Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Chills abound as the PT demo brought scares to those of the PS4 and to your favorite streaming sites to those without.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And that was only a single reveal in another busy week of news following an overseas gaming convention.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We have the full report as well as your calls, tweets, and emails on the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live on this August the 17th of 2014 with the 564th episode of our show.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you here at the Voice of the Geek's Network, vognetwork.com

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
where we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you are listening live, join us and chat. Live.vognetwork.com

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But meanwhile, we have our other hosts here in studio and it would be pretty boring if we didn't have an eclectic amount of voices here in studio.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And we've got quite the panel tonight you guys, starting off with the one and only, the happiest bunny on the farm as I used to say years and years ago.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm a little shrieky today.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, you're the scariest bunny on the farm today, or the most scared I guess.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Surprised, surprised. I was surprised.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Having my flesh eaten was surprising.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So obviously you're talking about the PT demo, which we're going to talk about a little more in depth in just a moment here.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But I have to introduce as well, Techmaster Loki.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hi.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hi Loki, how are you?

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm fine.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah?

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Good deal. What did you bring to eat tonight? I heard you complaining as you walked in that you didn't get what you wanted.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, I wanted to go to gym boys, but the family didn't leave in time and they left.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I normally would have left earlier, so I'd be able to get over there early enough.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But they ended up leaving five minutes before I normally leave.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And I had a list of chores I had to do before I left.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're how old and you have chores?

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Clean your room!

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, I had to make a lunch for my son for school and then I had to bring in the laundry.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And then, oh by the way, the car's out of gas.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So I ended up stopping at Jack in the Box because it's attached to the gas station.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But I wanted to get gym boys. That's where I was going to go.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I was going to bring you tacos.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry you were robbed of tacos.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
For what it's worth, I had tacos on Friday because my friend Monet, she loves tacos, so we went over there and had tacos.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And then she was performing in the Showgirls live.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, the hideous movie from the 90s that's so bad it's good.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They were doing a midnight screening and she was part one of the dancers.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Nasty fuck music.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It was so funny though. I loved it. It was great.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Had a great time at the Trash Filmorgy as they call it in downtown Sacramento.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sounds dirty, doesn't it? But we had a good time.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Is that like the Spike and Mike thing that they used to do?

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, well, I mean Spike and Mike's another thing they do there.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's probably a very similar crowd, but Spike and Mike I think travels around.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Spike and Mike, I haven't been to that in a long time, but I don't know if they do it anymore.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I went a few years in a row and it's like, wow, this is almost the same shit that was here last year.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, I haven't heard it advertised in a while. I don't know if it's still a thing.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Maybe somebody in chat knows. I don't know.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But we have more people in studio here to say hello to.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And I want to introduce this guy first because he's what you'd call a fan favorite.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He isn't on the show all the time, but when he's here it's always a lovely surprise.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Say hello everybody to Jamie's husband. Dan is here tonight.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sup?

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hey Dan, how you doing?

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Good.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah. What's new? Gosh, you haven't been on the show in a while.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You haven't been here since we moved to this place. I know that for sure.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Kind of was.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Did you? Well, yeah, you poked your head in for two seconds one episode.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But were you ever at the old apartment that we had?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
One time?

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Couple times.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He was on the floor.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It was lame. It scared me out of being on the show.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I know, right? But here isn't this much nicer? Sort of?

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's all right. It's all right. How you been?

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Good.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah? What games you been playing lately?

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
A lot of great Autosport. I played that Kingdom Hearts high def remake.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And that game is still bad.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Wait, wait, wait. You don't like Kingdom Hearts?

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The camera is still bad.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, I don't like Kingdom Hearts.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You know, that could get you beat up in some circles.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh, I'm so worried.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I liked Kingdom Hearts 2, what I played of it.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That game was a lot more fun. It was basically a lot more streamlined.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I was hoping with this remake they had cleaned it up a little bit.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And they did. It looks like a really good PS2 game.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And the thing about Kingdom Hearts 2? Tron.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Are you going to be picking up the HD remix in December, I think it is?

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, we already ordered it.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Gotcha.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So, are you going to give in to Jamie's demands for a PlayStation 4?

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Or what's happening on that front?

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
PlayStation 4 is doable. Wii U is still kind of like, eh.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah, what's up with Wii U? What's your love-hate relationship with Wii U like?

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's a Nintendo system. There's about six games on it that look pretty decent.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And it's like 300 bucks, which I think is too much for it.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But, you know, a lot of people love it. It's got a couple cool things going on.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What is the retro remix? The NES remix?

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The NES remix, yeah.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That pretty much tries to sell me one.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Just, eh, there's just not much consoling me.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You know, I'm not like, oh my god, the new systems look so great.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now that I don't work at game stores, I don't feel compelled to go out there and be like,

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
okay, here's my $500 for this, and here's my $400 for that, and here's my $400 for this.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's be real, Danny. You used to get some of that shit for free.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I never got consoles for free.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, really?

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No, it's the motherfuckers who work at those stores now get them for free.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh.

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I quit, and then like a year later, like, here's a PlayStation 4 and an Xbox 3 server.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Xbox, whatever the fuck it is now, won, and ten games for each! Yay!

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And I was just like, I had to win my Xbox 360, which I did.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
By fucking some guys up in video game trivia.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Awesome.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It was unholy.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Awesome.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vodnetwork.com.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We have many regulars in chat who remember Dan, who are saying hello.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Lots of greetings there.

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We have Bobby Blackwolf who says, Dan, coffee.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Coffee. Dan, coffee.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, Rob, where's my coffee?

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What's the, what's, go make it yourself.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What's the-

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Get in the kitchen, wench.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's the most annoying food request that Dark Sakura has?

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Coffee.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Coffee, alright.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now, believe it or not, Dan, I know you've been-

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't believe it.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I know you've been following this show on and off for the 12 years we've been doing it, because, well, you kind of have to.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But we actually have new listeners.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You know, we get a few new ones every week, so some people don't know who you are.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Up to 15 steady listeners.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's right.

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
One a year.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Love it or not.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We started with three.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
On the air for a dozen years with dozens and dozens of fans.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hundreds and hundreds of people who have listened at one time or the other.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So, Dan, what would you say, what kind of gamer are you?

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What are your favorite video games?

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What do you like to play the most?

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
At this point in my life, I'm definitely a retro gamer.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't really play a lot of new stuff.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
When I do play a lot of new stuff, it's mostly racing.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know, I've got Grid Autosport.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I've got a set of Corsa.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll probably get Project Cars.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, I was going to say, what do you think about Project Cars?

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Looks great.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Has a lot of possibility.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I won't be getting it on a console, because new steering wheels are like $400 apiece.

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I've already got a $600 steering wheel.

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That should work on PlayStation 4 if I go that way.

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But since I have a triple screen set up for my PC, fuck the PS4.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, looking in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com,

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
SSG100Matt says, Dan will get the system with the best racing games.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I was going to allude to Xbox One for Forza Horizon 2.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, Horizon sucks.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I love Horizon.

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay, Horizon's fine.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you're into the more sort of like Project Othomy, Casual Racer.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I can't play the real shit.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh no, I'm with you.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't play the sim games as sims.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You know, when I play Gran Turismo, I kind of dummy it down.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But it's the amount of content.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's the, you know, 10 different racing disciplines and 12,000 cars and 600 tracks,

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and you can race through your neighborhood.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Horizon is a cool game, it's just not as good as Forza.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I love Forza 5 in theory.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It looks great.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I just don't own an Xbox One.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And if it turned out that, oh yeah, you can use your T500RS on the Xbox One,

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
they might have suckered me in.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But no.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Now, here's the thing, Dan, and I don't know if this would change your mind on the Wii U,

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
but I know for me this is the thing I just, I don't know what has to be sacrificed to the devil to make this happen,

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
but F-Zero Wii U, yes or no?

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I wouldn't buy a system for it.

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Really?

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If I was going to buy a system for a Nintendo racing title, I probably would have bought it for Mario Kart.

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And if I had more of a steady local multiplayer community, I might have anyway.

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Eh, it's Mario Kart.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I played it. I liked it.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It was fun.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It has a lot of personality.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's Mario Kart.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's good.

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can't go wrong.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll play it on my GameCube or my Wii or my SNES or my Game Boy Brands or my DS.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
By the time the Wii U version of F-Zero ever comes out, you'd probably pick up one of those GX cabinets,

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
or I'm sorry, the AX cabinets for a decent cost.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't know about that.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They didn't make a lot of those.

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
All six of them.

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Alright, let's see.

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Tiger Claw says, Dan has a $600 racing wheel.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Has he tried playing those driving sims on the PC with it, like Euro Truck Simulator?

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I have.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Have you?

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I picked up Euro Truck Simulator on a Humble Bundle, and it's insanely bad.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And actually, the Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is a vast improvement, was also on a Humble Bundle recently,

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and I didn't get it.

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But I should have, because the problem was, it was the bonus game.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So it's like, donate this much or more.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And I'm like, fuck charity.

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
They have, what is it, spinning tires is supposed to be pretty good too,

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
like if you're really into hill climbing and stuff like that, it's supposed to be really realistic.

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Dan, I can't believe you'd say that about charity.

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I had this bucket of ice water ready to go for you.

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Woo.

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Alright.

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Dan will be commenting throughout the night, of course, as he tends to do, on whatever is going on in the news.

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But I also want to say hello to a familiar face here.

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sure many of you guys have heard this guy pop in week after week.

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Say hello, everybody, to Shane.

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hello.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hi, Shane, how are you?

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm fine.

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You don't want me to finish your intro, huh?

230
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Nope.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Alright, what's new with you?

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
How have you been in the past couple weeks?

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I just got a shiny, like, 30 minutes ago in Pokemon, so I'm pretty pumped up.

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Pokemon's still not old for you.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It never will be.

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Why not?

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Because it's Pokemon.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's like, are you going to get tired of breathing air?

239
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He hasn't caught them all.

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No, I have, actually.

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I do have them all.

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't have them all shiny.

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He hasn't caught them all shiny.

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I do not have them all shiny.

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Is that your mission?

246
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No.

247
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,400
I only want the ones I like shiny, and then every other shiny I get's just, I guess a

248
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,000
bonus unless it's a crappy one, then it's, like, not as good a bonus.

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Trading fodder?

250
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No, I'll still keep it, because it's shiny.

251
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,540
Um, are you looking forward to the new, I don't know, the new old Pokemon games that

252
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,540
are coming out?

253
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,540
I wasn't, and then they started releasing more stuff, like new mega evolutions or whatever,

254
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
and it got me excited.

255
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:46,780
So yes, I'm already, like, I'm ready to go with a Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

256
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:52,340
In our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, act-dev says, Shane, if you find a shiny Hawlucha,

257
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,340
let me know.

258
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,340
Did I say that right?

259
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,820
Yes, you did, and I'm actually in that area right now looking for a different shiny, so

260
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,100
I'll let you know, and then I will keep it.

261
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
You'll just rub it in.

262
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
You'll be like, I got one.

263
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,660
Well, not to rub it in, but, like, if I got two shinies, then yeah, I could trade one.

264
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,260
I just got a shiny Bunnelby, which is adorable, and doesn't look like he's been playing in

265
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
poop.

266
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,260
And SSG100ManChat says, every other shiny Shane doesn't want becomes a coat.

267
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,740
How many Osh-Watts have you bred trying to get a shiny one?

268
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,260
I am nearing 1,000.

269
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,620
Oh my gosh.

270
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,460
So you've made Osh-Watt coats for all the poor kids in the neighborhood?

271
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:35,660
Well, the rich kids first, and then the ones that aren't quite as well made go to the poor

272
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,660
kids.

273
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
All right, fair enough.

274
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,460
I think all the kids in Pokemon are in the same income bracket.

275
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,660
They can all afford just to wander the countryside waiting to fight each other.

276
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,660
All right, now Shane is here in studio because I know he's dying to, because he's not going

277
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
to stay for the whole show.

278
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
No, no.

279
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,100
But I know he's dying to talk about our kickoff topic tonight, and the kickoff topic I want

280
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,340
to talk about tonight before we get into our gaming weeks is a interactive demo that was

281
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:06,340
released a little bit stealthily on the PlayStation 4 marketplace this week, but as people figured

282
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,980
out what it really was, this game gained more and more steam, and I'm talking about

283
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
a lot, a lot, a lot of steam.

284
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,700
And I don't know about you guys, but I have friends, especially the extended OLR family,

285
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,660
people like Shane, maybe not the host directly on this show, but people like Shane, people

286
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:29,520
like Extrovert over on Hoard House, people like our number one fan Flaco Jones, all those

287
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,860
folks have been obsessed with PT.

288
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,100
Would that be a fair statement, Shane?

289
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
You're obsessed with PT.

290
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,860
I was texting about PT, but yes.

291
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,780
Who were you texting just now about PT?

292
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
Christopher.

293
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,620
So, okay, so PT, and this is a slight spoiler, but honestly, if you guys have followed video

294
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,940
game news, I don't see how you guys have avoided this news at this point, but I apologize if

295
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,380
I'm ruining anything for you.

296
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,420
PT is a interactive demo for the new Silent Hill game in disguise.

297
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
What?

298
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
I know, right?

299
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,980
You didn't just see the trailer 30 minutes ago in the other room.

300
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,300
I read about it online.

301
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:09,140
They're calling Silent Hills, which is being presented by Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro,

302
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,860
and Norman Reedus, who a lot of people know from The Walking Dead, he's going to be the

303
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:20,180
face model of the guy who Dan said should be just playing Solid Snake.

304
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,420
When they show him in the game and he kind of turns his head, I was like, you know, he

305
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,900
could play a live action Solid Snake fairly convincingly.

306
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,100
What if it was Solid Snake that turned his head at the very end?

307
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,900
That would be terrible.

308
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Silent Hill.

309
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,060
Silent Hill, the S stands for snake.

310
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,060
You never know.

311
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,060
Okay.

312
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,580
So Shane, what is it about that?

313
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,540
Because seriously, I'm seeing on Twitter people like Xtavor and other people, I think Captain

314
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,340
Spike from Gamebooyah.org has been talking favorably about this too, and some other people

315
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,060
I follow on Twitter, some are calling it the game of the year, which is a weird thing to

316
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,140
see because it's like a free demo.

317
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,700
But on the other hand, I also kind of get it.

318
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,280
I'm in that camp.

319
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,620
Right now it's my game of the year.

320
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:11,140
It has surpassed the entirety of Infamous Second Son and is now right now my game of

321
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
the year.

322
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,860
So why?

323
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:21,700
Because I think just the way they, it's everything about the way they introduced it, the feelings

324
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,100
it evoked while I was playing it.

325
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,620
I was legitimately scared the first time I was playing it.

326
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,220
And even when we were just playing it 30 minutes ago, I was still like kind of on my, on the

327
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,020
edge of my seat, even though I knew what was coming, except some things that happened were

328
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,660
not things I realized that were going to happen.

329
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
There was a surprise.

330
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,660
Yeah.

331
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
Yeah.

332
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
We had some surprises.

333
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
And that's the thing.

334
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,500
Nobody has figured out the pattern to the game.

335
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,700
I personally haven't even beaten it yet.

336
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,060
So like, you can't, you have to do a series of events at the end too.

337
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,900
I don't want to get too much into the weeds on that for people who haven't experienced

338
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,180
yet, but you have to get a certain, there are triggers, let's say on fifth dream already

339
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,620
spoiled it for everyone in the chat room, fifth dream, spank, spank, spank, spank.

340
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,620
It's online.

341
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
Yeah.

342
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
He's not accurate.

343
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
If you really want to know it's out there.

344
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Well, so that's the thing.

345
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,620
Yeah.

346
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Nobody's definitively solved it.

347
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
Even though we might've had that posted.

348
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,500
There are, there are three things in on the very last part of the game that have to happen.

349
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,100
The first one, everybody knows how to get that to happen.

350
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
That's easy.

351
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,620
We, we, we've all figured that out.

352
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,580
It's 100% confirmed proven.

353
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,340
The second one, no clue.

354
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,120
The second one can lead into the third one.

355
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,740
If it does, then we know how to beat it, but you have to get that second thing to happen.

356
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,100
And if you can't get it to happen the right way, then you're just stuck.

357
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,420
I still have no idea how I remotely did it.

358
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
So yeah.

359
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,780
Uh, dark soccer, you experienced this demo for the first time just earlier this evening.

360
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,700
And you are the first person in this household to beat it.

361
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,220
So which we don't know by accident.

362
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,060
She stood on Shane's shoulders, Shane did all the first parts of it.

363
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Shane beat the demo.

364
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,820
Jamie was holding the controller and then he's like, I don't want to play this part

365
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
anymore here.

366
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
I'm like, okay.

367
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,580
So what did you think?

368
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:14,340
I think that I'm going to punch eyeless bitch in the face next time.

369
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,140
You know what's interesting about it?

370
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,440
It doesn't prompt you at all.

371
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,620
It doesn't tell you how to do anything.

372
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,220
It doesn't say press X to do this.

373
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,700
It doesn't say press up or down.

374
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,420
It kind of says press X to do this at one point.

375
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
I don't know.

376
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:37,420
It lets you dive in and wander around and discover things in a finite world.

378
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,620
Finding the picture piece scared me the first time.

379
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,420
That was the first thing that scared me.

380
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,940
That scared the piss out of her.

381
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,180
She peed a little bit.

382
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Are you in my pants right now?

383
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,740
And if so, why?

384
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,500
Well since I'm not wearing any, I'll leave you two to be a little later.

385
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm not wearing pants, Rob.

386
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Yeah, I can see that.

387
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
No pants.

388
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I'm wearing a skirt.

389
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
I know.

390
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Okay.

391
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,900
So this demo comes out and after about six hours, even less, people have figured out

392
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
what it is.

393
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,740
And Shane texts me, calls me and is like, Rob, you have to do live stream.

394
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Rob, you have to do live stream.

395
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
Rob, what are you going to live stream?

396
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Rob, what time are you coming out?

397
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,980
Cause you're going to freak out.

398
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,280
So everybody wants to see that.

399
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,440
So sure enough, I go on Twitch and I do a live stream and yes, there were parts of the

400
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,160
demo that scared the crap out of me, but then we weren't able to beat it.

401
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
Like we could, and I was on a timer cause we had a whorehouse, huh?

402
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
We didn't beat it.

403
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
No.

404
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Oh, you said we weren't able.

405
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
We weren't able to beat it.

406
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,400
There's also seeing her in the bathroom and I actually was going to laugh.

407
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,840
I wanted to laugh my ass off when the baby started talking.

408
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,320
Yeah, that's a pretty funny part.

409
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Let's see.

410
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
We're going to live.vognetwork.com.

411
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,280
Lots of comments on this in our chat room.

412
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Act Def says Guillermo del Toro participating in this project has me sold on it.

413
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,120
You know, very interesting how much hype this, I mean, this is getting a lot of hype.

414
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,680
I have not seen this much hype for a demo in a long time.

415
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,440
It took over all the news at Gamescom.

416
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,800
Once this came out, nobody cared anymore about Gamescom, I think.

417
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Well behold that thought cause we will cover the Gamescom news later.

418
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Well, I'm not going to be here first.

419
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
I'll talk about it if I want.

420
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,440
I'll be at Taco Bell.

421
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,960
But well, but here's the thing.

422
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,240
It's interesting too, because you have Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro, Norman Reedus,

423
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,160
which you know, that, that excites a lot of people.

424
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,240
And something I need to sacrifice to get a Kiriyamaoka back.

425
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,280
And that's, that's the thing.

426
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,560
It's making people kind of forget that who's not involved.

427
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
No it's not.

428
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Where do you see that?

429
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,300
I see people just praying to everything they can pray to that he's going to show up.

430
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,620
And if he doesn't, whoever did the sound for the demo, I have to give a lot of credit to

431
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:42,900
because it sounded like a Silent Hill game that was not downpour.

432
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,740
But I see, it seems like the excitement for this is, is higher than any game in the Silent

433
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,100
Hill series is like four.

434
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,220
So it's like the first game probably where Yamoka is not involved, that people are excited

435
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
for.

436
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
Yeah, I can agree.

437
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,220
Yeah.

438
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,620
We're still sacrificing things to get him to show up somehow.

439
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Let's see.

440
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,140
Tigerclaw says, I'd be surprised if the game of the year goes to a horror game.

441
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,940
When was the last time that happened?

442
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
The Walking Dead?

443
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,940
Yeah.

444
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
Well, I don't know.

445
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,780
The Walking, I don't know if you'd count that horror though.

446
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,780
Some would say this is more adventure.

447
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
And it's The Last of Us.

448
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,020
Oh, The Last of Us?

449
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
Kind of a horror game?

450
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
Oh, you probably heard it.

451
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,020
That's right.

452
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,020
Um, I was going to say, we don't need the full game to get game of the year.

453
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,260
This demo is going to get game of the year.

454
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,940
So I'm just glad that Konami has something that they're actually releasing other than

455
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,340
Metal Gear Solid because it seriously, they have that in Pro Evo, I'm like, man, they're

456
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,300
going to go out of business if they don't have any good, you know, I mean, yeah, Metal

457
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,260
Gear is going to do well for them, but it was literally the only thing on their slate.

458
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:45,420
It's like, okay, Metal Gear and Pro Evo happened to Konami.

459
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,700
They're all, um, I know they do a lot of workout equipment and gym stuff and gambling stuff

460
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
in Japan.

461
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,500
If they release, you know, this, if they release Metal Gear in the first part of the year and

462
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,580
you know, this at the end, I mean, that's a pretty good year for Konami.

463
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,140
So, um, SGA 100 Matt says it's probably the most brilliant way to promote or announce

464
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,140
a game.

465
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,180
Fifth Dream says it's not even a game.

466
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,260
It's a demo at best, but it's effing scary in a way that impresses me.

467
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,740
So, uh, Tiger Claw says maybe demo of the year if there is such a category.

468
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,980
Um, Bobby Black Wolf reemphasizing Konami does a lot of business in the gambling sector.

469
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
They're doing fine.

470
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,620
Um, let's see.

471
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,580
Oh, how is it not a game?

472
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,620
I want to know that.

473
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,700
What makes it not a game?

474
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,500
I don't know if I agree with that comment, but everybody gets a voice.

475
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,980
So I wanted to say, say that the wrong, well, maybe we'll get more thoughts on that.

476
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
It's a game.

477
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,180
It's a very short game.

478
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,780
And I would also say, yeah, it's a short game, but as they pointed out at the end, it has

479
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,340
nothing to do with the main title.

480
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,780
So this whole story that's going on is self-contained.

481
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,060
And I mean, there's resolution enough as much as you've ever took that hallway and made

482
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,580
it a hundred levels long.

483
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,780
So would that be a game?

484
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,780
Yeah.

485
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,940
If it's something different happening every time.

486
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,260
How many of, how many of us have played the red room?

487
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:09,220
I mean, don't shit your pants as a game and that's just one screen, maybe two.

488
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
You played, what was it?

489
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
The, what was it?

490
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,220
The Crimson room.

491
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,220
Wasn't that what it was?

492
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,500
It's just a little flash game where you're stuck in a room.

493
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Well, it could have been, you know, a follow up to, you know, silent Hill four of the room.

494
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,620
I mean, it's kind of a room, few rooms in a hallway.

495
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,740
This is silent Hill, the hallway, um, silent Hill five.

496
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,140
Just a couple other comments I want to get out here.

497
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:35,020
Kaijuto in chat says, uh, I haven't seen this much hype for a demo since destiny.

498
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,700
Maybe sort of a hinting there that maybe it hasn't been that long since we've had a huge

499
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
look at ground zeros.

500
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,340
That was a pretty well.

501
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,460
And then I thought this was a nice kind of comment here to end on here.

502
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,220
Act F says, you know, ground zeros should have been what PT was.

503
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,580
Very interesting comment.

504
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,660
Could they have released PT as a commercial game the way they did ground zeros or

505
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,900
if it was that short, no, I would have felt quite ripped off or would rage.

506
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,820
They would rage.

507
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,940
Maybe if it was like a dollar.

508
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Yeah.

509
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,540
Or if like, what's the minimum price, five, $10 these days, maybe add a little more to

510
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,460
it, but for free, it's a great value for sure.

511
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,060
Can't you beat ground zeros, uh, in just a few minutes, I think they said, can you, I

512
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
don't know.

513
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
I thought it was a couple hours.

514
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,580
Well, and then I was going to say the first day that PT was out and me and Flacco Jones

515
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,140
and his wife were playing it, we played it for five hours trying to beat it.

516
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,520
And we had, I mean, that was when we didn't look at any spoilers or anything.

517
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,740
So we were going through it.

518
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,180
So we spent five hours on a game.

519
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,060
We didn't our demo, whatever you want to call it that we didn't beat.

520
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,220
And I know ground zeros like does not take that long.

521
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,420
So why should that be 30 and then PT only be a dollar when we had more, more time spent

522
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,420
on it.

523
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Interesting.

524
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,700
Well, I think the fact that they sold ground zeros anyways is just kind of lame.

525
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,140
The fact that it was 30 bucks was also very lame.

526
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,020
So I'm kind of glad they didn't go that route.

527
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Yeah.

528
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,660
I'm I, I kind of wonder if maybe Konami should just release ground zeros for free and if

529
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,380
that would have gotten as much hype as PT had, I don't know.

530
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,380
Yeah.

531
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,380
So Konami must have been awesome.

532
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,600
Konami must be a screwed around with some different ideas there.

533
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,600
But anyway, I do want to move into how was your gaming week, but just quickly, some kind

534
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,180
of final thoughts on a PT Loki, you haven't really played it yet, huh?

535
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,180
I just watched the video.

536
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,460
What'd you think of the whole thing and kind of how it was done there?

537
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,460
I don't know.

538
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,380
All I saw in the video was just the end.

539
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,720
So it looks neat.

540
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,940
I am, I gotta say for me personally, I'm really excited for the next silent Hill game and

541
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,520
I kind of, I've loved the silent Hill series, but I've always just kind of been, Oh yeah,

542
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
that game.

543
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Oh yeah.

544
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,780
And I haven't kind of been detached from it for the past few games.

545
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,540
So this is a really good way to like attention.

546
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
Get back over here.

547
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,540
You're a fan of silent Hill.

548
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,500
I'm curious to see what the trailers are going to be like, because you know, Kojima, he likes

549
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,420
doing his like vignettes for the fucking trailers.

550
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,420
Yeah.

551
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,380
I'm hoping this will be a big E3 presence next year, but who knows?

552
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,300
Dan, quick thoughts on the final thoughts on that.

553
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
It was awesome.

554
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
You know, I'd only read about it.

555
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
So today was the first time I saw it.

556
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,420
Really, really.

557
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,900
I mean, I could see that being a whole game.

558
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,700
You know, where you walk around an area, you have to do different things.

559
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,580
I mean, there was a lot of, there are a lot of things you could look at that demo.

560
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,780
There were a lot of touches that you're not going to catch your first, your second, your

561
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,780
10th time through.

562
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:29,540
Um, and like I was saying, if that thing was, if that hallway had a hundred repetitions,

563
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,420
but you managed to work enough different content into it, I think it'd be awesome.

564
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,100
I don't have as much confidence that the next silent Hill game will be like that.

565
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:46,220
Uh, cause that would be a radical departure, but I think that the PT was, it was pretty

566
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
good.

567
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,380
What was interesting is that even though, yes, it would be a radical departure, you

568
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,020
know, a lot of people have been noticing that it probably that demos in particular

569
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,420
has more in common with silent Hill, the room than anything else, which is weird because

570
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,620
the room was sort of that disconnected silent Hill game.

571
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,020
But you know, like I really, I still really like disconnected game that God slapped into

572
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
it.

573
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Yeah, it was.

574
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,020
I'm just worried.

575
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,020
This is going to try.

576
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,480
They're trying to pull like a Bioshock infinite with this where it's just like, Oh, it's infinite

577
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,900
universes and then we're going to tie them all together.

578
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,020
It's like, okay, I don't know.

579
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,900
Uh, Jamie, last thoughts on the teaser.

580
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,460
Uh, it just, it made me shriek.

581
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,540
So not like loudly, not like, you know, yeah, it wasn't enough where I could hear it over

582
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
here.

583
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
I didn't see it.

584
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
It was loud.

585
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
It was just high pitched.

586
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,740
I know even though bringing him back is going to be very like kind of cliche and doesn't

587
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,020
really fit in the story.

588
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:49,260
I do fully anticipate and hope that they bring back a full HD pyramid head for, uh,

589
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,820
some people like Shane's over there going, no, no, no, I don't want that.

590
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
So people really don't want that.

591
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,140
It'd just be out of character with what they just showed.

592
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,340
Like a realistic, they've already said that they want this game to be truly horrifying.

593
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,520
Uh, even to the point where the product is not commercially viable, this would be a really

594
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
cool sort of thing.

595
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,740
Now, if they do what I think they're going to do, I will have pyramid head and zombie

596
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,900
nurses and I think it's going to have all this stuff from like all the other games kind

597
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
of thrown in there.

598
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,700
Maybe like it's going to cross universes and so you can get stuff from silent Hill two

599
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,700
and with Kojima at the home now, I'm not so sure he might want to just, he might be eager

600
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,300
to put his own nurses will have time.

601
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,280
All right.

602
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,900
And last but not least, uh, Shane, the big, the big fan boy in the room for this, uh,

603
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,140
what are your thoughts closing out here?

604
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,320
I think it's amazing.

605
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,040
And right now I'm saying Dragon Age Inquisition is either going to tie it or probably not

606
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,640
beat it for my game of the year.

607
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
That's silly.

608
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
Demo is my game of the year.

609
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
All right.

610
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,440
Well, but of course you never know what else might stealthily release between now and the

611
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
end of the year.

612
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,920
No, it's going to be Dragon Age or this.

613
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
All right.

614
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,440
Well, we'll check in with you at the end of the year.

615
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
All right.

616
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
Okay.

617
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Whatever.

618
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
All right.

619
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,200
Uh, anyhow, we're going to move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video

620
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,400
games that we've been playing this week.

621
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,400
Uh, Dark Sakura, ladies first.

622
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,960
What have you been playing this week besides PTU?

623
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
We've all been playing that.

624
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Other stuff.

625
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Bejeweled.

626
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
A lot of Bejeweled on my phone.

627
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,520
I've been playing some, uh, Best Move, AKA Puzzle Bobble.

628
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,360
I played some Battle Fantasy 14.

629
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,600
Um, Dan, why are you looking like that?

630
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:36,160
Um, we were, I was, uh, strategy guiding Dan through Kingdom Hearts 1.5 remix.

631
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,240
Uh, and, uh, really that's about it.

632
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,920
I've had a lot going on, so stuff that still seems like a pretty action packed week.

633
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,200
I saw you on Twitter posting pictures of Kingdom, Kingdom Hearts, playthroughs on, if you saw

634
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
that I responded.

635
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Not yet.

636
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
I keep forgetting.

637
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,960
I'm trying to make Twitter more of a thing and Facebook less of a thing because, uh,

638
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
fuck.

639
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
So.

640
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
I hear you.

641
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
I hear you.

642
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,520
Uh, let's go to our guests, Dan.

643
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
How was your gaming week?

644
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,240
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

645
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Uh, what did I do?

646
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,920
I played some, uh, I played some Grid today.

647
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Had a lot of fun.

648
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,000
Basically, Friday night, I don't even know what happened.

649
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,480
I got home on, or was it Saturday?

650
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
When did you go to that game?

651
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,920
It was Friday when we went to go see Showgirls.

652
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Okay.

653
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,360
She was going to be out and I was like, man, I want to do some retro gaming.

654
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,640
So I drug out the Genesis and I played a game each of the Revenge of Shinobi, Shadow Dancer,

655
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,320
and Shinobi 3.

656
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,160
And I know that my skills are quite diminished because I got to the second to last level,

657
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,920
the second to last level, and the last level.

658
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,480
One game, just not even like no continues, no spamming extra lives.

659
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,040
Well, I did spam extra lives a little bit in Revenge of Shinobi, but, uh, I played some

660
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,400
Zelda on Saturday.

661
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,720
We played pretty much the first six Labyrinths, uh, in just a quick run through because we

662
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,960
were showing it to my friends' kids.

663
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,360
And today I played some Grid.

664
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,000
Besides that, not a lot of gaming.

665
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,400
All right.

666
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,160
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

667
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:10,040
Um, I really only played a couple games and it was actually funny, but not both of them

668
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,960
were kind of Kickstarter related, I guess.

669
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:19,120
I played more of Vanguard V, um, and I still like that demo, sadly, that there is no way

670
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,320
that Kickstarter is going to make its money.

671
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,680
Um, and then I played kind of along the lines with Vanguard V, um, the guy Maximilien Moreau

672
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,880
who's actually doing, he does the Cooking with Unity show.

673
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,920
They've been running this kind of, uh, series for, I think the last week or two called From

674
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,520
Scratch to Publish.

675
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,200
And they actually start from scratch and they made a game that's pretty simple and they

676
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,680
publish it on pretty much every platform that they could.

677
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:55,800
Um, you know, iOS, uh, Windows, Windows Phone, uh, Android, and, um, even PlayStation Mobile.

678
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,880
And so I downloaded the Android version, um, for 99 cents.

679
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,440
And so I've been playing their game, uh, Grid Cruiser, which actually it's kind of, um,

680
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,800
inspiring because, uh, one, I do get done with my long project.

681
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,160
I do kind of want to do something along the lines of that, where it's a lot of short projects

682
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,680
that you can get done in like a week or two just to have some stuff to bring in some revenue.

683
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,300
So, um, but yeah, it definitely goes support Vanguard V. I mean, although it's probably

684
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,140
too late at this point, but hopefully they will decide to relaunch the Kickstarter.

685
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,900
I have some other way to do funding later on.

686
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,300
All right.

687
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,540
Uh, before we get into my gaming week, I'm actually going to do something here real quick.

688
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,860
Uh, we're actually going to, we're having a lot of problems live, uh, for our live listeners

689
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,640
over a live.vognetware.com.

690
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,240
Our internet keeps going up and down.

691
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,060
I'm not sure what's up with that, but I think what we're going to do, or I'm going to do

692
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,820
an intentional drop here and we're going to cycle our internet in an attempt to try and

693
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,940
keep it up here, uh, for the remainder of the show.

694
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
So I apologize guys.

695
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,300
Thanks for sticking with us live for sure.

696
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,780
Um, these things happen.

697
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,860
Unfortunately, I don't know what's causing our internet to suck tonight.

698
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,400
It's been pretty good the past couple of months, but, uh, I am going to do an intentional drop

699
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
here.

700
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,820
Um, but we will be back in just a couple minutes.

701
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
I appreciate those.

702
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,060
You guys that are sticking with us, uh, here at vognetware.com.

703
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,560
We'll be right back to register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio

704
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,940
at vognetware.com.

705
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,660
Use the passphrase party.

706
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
Okay.

707
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Let's try this again.

708
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,340
The internet cooperates with us.

709
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Uh, of course those listening on the podcast are like, what's going on?

710
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
Everything's fine to me.

711
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,580
Uh, but yeah, we're having some, fortunately some, uh, difficulties sending our signal

712
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,880
out to the server that rebroadcast everything live.

713
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,380
So we just did a little power cycle here in studio on the router and all that good stuff

714
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,060
to hopefully give us some decent uptime tonight.

715
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,100
But, uh, you know, uh, despite all the live problems that sometimes occur, although it's

716
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,880
been pretty good the past couple of weeks, uh, or months, even, um, we, uh, do always

717
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,540
have the show complete and we do try to tape things for our podcast feed, which of course

718
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,220
you can check out orange lunch radio.com available in the iTunes store, stitcher radio, all that

719
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,220
good stuff.

720
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,220
All right.

721
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,480
When we left off, I was about ready to get into my gaming week, which, um, I don't have

722
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,080
a whole lot of exciting stuff to report because we talked about PT, which was the big bulk

723
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,560
of it, but I have also been playing Final Fantasy 14 here and there, which, uh, you

724
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,960
know, you know, you know, I love my MMO, so I'm playing that, um, another MMO I've been

725
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,360
playing an awful lot of, which I think I talked about last week, but, uh, never winner was

726
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
one I've been spending time with.

727
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,960
I don't, I think I got into it on a whorehouse, but not OLR.

728
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,760
So, um, I've been playing a free to play MMO called never winner that's available out there.

729
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,800
And, um, I like what I've been experiencing so far.

730
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,280
Um, even though it is free to play, I haven't really felt nickeled and dime now, granted

731
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,800
I'm only about what, 10 levels into it.

732
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,200
So I haven't really experienced the whole thing, but, uh, I like it because it's kind

733
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,440
of like that, you know, like a Warcraft MMO type of feel, but, um, you have, it's a little

734
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,400
more actiony, like, because you, you dodge things by double tapping and so you, you move

735
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,680
around a little faster.

736
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,720
So everything feels a little more fast paced, uh, like almost like, uh, the combat feels

737
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,600
almost more like Diablo esque in a way, but yet in that kind of wow environment.

738
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,120
So, uh, yeah, I like that.

739
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,280
And of course, since it's never winter, you have a lot of like user generated things to

740
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,640
explore and I've barely scratched the surface on any of that stuff.

741
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,400
But if you like D and D and you like free MMOs, you'll probably get a kick out of never

742
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
winter.

743
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,120
And dungeon Buster and chat says, just wait until you get to the late levels.

744
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
Yeah.

745
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,360
I figured in a free to play MMO type of thing, that's probably where you really start to

746
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,880
feel it as towards the end game, but for what it is right now, I'm enjoying it as a nice

747
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,580
little diversion because honestly, I like MMOs.

748
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,680
I'm not really feeling wow these days, sorry, Warcraft fans, but the drought that has been

749
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,400
going on in the game just finally broke me.

750
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,600
And I'm just not interested in wow or the entire game.

751
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,980
I'm not interested in the new expansion.

752
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,220
You know, there was a lot of news about the new expansion and wow this, this week, and

753
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,260
I got to admit, I'm not really, I'm not buying it.

754
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,260
Like I know that sounds harsh.

755
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,260
I have a lot of great, a lot of friends that really love world of Warcraft and have stood

756
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,040
by it, but I don't know, maybe the people will ultimately bring me back.

757
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,940
If I do come back to an MMO, it's usually the people is why, but the game itself, I

758
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
don't know.

759
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,460
I'm just kind of, kind of spent on it.

760
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,940
Um, so, but it gives me time to play other MMOs and see what else is out there.

761
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,060
So that part of it I like, otherwise I'm just waiting till the big holiday rush and a lot

762
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,180
of the games to come out there.

763
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:14,860
Speaking of Diablo, I got Diablo three on pre-order for Tuesday, the ultimate evil edition.

764
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,980
So I'm excited for that on PlayStation four.

765
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,740
So I will be excited to check that out.

766
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,260
Um, all right, so that's it for our gaming weeks.

767
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,220
Uh, moving into some housekeeping before we get into some gaming news.

768
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,020
Um, housekeeping, we will not have a live show Labor Day weekend.

769
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,260
That's two weeks away.

770
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,860
That is because I will not be here.

771
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,660
I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con, which is a huge, huge con, uh, for Southeastern

772
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,260
US and, uh, and beyond.

773
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,940
Honestly, I mean, I'm going out there for it.

774
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,700
Uh, voice geeks network is pretty heavily involved.

775
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,460
Uh, we're going to be participating.

776
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,820
Uh, we have a panel Monday as a part of the podcasting track, uh, 1130 in the morning.

777
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:55,420
So be sure if you are a dragon Han, I know I said am, and some of you guys might be a

778
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,460
little hung over, but that is the day you leaving.

779
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,100
So hopefully, uh, hopefully you're able to make it to our panel 1130 in the morning that

780
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,900
day, um, will also be appearing on other panels throughout the show.

781
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,380
Uh, I know Bobby and I are participating on another one.

782
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,180
Uh, our pal Brian over at British invaders has a few things he's on.

783
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,780
I want to say John from critical myth might be on a panel or two on some of the different

784
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,220
tracks.

785
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
Uh, but just keep, keep an eye out for that.

786
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,740
Uh, uh, all throughout dragon con, we will be there.

787
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,460
Um, but I know it's a big convention weekend in general and just in general, a weekend,

788
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,980
especially in the US where people kind of go out of town, do other things.

789
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,500
So we will not be having a show that week.

790
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,340
Um, but, uh, we will be here next week.

791
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,860
And then of course, we'll be back on September 7th, I believe the day is.

792
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,220
Uh, you can also follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R for all the updates,

793
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,820
facebook.com slash orange lingerie.

794
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,140
If you want to be our friend on Facebook, let's get into some gaming news.

795
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,940
There was quite a bit of it when there's a speaking of big expos, Europe had a huge one

796
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:57,980
gaming related this game's calm and specifically ironically has kind of funny.

797
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,780
Like I watched all those conferences live and.

798
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,580
Even the one who was a micro, well, all of them makes it for EA because EA was at one in

799
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,420
the morning and it's EA and it's one at one in the morning.

800
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,780
So no, I'm not watching that, but I actually watched the Microsoft one and Sony one

801
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,260
Microsoft was at five in the morning.

802
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,820
Thank you kid for waking up that early.

803
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,780
Um, so anyways, let's talk a little bit about Sony.

804
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,060
So Sony, they had a lot of rumors kind of going into it.

805
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:28,420
One of which was of course, um, HD remasters for journey and the unfinished one,

806
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,420
which were confirmed.

807
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,980
And the cool thing about those, of course, like a lot of the other games that they

808
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,300
have, uh, they are cross by.

809
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,500
So if you bought the PlayStation three version, you don't have to buy the

810
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,900
PlayStation four version.

811
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,260
It will already be there waiting to put, you know, waiting for you to play it.

812
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:51,740
Um, also hustle Kings is still, or is coming to a PlayStation four as well.

813
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,220
I am absolutely shocked that that series is still around.

814
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,060
Do people really like billiards that much?

815
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:02,380
I mean, I dunno, maybe it's literally the only game that's in that genre

816
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,180
that's out on consoles nowadays.

817
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,340
Um, all right.

818
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,500
And then, uh, they also announced that of course they're doing

819
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,780
pretty well with the system.

820
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:15,020
10 million units sold and they made sure to confirm that.

821
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,140
Yes, that's sold actually to customers and not just shipped.

822
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,740
Cause you know, poking fun at Microsoft and, uh, about, you know, some of

823
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,060
their numbers that they share.

824
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,220
And apparently the best selling console in North America for the past six months,

825
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,660
they said, and I think it's even outselling, uh, the PlayStation

826
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,140
three during that same time period.

827
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,580
They hit 10 million before the PlayStation three.

828
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,380
Um, and then kind of following, you know, some of their announcements,

829
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:48,380
they showed off a bunch of, I guess, unusual trailers, uh, for things

830
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,700
like including Q games, new, um, the tomorrow children, which kind of had

831
00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:01,340
this, you know, Soviet Russia kind of vibe to it and, uh, very strange

832
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,020
looking game, but, uh, that should be coming out to the platform at some point.

833
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,820
Um, they announced that daisy is coming to PlayStation four.

834
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,180
So I'm guessing probably going to be coming to both consoles at some point.

835
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,660
And I don't know if it's going to be, uh, exclusive or anything with

836
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:22,660
at least they announced that, uh, also, um, and some kind of pissing off

837
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,580
some of the fans of Vita, uh, tearaway unfolded is going to be

838
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,740
coming to the PlayStation four as well.

839
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,860
So now they're getting kind of.

840
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,620
They own their own version of the Vita game.

841
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,500
Uh, well, I also think what pissed off fans, the Vita was an absolute

842
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:42,060
lack of any news for the nothing, uh, which I, I'm going to be honest.

843
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:47,900
It seems to me that Sony is destined to make the Vita a portable PlayStation

844
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,980
television is what is what the Vita is destined to be through the PlayStation

845
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,380
now and through, you know, the, the streaming with the PS four.

846
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,620
And I kind of think they're really not super duper interested in having

847
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,700
the Vita be maybe a games platform.

848
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,940
They'll still support the indie development for it.

849
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,020
Cause it's kind of like a feather in their hat, but I just, I think

850
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,860
Sony's kind of done already.

851
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,300
If anything, they're supporting the Vita with more independent stuff because

852
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,700
they, you know, it is one of the few platforms that actually still supports,

853
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,380
you know, was it a PlayStation mobile, which you can publish to, you don't

854
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,980
even need like a dev kit or anything.

855
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,540
You can just publish straight to it.

856
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,380
Um, so there's that.

857
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,940
And also a lot of these games that are coming out, um, on console

858
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,740
are getting Vita versions as well.

859
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,420
So I think, I think you'll see a lot in that sense, but yeah, as far as.

860
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,180
Releasing major, major titles on the Vita.

861
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,460
I just don't think that's going to happen right away.

862
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,300
Um, maybe if the PlayStation TV really takes off and the numbers, you know,

863
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:56,340
justify, you know, more portable versions of these games, the problem is just like

864
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,620
the Wii U there's just not a lot of units out there and so they don't want to spend

865
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,180
the effort and, you know, cost to develop a game for the Vita even Sony doesn't

866
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,740
cause some of their big name franchises that they thought would do really well

867
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,740
didn't, but I think that's kind of the blame on some of the devs because they

868
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,900
had really shitty ports of like resistance and stuff.

869
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,740
A couple of quick comments from chat and I'll let you get back to the news.

870
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,020
Wrap up.

871
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,220
Sorry.

872
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,460
Lucky.

873
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,660
Uh, Akuma JP says we had a lot of games in summer though on Vita.

874
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,380
Remember Akuma JP is in Japan where it's probably a very different perception

875
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:26,620
over there.

876
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:30,180
I mean, Japan even had that other Vita before we did.

877
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,620
And you know, it's a little different over there.

878
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,460
There's still third parties are supporting it.

879
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,540
I mean like, you know, especially the Japanese companies are really supporting

880
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:43,380
the Vita like, uh, Atlas and, um, even was it like over here, access games.

881
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,700
They kind of do a lot of translations of titles and stuff, but you're seeing,

882
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,420
you know, uh, Tecmo Koe, um, they've got lots of stuff coming into the Vita.

883
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,900
So if you like, you know, your Japanese games, you're in a lot of that stuff

884
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,220
localized, which is kind of cool.

885
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,420
Um, but really that's it.

886
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:07,300
I mean, you're not going to see a lot of just Vita versions of big titles

887
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,900
coming on, you know, no call of duties or anything like that, which is kind

888
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,540
of disappointing.

889
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,540
Uh, act Efton chat says, make the Vita $150 and make the memory cards

890
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:14,860
cheaper.

891
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,820
And I may consider one.

892
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,180
Well, the Vita is going to be what?

893
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,020
99 bucks.

894
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,980
If you can hook it up to a TV that's seems to be where I think they will drop

895
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,980
the price of it, especially if the, I mean, cause the thing about it, if it's

896
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,420
$200 and you know, PlayStation TV is going to be 99, I don't know if you're

897
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,820
going to have to drop the price of that.

898
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,900
It's going to come down one way or another, you know, either it's retailers

899
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,340
trying to clear out their stock or it's Sony dropping the price of it.

900
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,740
But I think the price does need to come down on it.

901
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,540
All right.

902
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,220
Um, and oh, I was going to say it last, but at least, uh, they announced

903
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,620
SharePlay, uh, the feature they're kind of showing off originally with the

904
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,740
PlayStation four is now going to be coming in the fall update.

905
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,220
Now SharePlay was that feature that they showed off where say I'm having trouble

906
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,540
in a game or something like that.

907
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,980
I can have my friend take over the game and actually play a part for me, or, you

908
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,500
know, um, you can also do couch co-op, you know, over the internet.

909
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,500
So if I have, you know, a two player local game, I can have someone join in

910
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,060
on player two or something like that.

911
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:18,340
But what people are also seeing is like, Hey, I can use this to loan a game to my

912
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,660
friend, you know, across the country or something like that, they'll just take

913
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,980
over my game and they can play it up to an hour.

914
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,500
So it's going to allow you to play up to 60 minutes at a time.

915
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,740
And, uh, you know, after that 60 minutes, it'll disconnect, but you can

916
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,340
reconnect as many times as you want.

917
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,820
And so that'll be coming in software update 2.0, which is

918
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,180
coming in later this fall.

919
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,220
And, Oh, and of course, because it is multiplayer PlayStation,

920
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,220
plus will be required like everything else.

921
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:49,820
All right.

922
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,460
Well, Microsoft also had their big press conference and there was a lot of news

923
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,740
coming out of that, including, uh, increased presence for indie games.

924
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,500
Uh, on the ID at X-Box platform, which will include goat simulator.

925
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,980
No time to explain.

926
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:07,380
And, uh, one of the big ones coming over from PC is smite because smite is a big

927
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,060
MOBA, uh, not quite as big as league of legends or dota, or, you know, even

928
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,780
heroes, but, uh, smite definitely has its audience.

929
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,900
I see it on Twitch all the time.

930
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,780
So very interesting.

931
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,900
That has made me actually very shocked that goat simulator was allowed on

932
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,340
consoles because that came as buggy as hell on purpose, but it's just, I think

933
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,660
that, yeah, I think that's the joke.

934
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,100
Christ.

935
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,020
Yeah, that's the joke.

936
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,140
Uh, anyhow.

937
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,900
Um, also, um, Dan, you haven't seen goat simulator.

938
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,660
Oh, well I'll have to show you during break then.

939
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,580
Oh, good.

940
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,460
You know, I have this game, right?

941
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,260
Uh, apparently not.

942
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,300
Imagine if you will, a game like Tony Hawk, where you do tricks, except

943
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,060
instead of Tony Hawk on a skateboard, you're goat pissing people off and

944
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,740
breaking shit fucking much and going into space.

945
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,500
Space space goat.

946
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,020
I'm in space.

947
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,220
Uh, let's see.

948
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:03,980
Uh, also, uh, the Xbox one preview program, expanding their features for

949
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,340
more friends, the ability to view messages, friends, parties, and

950
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,180
achievements on a snapped app, uh, and playing media from USB device.

951
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,380
Uh, there will be an FIFA 15 bundle in Europe.

952
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,060
Uh, turtle rock studios is going to be bringing the beta for evolved

953
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,420
to the Xbox one in January, uh, evolved by the way, pushed back.

954
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,620
If you hadn't heard the memo on that.

955
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,420
But the, uh, a demo or the beta, excuse me, will be on the Xbox one in January.

956
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,140
Uh, let's see fable legends.

957
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,980
Multiplayer beta will be in October.

958
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:36,900
Um, there will also be a sunset overdrive, uh, package detail,

959
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,620
which would be a retail October 28th.

960
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,380
I'm not sure if that is specifically for Europe.

961
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,020
No, they're going to have a system with it's a white console.

962
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,500
Same date.

963
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:50,340
Uh, yeah, the 28th it's, uh, it's, um, same con or white console for three 99.

964
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,380
Uh, the beta program for halo five starts December 29th.

965
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,420
So just barely in this year.

966
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,980
Uh, let's see.

967
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,820
Also, uh, there will be a halo channel.

968
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:05,140
Microsoft and three 43 industry is a teaming up for the halo channel.

969
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,820
This will broadcast live Twitch game play.

970
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,900
There'll also be content based around the halo series available on this.

971
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,340
This is kind of interesting, like a whole,

972
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,260
you know why I say, yeah, why?

973
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,180
Because they tried the same shit with call of duty elite member elite

974
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,180
had all this content that was based around call of duty and it was fucking boring.

975
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,300
No, I don't remember that actually.

976
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:25,620
Yeah.

977
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,380
And then they just continue to leave because no one gave a shit about it.

978
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,060
So I, I don't know.

979
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,980
It halo tournaments would be kind of cool, but I just.

980
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,740
Aside from like, uh, that show from Steve or are they still doing the

981
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,020
Steven Spielberg halo thing?

982
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,420
Because it, you know, aside from that, I just don't get shit about the rest.

983
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,780
Think that is still a thing.

984
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,820
I, they said anything that had already started was still going to be a thing.

985
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,140
I think.

986
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,300
Do you guys talk about bungee firing Martin O'Donnell?

987
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,740
A while ago when it happened?

988
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:52,940
Yeah.

989
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,500
Has three, four, three hired him yet?

990
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,220
Oh, I haven't heard.

991
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:56,940
Don't think seriously.

992
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,540
What the fuck are you guys waiting for?

993
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,580
That's the guy who makes halo halo, right?

994
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,300
Hurry up.

995
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:02,820
Right.

996
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,980
Uh, last but not least the big, big, uh, bomb that was dropped, uh, crystal

997
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:14,020
dynamics announcing rise of the tomb Raider will be exclusive to the Xbox one.

998
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,580
Uh, in the days that followed that exclusive was, uh, clarified to mean

999
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:23,460
timed exclusive, but I think we all kind of expected that a huge game like tomb

1000
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,940
Raider, even if it is exclusive on Xbox one or whatever, the game of the year,

1001
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,980
definitive edition, blah, blah, blah, blah, would have been on all consoles

1002
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,780
anyway, especially with a big game like that, but a lot of people really

1003
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,260
unhappy about that news, um, considering that probably a lot of people bought

1004
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:43,300
tomb Raider on the PlayStation four for the definitive edition, just because,

1005
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,220
you know, the number of, uh, PlayStations that were in households at the time and

1006
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,860
so forth, you had more PS fours households.

1007
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,740
So I think the game sold better there.

1008
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,980
So, uh, and then some people saying, oh, if you go all the way back to the O G

1009
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,820
tomb Raider games, that was always more of a PlayStation thing.

1010
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:01,140
So this feels like a, and I'm using my quote, he fingers slap in the face to

1011
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,060
those of us that have supported tomb Raider all these years, the DLC for

1012
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,100
like granted out of four was exclusive to Xbox for about six months.

1013
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,620
I don't know.

1014
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,740
They paid $50 million for that.

1015
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:18,940
So, um, you know, I, in my opinion, it's business and you might not like it, but

1016
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,820
I sort of think if things had been the other way around where tomb Raider had

1017
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,180
been announced exclusive for PlayStation four, people would have been like, oh,

1018
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,660
cool.

1019
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,820
And you might've had your occasional Xbox Microsoft tomb Raider.

1020
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,900
So I kind of like, and I'm talking to somebody who doesn't own an Xbox one yet.

1021
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,940
I own a PlayStation four and not an Xbox one, but I'm looking at this going, well,

1022
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,300
that's, that's kind of irritating, but at the same time, it's probably a pretty

1023
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,780
good business decision on Microsoft.

1024
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,020
It's weird from square's end.

1025
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,140
Because, you know, we all know that square doesn't do exclusive deals.

1026
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,260
Well, all except for square does exclusive deals all the time.

1027
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,700
It's not that Dan it's that they went out on record and said, we were a little

1028
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,420
disappointed in the sales of tomb Raider, even though they kind of backtracked on

1029
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:07,300
that later and crystal dynamics, I believe, I believe came out and said, no,

1030
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,500
we, we may we're in the black, the games in the black now, you know, cause they,

1031
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,540
they did sales in the definitive edition, so forth.

1032
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,300
They made their money on that game and so forth.

1033
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,740
It's cause square's delusional.

1034
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,740
Look, I'm offended because tomb Raider was originally a Saturn game.

1035
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,260
And then the PlayStation stolen.

1036
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,980
So you know what Sony fans suck it.

1037
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,660
Now you're getting your own medicine.

1038
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,780
Well, what about, and some folks to say at fifth dream says

1039
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,620
tomb Raider is a PC title.

1040
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,340
I got, isn't it a PC title before it's any of those things.

1041
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:39,140
I'm pretty sure that when tomb Raider was being developed, it was a.

1042
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,580
It was a console game.

1043
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:43,420
Interesting.

1044
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,540
I don't think it started for the PC.

1045
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:49,660
I think what happened was there was a PC version and then they made other PC

1046
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:53,700
versions, but it was like the lead console for tomb Raider was the Saturn.

1047
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,500
And here's the thing though, is it's not just Xbox one.

1048
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,660
It's Xbox one and Xbox three 60.

1049
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,980
Rise of the tomb Raiders on three 60.

1050
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,420
Yes.

1051
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,820
It's it's act it's coming to Xbox first.

1052
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,260
I didn't re I didn't catch that.

1053
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,340
I thought the game only had the newer, uh, no, I think it's

1054
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,340
I think it's just how great the new generation consoles really are.

1055
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:19,660
Last, last in, you know, new, last in, um, last gen and current gen.

1056
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,340
Are you absolutely sure on that?

1057
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,500
I'm pretty sure.

1058
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,860
Oh, it in your mouth.

1059
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,940
Uh, Sony's chain is screening, screaming from the other room.

1060
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,580
Yes.

1061
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,780
So interesting.

1062
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,020
Yeah.

1063
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:33,460
Oh yeah.

1064
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,140
I'm seeing it.

1065
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,260
I'm looking at Wikipedia.

1066
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,100
So it must be true.

1067
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,820
Three 60 and Xbox one.

1068
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,300
Interesting.

1069
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:38,780
Matt.

1070
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,780
Meanwhile, frantically editing Wikipedia.

1071
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,180
It's on Wikipedia.

1072
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,260
So it must be true.

1073
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:47,940
Here it is.

1074
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,100
All right.

1075
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:54,220
So, uh, yeah, I, again, I admit I'm trying to look at the silver lining of this.

1076
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,500
I figured by 2015 holiday, I'd have an Xbox one anyway.

1077
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,780
So maybe there'll be like a really cool bundle that comes out for two

1078
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,060
prizes, the tomb Raider, because Microsoft seems invested in wanting

1079
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,940
their own uncharted.

1080
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Was the last two Raiders so big, despite being a disappointment that

1081
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,220
tomb Raider now has some sort of like relevance in the console war.

1082
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,620
Well, here's yes, because even though when that news came out that the

1083
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,700
two Raider wasn't selling well, Dan, it took a lot of us by surprise because

1084
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,460
the new two Raiders really good, great game, great game.

1085
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,420
And I figured it sold pretty well.

1086
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,860
I didn't figure that sold system selling.

1087
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,620
Well, I didn't figure it would be like if Microsoft rolled up and said, And

1088
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,100
this might date me, cause I haven't really been following new games too

1089
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,980
much, but if they just ran up and said, Hey, by the way, call of duty,

1090
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,260
Xbox exclusive bitches, drops mic, you know, it's like, Oh, we got tomb Raider.

1091
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,780
Good.

1092
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,700
I mean, it's cool.

1093
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,820
It's not going to change your fortunes.

1094
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,060
It's not going to sell Xbox one.

1095
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,660
If you consider that uncharted might be Sony's big game holiday 2015,

1096
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,580
it does create a very new tomb Raider.

1097
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,540
He does have a point.

1098
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,140
That's the thing.

1099
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,980
It's like, it's like, Oh, well, damn.

1100
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,940
I can't play a big yet.

1101
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,460
Hold on.

1102
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:08,940
Okay.

1103
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,460
Okay.

1104
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,540
I can't play tomb Raider right now.

1105
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,940
I'll just play uncharted until tomb Raider comes out.

1106
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,740
I mean, there's that scenario.

1107
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,380
I mean, especially now that it's confirmed that yeah, it's time exclusive.

1108
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,020
So people just like, fuck it.

1109
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,060
I'll just wait or I'll wait and see what the reviews are.

1110
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,980
And the reason that great, I'm just not going to buy it at all when it comes out.

1111
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,140
So it is a double edged sword that, you know, yeah, they get it exclusive,

1112
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,220
but if it doesn't turn out to be a great, great, great game,

1113
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,700
then it could hurt them in the end because now people are just not going to wait.

1114
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,220
They'll wait for it to drop price.

1115
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,060
We paid a hundred milos for an exclusive for a game that doesn't matter that much.

1116
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,660
We needed something.

1117
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,260
We got it Microsoft.

1118
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:52,500
We have bullet, which I remain hopeful

1119
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,180
because the first Tomb Raider was so darn good.

1120
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,340
I know it'll be a great game.

1121
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,820
I know I'm just the first Tomb Raider.

1122
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,860
You guys know what I mean? The first since the reboot.

1123
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,420
All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

1124
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,660
We're running really long because of all these stream problems

1125
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,660
we've been having tonight.

1126
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,500
Put us back a little bit. So let's move on.

1127
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,140
Dark Sakura, then I'll be quick.

1128
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:15,580
Warner Brothers is apparently interested in buying Xbox Entertainment Studios.

1129
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:20,220
There was something put out by a Hollywood reporter saying that Microsoft

1130
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,580
was actually considering selling Xbox Entertainment Studios

1131
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,620
to Warner Brothers because of

1132
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,260
I just lost my place because they wanted to,

1133
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,420
you know, after the negotiations with

1134
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,620
the merger of Xbox Entertainment and Machinima,

1135
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,500
that they thought that it would be a good idea.

1136
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,180
What? Hmm. You know what this means?

1137
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,460
But this news only can be one thing.

1138
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,500
The return of the WB.

1139
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,900
WBX. Well, you know that, you know, Xbox Entertainment was closed.

1140
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,620
Yeah, but they still, of course, own what is left of its assets in the division.

1141
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:08,820
Right. Well, and didn't the the documentary that they did,

1142
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,820
the E.T. one, didn't they have to go to Warner to do a whole bunch

1143
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,220
of the rights and stuff for like E.T. music and whatnot?

1144
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,100
Maybe that was the point of contact.

1145
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,300
Well, E.T. though is universal.

1146
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,620
OK, then fuck it. That's all wrong.

1147
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,940
God damn it, Dan. God damn it, Dan.

1148
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,340
I'm like, what? E.T. was a right at Universal Studios.

1149
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,500
But they licensed shit. I mean, you know, it's true.

1150
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,580
All right. You have The Simpsons right now.

1151
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,820
That's definitely not universal.

1152
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,860
Or I'm sorry. No, it's not even The Simpsons anymore.

1153
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,060
Fuck, I can't keep track.

1154
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,140
It's like Simpsons and then it was Terminator and then like.

1155
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,300
No, it's Simpsons now.

1156
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,980
No, it's back to the future.

1157
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,140
It's no, it's it's The Minions right now.

1158
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,300
They didn't replace Terminator turned into Minions.

1159
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,860
Simpsons was back to the future. Yeah.

1160
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,180
Yeah, that's disappointing.

1161
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,940
It was so cheesy. They had to keep it.

1162
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,500
I mean, anyhow, anyhow.

1163
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,300
Does does this affect the closure of Xbox Entertainment affect the whole

1164
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,380
like possibility of one versus one hundred returning or any of that?

1165
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,180
Oh, man, that was awesome.

1166
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,580
Well, if if if you mean the well,

1167
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,940
no, because, you know, zero percent

1168
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,980
chance of returning time zero is still zero.

1169
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:21,740
I think was the Xbox Entertainment was about like making TV

1170
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,820
shows and shit.

1171
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,780
It was about, oh, we're going to have all this original content

1172
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,820
and we're going to have like a Netflix thing going on.

1173
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,420
It wasn't about making games.

1174
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,380
That was like the Xbox community, man.

1175
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,380
And one versus one hundred was like, that was some cool content

1176
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,580
that sold Xboxes.

1177
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,100
I shit you not. We were selling Xboxes.

1178
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,540
People were like, how do we get this one versus one hundred thing?

1179
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,900
Oh, buy an Xbox, buy this card.

1180
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,540
Don't even the game desk.

1181
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,700
It's all good. Rod Band. Wow.

1182
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,820
I hope I will know.

1183
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,380
I hope that will come back in one way or another.

1184
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,420
Maybe Warner Brothers can do that.

1185
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,140
Warner Brothers, you joke about the WB, but didn't it become the CW?

1186
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,220
I don't know who has the controlling stake in CW.

1187
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,540
I don't know if that's mostly CBS.

1188
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,060
Who cares? Yes, that's true.

1189
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:09,260
Maybe, maybe because I want America's next top model on Xbox

1190
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,420
one with connect,

1191
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,540
make my best smize on connect.

1192
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,860
You're going to get supernatural.

1193
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,460
You can just do that for fun.

1194
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,860
I can. I'm doing it right now.

1195
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,940
The best you can hope for is an adaptation

1196
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,340
of a possible model and movie.

1197
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,140
I just saw a game.

1198
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,380
I just want my Xbox to root for me when I when I die in the exclusive

1199
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,460
Rise of the Tomb Raider.

1200
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,180
I want my I want Tyra to come out and go.

1201
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,540
We were rooting for you.

1202
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,580
We were all rooting for you.

1203
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,740
Anyhow, yeah.

1204
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,460
Loki, new story, please save this.

1205
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,940
All right. So speaking of comeback, Sierra is back

1206
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,340
resurrected in shambles, I guess, by Activision

1207
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:51,060
and Sierra's new direction is, well, they're going to be

1208
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,980
releasing some of their old titles, including King's Quest,

1209
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,860
the brand new King's Quest game and.

1210
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,180
Geometry Wars, three dimensions, which is like geometry wars,

1211
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:04,540
but now it's not quite flat, it's in dimensions.

1212
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,940
Bizarre Creations is back.

1213
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,740
Now, when they start doing time dimensions, then

1214
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,100
we have Tesseract edition.

1215
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,460
So correct me if I'm wrong.

1216
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,500
This is your only active.

1217
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,260
Fuck you. Oh, excuse me, excuse me.

1218
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,100
Not here. This is only Activision using the name, right?

1219
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,380
It's no there's no Roberta Williams.

1220
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,660
Oh, God, no original talent.

1221
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,860
She washed her hands of Lord gaming.

1222
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,780
Lord British isn't running back to Activision because

1223
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,020
more money after launching into space.

1224
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,220
Lord British tried to shoot himself into space.

1225
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,140
Right. No, he did shoot himself into space.

1226
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,820
Yeah, but he's not running back.

1227
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,660
This is just them saying we're going to release adventure games

1228
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,860
and we're going to release it under the order of British.

1229
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,100
He's making Facebook games now.

1230
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,140
Oh, no, that's what I'm saying.

1231
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,020
This those guys aren't coming back.

1232
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,580
So, yeah, it's not coming back.

1233
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,940
The name Sierra is being used for the King's Quest.

1234
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,620
Bizarre sequel slash remake slash resurrection.

1235
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,780
Bizarre, sadly, not coming back either.

1236
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,260
So even though I'm really no shit, even though I'm really.

1237
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,860
Fuck you, Activision.

1238
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,460
Fuck you for that.

1239
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,060
Fuck you, Microsoft, for even selling them.

1240
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:14,500
And even though I'm like really excited about a new Geometry Wars,

1241
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,140
I'm like super like shifty eyes, like don't fuck this up.

1242
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,980
Do not follow.

1243
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,540
OK, so King's Quest, they're saying is being developed by the odd gentlemen

1244
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:27,020
who did the misadventures of PB Winterbottom

1245
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,660
and I guess the wayward manor.

1246
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,900
And then lucid games are going to be taking over Geometry Wars.

1247
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,420
I have no idea who lucid games are, but it's Geometry Wars.

1248
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,700
I can't imagine it'd be that difficult.

1249
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,220
Famous. That's not true.

1250
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:47,100
Geometry Wars is a simple game that's perfectly balanced.

1251
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,500
It was designed not just like, oh, here you go, play this.

1252
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,300
Like they put some time into it.

1253
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,260
Remember the first year of the Xbox?

1254
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,980
It was the killer app.

1255
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,500
It was like, well, Project

1256
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,300
Awesome three is pretty good, but perfect dark zero.

1257
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,300
Do you have you played Geometry Wars?

1258
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,620
Oh, and Uno on Xbox Live. There you go.

1259
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,860
No, for like no lies detected on versus 100.

1260
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,660
And it's like it's so weird.

1261
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,140
Yet yet bizarre.

1262
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,780
Shut down vision camera, not support like what?

1263
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,660
Anyway, well, it was, you know, what happened was

1264
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,020
and I mean, I know that because I'm a racing effects, not a bizarre

1265
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,220
big thing was Gotham Project, Gotham Nine.

1266
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:31,820
It took three titles, but eventually for to eclipse Project Gotham.

1267
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,580
Microsoft didn't see any reason to keep bankrolling them.

1268
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,740
And so they sold them off to Activision.

1269
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,500
And then Activision had one release.

1270
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,140
It was like Splitter Splitter Blur.

1271
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,660
They had two releases because you remember Activision

1272
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,060
had them develop that crappy game, the club.

1273
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,460
Oh, oh, yeah. They did a double of seven games.

1274
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,220
Anyway, why do you why did you remind me about?

1275
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,260
I hate you so much, man.

1276
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:57,060
Here's the Geometry Wars two was still really good to evolved.

1277
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,220
Yeah, exactly. Anyway, that was Geometry Wars two was Geometry Wars.

1278
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,420
Sorry, whatever.

1279
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,740
Remember, we did have one that got the name Geometry Wars two on Xbox 360.

1280
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,740
That's really good, too.

1281
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,300
And we we had was that the guys supported it over the Wii.

1282
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,180
So that's pretty good.

1283
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,540
And the way that was still bizarre.

1284
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,980
And the Wii one was pretty good, too.

1285
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,620
Was it on 3DS or DS?

1286
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,980
I think so. It was on DS. Yeah.

1287
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,220
And that game was awesome.

1288
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,260
It's a great game. It's just OK.

1289
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:23,100
I'm just worried because Activision sucks.

1290
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,700
I don't know. I wouldn't say they suck, but it's just like there's

1291
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,260
EA has reclaimed their title, Crown of the Most Evilest.

1292
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,540
Oh, yes, yes.

1293
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,060
But I'm worried that the Activision and like even EA

1294
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,300
has been trying to spin this where or maybe not EA, but there was like,

1295
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,300
was it that the guy that did

1296
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,380
or the group that did Devil May Cry, you know, that game sucks.

1297
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:50,740
Well, now they're trying to release these games as indie titles.

1298
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:55,540
So like, you know, like Geometry Wars three dimensions is an indie title

1299
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,740
or like, you know, King's Quest is going to be more of an indie title.

1300
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,860
And they're trying to spin it that way to get people,

1301
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,820
you know, kind of more on their side for that stuff.

1302
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,420
Like they have another game coming out.

1303
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,020
I can't remember, but it looked exactly like Devil May Cry,

1304
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,980
but it's it's it's an indie title by a triple A studio or something like that.

1305
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,860
It's like that doesn't make any fucking sense.

1306
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,460
It's by what they call it.

1307
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:18,060
It's by a small market developer, you know, an indie developer.

1308
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,900
Indie developer, not indie studio.

1309
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,980
Yeah, because Activision is about the world's biggest or second biggest studio.

1310
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,540
Well, as much fun as we're having reminiscing evil bastards

1311
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,300
about the past, let's do some more reminiscing about the past with this story,

1312
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:37,020
because believe it or not, this week is the twenty five year anniversary

1313
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,860
of the Sega Genesis, not the medium, right?

1314
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:43,460
Not the not the Mega Drive necessarily, but the Sega Genesis

1315
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,700
coming to stores in North America.

1316
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:50,660
Remember Sonic and Tails and Fantasy Star and Echo

1317
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,260
the Dolphin and Shadow Run and Toe Jam and Earl.

1318
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,140
Don't remember those from launch because you remember Altered Beast,

1319
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,500
which which I went back and played not that long ago

1320
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,100
because it was on the Sonic Mega collection thing.

1321
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,660
So I went back to get my trophies.

1322
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:09,020
I played Altered Beast on Genesis and I was like Ultimate Genesis collection.

1323
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:09,700
That's it. Thank you.

1324
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,140
I was like Altered Beast on Genesis.

1325
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,540
This game sucks. That game was terrible.

1326
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,300
But the whole thing was you came from like Mario three,

1327
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,700
which is a masterpiece of of gameplay design and whatnot.

1328
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,060
And you looked at the graphics and then you looked at Altered Beast

1329
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:26,140
and you heard the graphics and the voice and you were like, God damn,

1330
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,380
this is amazing.

1331
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,700
And there were a lot of great games during the launch of the Genesis.

1332
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,220
There was Thunder Force Two.

1333
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,780
There was Herzog Zwei.

1334
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,180
There was Truxton.

1335
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,700
There was what else was going to launch?

1336
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,180
Yeah, that's about it.

1337
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,580
I had Super Thunder Blade and Altered Beast. I got screwed.

1338
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,380
Yeah. And the Altered Beast.

1339
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:46,900
Bulls and Ghosts.

1340
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,100
Bulls and Ghosts was the lead launch title.

1341
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,540
It was the reason to own a Sega Genesis.

1342
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,820
Altered Beast, everybody remembers from the arcade

1343
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,940
and not that it was necessarily a much better game in the arcade,

1344
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:59,940
but everybody remembers those sequences with like the voice

1345
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:03,220
like when they transform in the wise from your wave.

1346
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,460
The Genesis was a capable trance.

1347
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:09,620
The funny thing about the Genesis translations were they were always close.

1348
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,020
They weren't exact. Golden Axe wasn't exact.

1349
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,780
You know, what was the other one?

1350
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,420
Ghouls and Ghosts wasn't exact.

1351
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,500
Altered Beast wasn't exact.

1352
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,660
But because they were the closest you could get at home at the moment,

1353
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,820
they were amazing.

1354
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,740
I didn't realize Omar Fudd did voice acting in that game.

1355
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,420
He did. Oh, yes.

1356
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,940
Dungeon Buster in chat at live.vognetware.com says,

1357
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,860
everybody poop who's Altered Beast nowadays.

1358
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,900
But it was like, holy crap, it's almost like the arcade at the time.

1359
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,420
Yeah, it was.

1360
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,260
That's what I was saying is it was mind blowingly close.

1361
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,060
And when you got your Genesis, that was, you know,

1362
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,620
especially if you bought it in the first year before Sonic released

1363
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,580
and became the pack-in, that was the game you slammed in and you turned on.

1364
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,660
And you were like, why didn't I buy a second controller

1365
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,060
so my buddy could play with me?

1366
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,660
And you play through the game in like 20 minutes

1367
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,180
and then you play through the game again in like 20 minutes.

1368
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:01,660
And then you put it away and hopefully you'd bought another game.

1369
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:06,060
Dan, I know you have many fond memories of the Genesis

1370
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:07,860
because I think you're kind of the Sega fanboy.

1371
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:08,940
Yeah, Sega is my thing.

1372
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,620
Which is kind of probably why you're here tonight of all weeks.

1373
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,740
No, it's just an amazing coincidence.

1374
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,980
Amazing coincidence.

1375
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,060
What are your personal favorite memories?

1376
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,780
Because I didn't own a Genesis and my friends did, but I didn't own one.

1377
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:21,780
You didn't own a Genesis?

1378
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,380
I was a Super Nintendo kid.

1379
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:25,180
Fuck you, I'm leaving.

1380
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:28,380
Well, what are your favorite memories of the Sega Genesis?

1381
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,140
Looking back, you know, the great thing about when the Genesis

1382
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:37,620
actually launched was that it took the how do you say?

1383
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,300
It kind of took the vibe that Nintendo was putting out, which was,

1384
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,420
oh, it's real family friendly and it's good for kids.

1385
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,940
And the console is wide and the games are all brightly colored.

1386
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,260
And I mean, the box was black.

1387
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,180
It had the big silver logo on it.

1388
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,540
It had the big screenshot from Altered Beast.

1389
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,540
And it just it looked edgy.

1390
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:56,380
It felt edgy.

1391
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:00,220
The controllers were were a little too large for little kid hands

1392
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:03,660
and had three buttons, which was amazing at the moment.

1393
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,780
The game cartridges were really cool and sleek,

1394
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,140
and they didn't have the names on the front.

1395
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,300
They were only on the top.

1396
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,540
And it did weird little things like when you had two controllers plugged in,

1397
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,580
it wouldn't ask you if you wanted to do one or two player

1398
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,260
and some of the launch games you had to press start of the second controller.

1399
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:22,540
But if you only played it, one player would let you swap controllers back

1400
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,620
and forth, which Nintendo didn't do at the moment.

1401
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,900
And we were just like, oh, man, that's so cool.

1402
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,140
What kind of thought went into that?

1403
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:34,220
It had almost all arcade games, just really fantastic stuff.

1404
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,380
I had a Super Nintendo.

1405
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,860
God, you suck.

1406
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,700
And that's not what you said when we opened my luggage day one.

1407
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,660
You're like, you bought a Super Nintendo.

1408
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:47,940
I did not. You did. You did, sir.

1409
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,540
I'm like, wow, your Super Nintendo is ugly and discolored.

1410
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,980
Mine is beautiful and pristine.

1411
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,380
Let's throw yours away.

1412
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,100
I know you still have mine.

1413
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:59,060
I think, OK, when we talk about our show, we do like like I throw away

1414
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,540
a Super Nintendo, not to interrupt the family.

1415
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,460
So I was looking for you to interrupt because I was like out of breath.

1416
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,860
But I as a non Genesis owner, I still remember

1417
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:12,660
what I think was kind of the big moment for me that made me want to Genesis.

1418
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,300
And I think was was a big defining moment

1419
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,100
for the Sega Genesis was the release of Mortal Kombat.

1420
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,180
And the fact that the Sega Genesis was the only system cool enough

1421
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:28,140
to have the blood code, whereas on the Super Nintendo, it was like, no, it's sweat.

1422
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,260
I had the Super Nintendo version.

1423
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:32,540
Did you really? Because the graphics and sounds were better.

1424
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,860
But the gameplay was broken as shit.

1425
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,340
Yeah, it really was.

1426
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,540
You know, that was the big problem with this next version.

1427
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:40,540
It just didn't play right.

1428
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:45,700
But it looked like like the scale down, but it looked like the arcade.

1429
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,660
And that was just sort of the weird thing about it was.

1430
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,940
Yeah, the Genesis version was a big, big seller.

1431
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,180
But that didn't come out till, what, 94?

1432
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,940
It was later on. It was.

1433
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,420
Yeah, it's 93 or 94.

1434
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,460
So you're talking like three or four years in.

1435
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,900
And it kind of gave.

1436
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,260
What was weird was, you know, the SNES came out and the SNES was successful

1437
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,820
and the Genesis came out with Sonic and the Genesis was holding its own.

1438
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:10,620
And then the Mortal Kombat thing, you know, then the SNES got Street Fighter II.

1439
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,500
And all of a sudden we were all throwing the Genesis aside

1440
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,660
because it was like we had to play Street Fighter II.

1441
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,300
Talk about a third party exclusive.

1442
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,540
That was a huge system seller.

1443
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,740
And, you know, because the Genesis didn't get Street Fighter II

1444
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:28,220
and sell it until Special Champion Edition, they had no analog to it.

1445
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:33,780
So they brought out MK, MK gave the Genesis more life

1446
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:37,060
because their version had fatalities.

1447
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:40,340
It had blood. It played faster. It played better.

1448
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,220
Yeah, it sounded kind of wonky and it looked a little funky,

1449
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:48,220
but it was closer to what people, to what the Mortal Kombat fan wanted.

1450
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,540
Right. Very good.

1451
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:53,020
Very good summary of that there, Loki.

1452
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,900
I didn't have a Genesis right away, but I did get one.

1453
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,900
I did get one later on.

1454
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,540
So I think, you know, one of my favorite games on there.

1455
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,500
Well, I had two favorite games.

1456
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,900
One would have been the their version of Jurassic Park,

1457
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,140
which was the side scroller version where you could play as the dinosaurs.

1458
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:10,220
That was pretty cool.

1459
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,340
And then Vectorman, actually.

1460
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,180
I kind of like that was late.

1461
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,860
And Earthworm Jim.

1462
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,940
That was a good game.

1463
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,140
You know, Earthworm Jim is a great example of a game

1464
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,900
that was just hyped as shit, too.

1465
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,260
Like they pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and pushed it.

1466
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,940
And then it came out and it was good.

1467
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:32,660
Guys, you know, in chat saying the game came out in 92, not 93 or 94.

1468
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,980
That actually does sound right, because I remember I got in a fight

1469
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:35,820
with my ex-girlfriend.

1470
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,940
I know it was a couple of years in.

1471
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,420
Because remember, it launched in 89.

1472
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:42,060
So we're not talking like first Christmas or second Christmas.

1473
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,420
It'd be like the third or fourth Christmas for the console.

1474
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,220
You know, Dan, Dan, I hate to disappoint you,

1475
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,660
but the first Sega system I ever owned was a Dreamcast.

1476
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,580
And even then, it was after they had slashed the price like 50 bucks.

1477
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,380
Well, I'm not surprised by that before the Dreamcast was out here.

1478
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:58,180
Oh, yeah, with the Japanese, because there were like six people

1479
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,820
who owned the master system. Yeah.

1480
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:04,620
And so when the Genesis came out, it had it had a big mountain to climb.

1481
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,300
But the whole thing was they kind of pulled the Sony

1482
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:11,940
where they didn't go directly after the Nintendo consumer at first.

1483
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,860
They went after the older gamer.

1484
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:16,020
They said, like I said, everything's a little edgier,

1485
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:18,220
a little more expensive, a little bit bigger.

1486
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,980
But you're going to get the hardcore arcade games that you want.

1487
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:26,220
You're not going to get to Mario, but you will get Altered Beast.

1488
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:28,220
You will get Golden Axe.

1489
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:30,380
You will get Revenge of Shinobi.

1490
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:32,900
You know, oh, yeah, that was probably the other really good launch game.

1491
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:33,700
Revenge of Shinobi.

1492
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,300
Oh, Shadow Dancer. That was another great title.

1493
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,100
Yeah, Shadow Dancer, which is which is a Mega Drive or Genesis exclusive

1494
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,660
because the arcade version is completely different.

1495
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,180
And Moonwalker. Come on.

1496
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,660
How can I forget Moonwalker?

1497
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,500
Oh, yeah, not a launch, but a great game.

1498
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,660
First year or maybe second year.

1499
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,500
It's Strider. Strider.

1500
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,060
Yeah, it was probably the first, not the first Christmas,

1501
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,100
but the second Christmas, Christmas 90.

1502
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,100
And you remember I sat down and beat it on Genesis,

1503
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,860
one of our first years together.

1504
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,460
Actually, I think you beat it on the arcade emulator that we had.

1505
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,860
Now, I beat it on the Genesis.

1506
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,300
I did. I was sitting on the Genesis version is easier.

1507
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,460
All right. Well, we could reminisce on Sega Genesis all night.

1508
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:13,860
And Dan's going to try, but we can't.

1509
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,300
I do. I do want to move on.

1510
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,300
Let me talk about this new title.

1511
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,460
Hey, did I tell you about something on Genesis?

1512
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,500
So don't I have a story?

1513
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,540
Well, that's what Nintendo shut up while I mute Dan's mic.

1514
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,740
Let's move on to.

1515
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,100
Hey, Jamie, tell us all about how great the Genesis is.

1516
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:27,980
Well, how about Plants vs.

1517
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:31,020
Zombie Garden Warfare for people?

1518
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,900
For people who are interested in this game, it is the fans.

1519
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,300
OK, I'm done.

1520
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,540
She dropped the mic, take the mic out of his hand.

1521
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,540
Give me that. Oh, Dan, now I have two mics.

1522
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:50,340
Yes, I am. Oh, hey, leave my coffee alone.

1523
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:55,540
Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.

1524
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:58,180
I'm going to strangle him with the cord.

1525
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,300
Do you get to play as the coffee bean in the Garden Warfare?

1526
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,900
It's free, bitches.

1527
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,060
It's free for a little while.

1528
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:09,140
Seventy two hours worth of free on Loolergens.

1529
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,420
So go get it.

1530
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,540
And here's Dan talking about more Sega shit.

1531
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,540
You know, the plants didn't really have Plants vs.

1532
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:18,460
Zombies on Sega, but they did have Zombies Ate My Neighbors,

1533
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,020
which had a lot of hedges.

1534
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,420
It didn't have plants in it.

1535
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:25,220
Many, many plants and several zombies.

1536
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:29,980
I love how Jamie literally read a story about a new game

1537
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:32,180
that's free and neither one of you care.

1538
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,420
Is it on Sega Genesis?

1539
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,980
No. Then it doesn't matter.

1540
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,060
Here's why I don't care.

1541
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,700
Here's why I don't care about that.

1542
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,260
It's because it's not free forever.

1543
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,540
It's just a free trial over the weekend.

1544
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,260
Now, if it was one of those, hey, Origin, I mean,

1545
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,140
or it's Origin giving me a free game.

1546
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,700
Yeah, sure. Go download it. That'd be awesome.

1547
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,900
Wing Commander 3 is still free.

1548
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,940
Yes, Wing Commander 3. Go download that.

1549
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:52,140
But, you know, it's not one of those.

1550
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,660
Free trial? I don't give a shit.

1551
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:57,220
So it's one of those.

1552
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,300
Isn't it a free weekend when you start it?

1553
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,260
It's not like Steam weekends where it's between.

1554
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,780
I thought it was like 72 hours when you download it and start it.

1555
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,460
Yeah, I still think that's how it works.

1556
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:09,460
All right. Anyhow, so let's travel around the world

1557
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,700
and check out some release dates of some games that are coming out that,

1558
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,860
sadly, they're probably not free, but you never know.

1559
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,700
Are they on the Genesis?

1560
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,900
We'll cover Genesis release dates.

1561
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:19,820
No, but guess what?

1562
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:23,020
Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare is coming out on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4,

1563
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,220
but that's because EA said, hey, guess what?

1564
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:30,420
Microsoft paid for an awesome exclusive on Xbox One and Xbox 360.

1565
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,900
So you guys get it six months later. Whoo!

1566
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,420
So you better believe that whenever Tomb Raider comes out on PlayStation,

1567
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,500
it's going to be probably six months later because that seems to be all their deals are.

1568
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,100
Six months comes out on the other systems.

1569
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,100
So those will be PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4.

1570
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,780
And then Tales of Zilia 2 on PlayStation 3.

1571
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:56,100
And finally, Diablo 3, the Ultimate Evil Edition on PlayStation 3,

1572
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:01,100
PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox 360.

1573
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,380
All right. Traveling over to Japan,

1574
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,580
taking a look at the Mega Drive releases in Japan.

1575
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:07,380
Nothing, Dan.

1576
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,260
There's nothing coming out on the Mega Drive this week in Japan.

1577
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,340
And Wii U releases and nothing.

1578
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:15,020
The Mega Drive really wasn't the most successful system in Japan.

1579
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,380
Did you look at the European or the Brazilian?

1580
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:21,020
So how about what's coming out on other systems?

1581
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,500
Well, I was going to say also nothing on the Xbox 360.

1582
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,540
That actually isn't true.

1583
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:29,020
That's usually a running joke, like Xbox 360 in Japan, ha ha ha.

1584
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,180
But the Xbox 360 is getting World of Tanks,

1585
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:35,220
Xbox 360 Edition Starter Pack is out in Japan this week.

1586
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:38,460
So more releases than the Mega Drive.

1587
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,020
Go figure.

1588
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,260
On the PlayStation 4, a big week over there on the 21st,

1589
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,180
Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls, Ultimate Evil,

1590
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:47,060
and The Last of Us Remastered hitting Japan this week.

1591
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,180
The Xbox One still not out in Japan,

1592
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,260
so we don't actually have releases for that yet.

1593
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:56,020
On the PlayStation 3, Diablo 3 makes its way out there as well.

1594
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:59,900
Nothing on the Wii U this week, because releases are few and far

1595
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,860
between on the Wii U.

1596
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:03,140
But the PlayStation Vita has a few games

1597
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:05,100
to kind of follow up what AkumaJP said earlier.

1598
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:08,220
Binary Star, Bullet Girls, and Chaos

1599
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:11,060
had Duel all coming out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

1600
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,740
So there are still some releases on the Vita.

1601
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:17,620
Just one game on the 3DS this week, Tetsudo Nippon,

1602
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,580
Rosa no Tabi, Kashima Orinkai Tetsudo Hen

1603
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:22,820
comes out this week.

1604
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,320
I'm trying to see what that game is.

1605
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,340
It looks like it's a game about public transit,

1606
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:28,940
or like transit trains.

1607
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:29,740
It's a train game.

1608
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,860
Some people love their trains in Japan.

1609
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,660
Some people love their trains in America, too.

1610
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:33,980
We don't get cool games like this.

1611
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,700
Remember they used to have those big awesome controllers

1612
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,580
for the train games?

1613
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,500
I think they still do.

1614
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,500
They probably still do.

1615
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,140
Awesome.

1616
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,140
Yeah, and on 3DS, you'd have it on the bottom.

1617
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,820
Isn't there like a big Shinkansen thing

1618
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,300
that came out like last year?

1619
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:45,800
Probably.

1620
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,420
I don't know.

1621
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,340
They don't release the really cool stuff here.

1622
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:51,500
We got Railroad Tycoon, and I think I had the A train on.

1623
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,900
No, they have a train simulator game.

1624
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:57,740
I know it's on Steam because they have zombie DLC for it.

1625
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:58,820
Don't ask me why.

1626
01:14:58,820 --> 01:14:59,620
They have that.

1627
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,380
And then the warehouse simulator game,

1628
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,900
they also had zombie DLC for us.

1629
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,580
What if you made like a funny typo?

1630
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,460
Warrios.

1631
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,500
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys,

1632
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,060
and then the classic.

1633
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:10,700
No.

1634
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

1635
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,280
UK dates.

1636
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:12,940
My bad.

1637
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:13,940
Jeez, Rob.

1638
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,540
No one cares.

1639
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,500
You can leave.

1640
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,620
Is anything coming out on Genesis?

1641
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,460
In the UK, it would be the Mega Drive, sir.

1642
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,700
Oh, my bad.

1643
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:26,300
On the 19th, we have Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls for PS3, Xbox

1644
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:31,660
360, and PS4, and X-Bone, and not Genesis.

1645
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:37,380
On the 20th, we have Counter Spy for PS4, Vita, and PS3.

1646
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,620
Dan?

1647
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:40,580
Mega Drive.

1648
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:41,460
There, I said it.

1649
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,500
It's on the Mega Drive.

1650
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,260
Sweet.

1651
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:46,220
I'm importing it.

1652
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:48,860
On the 21st of August, we have Plants vs. Zombies,

1653
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:52,300
Garden Warfare on Xbox 4, and I'm sorry, not Xbox 4.

1654
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,700
PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.

1655
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,980
See what you made me do?

1656
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,420
Mega Drive.

1657
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:59,340
I'll Mega Drive the car over you.

1658
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,300
I'll run over you with my Mega Fiat.

1659
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:02,900
All right.

1660
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,420
No.

1661
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,180
Now, just a couple more stories, and then

1662
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:06,780
the classic game of the week.

1663
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:10,140
It'll be back to Jamie, because it's all about Jamie.

1664
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,780
The irony is it probably won't be a Genesis game.

1665
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:19,180
It is actually not a Genesis game tonight, but that's OK.

1666
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,860
All right, moving, because she's probably

1667
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:23,240
done every Genesis game at one point or another.

1668
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,580
She's done a lot of Sega games.

1669
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:25,580
Oh, shoot.

1670
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,060
I actually fucked up, because I was

1671
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:31,940
going to do my whole Capcom, the Qsound era games.

1672
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:33,820
Yeah, you broke your own pattern.

1673
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,540
I'm going to have to start my pattern again next week.

1674
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:35,900
All right.

1675
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,140
Well, that's OK, because the show is broke in itself

1676
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,660
when it keeps disconnecting tonight, so it's appropriate.

1677
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,620
Loki.

1678
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:42,500
All right.

1679
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,340
Mario Kart.

1680
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:47,020
So lots of copies have been sold.

1681
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,940
They've surpassed $1 million in the US,

1682
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,140
and that's a pretty amazing feat, considering they haven't

1683
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,460
really sold that many systems.

1684
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:57,220
But Mario Kart definitely helped, so good for them.

1685
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,700
And of course, we'll see some free DLC

1686
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:09,780
that's totally not cashing in from sponsors, but whatever.

1687
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:13,380
I'm actually excited to see more track DLC.

1688
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:17,060
And speaking of tracks, there's actually some cups

1689
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:19,180
that were not in the game.

1690
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:27,260
They have some unused icons, including, let's see here,

1691
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:37,140
looks like a Yoshi egg, a star, a boo, and a blue shell.

1692
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,060
Oh, god, I can only imagine what a blue shell

1693
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,060
cup is going to consist of.

1694
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,540
My understanding is, isn't one of the new DLCs

1695
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,060
like Mercedes-based?

1696
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:45,580
Yeah.

1697
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,540
Like you get Mercedes carts?

1698
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,700
It's coming out August 24th, I think.

1699
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,820
Where does that come from?

1700
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,420
Just some weird type of deal.

1701
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,700
It was in Japan first.

1702
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:55,980
They've had it for a while.

1703
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,300
It was just some weird licensing deal they had.

1704
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,740
But I mean, who's going to be sitting there,

1705
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,180
and they're going to be playing their Wii U,

1706
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:04,420
and they're going to be going, because I could choose

1707
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,900
a Mercedes and Mario Kart, I think

1708
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,940
I'm going to head on down to my local Mercedes dealer

1709
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,620
and take a test drive.

1710
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,740
It just doesn't seem to have a lot of synergy.

1711
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:15,300
Not everyone is like you, Dan.

1712
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,100
Brand awareness.

1713
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,420
It might work on me, but I mean, that's like, fuck it.

1714
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,700
I'll definitely, I mean, yeah.

1715
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,420
Dan gets out of bed going, I want to test drive a car today.

1716
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,260
Mercedes is trying to hook them early.

1717
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,540
They're all like, you know, when I was 10 years old,

1718
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,780
I drove a Mercedes and Mario Kart,

1719
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:30,700
and I'm semi-successful now.

1720
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,780
If I actually took this seriously,

1721
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:34,980
which I'm going to humor Dan and take this seriously,

1722
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,020
I think it is a part of brand awareness.

1723
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:39,260
And it may not be so much about trying to get the person

1724
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:41,260
to go out and test drive a Mercedes

1725
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,580
as it is trying to reach the person that's already

1726
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:46,020
thinking about driving a car who may have thought,

1727
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:47,740
I didn't think about a Mercedes,

1728
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:50,100
but now I'm seeing it on these YouTubes

1729
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,460
of people playing Mario Kart,

1730
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,060
and it's just creating the awareness.

1731
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:53,900
And-

1732
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,740
You're a fucking idiot.

1733
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:57,700
Fuck you, get off the channel.

1734
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,100
Fuck you.

1735
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,140
No, no, no.

1736
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,340
I just don't buy that.

1737
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:03,980
I just, I see the user base for the Wii U

1738
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:07,580
and the user base for the Mercedes Benz automobile

1739
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:11,140
as so different that I just can't see them working together.

1740
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,780
It's just, it's just two great tastes that don't go together.

1741
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,220
It's just that they paid them money

1742
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:18,540
to put it in their game.

1743
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:19,460
I know.

1744
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,980
That's all it was because they're like, we need money.

1745
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,220
Right, no, no, no, I'm not saying Nintendo,

1746
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,180
yeah, that's why, that's exactly what I'm getting at.

1747
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:26,020
How did this go?

1748
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:26,860
You know what?

1749
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:27,900
Nintendo doesn't do anything for free.

1750
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:28,740
I want to see Trojan-

1751
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:29,820
Oh my God, Rob.

1752
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:31,660
I didn't, I don't, you're not really an idiot.

1753
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,380
I want to see Trojan condoms,

1754
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:35,420
pay them a lot of money to put some DLC in,

1755
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,300
like, I don't know, Mario Kart, why not?

1756
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,140
Let's do that.

1757
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,100
Dude, that would be awesome.

1758
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,460
There could be a condom power up.

1759
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,980
It covers you up and you're protected from everything

1760
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,340
until it wears off.

1761
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:47,620
Dan, you could have the Mercedes and Mario Kart,

1762
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,020
or you can have Yaris.

1763
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,860
Yaris probably made more sense.

1764
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:54,860
Because it's a cheap-

1765
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,380
Are you really right now?

1766
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,500
Yes, yes, and I'll tell you why.

1767
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,060
First of all, Yaris is a bootsy game,

1768
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,260
so I'm not trying to endorse that you,

1769
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:04,340
well, you can't download it, but okay.

1770
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:07,060
Yaris was a cheapy little car

1771
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:09,460
that's going to be geared towards 20-somethings

1772
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:11,380
who are probably sitting on their fucking couch

1773
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,900
playing Xbox 360.

1774
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,460
Do I think for a second that Yaris sold Toyota any cars?

1775
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,860
No.

1776
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,420
But I'm sure, you know,

1777
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,420
it's not as if Mercedes came out and said,

1778
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,980
you know who we're going after?

1779
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:25,020
We're going after Gran Turismo players.

1780
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,220
Well, here's the thing, too, though.

1781
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,220
When, like, I was looking for a car

1782
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,700
and I was looking for some affordable cars and stuff,

1783
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:33,260
I was like, oh, hey, cheap car, it's a Yaris.

1784
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,780
Let me see what that's about, you know?

1785
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:35,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1786
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,300
Not saying that I was going to buy it,

1787
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,780
but it's like, it's made it stand out

1788
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,860
like a fraction of a percent more than, like, say,

1789
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,700
you know, I don't know.

1790
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,300
Well, and unless I'm completely off base

1791
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:52,140
onto what the common user of the Wii U is,

1792
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:56,420
apparently it's an affluent, you know, 40 to 50-something

1793
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:58,180
that's making six figures.

1794
01:20:58,180 --> 01:20:59,380
Because that's, well, no,

1795
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:02,820
because I guess there is a $40,000 Mercedes out there now.

1796
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,260
Maybe that's the whole idea.

1797
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,420
Maybe they're trying to say,

1798
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:08,420
hey, you're 23 years old and you're sitting at home

1799
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:12,220
playing a game for 12-year-olds, come buy a Mercedes.

1800
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,060
You get a used Mercedes?

1801
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:16,820
No, I'm sure, yeah, I'm sure it's got like an 83,

1802
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:20,140
you know, diesel piece of shit Mercedes

1803
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:21,620
that you can drive in the game.

1804
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,060
They do have the old class.

1805
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:25,940
Mario's like sticking out of the hood, you know, fuck.

1806
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:26,980
They do have, like,

1807
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,860
was it some of the classic Mercedes in there?

1808
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,860
Like, they have the classic, I forget,

1809
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,580
the one that's like the monopoly car in the game.

1810
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,420
Right.

1811
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:35,260
And...

1812
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,620
Yeah, it's only like, yeah.

1813
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:39,300
And it's more expensive than any new Mercedes.

1814
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,580
Yeah.

1815
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:42,740
The SLR McLaren, you know.

1816
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,900
Let's see, I was gonna see exactly

1817
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:48,060
which cars were in there.

1818
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:48,900
It would all make more sense to me

1819
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:52,940
if it was like Mercedes free download pack for Forza 5.

1820
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,100
Let's see, it was...

1821
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:01,820
The 1957 300 SL Roadster,

1822
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:05,060
the 1934 W25 Silver Arrow,

1823
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:10,060
and let's see, the new compact SUV.

1824
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,340
The GLA.

1825
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,420
I was thinking, hey, maybe it's not such a cash-in.

1826
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:16,340
Maybe they're just gonna put some cute cars in there

1827
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:17,180
as some sort of freebie.

1828
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:18,020
Then it's like, oh yeah,

1829
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:21,420
and the new compact Mercedes SUV.

1830
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,020
All right.

1831
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,060
For time, I gotta move on.

1832
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,300
I wanna hit one more story here

1833
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,820
before we get to the classic game of the week,

1834
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:30,580
which has no add-on car DLC that I know of, but we'll see.

1835
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:32,980
You guys all know about what went down on Twitch last week.

1836
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:33,940
We talked about that,

1837
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:35,300
and I'm sure a lot of your favorite podcasts

1838
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,420
have been talking about the controversy happening at Twitch.

1839
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,820
Well, a little bit of irony on this story.

1840
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,180
Twitch seems to have expanded

1841
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:45,180
into more live streaming demonstrations,

1842
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:48,500
I suppose, for lack of a better term, for electronic music.

1843
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:52,020
Porter Robinson released a new album this past week, Worlds,

1844
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:55,900
and he had a Twitch stream that ran this thing

1845
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,180
where he hung out with fans

1846
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:59,260
and talked about the video games that inspired the tracks

1847
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:01,140
and showed the recording studio and so forth.

1848
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,140
So it was a little weird because I guess it was about games

1849
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:04,420
because he talked about video games,

1850
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:09,420
but yet it was this album promotion for copyrighted music.

1851
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:15,140
So I don't know if the archives got bleeped or whatever.

1852
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:15,980
I don't know.

1853
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:17,820
But this isn't the first time this has happened either.

1854
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,580
There's, let's see, Mad Descent,

1855
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:23,380
who is the label behind Diplo, Dylan Francis.

1856
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,460
They did a Twitch channel.

1857
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:25,300
Diplo.

1858
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,140
Is it Diplo?

1859
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:28,900
Sorry, you can tell how much I listen to these artists.

1860
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,540
They did a Twitch channel

1861
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,500
where the folks are talking with fans.

1862
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,500
And Darude, I know Darude, they did the after party.

1863
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,860
Remember Sandstorm?

1864
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:39,340
That's my excuse to play Darude right now.

1865
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:43,260
So anyway, interesting that this is some territory

1866
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,100
that they're getting into

1867
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:47,620
because it's not really directly about video games

1868
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,700
and it's barking up the tree

1869
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,180
of something that they really cut back on last week.

1870
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:55,260
So, I don't know.

1871
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,980
It's a little hypocritical actually.

1872
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:57,820
A little bit?

1873
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:58,660
A little bit.

1874
01:23:58,660 --> 01:23:59,500
Why do you think?

1875
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,340
Because they're like,

1876
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:02,020
no, you can't play copyright music.

1877
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:03,100
We're gonna play copyright music.

1878
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,940
That's right.

1879
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:04,940
That's our job to play copyright music.

1880
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,300
But is it the copyright holder

1881
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,500
playing the copyrighted music?

1882
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,580
I would assume so in this case

1883
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,060
because it's the record label doing it.

1884
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:10,900
But-

1885
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:11,740
Then it's a little different.

1886
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:13,940
But when you're using an all automated system

1887
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,060
to bleep things, I wonder if that matters.

1888
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,460
Because we've seen cases on YouTube anyway.

1889
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,300
I mean, I guess I am doing apples to oranges,

1890
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,940
but if it's to be believed that YouTube's gonna buy Twitch,

1891
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,460
I think it's a fair comparison.

1892
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:28,660
YouTube has dropped video and copyright striked

1893
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,340
like people that hold the IP.

1894
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:34,940
Like game creators whose soundtracks get flagged

1895
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,660
from whoever owns that.

1896
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,980
It gets their whole damn movie flagged.

1897
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:39,820
Right.

1898
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,700
Well, they kind of backed off on that a little bit.

1899
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:45,220
It was really bad about a year back.

1900
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,180
I think that Twitch is fantastic.

1901
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,620
And I mean, I haven't really followed

1902
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:50,340
their recent troubles.

1903
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:53,260
I know that they just dropped the whole Justin TV label.

1904
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,980
But I think that for gamers,

1905
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:59,980
Twitch is literally the validation of the hobby.

1906
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,560
It's an entire network.

1907
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,140
You can watch pretty much any game that you'd wanna watch.

1908
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:07,300
You can stream any game that you'd like to stream

1909
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,900
and try to get watchers.

1910
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:13,060
But I can also see how if it's not already

1911
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:14,900
being perverted terribly,

1912
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:18,340
how it can be just perverted terribly and ruined in a second

1913
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:21,240
as any good idea does when you involve humanity.

1914
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:23,800
All right.

1915
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,820
On that note, let's talk about

1916
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:28,160
other of humanity's perverted ideas

1917
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,660
in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

1918
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:33,460
Dark Soccer's gonna take a step into the vault

1919
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,300
and find a game that she thinks,

1920
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,780
hey, you kids should be playing this game.

1921
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,580
I don't know why you're not playing this game.

1922
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,820
Actually, a lot of you have probably played this game.

1923
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:41,940
But remember this game?

1924
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:42,760
Yep.

1925
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,600
It's cool.

1926
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,440
Dark Soccer.

1927
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,420
And it actually is old.

1928
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,260
It is old.

1929
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,620
And I kind of looked at this going,

1930
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,060
oh my God, this game is that old?

1931
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,140
And yes it is.

1932
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,340
Dark Soccer, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1933
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,260
It's Bejeweled.

1934
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:55,080
Bejeweled.

1935
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:55,920
Because it's old.

1936
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,740
It is.

1937
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:58,620
Came out in 2001 and it was,

1938
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:01,980
I think this is the first solely browser game

1939
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:04,380
I've ever done as well.

1940
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,780
So we're definitely getting into the internet age with this.

1941
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:07,620
Possibly.

1942
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:10,460
But basically it's a puzzle game created by PopCap.

1943
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:15,460
It started off as a web-based flash game called Diamond Mine

1944
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,420
that was inspired by a game called Shariki.

1945
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:25,380
Basically, you just have to match up three gems in a row

1946
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,820
and you can get more than that.

1947
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:30,700
It's kind of like the Columns thing too, right Dan?

1948
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,500
Columns, Sega.

1949
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,820
All I'm going to say is for the record,

1950
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:36,060
I would be shocked if there's not a Sega Genesis version

1951
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:36,960
of this out there.

1952
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,580
Columns.

1953
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:40,940
Columns is not the same.

1954
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,220
I know, but still.

1955
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:47,100
But anyway, the game, it's basically just so simple

1956
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,260
and kind of stupid and addicting,

1957
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:53,060
but we now have so many different versions of Bejeweled

1958
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:56,180
and it's been on fucking everything.

1959
01:26:56,220 --> 01:27:00,140
So basically, Bejeweled was actually created by,

1960
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:03,140
the name came up by Microsoft who thought

1961
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:05,420
that Diamond Mine was too similar to another game

1962
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,140
called Diamond Mines as far as the name.

1963
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,140
So basically it's been everywhere.

1964
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:13,280
It's been on Windows where it was Bejeweled Deluxe

1965
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,300
and it was on iOS.

1966
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,880
It's been on old PDAs like the Blackberry, the iPhone,

1967
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,740
Palm OS, Windows Mobile Smartphone Platforms.

1968
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,560
It's been on Xbox Live Arcade.

1969
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,240
It was one of the first downloadable games

1970
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,180
for the iTunes store on the iPod.

1971
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,380
I had it on my old flip phone.

1972
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:35,640
I won't say anything about how often I played that game,

1973
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,760
but I had it.

1974
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,980
It's been on the Chrome Web Store for free.

1975
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:41,680
There's an HD iPad version.

1976
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:46,400
And basically it's also, I think,

1977
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,680
what has led up to the popularity of such games

1978
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,340
such as Candy Crush Saga.

1979
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,300
And other similar type of puzzle games.

1980
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:58,740
Although, you know, this game probably wouldn't exist

1981
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:03,740
if it wasn't for its precursors like Columns, Puyo Puyo.

1982
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,140
What was that one that Julie liked, Dan?

1983
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,180
Magical Drop.

1984
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:11,340
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1985
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:12,340
I like Magical Drop.

1986
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:15,320
All kinds of just the little puzzle games like this

1987
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,020
that are, and the thing is,

1988
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:21,860
the concept behind the game is really easy.

1989
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:27,100
However, it just gets complicated,

1990
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:28,980
especially now that they've got these multiple versions of it

1991
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,180
because I've been playing a whole crap ton

1992
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,460
of Bejeweled 3 lately,

1993
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:36,060
which is just Bejeweled on iOS right now.

1994
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:39,500
Like the butterfly mode I'm addicted to, diamond.

1995
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,700
There's actually a mode called Diamond Mine

1996
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:46,100
that's like groundbreaking using the gems and everything.

1997
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,180
It's pretty interesting.

1998
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,180
But basically you just have to swap one gem

1999
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:52,180
with one adjacent to form a horizontal

2000
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:54,700
or vertical chain of three or more.

2001
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,820
And then you can cause chain reactions,

2002
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:59,060
basically where they will cascade effect

2003
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:02,780
and break many more and you get more points and stuff.

2004
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:05,740
So you've got in the original, there were two versions.

2005
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:09,340
There was normal where every match would fill a bar

2006
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,580
and then a level would be complete.

2007
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:13,540
And that's classic mode in some of the newer versions.

2008
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:16,700
When you were out of moves, it was game over.

2009
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,380
Matching four or five or six

2010
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,740
was just still a regular thing.

2011
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:24,820
You didn't get the special gems until Bejeweled 2 forward.

2012
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:27,740
There was time trial where the bar would start

2013
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:29,060
halfway through the middle

2014
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:31,100
and the level would complete when the bar is full

2015
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,220
and over time the bar would decrease.

2016
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:35,180
So basically you're fighting the bar

2017
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,660
to see how well you're gonna do.

2018
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,780
And that's really it.

2019
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:42,140
You know, you can actually still visit

2020
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:46,940
the original Bejeweled Flash version and play it online.

2021
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:47,820
So.

2022
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:51,820
I used to play the crap out of Bejeweled on MSN zone.

2023
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,660
How old is that?

2024
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:58,060
Let's see, 2001, you know,

2025
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:02,420
I had barely been living out here only two years.

2026
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:04,660
Been out here for like two or three years.

2027
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:07,540
About two years, so yeah.

2028
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,500
I'm just gonna go ahead and put a caveat out there.

2029
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,260
Bejeweled is not in the vault.

2030
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:14,620
Bejeweled will never be in the vault.

2031
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:15,460
Bejeweled is not a game.

2032
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,460
It technically is, because I have a box for Bejeweled 2.

2033
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,380
Technically we don't have a vault.

2034
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:23,340
By the way, the vault's been disassembled for years.

2035
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,900
But it lives on in-

2036
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:26,740
In my mind.

2037
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,740
Yes, exactly.

2038
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:29,580
All right, there it is, a classic game of the week.

2039
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:30,620
It's very small.

2040
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:32,580
But jeweled.

2041
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:34,700
And some folks in chat asking like,

2042
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,860
what up G says, how old is considered classic?

2043
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:40,020
And the rule here at OLR is 10 or more years old.

2044
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:41,420
Which is, that's a decade old.

2045
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:43,900
And yep, 13 years for Bejeweled, so.

2046
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,060
I think classic should be pre-2000.

2047
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,860
Well, what's funny is that when we changed the rule

2048
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:53,100
to be 10 or more years, it was about 2001, 2002

2049
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,860
for how far back we were going.

2050
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:56,460
So it's just like, we're still moving forward.

2051
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:59,500
Not that I would say that Bejeweled is not a classic game.

2052
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,260
I mean, it's been played by 11 gajillion people.

2053
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,100
Right.

2054
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,260
Just, you know, because there's no-

2055
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,340
You're just pissed it wasn't a Genesis game.

2056
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,300
Oh, fuck you.

2057
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:12,180
You know, you know there's a homebrew of Bejeweled

2058
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,260
on the Genesis.

2059
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,940
You know it exists.

2060
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,740
And Bobby still keeps wanting me to do Halo

2061
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:18,340
for classic game and I'm not gonna.

2062
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:19,180
All right.

2063
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,020
Ooh.

2064
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,820
We, part of the reason we changed the rules

2065
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:25,860
so that we could throw in Dreamcast games and-

2066
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:26,700
Yes.

2067
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:27,540
And GameCube.

2068
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,360
Yes.

2069
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:29,200
All right.

2070
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,540
Dreamcast shit came out in 99.

2071
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,380
Right.

2072
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:32,220
Right.

2073
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,620
But some of the other games I've covered

2074
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:36,180
have been out in the 2000s.

2075
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:38,100
Maybe classic is everything older

2076
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,180
than the current generation.

2077
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:40,020
Maybe classic is-

2078
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:44,020
Maybe classic is two generations old.

2079
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:44,860
All right.

2080
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:45,680
Well, anyway.

2081
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,520
So it can't be PS2, but it can be PS1.

2082
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,580
When you come to the show regularly you'll have-

2083
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:51,260
I guess it could be PS2, but it can't be PS3.

2084
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:52,100
Dan, let it go.

2085
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:52,920
All right.

2086
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,760
Moving on.

2087
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,580
Right, Dan, you're right.

2088
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,420
Well, no, you asked.

2089
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,900
Somebody asked and I was answering the fucking question.

2090
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,720
You're screwing up your own show.

2091
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:01,820
How dare you?

2092
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:03,860
Every gamer gets a voice.

2093
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:05,700
Well, I was answering the question.

2094
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:06,900
I was answering the question.

2095
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:09,020
Besides you guys' wishy washy.

2096
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:10,340
Besides you guys' wishy washy.

2097
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:12,060
Oh, maybe 10 years.

2098
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,020
Maybe as old as Jamie says it is.

2099
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:15,760
All right.

2100
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,540
Look, we're going to take a break.

2101
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:18,940
Calm down a little bit here.

2102
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,660
We'll be back with more of Orange Lawn's Radio

2103
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,100
after a quick break here.

2104
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,140
Your emails, Frugal Question of the Week,

2105
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,420
Rapid Fire News, and much more.

2106
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:27,300
We come back with more of Orange Lawn's Radio

2107
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,140
right after this.

2108
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:29,220
And more Sega Genesis.

2109
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:34,220
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live

2110
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:44,860
on this, let's see, it is August the 17th of 2014.

2111
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,260
564 episodes down of Orange Lawn Show.

2112
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:50,340
Actually, this is 564 in progress.

2113
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:54,820
So anyhow, over there, I noticed in the corner,

2114
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:57,680
Loki is showing Dan Goat Simulator for the first time.

2115
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,700
Is that what's happening over there?

2116
01:32:59,140 --> 01:32:59,980
Because I hear Dan going over there.

2117
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,140
Yeah, showing him Goat Simulator.

2118
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,740
That goat just got so goddamn simulated by that car.

2119
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,320
Good times.

2120
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,160
Good times.

2121
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,060
All right, well, we are going to go over

2122
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:09,020
some rapid fire news.

2123
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:10,620
I hate to break into the Goat Simulator,

2124
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:11,860
but we still have a lot of show to cover,

2125
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,580
and we're running behind tonight a little bit

2126
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,700
thanks to live difficulties.

2127
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:18,140
But I appreciate you guys sticking with us here live.

2128
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,780
Again, we do tape live at The Voice of the East Network,

2129
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:23,100
vognetwork.com, Sunday nights at six Pacific, nine Eastern.

2130
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,860
Usually there's not so many fricking drops and stream issues.

2131
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,660
But of course, if you do miss us live,

2132
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:29,900
you can always check out the podcast feed,

2133
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:33,760
which is available on your favorite podcast app.

2134
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,600
Loki.

2135
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,340
Hold on, Goat Simulator's being glitchy like,

2136
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,720
I know, shocking, Goat Simulator glitchy?

2137
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,000
What?

2138
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,540
Had to force quit this thing,

2139
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,460
because it's all main menu.

2140
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:46,340
Nope, main menu.

2141
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:48,340
Nope, main menu.

2142
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,180
Nope.

2143
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:51,920
So anyways, okay.

2144
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:54,260
All right, let's do this.

2145
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:57,060
Okay, so hey, this is pretty cool.

2146
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:59,780
If you're a fan of shmup games,

2147
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:02,220
the creator of Ikaruga has a brand new game

2148
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:05,380
coming to PlayStation 4 called Ubusana,

2149
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:08,980
and that is literally all we know about it.

2150
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:11,460
He apparently talked about it on his blog,

2151
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:13,820
and mentioned that it's gonna be a downloadable title

2152
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:15,300
on PlayStation 4.

2153
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,500
You know where the creator of Ikaruga

2154
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,940
got their start, by the way?

2155
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:19,880
Genesis.

2156
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:21,700
Of course.

2157
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:22,540
Okay.

2158
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:27,200
So that's all we know so far, unfortunately.

2159
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:31,980
And then, during the Microsoft conference,

2160
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:34,420
they actually announced that they're gonna be doing

2161
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:38,520
an exclusive Xbox One bundle with Call of Duty,

2162
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:42,240
and it's gonna have kind of a skin system, skin controller,

2163
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:45,500
a digital download of Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare,

2164
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,480
and a one terabyte hard drive,

2165
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,980
and it's also gonna be $499,

2166
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:53,740
to which I say, why the fuck would I buy that

2167
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:57,420
when I can buy the Sunset Overdrive one for $399,

2168
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:00,060
and hell, if I really wanted to add some additional space,

2169
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,580
it would cost a hell lot less than $100.

2170
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:06,540
But I guess then I would get Call of Duty 2.

2171
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:07,380
Whatever.

2172
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:09,780
But yeah, if you're interested,

2173
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,660
that'll be coming out launch for,

2174
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:14,220
well, it'd be now on the third,

2175
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:16,820
because they're doing that Day Zero edition.

2176
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,060
Whoopty shit.

2177
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:20,780
And then, last but not least,

2178
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:24,820
Meta Knight is confirmed now for the new Smash Bros. game.

2179
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:26,260
Did you say Meta Knight?

2180
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:27,780
Meta Knight.

2181
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:29,860
Okay, because I didn't think they had

2182
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:31,560
much to do with video games.

2183
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,200
You know, it's not part of their lifestyle,

2184
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,740
and they are not the Amish, hello, they're different.

2185
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,700
Yeah, so Meta Knight, he will be coming,

2186
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:44,700
and I wish they just would talk about new characters,

2187
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,380
not old characters coming back, to be honest.

2188
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:49,740
And just do it all at once,

2189
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:53,100
instead of like, one character now,

2190
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:55,060
another character now, another character,

2191
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:56,660
I mean, we're only like,

2192
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:58,940
about six weeks away from the launch, just.

2193
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:02,560
I kinda like when there's some surprises still in the game,

2194
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,940
although I guess in this internet age,

2195
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,560
the surprises never last long, but.

2196
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,380
True, but hopefully there'll be some unlockable characters,

2197
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:12,500
like Rob was last time, I mean, I thought that was cool.

2198
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,780
What's so cool on Melee, when you unlock characters,

2199
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,620
and you have no fucking idea who they were.

2200
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:20,020
You're all like, who the hell is this guy?

2201
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,460
Oh, he's kinda awesome.

2202
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:23,500
Are they ever gonna confirm Ness?

2203
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:24,340
That's the one.

2204
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:26,900
Let's go buy all of the Fire Emblem games.

2205
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,420
It's been in every single game,

2206
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:29,800
I don't think they're gonna take him out.

2207
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:30,640
You never know.

2208
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:31,780
It'd be funny though, like, they have, you know,

2209
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:33,900
they do it like Melee, where they show the, you know,

2210
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:37,180
silhouette, and it's like, your sweetest Ness is like,

2211
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:38,980
haha, fuck you, you ain't getting Ness,

2212
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:41,540
and there's mother is never gonna fucking come

2213
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,340
to this console ever again, so.

2214
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:46,160
All right, well, I have a few stories for you guys here,

2215
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,360
starting off with a game I'm sure y'all are very excited

2216
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:50,920
about, Just Dance 2015, right Dan?

2217
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,240
Big fan of this series, right?

2218
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,640
Not on Sega Genesis.

2219
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:58,160
Just Dance 2015 will be out on the Wii and the Wii U,

2220
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,280
that's right, the original Wii is still there.

2221
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:04,160
Let's see, it's also on, it's on everything, honestly.

2222
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,880
And it has some new songs that were announced

2223
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:07,680
at Gamescom this week, including,

2224
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,080
and I know Dan is a big fan of all these artists,

2225
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:14,320
4x4 by Miley Cyrus, Ain't No Mountain High Enough

2226
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,560
by Marvin Gaye, that's actually kinda cool.

2227
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,640
That's cool.

2228
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,160
Let's see, Macarena by The Girly Team,

2229
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,320
so it's not just the Macarena,

2230
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,760
it's a girly team cover of the Macarena.

2231
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,080
Yeah, it's not by the original couple Macarena guys,

2232
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,840
it just ain't the Macarena.

2233
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,800
You Spin Me Round, like a record by Dead or Alive, which.

2234
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,640
You're damn right.

2235
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:33,220
That song's pretty fucking rad.

2236
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:37,400
And last but not least, Best Song Ever by One Direction,

2237
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:40,720
which I do not actually believe is the best song ever,

2238
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:41,600
that is a lie.

2239
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:46,120
The test revealed, that is a lie.

2240
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:46,960
Moving on.

2241
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,040
Wait, it says something about Shenmue up there.

2242
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:50,120
That's right, because this next thing is about Shenmue.

2243
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,780
Oh my God, that's why Sega.

2244
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:55,280
How about an HD remake of Shenmue?

2245
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:59,180
That's right, an HD remake of Shenmue is happening.

2246
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:03,320
But here's the catch, it's happening by fans.

2247
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,880
It is not actually something that is Sega endorsed,

2248
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:09,440
which makes me question if it will actually happen at all.

2249
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,160
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and put a no on that.

2250
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,600
See how fast this gets shut down.

2251
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,120
But anyway, there's some YouTubes up there.

2252
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,920
The creator, Nkun Kid, is using the original

2253
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:23,400
background modeling that was in Shenmue, but new textures.

2254
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:27,920
And the model for Ryo Hazuki is taken from

2255
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,240
the Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.

2256
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:32,200
So, kinda interesting how they're doing that.

2257
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,440
So if you wanna see more, you can go to YouTube for that

2258
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:39,080
for the fan-made HD Shenmue remake.

2259
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,560
Which in our chat room, we have Fifth Dream saying,

2260
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,720
fuck yes, fuck yes, fuck no, God damn it.

2261
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:47,640
No, that was like awesome for like 20 seconds.

2262
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:49,960
I was like, this is the best day, no.

2263
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:52,520
Yu Suzuki is gonna find that guy and kick him in the head.

2264
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,880
Yu Suzuki, by the way, still has every intention

2265
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,980
of finishing Shenmue, he just needs fat cash.

2266
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,480
Black Wolf in chat says, the fans are going to Sega

2267
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:03,040
saying, hey mister, wanna wrestle?

2268
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,800
And Sega will be like, yes, okay, you're dead.

2269
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:09,560
Fifth Dream in chat says,

2270
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,040
know where I can find a lawsuit around here?

2271
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,240
All right.

2272
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,960
Why doesn't Sega like Kickstarter, Shenmue 3?

2273
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,800
Because if they don't wanna spend...

2274
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,420
When Sega goes to Kickstarter, they're gonna be like,

2275
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,000
you're fucking Sega, you don't eat Kickstarter.

2276
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,400
But they make the money on it.

2277
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,280
Well, cause the problem is that Sega can't afford

2278
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:29,440
to bankroll a game that's gonna cost like $40 million.

2279
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:33,000
Maybe if they stretched out his legs a little longer,

2280
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,960
he might be viable as a character for these new consoles.

2281
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,080
Like if Sega were to launch a Kickstarter like that though,

2282
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,440
I'd be like, seriously?

2283
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,400
Maybe Yu Suzuki should just do it himself.

2284
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:45,360
How about where the fuck is Phantasy Star Online 2

2285
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,680
in the US already?

2286
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:48,040
Oh yeah, well fuck that.

2287
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:48,920
Yeah, fuck that.

2288
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:51,680
All right, well, I guess I could always play this MMO.

2289
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,880
As I mentioned earlier in the show,

2290
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,620
World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor

2291
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:56,080
had its release date revealed,

2292
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:59,640
which is November 13th, 2014 is the day it's coming out.

2293
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,160
And if you're interested in getting the collector's edition,

2294
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:04,040
you can pick that up for,

2295
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:05,600
now the official price hasn't been announced,

2296
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,920
but Amazon and GameStop are showing it at $90,

2297
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,440
which seems to be accurate.

2298
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:10,720
And-

2299
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:13,120
Survey says ding, ding, ding, ding.

2300
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:14,420
This is, I believe,

2301
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:15,540
I don't know about the collector's edition,

2302
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:17,720
but I know the retail was supposed to be $10 more

2303
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,880
than it has been in the past.

2304
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,800
And I'm kind of sitting here going, for what?

2305
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:24,860
But anyhow, some of the things that you can get

2306
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:25,960
in the collector's edition,

2307
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,640
you get the physical DVD version of the expansion.

2308
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,400
Those are collector's items these days.

2309
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,480
A behind the scenes DVD and Blu-ray two disc set

2310
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,680
that gives you some commentary and interviews

2311
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,580
that you'll never watch.

2312
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:39,600
The soundtrack, you get the soundtrack on CD.

2313
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,700
That's pretty cool.

2314
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:42,920
You get an art book for your coffee table

2315
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:45,280
with 160 page art book.

2316
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,560
It's something that you put in the computer

2317
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,000
and then rip to your iTunes

2318
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,280
or whatever your music thing of choice.

2319
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,960
You get a mouse pad because every collector's edition

2320
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,380
has had a stinking mouse pad with it.

2321
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:56,640
This one featuring the Warlord Blackhand.

2322
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,680
And some things you get in the game itself,

2323
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:01,840
a Dread Raven Mount and a Dread Hatchling pet,

2324
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,680
excuse me.

2325
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,280
And you get portraits for Starcraft two,

2326
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,160
Warsong Pennant for Diablo three

2327
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,640
and a card back for Hearthstone

2328
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:11,780
because we love that Blizzard synergy.

2329
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,740
How about give us a good game?

2330
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,840
I, well, it's not that I-

2331
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,960
And it all comes in an oversized box.

2332
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,080
That'll take up a lot of room on your shelf.

2333
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:22,900
That's right.

2334
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:23,740
I don't know.

2335
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:25,280
I don't want to say that World of Warcraft is a bad game

2336
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,240
because I've spent years of my life playing it

2337
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:28,080
and having a good time.

2338
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,640
The right people will always make a game fun, I think.

2339
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:33,800
But it's just one of those things where it's like,

2340
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,680
I just really disagree with the direction

2341
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,860
the game's been going in lately

2342
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:38,540
and the way they've been pacing content,

2343
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:39,760
which is not at all.

2344
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,400
But anyway, I can do a whole nother rant on this

2345
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,260
and I probably will on this week's courthouse.

2346
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:47,760
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

2347
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:50,400
Well, for people who have been paying attention

2348
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:54,960
to Mortal Kombat X, Kano has been teased now.

2349
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,160
There was a trailer acquired by Eurogamer Portugal

2350
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,080
who said that there were three different versions

2351
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,280
of Kano to be seen.

2352
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,640
One is a cutthroat version

2353
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:08,000
that allows him to power up his knife attacks

2354
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,140
with his cybernetic heart.

2355
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:12,820
Then there's a full cybernetic version

2356
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,360
that gives him a bunch of weaponry

2357
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:18,120
and then the commando variation where he becomes a grappler.

2358
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:20,340
So I don't know how I feel about that.

2359
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:21,520
There's also a jungle stage

2360
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,480
because every Mortal Kombat has a stage with trees.

2361
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:25,920
They're probably evil.

2362
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:32,120
And then there is going to be a Super Smash Brothers,

2363
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:35,640
a 3DS bundle that will be out October 3rd.

2364
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,160
It is red with all the characters on the cover

2365
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:42,240
and black and white or very, very grayscale,

2366
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,960
you know, pick renditions of the characters

2367
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:49,320
over a red background with red and black lettering.

2368
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:52,840
And it's a limited edition as they all are.

2369
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:57,520
And it comes with it installed on a 3DS XL

2370
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:02,160
so that you won't actually have a physical copy of it at all.

2371
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:06,720
Also, last but not least,

2372
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,760
Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain

2373
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,360
and Ground Zeroes are coming to Steam.

2374
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,680
So, good.

2375
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,240
Oh, nice.

2376
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,240
That's kind of cool.

2377
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,360
We get to play the Phantom trailer.

2378
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:22,720
Nice.

2379
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,800
All right, let's do the FUGL question of the week.

2380
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:26,640
Every week here on the show,

2381
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,080
you take Facebook and Google Plus

2382
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,160
and slam them together and you get FUGL.

2383
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:40,240
This week, our question had to do with demos,

2384
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:41,960
since I know PT was on our minds,

2385
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,160
which we talked about earlier in the show.

2386
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,760
So we asked our communities,

2387
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,040
when was the last time you got really hyped for a game demo?

2388
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,520
Did you ever buy something else just to get a demo

2389
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,240
of a game you were really looking forward to?

2390
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:57,440
So let's start on Facebook tonight with Tech 2030,

2391
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,040
who says, back in 07,

2392
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,840
I bought Crackdown just to play the Halo 3 beta

2393
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,960
and I ended up liking Crackdown better than Halo 3.

2394
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,040
I don't think you were the only one in that case.

2395
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,000
Alan Alchemy said, let's get this one out of the way.

2396
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
The Omega hyped Final Fantasy 7 demo

2397
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,640
that came with Square Fighter Tow Ball number one.

2398
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:16,480
Yes.

2399
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,640
And yes, I did buy it for that reason.

2400
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:20,760
Though, to be fair, Tow Ball number one and Einhander

2401
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,840
are the two top abandoned Square franchises

2402
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:23,680
I'd wish to come back to.

2403
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:24,920
Aw, Einhander.

2404
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,440
Tow Ball number two wasn't that bad.

2405
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:27,760
They came with a demo as well.

2406
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,960
I thought the Tow Ball games were actually really cool.

2407
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:35,800
DJ Rama S kind of chimed in there with a nice hearty yass

2408
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:37,720
to agree with that comment saying,

2409
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:39,040
I bought Tow Ball number one

2410
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,680
just to get the Final Fantasy 7 demo.

2411
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:41,880
Worth it.

2412
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:43,200
DarkTetsuya said three

2413
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,000
for the Tow Ball and Final Fantasy 7 demo.

2414
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,280
Also want to add the official PlayStation magazine's

2415
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,440
Metal Gear Solid 1 demo blew my mind back in 1998.

2416
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,720
Ah, he stole my answer.

2417
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:55,400
That was, I remember when that was PlayStation magazine.

2418
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,840
That demo blew my fucking mind when I was younger.

2419
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,720
What about Zone of the Enders?

2420
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:01,720
I don't remember that playing that demo.

2421
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,560
That came with the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo.

2422
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,720
Do you remember what the demo

2423
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,920
that came with Final Fantasy 7 was?

2424
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,360
That came with Final Fantasy 7?

2425
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,200
No demo came with Final Fantasy 7.

2426
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,840
There was Musashi Den.

2427
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:11,680
No.

2428
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,520
Didn't it come with?

2429
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:13,360
That had the demo for eight.

2430
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:16,360
That was it, that was the reverse.

2431
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,520
It was already like three or four discs.

2432
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,280
Where were they going to put the demo?

2433
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,280
Up your butt.

2434
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,120
Robert K. said-

2435
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:24,280
I don't think that would have had the proper effect.

2436
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:25,800
Robert K. starts his answer with,

2437
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,880
after being a staunch Sega fan boy,

2438
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,800
does he have your attention, Dan?

2439
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,680
The Tomb Raider 2 demo that came with PlayStation magazine

2440
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:36,120
made me buy a PlayStation just to play it.

2441
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:37,400
Yeah, see, see what happened?

2442
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,240
See what happened?

2443
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,480
Sony stole that shit.

2444
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,400
Bonus Sega answer,

2445
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,680
reserving a copy of the Sega magazine

2446
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,880
just for Christmas nights.

2447
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:46,680
I miss magazine demos.

2448
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:49,080
Christmas nights came with like every magazine too.

2449
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,280
I think I probably had like three copies.

2450
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,120
Although-

2451
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:52,960
We only got one left.

2452
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,160
Keep in mind, Robert K.'s overseas.

2453
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,480
Robert K., you the man.

2454
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,760
We have a Japanese one too.

2455
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,840
Overseas, they appreciate Sega.

2456
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,840
In Europe, they fucking love Sega.

2457
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:02,680
They love it.

2458
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:04,520
Nintendo was an afterthought in Europe.

2459
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,720
You know what else they love in Europe?

2460
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:07,040
Commodore 64.

2461
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,880
Commodore 64 is really neato.

2462
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,400
You know what else they love in Europe?

2463
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:12,240
What?

2464
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:13,200
Marmite.

2465
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,160
No, no, no.

2466
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,240
That's in Australia.

2467
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,080
Moving on.

2468
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:16,920
That's Vegemite.

2469
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:17,760
You think Vegemite.

2470
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:18,600
All right.

2471
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,000
Fuck you.

2472
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,720
Degenerate Johnny says,

2473
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,840
back in the mid-90s, I subscribed to PC Gamer,

2474
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,040
which came with PC demos almost every issue.

2475
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:27,400
Although some demos were quite good,

2476
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,240
none of them excited me

2477
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:31,000
more than the Aliens vs. Predator PC demo.

2478
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,600
As the player, you were offered the option

2479
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,480
to play through the demo

2480
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,480
as either the Marine, Alien, or Predator.

2481
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:36,560
It came out during the time

2482
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,640
in which AVP hype was at its highest.

2483
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,520
To this day, the demo and the game

2484
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:43,480
rank quite high amongst my favorite FPSs.

2485
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,440
Andy R said,

2486
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,880
I bought the Dragon Quest game

2487
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:48,320
that came with the Final Fantasy 12 demo on it.

2488
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,240
It was eight, wasn't it?

2489
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:50,080
It came with the 12 demo.

2490
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:50,920
I think it was.

2491
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,400
Now, Alan decided to throw in two more answers here.

2492
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,640
He's hogging the segment tonight,

2493
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,480
but I will mention this

2494
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,320
because he says,

2495
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,320
Brave Fencer Musashi for Final Fantasy 8.

2496
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,520
So that was the other one there.

2497
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,040
So, and Jason, our buddy VXJ6V,

2498
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:07,880
replied to that with a little up arrow saying,

2499
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,160
yep, Final Fantasy 8.

2500
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,600
I also remember being hyped

2501
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:11,920
to play the Final Fantasy 8 demo,

2502
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,840
though not owning a PlayStation at the time

2503
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,680
meant I had to play it at a friend's house.

2504
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,640
The Halo 3 demo included with Crackdown

2505
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:18,960
is the only other one that comes to mind.

2506
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:22,360
Plus, Crackdown was an amazing game on its own.

2507
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:24,200
Let's check out some of the answers from Google Plus,

2508
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,120
because believe it or not,

2509
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:25,960
there's people on Google Plus.

2510
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:26,880
Actually, we have quite a few answers

2511
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,680
on Google Plus tonight.

2512
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:30,880
Now, as part of the article,

2513
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,600
I linked my YouTube,

2514
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,760
where I did my playthrough of the PT demo,

2515
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,240
which also got some response,

2516
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,720
as Renee from Google Plus,

2517
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,240
Renee Y.

2518
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,080
We love her.

2519
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,120
DNL from the DDR Freak days, if I remember right.

2520
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:43,960
Renee said,

2521
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,720
loved watching Sky get scared witless during the stream.

2522
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:49,240
I haven't been so hyped since Silent Hill 3, honestly,

2523
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,520
but did anyone else feel like PT was a scarier

2524
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,560
but less thought out Stanley parable?

2525
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:55,120
Like some puzzles were too hard

2526
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:56,980
while others were really obvious.

2527
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:00,480
ActDeft replied and said,

2528
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,800
I remember buying the official PlayStation magazine

2529
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,600
just to get a demo disc with the DDR Max 1 US demo.

2530
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,480
I played that demo disc a lot.

2531
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:09,320
Curiously enough,

2532
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:11,400
the featured game in the demo disc was Sly Cooper,

2533
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,840
which I didn't know about back then.

2534
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,000
And when I played it,

2535
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,200
got really hyped for the game

2536
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:17,840
and a bit of a fan of the series since.

2537
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,320
Flaco Jones replies,

2538
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:22,060
my mind goes to the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo

2539
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:23,680
that was bundled in with Zone of the Enders

2540
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,520
on PlayStation 2.

2541
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:25,360
You're damn right.

2542
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,060
It was fantastic and better yet,

2543
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,080
it was based on the Japanese version,

2544
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,600
which ended up being a little racier

2545
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,640
and more fun than the eventual opening level

2546
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,320
in the finalized American version.

2547
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,720
We drove all the way down to San Francisco

2548
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,660
to buy the import of Zone of the Enders

2549
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,920
so we can get the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo.

2550
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,920
That's pretty hot.

2551
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,920
Redertainment says,

2552
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,240
the only time I've bought a game

2553
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:47,400
to get a demo for another game

2554
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,740
is when I bought Dragon Quest 8

2555
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:50,640
to get the demo for Final Fantasy 12.

2556
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,480
This is the only time I've done something like this,

2557
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,320
including things like seeing movies to see a trailer,

2558
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:58,000
watching a TV show to see something for another show,

2559
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,640
or paying for a concert to see an opening act.

2560
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:01,760
Last but not least,

2561
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:04,080
I think this is Brozime,

2562
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,800
but it could be Brozime,

2563
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,660
but I'm gonna guess Brozime replies and says,

2564
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:11,260
I've never purposely bought a game for a demo,

2565
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:13,120
but I do remember being quite happy

2566
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:15,440
when I was told by a friend my copy of Crackdown

2567
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:16,960
had the Halo 3 demo with it.

2568
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,680
So it seems like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing

2569
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,280
seems to be the most popular answer.

2570
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:24,000
Anybody in studio, open forum on this answer,

2571
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,760
especially if you can think of one that hasn't been named yet

2572
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,800
demo and game combo.

2573
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,320
There was one that,

2574
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:33,620
a demo that got me excited for the game,

2575
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:36,460
even though I didn't go out of my way to get the demo.

2576
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:38,560
And that was for Jumping Flash,

2577
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,420
right when the PlayStation was new.

2578
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:44,460
And I just remember playing that one level of Jumping Flash

2579
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:47,460
on the demo over and over and over and over.

2580
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:50,380
And then I actually went on purpose and got,

2581
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:53,220
I paid like a buck because I could,

2582
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:56,340
to get the demo version for Um Jammer Lamy.

2583
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:57,180
Before.

2584
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:58,180
Oh yeah, that's an awesome demo.

2585
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:00,300
Cause it's got a lot of like weird content on it.

2586
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:02,220
Yeah, and it basically has all of the music

2587
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:03,060
in the game on it.

2588
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:04,580
And it's just sort of locked out.

2589
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:05,740
So it's weird.

2590
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:07,180
So I ripped all the music from the game.

2591
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:11,140
Well didn't it have like the change stuff

2592
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:12,820
from when she dies?

2593
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:15,700
Yeah, it had like the rap about being in hell

2594
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:18,940
and everything for the Chop Chop Master Onion.

2595
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:20,260
The Zoe,

2596
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:22,980
the Zoe Metal Gear Solid 2 demo is the ultimate expression.

2597
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:25,340
I did do the Tobaal number one

2598
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:27,580
and Final Fantasy 7 thing too.

2599
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:29,580
I mean, I bought both of those games for retail release

2600
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:31,380
because of the demo discs they came with.

2601
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:33,180
Both decent games.

2602
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:34,020
Zoe.

2603
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:37,740
Oh, what was, what game came with the,

2604
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:39,700
the first Devil May Cry demo disc?

2605
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:41,020
That was a really good one too.

2606
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,500
Oh hell, I don't remember.

2607
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:45,700
But yeah, the one where it's all like strange and ironic

2608
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:47,620
that it should end the same way.

2609
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:49,540
Oh man, that was such a good demo.

2610
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:50,740
Loki, anything?

2611
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,460
I do have one that hasn't been mentioned yet.

2612
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:57,340
I imported the Japanese Blu-ray for Advent Children

2613
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:58,580
for Final Fantasy 13.

2614
01:50:58,580 --> 01:50:59,420
I remember that.

2615
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:00,260
I remember that.

2616
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:01,900
That was a good one.

2617
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:03,540
This might be a little bit outside the scope

2618
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:05,300
but since my Metal Gear Solid answer got taken,

2619
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:06,300
I have to go this direction.

2620
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:08,060
But I remember it wasn't so much necessarily

2621
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:09,940
about buying a game to get the demo,

2622
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:12,660
but I remember calling into the BBS

2623
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:17,340
and sitting there watching my modem download for an hour

2624
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,820
so I could play the Wolfenstein 3D demo.

2625
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:21,220
Fuck yeah, nice.

2626
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,380
Episode one.

2627
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:23,780
And then what was after that?

2628
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:25,740
Like there was, you used to get the episode one stuff

2629
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:27,380
all the time, it was Commander Keen,

2630
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:29,100
but there were some huge ones like Doom.

2631
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:31,780
The original Doom had like the first couple levels

2632
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:32,620
were playable in Doom.

2633
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:36,140
Yeah, I always have the fucking config sys

2634
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:39,060
and my goddamn auto zet bat.

2635
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:41,380
The right memory allocated in the right spot.

2636
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:42,820
Yeah, so even though it wasn't necessarily

2637
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:44,020
buying a game to get another game,

2638
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:46,380
you still had to invest something just to play the demo

2639
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:47,220
just to get a taste.

2640
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:48,900
Yeah, it was the distribution.

2641
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:52,220
It was like that 3D Realms Apogee distribution method.

2642
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:53,060
Exactly.

2643
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:53,880
Hey, it worked.

2644
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,380
Everybody had the first couple levels of Doom.

2645
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:56,220
It was awesome though,

2646
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:59,420
when PC gamers start putting full games in there.

2647
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:01,220
So they have like total annihilation

2648
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:03,300
was one of the ones that they had in there at one time.

2649
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,600
And it's just, I always love just like,

2650
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,980
I just buy a PC gamer all the time

2651
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:09,220
just for whatever free shit they had on their disc.

2652
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,780
I remember when magazine started giving,

2653
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:13,920
like there was a weird thing with Sega specifically

2654
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,920
where they gave away disc one of Shining Force 3

2655
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,220
and it's like a four disc game.

2656
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:21,900
They just threw the first disc in the,

2657
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:23,220
and like with the magazine.

2658
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:24,040
Wow.

2659
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:25,440
So that you would have that first,

2660
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,700
like third or quarter of the game.

2661
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:28,540
Wow.

2662
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:29,360
And then want to invest in it.

2663
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:31,320
I think they did the same for Panzer Saga,

2664
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,520
Panzer Dragoon Saga,

2665
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,120
which is amazing because the game's got a production run

2666
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:37,520
of like seven units.

2667
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,620
Right.

2668
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:39,680
But not the first disc,

2669
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,240
cause there's plenty more out there.

2670
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:42,680
There's at least 12 more.

2671
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,560
Good answers tonight.

2672
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,720
Good answers tonight you guys.

2673
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,540
Thanks for participating.

2674
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,160
If you want to answer a future FUGL question,

2675
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:49,880
they go up on Sunday morning afternoon-ish.

We should bring back Jumping Flash.

2681
01:52:59,260 --> 01:53:00,300
Props by the way,

2682
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:01,700
to the Google Plusters this week.

2683
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:04,980
You guys, there was quite a few of you this week.

2684
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:06,200
You're showing the Google Plus love.

2685
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:07,260
All right.

2686
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,180
Let's move on with some more stories.

2687
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:10,020
We have a few.

2688
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:10,980
There's actually one last thing.

2689
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:11,820
Yeah.

2690
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:12,820
SSJ100 Matt says,

2691
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,820
I'd subscribe to the Dreamcast magazine

2692
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,660
just for their demo discs.

2693
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:17,780
So did.

2694
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:20,620
I mean the CD era really ushered in those demo,

2695
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:21,460
cause I mean,

2696
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:22,980
it's not like you were going to have demo cartridges.

2697
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:24,260
I mean.

2698
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:25,100
Well, you know,

2699
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:26,300
there was one month in the place,

2700
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,580
the official PlayStation magazine,

2701
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:29,460
where there was like one demo disc

2702
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:33,780
that had the warehouse level of Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

2703
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:36,220
I think it had a track on Gran Turismo.

2704
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:37,060
It had that Metal Trip demo.

2705
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,340
I remember that one.

2706
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:42,000
And that demo disc had so much gameplay in it.

2707
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,300
Like I probably played that disc

2708
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:47,620
more than I played any retail release for years.

2709
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:48,540
I played the demo,

2710
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:49,760
it was for Cool Borders.

2711
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,260
I think the very first Cool Borders,

2712
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:52,820
I played that demo like,

2713
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:54,340
I don't even know how many times.

2714
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:55,180
It would be just after school,

2715
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:57,340
just be playing that damn thing over and over,

2716
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:58,660
the same level over and over.

2717
01:53:58,660 --> 01:53:59,860
Oh yeah, and you could master it.

2718
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:01,380
I mean, because there was so much you could do.

2719
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:04,340
I remember the demo for Spy Hunter for PS2.

2720
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:05,780
I could beat the first level.

2721
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:08,100
I could beat every single possibility on it.

2722
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,980
But there was like just a couple of those demos

2723
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:12,340
from that glory time of the PlayStation one,

2724
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:13,560
where it's like,

2725
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:17,260
that demo disc had three or four AAA hall of fame games

2726
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:18,100
on it.

2727
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:20,940
And you could play those levels for hours.

2728
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:22,020
Yeah, it was awesome.

2729
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:25,420
If you were broke and bored, which it was.

2730
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:26,260
All right.

2731
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,100
So,

2732
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:28,300
Not on Sega, but still good.

2733
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:31,580
Kickstarter, you see a lot of, you know,

2734
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:34,180
games being backed and funded on their wall.

2735
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:35,540
Not Shenmue.

2736
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:38,260
Well, not Shenmue, but the,

2737
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:40,820
I guess the original creators of Night Trap

2738
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:45,820
are trying to bring out an HD remake of the game,

2739
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:49,780
or not remake, but HD remaster of the game.

2740
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:51,700
And they're seeking, what was it?

2741
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:55,980
$330,000 or some arbitrary amount.

2742
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:57,620
Yeah, $330,000.

2743
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:58,860
Ridiculously too low.

2744
01:54:58,860 --> 01:54:59,700
I mean,

2745
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:00,520
Exactly.

2746
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,540
Oh man, this is hilarious.

2747
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:06,780
So they want $330,000 and they're seeing,

2748
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:09,540
I mean, they're promising the world here.

2749
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:11,860
They're saying that they're going to actually print discs

2750
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:13,980
and they're going to put them out in cardboard sleeves

2751
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:15,620
and, you know, for game consoles,

2752
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:17,460
which I don't even know if the game publishers

2753
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:18,420
will let them,

2754
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:20,540
like the manufacturers will let them do that.

2755
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:21,380
Here's the thing.

2756
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:25,980
It's not a high def version of Night Trap.

2757
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:28,060
They're basically saying that they want to

2758
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:30,180
re-shoot the movie.

2759
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:31,020
I don't think they're re-shooting.

2760
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:34,060
They're taking the 35 millimeter footage.

2761
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:36,980
Apparently they say it's like 4K or even like,

2762
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:37,820
they can re-

2763
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:39,600
Oh, so they're just going to reuse.

2764
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,700
Yeah, they're going to reuse the footage

2765
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:42,540
because apparently the footage that was in,

2766
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:44,700
the footage that they shot was at a much,

2767
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:47,340
much higher quality than was actually available

2768
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,700
to be displayed in the game.

2769
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:50,380
I mean, if it's 35 millimeter, it's good,

2770
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:53,780
but my understanding was they wanted to re-shoot the game,

2771
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:54,660
rebuild the game,

2772
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:57,660
rebuild a game engine and publish it for consoles.

2773
01:55:57,660 --> 01:55:59,900
And they wanted to do this for 300K.

2774
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:02,980
And then they still needed to buy the rights

2775
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:04,940
to use the Night Trap franchise.

2776
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:06,820
No, they already bought the rights.

2777
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:09,020
They spent a quarter million dollars on that.

2778
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:13,700
So that $300,000, 250,000 of it is repaying them back.

2779
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:16,800
Yeah, see that's why, okay, that's right.

2780
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:17,640
So that's what I was saying is that

2781
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:18,740
that is scammy as hell.

2782
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:21,580
Because you know, they paid like 16 bucks for those rights

2783
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:24,500
and managed to somehow get a $200,000 receipt.

2784
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,940
With all due respect,

2785
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:28,300
as I realized the original creators of Night Trap

2786
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:29,120
are involved with this Kickstarter.

2787
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:32,980
Which was by the way, Rob, on Genesis.

2788
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:33,900
Yeah, yes.

2789
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:35,280
But with all due respect,

2790
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:39,060
I have no interest in seeing this Kickstarter succeed.

2791
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,380
And I don't actually think it's a good thing at all

2792
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:44,140
because let's be real and having come off just,

2793
01:56:44,140 --> 01:56:46,800
taking your wife out on a quote unquote friend date

2794
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:50,440
to see Showgirls at the movie theater.

2795
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:53,840
Night Trap is kind of the Showgirls of the video game world.

2796
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,240
It is, it's definitely.

2797
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:56,800
It's something that's so bad.

2798
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,200
It's kind of good,

2799
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:02,880
but that means you leave it in its original badness.

2800
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,320
It doesn't need to be redone.

2801
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,480
It's gonna lose something.

2802
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:06,520
Let's stop for a second.

2803
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:09,440
Has anyone in this room ever actually sat down,

2804
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:12,540
owned and or played Night Trap besides me?

2805
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:14,440
Not owned, but a friend of mine had it.

2806
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:15,720
So I played it at my friend's house.

2807
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:17,080
I mean, have you seriously sat down

2808
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:20,400
to try to play Night Trap with any degree of proficiency?

2809
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,560
I don't know on what scale of, but I mean, yeah,

2810
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,400
we sat down and tried to play a little bit.

2811
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,320
Did you try to beat Night Trap?

2812
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,840
Night Trap is kind of a cool game.

2813
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,600
The idea behind Night Trap is that literally

2814
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,600
you're monitoring the house and you're triggering traps

2815
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,400
to take out monsters before they kill people.

2816
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:36,000
It's a great idea.

2817
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,520
It was definitely ahead of its time.

2818
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:42,780
And it wasn't going to be good

2819
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:47,780
because it was shot as a super, super B movie,

2820
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:51,600
starring a B movie actress who killed herself

2821
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,720
and a bunch of B movie actors and actresses.

2822
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:58,720
But Night Trap isn't a bad game for what it is,

2823
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:00,900
which is a bad game.

2824
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:01,740
Exactly.

2825
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:03,420
But the thing with this is it's not even about

2826
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:05,780
the quality of Night Trap or not because I would love

2827
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:10,780
somehow to see Night Trap released as a DLC

2828
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:14,700
or as a downloadable game, even put on a disc,

2829
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:17,720
maybe even as a budget title, maybe even as a full release,

2830
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:20,660
but, and maybe even reshot, but these guys aren't doing it.

2831
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:23,880
These guys are trying to get people to give them money

2832
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,260
and they have absolutely no,

2833
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:27,100
like they bought the Night Trap rights and they're like,

2834
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,620
how the fuck do we get some money back out of this?

2835
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:31,760
Oh, well, yeah, we'll make a game.

2836
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:33,580
Yeah, we'll make a game out of it.

2837
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:35,520
And we're going to charge you for the rights.

2838
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,620
And I just, if somebody paid $250,000 for the rights

2839
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:41,020
of Night Trap, man, they ought to be kicked in the balls

2840
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:42,060
until they explode.

2841
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:46,980
I mean, I'm sure it's the guy from Digital Pictures

2842
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:49,540
who is just, you know, his glory days.

2843
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:50,500
It was a bunch of old people.

2844
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,340
Like I seriously don't know who these guys are.

2845
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:54,180
His glory days are 30 years behind them.

2846
01:58:54,180 --> 01:58:56,260
I don't even know if they have like any programmers

2847
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:57,900
or anything, it's just a bunch of like these.

2848
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:00,180
Yeah, no, it's just, it is.

2849
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:01,540
Let me get to some comments from our chat room

2850
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:02,820
over at live.vognetwork.com.

2851
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:04,660
Ragenator says, the closest thing to Night Trap

2852
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:06,780
that I've played was Wing Commander 3 and 4.

2853
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:08,220
The only thing those games have in common

2854
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:11,180
is it's part of the full motion video PC craze

2855
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:13,980
and CD system craze at the time.

2856
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,380
There's really otherwise not a lot of similarities

2857
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:17,200
I can think of.

2858
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,340
Wing Commander 3 had kind of an awesome flight game

2859
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:21,340
to go with the cheesy CGI.

2860
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:24,180
SSJ100Matt says, I beat Night Trap at a party

2861
01:59:24,180 --> 01:59:26,100
a few years ago with friends, eventually.

2862
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:27,920
I never owned it because my parents caught wind

2863
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:30,940
of the original scandal and wouldn't let me get it.

2864
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:33,280
Tigerclaw says, double switch was the closest

2865
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,820
to Night Trap actually.

2866
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:36,700
So there's some comments from our chat room over at live.

2867
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:39,620
Double switch, that game's also insanely awesomely bad.

2868
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:40,980
I had so many of those Sega C,

2869
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:42,200
I mean, I probably still have a bunch of them,

2870
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:45,700
but I had Night Trap, I had Tomcat Alley,

2871
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,380
I had double switch.

2872
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:50,500
You know, I loved the FMV games for what they were.

2873
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:51,340
I didn't walk into it going,

2874
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:53,460
this is gonna be the next generation in gaming.

2875
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:54,560
It was just something different.

2876
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:56,620
Sewer Shark, you know.

2877
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:57,980
I remember Sewer Shark.

2878
01:59:57,980 --> 01:59:59,740
Welcome to the sewers, punk.

2879
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:03,820
I can still do that entire opening monologue from that game.

2880
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:05,160
Well, maybe not, but I could.

2881
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,000
I'd walk around Taco Bell doing it

2882
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,560
and all my coworkers would just be like, fucking Dan.

2883
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,320
All right, let me move on.

2884
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:14,840
I want to talk quickly about a new BioWare game,

2885
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,080
which should have Jamie's ears perking up a little bit,

2886
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:19,160
except this has nothing to do with Mass Effect or Dragon Age.

2887
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:20,000
Sorry.

2888
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,160
I heard the Mass Effect guy.

2889
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:21,980
Yes he did.

2890
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:23,720
He was like, fuck you.

2891
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:25,240
That was last week's news, Dan.

2892
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:26,080
Yeah.

2893
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:27,800
I just wanted to say it

2894
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,040
because I know my wife loves Mass Effect

2895
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,000
and this probably fucks up her good time.

2896
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,480
Ah, take that.

2897
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,680
I'd probably think he contributed to the-

2898
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:35,120
Mass Effect can eat me.

2899
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:36,840
It's not on Sega Genesis.

2900
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:37,840
Watch your volume, Dan.

2901
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:38,680
All right.

2902
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:42,120
Shadow Realms is the name of the game from BioWare.

2903
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:44,160
It is a 4v1 game.

2904
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:46,120
Another one between Evolve-

2905
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:47,040
Four versus one?

2906
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:50,200
Yeah, between Evolve and the new Fable game

2907
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,680
and what Pac-Man Versus.

2908
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,520
Throwing it way back.

2909
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,440
Pac-Man Versus is incredible.

2910
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:54,920
I know, right?

2911
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:56,220
All of a sudden everybody's like,

2912
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:59,040
I want to make Pac-Man Versus in my franchise.

2913
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:00,380
That's a good idea.

2914
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:03,440
I want to have a fighting game that's 4v1,

2915
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:05,280
but just it's like completely unfair.

2916
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,640
Just like, you know, the one person-

2917
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:08,160
It already is completely unfair.

2918
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,480
It's four versus one.

2919
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:11,060
Pac-Man Versus is an awesome game.

2920
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:12,600
We should hook that up and play.

2921
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:13,440
We should.

2922
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:14,260
Right now.

2923
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:15,100
We should do a Twitch stream of that.

2924
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:15,940
It'd be so much fun.

2925
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:16,760
Fuck yes.

2926
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:17,600
Yes.

2927
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:19,240
I have his Elgato capture card.

2928
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:20,500
I just never use it.

2929
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:21,340
All right.

2930
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,540
Elgato es en fuego.

2931
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:23,640
Moving on, Shadow Realms.

2932
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:27,260
A 4v1 story-driven online action RPG

2933
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:31,680
with dynamic co-op missions in a evolving BioWare world.

2934
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:32,760
There's supposed to be new episodes

2935
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:34,280
that'll be released through this as well.

2936
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:35,800
So it's a new IP for BioWare.

2937
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:39,080
So that's pretty cool that it's a new IP.

2938
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,400
That did come out of Gamescom.

2939
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:45,400
You can register for the alpha at shadowrealms.com slash alpha

2940
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:46,620
and I'm sure a lot of you guys

2941
02:01:46,620 --> 02:01:48,060
are going to be signing up for that.

2942
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:49,720
So pretty cool.

2943
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:50,560
Sounds like it could be,

2944
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:51,800
especially if it's like story-driven.

2945
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:55,240
I'm curious how the 4v1 aspect of that works with that,

2946
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,360
but check it out.

2947
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:58,640
Be cool.

2948
02:01:58,640 --> 02:01:59,480
Dark Sakura.

2949
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,520
Well, we've been keeping up

2950
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:03,080
with the whole net neutrality bullshit

2951
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:04,460
that's been going on.

2952
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:06,620
This one's a really interesting one.

2953
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:11,620
Basically Comcast and Time Warner had $132,000 in donations

2954
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:16,080
for an event that honored the current FCC commissioner

2955
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:20,280
and then pulled it when said commissioner,

2956
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:21,440
Min Young Clyburn,

2957
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,500
basically made a bunch of accusations

2958
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:26,680
against the companies that were trying to become one giant

2959
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:31,540
ISP and buy his vote on the merger.

2960
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:33,600
So pretty much, yeah, that's what they were trying to do

2961
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,920
and they just pretty much made themselves look shittier.

2962
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,580
People from Comcast and Time Warner, by the way,

2963
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:41,000
donating 132,000 to anything,

2964
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,020
that's like their pocket change.

2965
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:49,120
But still the fact that they pulled said pocket change.

2966
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:52,800
And you know, it's Comcast really getting dogged on a lot

2967
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,080
in the news lately with all these people

2968
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,720
recording the customer service calls.

2969
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:58,400
I just saw one today on the front page like Yahoo

2970
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,760
or news.google or something where it was like,

2971
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:02,960
the dude was on hold for three hours

2972
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,920
until the customer service center closed

2973
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:06,720
and he had like the little timer running on his phone

2974
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:07,560
to prove it like just-

2975
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:09,620
It's a giant company of dicks.

2976
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:11,560
Comcast-

2977
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:14,120
To be fair, also the internet service provider

2978
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:16,040
powering our show tonight that keeps dropping.

2979
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,360
They are the best internet service provider

2980
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:19,660
in our part of the world

2981
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:22,920
because we can't get Verizon, Fios and shit like that.

2982
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:26,400
God, like if you have to call Comcast customer service,

2983
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:28,820
they will happily fuck up your account

2984
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:30,120
for months and months and months.

2985
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:31,720
And every month you call up and you're just like,

2986
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:34,240
God damn it, reverse the late charge, it's your fault.

2987
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:36,000
I will kill your faith.

2988
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,440
This is basically though,

2989
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:42,440
what the official Comcast VP of Community Investment said.

2990
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:43,640
We have-

2991
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:44,480
It's a bribe.

2992
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:45,720
You know it, I know it.

2993
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:47,580
Let's just get it out in the open.

2994
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:48,960
We have great respect and admiration

2995
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,000
for FCC Commissioner, Min Young Clyburn,

2996
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,120
and for the Kites Foundation and its work.

2997
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:57,480
We do not want either the Commissioner or Kites

2998
02:03:57,480 --> 02:04:00,560
to fall under a shadow as a result of our support

2999
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:02,440
for the diversity in cable industry,

3000
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:05,040
which is why we are withdrawing our support for the donor.

3001
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:05,880
Pay off.

3002
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:09,200
They just figured out a way to do it under the table.

3003
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,760
I, yeah, well, I'm kind of done, so.

3004
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:16,760
Jamie's just sitting over there going dot, dot, dot.

3005
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:18,480
Can I tell my funny Comcast story here?

3006
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:19,320
Cause this is hilarious.

3007
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:20,160
Fuck yeah.

3008
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:21,760
So, you know, I just moved from the apartment

3009
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,600
to this house not that long ago, right?

3010
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:26,900
So, I had my service moved, my Comcast service,

3011
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:29,000
but I don't know why they did it this way.

3012
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,280
They set up a new account for me completely,

3013
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:34,180
closed it, then did another one.

3014
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:36,120
So I've had like three accounts with Comcast.

3015
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:39,280
I ended up getting a check in the mail from them

3016
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:41,800
for money that I guess somehow was not spent

3017
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:42,820
or like a refund.

3018
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:44,400
And I actually had to call them to be like,

3019
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:45,600
can I cash this check?

3020
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:47,720
Cause like you just moved my service

3021
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:48,560
from one place to another.

3022
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:51,400
Then I got a bill for the device.

3023
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:54,160
No, that was never returned.

3024
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:55,720
The device that they said was never returned

3025
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:57,360
because I moved it from one place to the other.

3026
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:59,080
So I called them and got that worked out.

3027
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:00,040
And finally they figured that out.

3028
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:01,760
I mean, to their credit, they fixed it.

3029
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:05,040
But to this day, I still get mail forwarded

3030
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,000
from my old address.

3031
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,600
That's like, you should sign up for Comcast again.

3032
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:09,920
We miss you and dah, dah, dah.

3033
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,520
And I'm like, you guys, I moved my service.

3034
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,240
It shouldn't be that complicated.

3035
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:18,060
I've got two awesome Comcast stories.

3036
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:18,900
All right, quickly, quickly.

3037
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:20,360
Number one is like yours.

3038
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:21,200
All right.

3039
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:22,920
When we were in the old house

3040
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:25,000
where you guys used to do the show

3041
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,160
and we had terrible service

3042
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:27,120
cause I didn't own my own modem

3043
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:28,720
or deal five or pay the big money.

3044
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,360
Yeah.

3045
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:32,400
When we moved to the house that we're in now,

3046
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:35,560
Comcast fucked up my billing for like six months.

3047
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:37,120
And this is like every month I had to call in.

3048
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:39,360
The other one was just like your second story.

3049
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:41,660
Comcast calls me one day we're living in a house

3050
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:44,260
and some lady in terrible broken English.

3051
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:46,200
And I'm sure she was just doing her best.

3052
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:50,240
Was just like, hello, is Danielle Devrina there?

3053
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:54,200
And I'm like, this is Dan Devrend.

3054
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:56,280
Oh, hello, Mrs. Devrena.

3055
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:59,880
We understand that you don't have Comcast service.

3056
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:03,800
I'm like, my name is Dan Devrend and I do have Comcast.

3057
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:06,440
Okay, thank you.

3058
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:07,920
Click.

3059
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:08,760
Awesome.

3060
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,400
To be fair, and even though I dog on them,

3061
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,320
I did actually call them this week to try to camp.

3062
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:20,160
Well, we got AT&T, AT&T came up to our door

3063
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,120
and they're like, okay, here, we can give you internet

3064
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:27,600
and TV for basically $1 less than you paid right now.

3065
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,420
You didn't say yes, did you?

3066
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:29,260
No, I didn't say yes.

3067
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:30,100
Oh, thank God.

3068
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:33,800
Because their TV package was like their family package.

3069
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,440
So it's all these family channels.

3070
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:37,040
Their internet is so, well, you do have a family.

3071
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:40,420
Their internet is so bad that it'll give you cancer.

3072
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:42,480
Well, it's the fiber internet now

3073
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:43,720
that they have running through.

3074
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:45,560
It's 35.

3075
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:47,260
Remember when someone cooked a fiber optic cable

3076
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:50,080
in our neighborhood, sweetie?

3077
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:52,400
Remember when someone cut the fiber optic cable

3078
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:53,240
in our neighborhood?

3079
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:54,720
Yeah, we got like two months of service out of that.

3080
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,200
I mean, service.

3081
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:57,600
They were trying to stop this show.

3082
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:59,600
But anyways, they crashed into it.

3083
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:01,720
They did offer like, they're all, hey,

3084
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:05,960
we'll give you a TV package and double your internet speed

3085
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:09,560
and give you HBO free for a year for like $4 more.

3086
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:10,960
Tell them you want an iPad.

3087
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:13,120
I don't want an iPad.

3088
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:15,140
It sounds like people will give you a fucking iPad.

3089
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:15,980
Yeah, they will.

3090
02:07:15,980 --> 02:07:16,800
The AT&T TV.

3091
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,980
No, the AT&T, they wanted to give me a,

3092
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:21,820
like it was a Google Nexus tablet or something.

3093
02:07:21,820 --> 02:07:22,940
It'll be an iPad second gen.

3094
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:23,780
Fuck no.

3095
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:24,600
It is an Xbox.

3096
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:25,980
No, no, they give you the mini.

3097
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:27,740
What, you mean the one that's in my hand?

3098
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:30,860
Like an Xbox 360, a 32 inch TV

3099
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:33,540
or like a Google Nexus 3 or something like that.

3100
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:34,380
And I was like, man.

3101
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:36,860
You and I both know that's on your list to upgrade.

3102
02:07:36,860 --> 02:07:39,780
You should give me a Mercedes, yes, it definitely is.

3103
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:41,140
All right.

3104
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:41,980
Nintendo's got some.

3105
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:44,380
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

3106
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:46,660
SSJ100 Matt says, poor Danielle.

3107
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:49,940
I know, I feel real bad for her

3108
02:07:49,940 --> 02:07:52,180
because she apparently does not have Comcast.

3109
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:53,580
And that was back when they had just started

3110
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:56,180
the cable modem and I mean, it was so good.

3111
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:57,900
Like I called Comcast as soon as I found out

3112
02:07:57,900 --> 02:08:00,180
that that exists and was like, can I get that at my house?

3113
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:01,020
And they're like, yes.

3114
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:03,220
And I'm like, come and take my money right now.

3115
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:04,460
Then the guy was going to try to give me

3116
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:06,340
some extra network cards and a supervisor

3117
02:08:06,340 --> 02:08:07,900
because it was like one of his first installs.

3118
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:10,140
Like just cock slapped him.

3119
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:10,960
It was brutal.

3120
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,220
He's like, dude, I just got in trouble

3121
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:13,860
for trying to hook you up with free shit.

3122
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:15,940
I'm like, dude, tell your supervisor he's a dick.

3123
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:17,820
The guy just busted up laughing.

3124
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:19,660
That's when we lived in the hood.

3125
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:20,900
But when we got our cable modem,

3126
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:22,660
that like revolutionized our life.

3127
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:23,500
It was so good.

3128
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:27,380
Because before that, we paid for two phone lines.

3129
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:28,900
We had two AOL accounts.

3130
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:30,980
When OLR first started, it was on DSL.

3131
02:08:30,980 --> 02:08:33,140
Oh man, well, this is pre-OLR.

3132
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:34,460
This is when we still lived like,

3133
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:36,340
this is before we even knew you guys, right?

3134
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:37,180
Probably right around the time we met you guys.

3135
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:39,580
This is when we still were at the tail end of dial-up, right?

3136
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:41,420
I remember the house she lived in.

3137
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:42,820
The first time I ever met you, Dan,

3138
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:44,620
you and your friends were over playing,

3139
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:47,660
having a LAN party, a local area Nintendo party.

3140
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:49,700
And you had like eight TVs hooked up,

3141
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:51,060
all playing The Legend of Zelda.

3142
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:52,260
And you were doing like a speed run.

3143
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:54,620
Oh, I dominated that night too.

3144
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:56,060
It was so good.

3145
02:08:56,060 --> 02:08:58,220
That was where I lived in the hood house.

3146
02:08:58,220 --> 02:09:00,220
Yeah, we lived in the fucking get-to.

3147
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:01,700
You gotta do that again, because I want in.

3148
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:04,020
We should do that like tonight.

3149
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:05,540
I gotta work tomorrow, fool.

3150
02:09:05,540 --> 02:09:07,380
Fuck, Colin.

3151
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:09,740
I'm doing an admin day tomorrow, so y'all can suck it.

3152
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:10,780
How about you suck?

3153
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:11,700
Nevermind.

3154
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:15,220
All right, as much as I love the Comcast Bitch Hour,

3155
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:17,220
we do have more games to discuss, which is just-

3156
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:19,420
Comcast Bitch Radio!

3157
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,420
Loki.

3158
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:23,780
All right, so this is pretty sweet.

3159
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:25,780
No Man's Sky's gonna be a pretty ambitious game.

3160
02:09:25,780 --> 02:09:27,180
And this is one of those stories that like,

3161
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:30,300
hey, let's throw a cool statistic and talk about it.

3162
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:32,580
So here's the statistic.

3163
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:35,220
You would need five billion years

3164
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:38,780
to explore every planet in the game for one second.

3165
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:39,620
So that's how much procedural-

3166
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:41,100
That's probably bullshit.

3167
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:42,940
But if that game is even half as good

3168
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:45,460
as they're trying to say it's gonna be,

3169
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:47,380
it might sell me a PS4.

3170
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:48,220
Yeah.

3171
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:50,340
That sounds fucking cool as shit.

3172
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:52,420
I really do want this game.

3173
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:53,780
It does sound pretty awesome.

3174
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:55,140
And I already own a PS4, so I just-

3175
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:57,940
And my PC's not gonna be good enough to run that.

3176
02:09:57,940 --> 02:09:58,780
You know, I need a PC.

3177
02:09:58,780 --> 02:09:59,620
Is it gonna be on PC?

3178
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:01,260
I thought it was gonna be on PC.

3179
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:02,900
Fuck the PlayStation 4.

3180
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:06,460
Is it cross-play where PS4 people can play with PC people?

3181
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:07,300
I have no idea.

3182
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:08,740
Probably not.

3183
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:09,580
Oh, Final Fantasy XIV doesn't.

3184
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:10,420
It might be.

3185
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:11,500
It might be because it's-

3186
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:13,380
Microsoft's the one that doesn't play that game,

3187
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:14,900
but you know, fuck them if they don't want to.

3188
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:17,340
I think that's more like a square thing.

3189
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:19,060
No, because, no, no, no.

3190
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:19,900
Square's come out and said,

3191
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:22,060
we would put Final Fantasy XIV on the Xbox One,

3192
02:10:22,060 --> 02:10:23,580
but Microsoft won't do the cross-server

3193
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:25,420
and we're not having separate servers for Xbox One.

3194
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:27,660
Right, Square is like, we're having one server.

3195
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:28,780
And Sony's like, yes.

3196
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:30,740
And Microsoft's like, no.

3197
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:31,580
Exactly.

3198
02:10:31,580 --> 02:10:32,420
But I think that was-

3199
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:33,420
But yet they did it for 11.

3200
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:36,420
But I think this No Man's Sky thing is probably more like,

3201
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:38,580
I don't know who's making it.

3202
02:10:38,580 --> 02:10:39,420
Is it Square?

3203
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,260
Fuck, if it's Square,

3204
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:43,580
it's strangely enough, it's actually, it's Hello Games.

3205
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:45,060
They're the ones that did the,

3206
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:47,660
was it that Motorcycle game?

3207
02:10:47,660 --> 02:10:49,500
The Joe Danger game.

3208
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:50,660
Well, their office is flooded

3209
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:51,860
during the production of this, right?

3210
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:53,780
We're all familiar though with like what this is, right?

3211
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:55,100
Like all your listeners are.

3212
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:56,380
It's like an open space game.

3213
02:10:56,380 --> 02:10:57,220
It's awesome.

3214
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:58,180
Yeah, sounds awesome.

3215
02:10:58,180 --> 02:11:00,020
Fucking sweet.

3216
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:00,860
Let's see.

3217
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:01,700
ActDeft in our chat says,

3218
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:04,780
Dan sounds like the guy from Jet Set Radio.

3219
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:05,620
Do you?

3220
02:11:05,620 --> 02:11:08,500
DJ Professor K, Jet Set Radio!

3221
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:10,940
Ow, my ears.

3222
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:12,300
Ow, ow, ow.

3223
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:13,500
All right, a quick follow up

3224
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:15,620
to something we had talked about last week.

3225
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:17,980
This is GameStop announcing

3226
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:19,580
their simplified trade-in pricing.

3227
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:20,420
It is real.

3228
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:22,060
That whole thing did happen.

3229
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:26,740
So GameStop has 100 games worth $20 or more, they say.

3230
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:27,580
So, I mean, I'm assuming that means-

3231
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:29,180
Is that the press release?

3232
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:30,020
Oh, sorry about that.

3233
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:30,840
Yes, it is.

3234
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:31,680
Is the press release through-

3235
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:33,180
From a guy named Jason Cochran?

3236
02:11:35,620 --> 02:11:37,860
Jackie Smith says in contact.

3237
02:11:37,860 --> 02:11:38,700
I read one.

3238
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:40,260
I threw that guy out of my store.

3239
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:43,380
When he was my boss's boss,

3240
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:44,500
he came in and was bitching at me.

3241
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:45,340
I was just like,

3242
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:46,900
if you got nothing better for me,

3243
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:48,620
you just need to go.

3244
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:49,660
And he just turned around and left.

3245
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:50,500
My boss was like,

3246
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:51,740
what the fuck did you just do?

3247
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:53,340
I'm just like, I ain't got time for this.

3248
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:54,740
That is awesome as hell.

3249
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:55,580
You're hardcore.

3250
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:56,400
It was amazing.

3251
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,240
You're hardcore.

3252
02:11:57,240 --> 02:11:58,080
I love it.

3253
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:58,900
All right.

3254
02:11:58,900 --> 02:11:59,740
So yeah, so-

3255
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:01,580
What's that?

3256
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:02,900
I said, hi, Mr. Vrena.

3257
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:03,740
Mr. Vrena.

3258
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:04,560
Oh, Alan just walked in and said,

3259
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:05,400
hi, Mr. Vrena.

3260
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:07,580
All right.

3261
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:09,660
I do have Comcast, damn it.

3262
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:13,300
So yeah, if you sell-

3263
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:14,720
Anyway, you get a little more money

3264
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,940
if you're a Powered Up Rewards pro member

3265
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:18,420
and blah, de blah, de blah.

3266
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:20,300
I still say sell them direct on eBay,

3267
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:22,380
but if you want to take the easy way out,

3268
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:23,220
you can.

3269
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,160
All right.

3270
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:26,000
Let's-

3271
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:26,820
What?

3272
02:12:26,820 --> 02:12:27,660
I was saying, yeah.

3273
02:12:27,660 --> 02:12:28,480
Yeah, all right.

3274
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:29,500
Yeah.

3275
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:31,180
Let's get to the mailbag

3276
02:12:31,180 --> 02:12:32,980
because every week you guys send us emails.

3277
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:35,940
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

3278
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:38,820
And we read those emails live on air.

3279
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:41,300
Now, by the way, so our podcast listeners know

3280
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:42,660
because I threatened this last week.

3281
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:44,100
I said, if we don't get four emails,

3282
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:46,380
I'm going to play music from Kim Kardashian Hollywood

3283
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:47,860
during the break.

3284
02:12:47,860 --> 02:12:49,440
Kim Kardashian Hollywood music

3285
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,040
was played during the break tonight

3286
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:52,740
because when I looked before the show,

3287
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:54,340
we had three emails.

3288
02:12:54,340 --> 02:12:55,820
One came in during the show

3289
02:12:55,820 --> 02:12:59,220
and I decided because people like Bobby and Act F

3290
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:00,220
were like, he won't do it.

3291
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:01,060
He won't do it.

3292
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:01,940
You know, don't send an email.

3293
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:03,540
I decided to torture everybody anyway.

3294
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:05,620
So just so you podcasties know,

3295
02:13:05,620 --> 02:13:07,220
the live listeners got tortured tonight.

3296
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:09,980
I'm still thinking of a way to torture the rest of you.

3297
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:13,560
Besides having Dan on the show.

3298
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:16,420
Then again, Dan was on the show this week.

3299
02:13:16,420 --> 02:13:17,240
Yeah, yeah.

3300
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:18,780
I self burned before you could burn me.

3301
02:13:18,780 --> 02:13:20,140
All right, fair enough.

3302
02:13:20,140 --> 02:13:21,040
Burn shield.

3303
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:24,620
Burn heal.

3304
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:26,980
Plus one resistance to burning.

3305
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:28,340
You guys have been taking so long

3306
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:30,780
that I actually had to refresh all the emails.

3307
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:31,780
I'm trying to kill time

3308
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:34,340
until her iPad's battery dies.

3309
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:35,660
Dan uses burn heal.

3310
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:36,500
It's super effective.

3311
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:37,320
I'm gonna kill something other than time.

3312
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,160
It's super effective.

3313
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:39,420
All right, Jamie, do it.

3314
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:41,620
Well, I actually have to load the emails now.

3315
02:13:42,740 --> 02:13:46,240
So we could fill more time talking about Sega Genesis.

3316
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:49,940
Have we talked about blast processing?

3317
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:51,500
Blast processing is great.

3318
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:53,340
That iPad needs blast processing.

3319
02:13:53,340 --> 02:13:54,860
That iPad needs to be blasted.

3320
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:56,100
What's up, Orange Lounge?

3321
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:58,420
I attached another song for Loki to sample.

3322
02:13:58,420 --> 02:14:01,180
I actually like Jamie's opinion on the song the most.

3323
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:04,060
Which I still haven't gotten the original email.

3324
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:07,300
That first email that he attached never got forwarded to me.

3325
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:09,060
So I need that or either that

3326
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:11,380
or got lost in spam filter hell.

3327
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:12,620
Is this from Ranma?

3328
02:14:12,620 --> 02:14:14,860
No, let me finish reading the damn email.

3329
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:17,820
So I apologize.

3330
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:20,220
I apologize for not getting back

3331
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:23,400
because I have not actually heard the song yet.

3332
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:24,420
Sorry, Robin Loki.

3333
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:26,200
She's your show star.

3334
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:27,780
What?

3335
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:29,140
My question is pretty simple.

3336
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:31,220
Why isn't Destiny going to be on PC?

3337
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:33,740
Do you think it eventually will be?

3338
02:14:33,740 --> 02:14:35,140
Probably, maybe?

3339
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:36,820
Yes, I think it will be on PC

3340
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:38,100
just because it's so easy.

3341
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:41,580
The port, you know, the PlayStation 4, Xbox One games

3342
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:43,340
because they're x86 anyways.

3343
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:46,060
So yes, it probably will eventually go on PC.

3344
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:49,380
Especially if, well, yeah, why not?

3345
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:50,220
The funny thing is,

3346
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:52,460
Bungie really hadn't done any PC work

3347
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:55,340
since they went over to the console side,

3348
02:14:55,340 --> 02:14:57,460
except for the PC version of what, Halo 2,

3349
02:14:57,460 --> 02:14:58,300
Halo 1?

3350
02:14:58,300 --> 02:14:59,820
Halo 1.

3351
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:01,100
Thanks, Smile.

3352
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:02,620
Hope you guys had a wonderful weekend

3353
02:15:02,620 --> 02:15:04,660
and I hope you have an amazing upcoming week.

3354
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:07,060
Much love, EA Skeezy from Milwaukee.

3355
02:15:07,060 --> 02:15:09,140
PS, Jamie, I would love to someday

3356
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:10,660
spend a weekend on your couch.

3357
02:15:10,660 --> 02:15:12,060
We'll rock some games and eat tacos

3358
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:13,300
till our poop turns to salsa.

3359
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:14,140
Ew, LOL.

3360
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:17,460
Yeah, you ain't coming to my fucking house.

3361
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:21,100
All right, thank you for forwarding that to me.

3362
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:22,820
Just forwarded two emails to you.

3363
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:23,660
Sweet, I appreciate it.

3364
02:15:23,660 --> 02:15:24,820
You can come stay on the couch

3365
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:27,420
if you bring us some of that fine Wisconsin cheese.

3366
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:31,020
Hello, OLR crew.

3367
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:33,260
13x forever here.

3368
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:34,580
Third time's a charm, I suppose.

3369
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:37,740
I also apologize for a long email with the Lord.

3370
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:40,100
So Trails, what?

3371
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:45,660
Whatever, Dan.

3372
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:49,460
So Trails in the Sky, AKA Sora No Kisuke,

3373
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:52,740
is the first game in the Kiseki sub-series

3374
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:54,460
of Legend of Heroes JRPG

3375
02:15:54,460 --> 02:15:57,700
from Falcom, Dragon Slayer, Ys, many other games.

3376
02:15:57,700 --> 02:16:00,300
Kiseki series is one of the biggest,

3377
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:02,940
most popular JRPG series in Japan right now.

3378
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:05,900
Trails in the Sky first came out in 2004 on PC in Japan.

3379
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:08,380
It was so large that the developer split it into two games,

3380
02:16:08,380 --> 02:16:10,580
first chapter and second chapter respectively.

3381
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:13,180
Later, it was ported to PSP and PS3.

3382
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:14,460
So what makes this game series

3383
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:16,660
to stand apart from other JRPGs?

3384
02:16:16,660 --> 02:16:19,300
First of all, it is more story-oriented

3385
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:21,260
than the vast majority of JRPGs.

3386
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:23,140
The story and world building is bread and butter

3387
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:23,980
of this series,

3388
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:26,780
which resulted in one of the most detail, alive,

3389
02:16:26,780 --> 02:16:29,260
and consistent world in any JRPG out there.

3390
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:30,620
Scripts for these games are really,

3391
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:32,580
really huge example script shots.

3392
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:38,420
Flat characters, existential plot twists,

3393
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:40,940
mute town crowd, not in these games.

3394
02:16:40,940 --> 02:16:44,420
You get your in-depth character.

3395
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:45,540
Stop it, Dan.

3396
02:16:46,420 --> 02:16:47,980
I'm talking to Rob.

3397
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:49,780
Stay focused on your story.

3398
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:51,700
This is like an hour long.

3399
02:16:52,100 --> 02:16:54,580
This is actually the guy that tried to call in last week

3400
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:55,820
and the internet sucked.

3401
02:16:55,820 --> 02:16:56,660
And yeah, we said email.

3402
02:16:56,660 --> 02:16:59,620
Yes, so that's why I'm happily reading this.

3403
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:01,180
You get your in-game character development

3404
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:02,380
from your main party members,

3405
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:05,340
and then for half the NPCs in the world,

3406
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:06,940
albeit a lot less detailed.

3407
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:09,020
That's right, you can see how things are going

3408
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:12,380
for a lot of town people after each main story advancement.

3409
02:17:12,380 --> 02:17:14,420
What's more, stories in each individual game

3410
02:17:14,420 --> 02:17:17,220
are intertwined not only with previous titles,

3411
02:17:17,220 --> 02:17:18,460
but with future ones as well.

3412
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:20,060
You'd be surprised at how many instances

3413
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:22,220
of foreshadowing were there in the beginning,

3414
02:17:22,220 --> 02:17:24,980
even for the latest games.

3415
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:27,060
First game is relatively slow paced

3416
02:17:27,060 --> 02:17:29,020
and light on the battle system in many games.

3417
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:31,220
There's a lot of introductory stuff for everything,

3418
02:17:31,220 --> 02:17:34,060
but it picks up speed fast right before the second chapter

3419
02:17:34,060 --> 02:17:35,660
and other aspects are greatly improved

3420
02:17:35,660 --> 02:17:37,220
in later games on the series.

3421
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:38,820
Oh, did I mention background music?

3422
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:40,220
It was great from the get-go

3423
02:17:40,220 --> 02:17:42,060
and it only got better ever since.

3424
02:17:42,060 --> 02:17:43,820
Now, why is all the hype?

3425
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:48,220
Sadly, only Trails in the Sky FC for PSP

3426
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:49,660
came out in the West.

3427
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:51,220
That's it until just recently

3428
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:53,420
when XSEED finally released

3429
02:17:53,420 --> 02:17:55,940
a greatly improved original PC version on Steam

3430
02:17:55,940 --> 02:17:58,020
with lots of enhancements and ported features

3431
02:17:58,020 --> 02:18:00,020
from handheld and console releases.

3432
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:03,940
What is more important, they're localizing second chapter

3433
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:05,860
and plan to release it at the end of the year,

3434
02:18:05,860 --> 02:18:08,540
maybe early 2015 on PC first,

3435
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:10,460
and then the PSP version as well.

3436
02:18:10,460 --> 02:18:15,460
And if FC and SC of Trials in the Sky will sell well,

3437
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:17,340
they're going to get the third chapter,

3438
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:19,740
which is a new game that bridges Trails in the Sky

3439
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:24,740
with the next installment, Zero slash Aonokisuki,

3440
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:29,460
and GASP probably may be somehow the rest of the series.

3441
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:31,740
In other words, every sold copy of Trails in the Sky,

3442
02:18:31,740 --> 02:18:34,220
first chapter, and more importantly, second chapter,

3443
02:18:34,220 --> 02:18:36,220
will have measurable impact on the probability

3444
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:38,760
to see the whole series being localized in the West

3445
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:40,140
for the first time ever.

3446
02:18:40,140 --> 02:18:43,060
In conclusion, these are really great game.

3447
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:44,900
These are really great games

3448
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:48,300
for a really low price of $19.99 on PC or PSP.

3449
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:49,900
If you're interested in JRPGs at all,

3450
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:51,280
you should try this game.

3451
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:53,700
Your friendly neighborhood bracelet, 13X forever.

3452
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:55,880
PS, sorry for the messed up email.

3453
02:18:57,220 --> 02:18:59,260
You can't go wrong with anything by Falcom.

3454
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:01,460
I just downloaded Ease Origin, it's awesome.

3455
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:04,660
I'm glad we got to give the game a proper shout out

3456
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:07,480
cause he was denied that shout out last week, so hooray.

3457
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:08,740
Yeah.

3458
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:11,580
Hey, OLR, I've heard emails run to high demand,

3459
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:13,420
so I decided to finally write in about something

3460
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:15,820
I've been thinking about since the whole Ubisoft

3461
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:17,720
no fem assassin debacle.

3462
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:21,260
There are all kinds of ways that games implement the player

3463
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:23,220
in deciding what goes on with the main character

3464
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:25,140
ranging from almost none, Dead Space,

3465
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:27,300
Rise of Evil, Strider, et cetera,

3466
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:29,980
up to complete control over nearly everything,

3467
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:31,060
including how the player looks

3468
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:33,020
and often story related choices,

3469
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:36,420
Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect, Dark Souls, Saints Row, et cetera.

3470
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:39,700
My main question would be which type of,

3471
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:42,260
which of the types do you generally enjoy more?

3472
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:44,580
For those of you who answer complete control,

3473
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:47,340
do you think it takes away from the narrative of the game

3474
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:49,340
in some way since the events have to be planned out

3475
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:51,100
in such a way as to allow so many

3476
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:52,740
different types of characters?

3477
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:54,740
Or do you think it's sort of irrelevant

3478
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:58,780
and that we should always be able to create a character?

3479
02:19:58,780 --> 02:20:01,620
Then for the second part of this question in games

3480
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:04,240
that have you create your own characters from scratch,

3481
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:07,140
do any of you have a character already in mind

3482
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:09,380
when you begin playing that you will use

3483
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:10,740
across different game series?

3484
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:13,580
Personally, I have a short roster of characters I'll create

3485
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:15,220
that I've been using since I was about 18

3486
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:17,080
with some new characters occasionally branching out.

3487
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:17,920
Pause.

3488
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:21,540
I really don't care as long as the story's good,

3489
02:20:21,540 --> 02:20:23,420
although I really do love putting a lot of time

3490
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:25,220
into character creation.

3491
02:20:25,220 --> 02:20:27,820
There really are pros and cons to both formats.

3492
02:20:27,820 --> 02:20:30,100
I think it's so hard to pick one or the other

3493
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:32,940
because if I were to say that I only like it

3494
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:34,800
when I can create my own character and do my own things,

3495
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:36,540
I'd be saying I don't like Mario

3496
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:37,500
or things like that as much.

3497
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:40,860
There's great value in games like that.

3498
02:20:40,860 --> 02:20:42,620
But of course, I love the ones

3499
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:44,940
where you can make your own character too.

3500
02:20:44,940 --> 02:20:47,940
Especially in a genre like role-playing,

3501
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:50,380
I think it works very well there.

3502
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:53,180
I mean, I wouldn't expect necessarily in an action game

3503
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:54,780
I can do that.

3504
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:57,540
Although I would think that in a multiplayer action,

3505
02:20:57,540 --> 02:20:59,980
which is why the Ubisoft thing got a lot of crap,

3506
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:02,420
you would have a variety of characters to choose from,

3507
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:03,780
but I digress.

3508
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:08,500
I don't mind the lack of openness

3509
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:12,220
in certain genres of games.

3510
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:15,820
But at the end of the day, is the game good?

3511
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:16,660
Yes or no?

3512
02:21:16,660 --> 02:21:18,480
That's the most important thing.

3513
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:19,700
I do like to make characters though.

3514
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:20,540
I'm gonna be honest.

3515
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:23,100
I make characters usually that look like me.

3516
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:26,540
The characters I usually make, not always.

3517
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:28,980
Or I'll do a girl that looks nothing like me.

3518
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:32,020
Well, I would like to tell the letter writer

3519
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:33,320
because there was a note added,

3520
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:36,520
you should read the first part silently before allowed.

3521
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:38,760
Please, I don't want to impose on you or the show.

3522
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:41,240
You should have put that up at the beginning of the email

3523
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:45,240
because I don't read the emails before I read the emails.

3524
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:46,840
I think he meant the rest of the email though.

3525
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:48,440
There's something else that he put after that.

3526
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:49,600
It said the first part.

3527
02:21:50,580 --> 02:21:51,840
I think he means the second part.

3528
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:53,640
If you actually look at it, it says,

3529
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:56,120
it's fine, you can read it.

3530
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:58,800
I looked at it before the show and it's fine.

3531
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:02,840
He was worried about making a cheap plug on there.

3532
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:04,080
It's fine.

3533
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:05,800
I recently started a YouTube channel,

3534
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:09,680
partly inspired by OLR and sometimes my favorite YouTuber.

3535
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:11,660
So I'd like to invite anybody that's interested

3536
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:14,340
in video game related content to come check it out

3537
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:16,840
since I'm trying to figure out what people want to see.

3538
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:19,520
And the chat seems to always be reasonable,

3539
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:21,400
fun people to interact with.

3540
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:22,960
It's Brozime on YouTube.

3541
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:26,540
Also, I hope to be in chat tonight, but no promises

3542
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:28,240
as I usually work quite late Sundays.

3543
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:30,120
Love the show, Brozime.

3544
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:30,960
There you go.

3545
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:34,080
I think it's reasonable and fun people on YouTube.

3546
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,440
They're all a bunch of trolling, hacky assholes.

3547
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:37,640
Oh, I come on on YouTube a lot.

3548
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:39,600
I'm happy to promote your YouTube channel,

3549
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:41,320
especially when you kiss up a little bit and be like,

3550
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:43,080
you know, it's inspired by OLR.

3551
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:45,360
I don't mind plugging people, I'm fine with that.

3552
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:46,960
It's not in position.

3553
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:48,160
No, in all seriousness,

3554
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:49,320
best of luck with your YouTube channel.

3555
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:53,280
I love, you know, I support indie broadcasting in all forms.

3556
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:55,080
What about walking around your neighborhood

3557
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:56,560
with a megaphone?

3558
02:22:56,560 --> 02:23:01,400
I'm broadcasting right now live from Rob's house

3559
02:23:01,400 --> 02:23:03,280
where all of his neighbors can hear me.

3560
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:04,520
I don't want the police call.

3561
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:06,760
That is probably the stupidest thing you've ever said.

3562
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:07,880
You know what?

3563
02:23:07,880 --> 02:23:10,000
I can think of another stupid thing that I said

3564
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,760
that consisted of two words when we got married.

3565
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:14,300
And by the way- No way?

3566
02:23:14,300 --> 02:23:16,100
By the way, Brozime's in chat saying,

3567
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:18,160
I meant the second, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3568
02:23:18,160 --> 02:23:19,000
So he's beeping up all the time.

3569
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,560
By the way, I love this guy.

3570
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:22,240
We know what you meant.

3571
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:24,000
Jamie doesn't know what you meant.

3572
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,940
I know that you can sit and spin.

3573
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:27,620
She's walking home from the show tonight.

3574
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:28,460
No, I'm not.

3575
02:23:28,460 --> 02:23:29,280
Do we have another email?

3576
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,120
Yes.

3577
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:31,220
Last email.

3578
02:23:31,220 --> 02:23:33,140
This is from Robert M.

3579
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:34,540
I wonder what effect the changes

3580
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:38,180
in Twitch's terms of service will have to salty bet,

3581
02:23:38,180 --> 02:23:39,700
even though when Moogan channel

3582
02:23:39,700 --> 02:23:41,640
is almost entirely focused on live feed

3583
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:43,420
rather than archived content.

3584
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:45,800
The prospect of betting on games

3585
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:46,940
that have already taken place

3586
02:23:46,940 --> 02:23:48,660
seems even more silly slash dangerous

3587
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:50,820
than buying a DVD of world poker jar.

3588
02:23:50,820 --> 02:23:53,820
People bet on games on Twitch?

3589
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:55,420
That's fucking brilliant.

3590
02:23:55,420 --> 02:23:56,260
It's fake money.

3591
02:23:56,260 --> 02:23:57,380
It's monopoly money.

3592
02:23:57,380 --> 02:23:58,220
It's fun.

3593
02:23:58,220 --> 02:23:59,780
No, but that's amazing.

3594
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:02,700
I mean, fake money, real money, that's inspired.

3595
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:03,540
You seriously need to watch it

3596
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:06,300
because it's all those independently made

3597
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:08,300
Moogan characters fighting each other.

3598
02:24:08,300 --> 02:24:11,180
So they have ridiculous shit all the time.

3599
02:24:11,180 --> 02:24:14,460
And you sign up and you get like X amount

3600
02:24:14,460 --> 02:24:15,820
of salty bucks or whatever.

3601
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:17,300
And then you bet on it.

3602
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:19,620
But it's difficult to win a lot of times.

3603
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:23,020
Now is it real players or is it computer versus computer?

3604
02:24:23,020 --> 02:24:25,020
Holy shit, I've got to check this out.

3605
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:27,540
Remember when we did that for WrestleMania 2000?

3606
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:29,660
Yeah, we ran the entire card,

3607
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:31,540
and in a lot of ways it was accurate.

3608
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:32,380
And they do that every year.

3609
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:34,340
Like they do the Madden bullshit like that.

3610
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:36,060
You know, and I was like, Twitch is all,

3611
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:37,460
you know, earlier on I'm like, Twitch is awesome.

3612
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:38,700
Twitch legitimizes our hobby.

3613
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:41,020
Twitch gives everyone a chance to kind of show off

3614
02:24:41,020 --> 02:24:43,580
and it gives everyone a chance to see people showing off.

3615
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:45,580
I think that's amazing until we fuck it up

3616
02:24:45,580 --> 02:24:47,640
and fucking it up would be real gambling.

3617
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:50,060
However, if somebody has managed to turn it into a game,

3618
02:24:50,060 --> 02:24:51,580
that's like the best thing ever.

3619
02:24:51,580 --> 02:24:53,060
They turned a game into another game.

3620
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:54,460
I am totally checking this shit.

3621
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:55,900
They took parts from games,

3622
02:24:55,900 --> 02:24:57,540
they turned into a game into another game

3623
02:24:57,540 --> 02:24:58,700
about betting on games.

3624
02:24:58,700 --> 02:25:00,180
As far as the email goes though,

3625
02:25:00,180 --> 02:25:01,540
I think you hit the nail on the head.

3626
02:25:01,540 --> 02:25:06,540
It doesn't matter because like 98% of it is live based.

3627
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:09,060
You know, you're not going to bet on matches

3628
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:11,380
that have already taken place.

3629
02:25:11,380 --> 02:25:13,460
So I think it's okay.

3630
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:15,580
Are they going to not let you broadcast live?

3631
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:16,940
Is that kind of the trick?

3632
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:17,960
No, you can broadcast live.

3633
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:20,700
It's the highlights you can only save in two hour chunks.

3634
02:25:20,700 --> 02:25:22,860
Although I believe they ended up getting rid of those,

3635
02:25:22,860 --> 02:25:25,260
but they're not going to keep your videos on file

3636
02:25:25,260 --> 02:25:28,620
for all time, unless you specifically make a highlight.

3637
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:29,500
Which is fair.

3638
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:32,060
Yeah, which is totally fair.

3639
02:25:32,060 --> 02:25:34,460
Vast, vast amounts of storage.

3640
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:35,300
Yeah.

3641
02:25:35,300 --> 02:25:36,180
Dungeon Buster says in chat,

3642
02:25:36,180 --> 02:25:39,600
I bet on Akuma and he was wrecked by a school girl

3643
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:41,100
with a magic cat, I think.

3644
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:43,620
Yeah, it's very difficult to pick.

3645
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:45,140
They're like, there's all the rules in there.

3646
02:25:45,140 --> 02:25:47,060
It's like always bet on Dragon Ball Z

3647
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:48,940
and never bet on Dragon Ball Z.

3648
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:52,340
Never bet on Akuma because he takes damage

3649
02:25:52,660 --> 02:25:54,180
twice as fast as every other character

3650
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:56,380
and never bet against a school girl with a magic cat

3651
02:25:56,380 --> 02:25:58,060
because she will fuck your shit up.

3652
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:01,020
All right.

3653
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:03,020
That's it for emails tonight, yes?

3654
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:04,780
Fifth dream says always bet waifu.

3655
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:07,180
Always bet on black.

3656
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:09,020
Yeah, that's it.

3657
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:11,420
All right, participate at orangelaundry.com.

3658
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:14,160
If you want to send us an email in a future week,

3659
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,360
I would appreciate it.

3660
02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:18,180
Let's go, Jamie probably won't

3661
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:19,480
because then she has to read it,

3662
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:23,320
but who says we were here to make Jamie's life easy?

3663
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:26,200
I mean, dance here in studio tonight, people.

3664
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:27,040
All right.

3665
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:29,200
Love you, Jamie.

3666
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:30,440
XOXO.

3667
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:31,560
Love you, mean it.

3668
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:33,480
Damn, you better get me a burrito after the show.

3669
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:35,480
Let's go to the FUs of the week.

3670
02:26:35,480 --> 02:26:40,480
FU to the intensely negative world around us

3671
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:05,360
and the fact that I came very close

3672
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:08,280
to just wanting to sit back and watch it all burn

3673
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:12,120
until I remember that there are truly good people

3674
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:12,960
in the world.

3675
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:14,600
And me, and me.

3676
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:17,480
Yes, except Loki, sorry, Loki, you're kind of okay.

3677
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:18,320
That's not good.

3678
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:19,160
That's fine.

3679
02:27:19,160 --> 02:27:20,000
I'll stick with him.

3680
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,840
FU to Rob for making fun of his,

3681
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:23,240
for trying to, you know, rub in my face

3682
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:25,880
that he has a signed poster that I don't even want,

3683
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:29,320
but I'm going to steal now just to prove that I can.

3684
02:27:29,320 --> 02:27:30,160
Fine.

3685
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:35,160
Also, FU to the ghost bitch in PT that ate me.

3686
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:37,880
I made her scream and pee.

3687
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:39,040
I did pee.

3688
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:41,920
We checked the trousers later.

3689
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:43,000
Doesn't like one of the,

3690
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,240
like doesn't like ghost thing or whatever,

3691
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:46,360
like pee on you or something.

3692
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:48,240
Cause I remember watching, you know.

3693
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:49,240
It sounds like it.

3694
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:50,080
It sure sounds like it.

3695
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:51,560
Oh, it's they're eating flesh.

3696
02:27:51,560 --> 02:27:52,400
They're rending.

3697
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:55,920
Then I'm like, it sounds like you're getting drained upon.

3698
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:58,400
Watch out because if you talk about this game three times,

3699
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:00,280
then Shane will instantly be summoned.

3700
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:01,280
Like he'll just appear.

3701
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:05,520
And then the ghost pissed from her ocular cavity.

3702
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:07,240
Okay.

3703
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:10,200
Am I the oldest yourself so I married an axe murderer?

3704
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:12,240
The only one who liked it.

3705
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:13,080
Bullshit.

3706
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:15,640
Like three other people did.

3707
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:17,800
Anyways, moving on. Bullshit.

3708
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:20,000
FU to Jamie for liking the old Michael,

3709
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,120
Mike Myers movie.

3710
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:23,000
So I married an axe murderer.

3711
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,160
FU because you're being a dick.

3712
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:28,400
Me because I'm being a dick.

3713
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:29,240
All right.

3714
02:28:29,240 --> 02:28:30,720
Is that it for your refuse, Dan?

3715
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:31,960
Probably.

3716
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:32,800
All right, Loki.

3717
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:34,560
FU for spilling Genesis wrong.

3718
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:35,840
Loki.

3719
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:36,680
I guess just.

3720
02:28:36,680 --> 02:28:37,520
Fuck that guy.

3721
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:41,040
I guess just FU to being hot.

3722
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:42,440
It's like hot in here.

3723
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:43,280
I don't know.

3724
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,720
Sorry. I have the fan on.

3725
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,320
Are you pre-menopausal?

3726
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:47,320
No, it's just this.

3727
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:50,960
This is a wooden chair and it doesn't breathe.

3728
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:52,760
He's got himself on this wall.

3729
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:53,600
Do what I do.

3730
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:54,840
I stand up during the show.

3731
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:55,920
I should start doing that.

3732
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:56,840
Yeah.

3733
02:28:56,840 --> 02:28:57,840
All right.

3734
02:28:57,840 --> 02:29:00,880
My FU of the week goes to the Sega Genesis

3735
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:01,720
because I didn't have one.

3736
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:02,560
You know what?

3737
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:04,240
Sega Genesis F's you back.

3738
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:09,000
Also my FU of the week goes to mood swings.

3739
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,560
Yay.

3740
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:11,560
All right.

3741
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:12,400
That's it.

3742
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:14,560
Just a couple more stories.

3743
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:16,920
And then we're going to take your calls here real soon

3744
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:19,680
at 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype,

3745
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:20,840
Orange Lounge Radio.

3746
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:22,640
You can call in and talk to Dark Soccer,

3747
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:25,240
Loki, myself or Dan, I guess.

3748
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:26,840
All right, Loki.

3749
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:29,680
So you may remember such games as,

3750
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:32,840
well, actually it is one game, but Remember Me

3751
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:36,720
was kind of a game that came out last year

3752
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:39,360
and it was okay.

3753
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:43,000
It was this sort of memory hacking,

3754
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:45,400
I don't know what you would call it,

3755
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:48,000
like futuristic brawler.

3756
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:48,840
I don't know.

3757
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:49,680
It was kind of strange.

3758
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:51,520
But anyways, that company Dot Nod,

3759
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:55,320
they're back with a brand new game called Life is Strange.

3760
02:29:55,320 --> 02:29:57,360
And it's kind of like,

3761
02:29:58,360 --> 02:30:01,400
they're kind of comparing it to like a butterfly effect.

3762
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:05,240
You know, every action acts a butterfly effect.

3763
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:07,460
But with the power to rewind time,

3764
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:10,360
what would you change and what would you,

3765
02:30:10,360 --> 02:30:13,480
and what would it turn out to be,

3766
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:15,760
change for the better or for worse?

3767
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:16,920
So I don't know.

3768
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:18,520
It sounds interesting.

3769
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:21,840
It's scheduled to be out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One,

3770
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:25,920
as well as PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

3771
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:28,640
And yeah, they only have like a little bit of a teaser

3772
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:31,660
for it, but it looks pretty.

3773
02:30:31,660 --> 02:30:32,600
I just don't know.

3774
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:35,240
Speaking of which, I wanted to mention though,

3775
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:37,480
totally aside from this,

3776
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:40,280
you know, Quantum Break wasn't really on my radar.

3777
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:43,400
It kind of looks stupid based off the first trailer

3778
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:44,360
that they showed.

3779
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:46,480
But man, that gameplay footage that they had

3780
02:30:46,480 --> 02:30:50,280
during the Microsoft press conference was fucking awesome.

3781
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:51,480
That game looks sweet.

3782
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:53,520
So looking forward to that.

3783
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:55,840
That's it.

3784
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:57,320
All right.

3785
02:30:57,320 --> 02:30:59,440
Lastly tonight, before we get to phone calls,

3786
02:30:59,440 --> 02:31:02,420
obviously there's been a lot of talk this week

3787
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:05,080
when the world lost Robin Williams,

3788
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:08,200
the fantastic, fantastic improv comic

3789
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:11,160
that a lot of you, of course, I know absolutely adored,

3790
02:31:11,160 --> 02:31:12,000
as did we.

3791
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:15,240
And he was also a gamer, as I'm sure a lot of you guys knew.

3792
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:17,600
He had an active World of Warcraft account.

3793
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:19,720
He appeared in Nintendo commercials

3794
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:20,920
with his daughter, Zelda,

3795
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:24,360
which was named after the Legend of Zelda.

3796
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:26,260
So in gaming news,

3797
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,720
how this is relevant to the gaming world,

3798
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:32,140
besides the fact that Robin was one of us,

3799
02:31:32,140 --> 02:31:34,280
is the fact that gamers are sort of rallying

3800
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:38,160
for memorializations of Robin Williams in various games.

3801
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:40,000
There was a couple different change.org petitions

3802
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,040
out there, one of them for Blizzard,

3803
02:31:42,040 --> 02:31:45,240
to memorialize Robin Williams in the game somehow.

3804
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:47,440
And it sounds like Blizzard was pretty receptive to that.

3805
02:31:47,440 --> 02:31:48,680
Pretty quickly they said, you know,

3806
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:50,280
we've got something in the works, you know,

3807
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:51,120
you'll see it soon.

3808
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:52,880
And I would think that Mork the York

3809
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:55,200
would make a perfect addition to World of Warcraft,

3810
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:56,360
who knows, who knows.

3811
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:59,160
Anyhow, Nintendo also responded

3812
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:01,760
to a similar change.org petition requesting

3813
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:05,080
that Robin Williams be remembered in a future Zelda title.

3814
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:06,860
That one might be a little bit harder to pull off,

3815
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:08,740
but fans, you know, are asking for it.

3816
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:11,440
Nintendo did put out a response which says,

3817
02:32:11,440 --> 02:32:13,440
Robin Williams was loved at Nintendo.

3818
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:15,160
Our hearts go out to his entire family,

3819
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:16,960
and especially to Zelda Williams,

3820
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:19,520
who we've worked with multiple times.

3821
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:21,240
We appreciate the outpouring of support

3822
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:23,680
from the gaming community, and hear the request of fans

3823
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:25,380
to honor him in a future game.

3824
02:32:25,380 --> 02:32:27,960
We will not be discussing what might be possible

3825
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:30,320
for future games during this difficult time,

3826
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:33,120
but we will hold our memories of Robin close.

3827
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:36,880
So I actually kind of really liked that response

3828
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:38,560
because it's showing that like,

3829
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:42,720
we're not gonna make any decision really rash in the moment,

3830
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:45,320
but obviously we were big fans of him as well,

3831
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:47,880
and we'll do, you know, it's kind of like,

3832
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:49,640
we'll assess this at a later time

3833
02:32:49,640 --> 02:32:51,220
when we're ready to talk more about

3834
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:52,680
what's going on with The Legend of Zelda.

3835
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:56,640
So that, in that retrospect, it's pretty cool.

3836
02:32:56,640 --> 02:33:00,160
So, anyhow, let's move on.

3837
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:04,120
It's time to go to the Skype line over at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

3838
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:06,040
our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

3839
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:07,400
if you'd like to give the show a call,

3840
02:33:07,400 --> 02:33:10,240
and talk about anything that we've mentioned tonight,

3841
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:13,040
or perhaps something else you'd like to bring up.

3842
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:14,960
I'm gonna head over to the Twitter real quick,

3843
02:33:15,480 --> 02:33:18,040
but while I'm loading up our Twitter at twitter.com slash O-L-R,

3844
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:18,920
let me check in with Loki

3845
02:33:18,920 --> 02:33:20,760
to see if there's any last minute stories.

3846
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:22,620
And again, the Skype line is open.

3847
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:24,440
They have a new Minecraft set coming out,

3848
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:26,680
and these new Minecraft sets aren't the like,

3849
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:28,920
micro, micro Minecraft stuff.

3850
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:30,840
Lego Minecraft, I should say.

3851
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:35,360
And they've got one, it's, was it The Farm and The Cave.

3852
02:33:35,360 --> 02:33:39,240
And they look awesome, because now they're minifig size,

3853
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:41,000
or minifig scale, I guess.

3854
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:43,760
Let me go to this Twitter topic,

3855
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:46,000
because somebody sent one in just for Dan.

3856
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,320
This comes from SSJ100Matt saying,

3857
02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:51,680
Genesis and Mega Drive news just for Dan.

3858
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:53,920
Unreleased Bill the Tomato port

3859
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:56,960
released on reproduction cartridges.

3860
02:33:56,960 --> 02:33:58,960
And he actually sends this to his story

3861
02:33:58,960 --> 02:34:02,400
over at retrocollect.com about this,

3862
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:04,520
what is it, Bill the Tomato is the game?

3863
02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:05,680
Yeah, Bill the Tomato, wow,

3864
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,160
they actually are putting it in like,

3865
02:34:07,160 --> 02:34:09,000
a little Genesis box and everything.

3866
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:11,120
That's pretty cool.

3867
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:12,680
Yeah, they do stuff like that.

3868
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:17,000
Cool, you know, especially over retrocollect,

3869
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,800
they're huge, huge into the Sega stuff,

3870
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:22,840
and the Genesis lives on.

3871
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:25,840
$75 in North America, if you want this.

3872
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:28,160
100 copies of this game being made available

3873
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:29,620
using all new parts.

3874
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:31,680
They've done some like, really incredible stuff.

3875
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:33,240
I mean, that's like an unreleased prototype,

3876
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:34,920
but they've done like, some homebrew,

3877
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:37,500
some brand new stuff, especially for the machine

3878
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:41,000
that you would be shocked to see coming out on Genesis.

3879
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:42,600
I seem to remember,

3880
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:44,120
and I know Bobby's probably listening,

3881
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:45,880
and he'll correct me on this,

3882
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:47,400
but I seem to remember he had a pretty big interview

3883
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:50,680
with somebody who was making like, a Genesis game.

3884
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:53,160
Like, he had those people on, and I, fuck,

3885
02:34:53,160 --> 02:34:54,160
I don't remember the name of the game.

3886
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:55,160
He'll jump in there with it.

3887
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:57,840
There's this RPG that was like, a huge huge deal,

3888
02:34:57,840 --> 02:34:59,480
and I always forget the name of it, but.

3889
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:00,320
And he had the developers on the show.

3890
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:02,460
It just looks cool as hell.

3891
02:35:02,460 --> 02:35:04,840
And I really do wish that, had I known about it sooner.

3892
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:06,320
The Baker Prince, was that what it was called?

3893
02:35:06,320 --> 02:35:07,360
Ah, fuck, I don't know.

3894
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:08,360
Had I been on it sooner,

3895
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:10,560
I probably would have ponied up for a copy.

3896
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:12,640
There was a Kickstarter, for one.

3897
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:14,480
There was actually, there was one that was more recent

3898
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:17,740
that was a Kickstarter, that they were using Unity,

3899
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:20,520
but I don't know how they would port that to Genesis,

3900
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:24,920
but it had, it was sprites with normal maps on them,

3901
02:35:24,920 --> 02:35:26,920
so they had real-time lighting on the sprites,

3902
02:35:26,920 --> 02:35:28,060
which is kinda cool.

3903
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:30,840
Yeah, just stuff that you wouldn't expect

3904
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:35,400
an X60 or a 68000 and a Z80 to be able to do, you know?

3905
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:37,400
But advanced programming techniques,

3906
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:40,520
they can take old consoles and make them do things

3907
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:41,840
that you're just like, holy shit,

3908
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:43,400
why couldn't they have done that back in the day?

3909
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:44,880
Well, they didn't know how.

3910
02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:47,240
One of the guys that we see at Atari party every year

3911
02:35:47,240 --> 02:35:51,360
has this mind-blowing version of Space Harrier

3912
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:53,000
that plays on the Atari 800.

3913
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,600
It must use a huge amount of memory,

3914
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:57,540
comparative to what they had available at the time,

3915
02:35:57,540 --> 02:36:00,400
but it looks like the arcade game.

3916
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:02,220
Not like, wow, it's the arcade game,

3917
02:36:02,220 --> 02:36:04,420
but I mean, it looks more like the arcade game

3918
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:05,900
than a Master System version,

3919
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:08,120
like a Sega Genesis version, anything like that.

3920
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:09,760
And Bobby must have been AFK,

3921
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:10,740
because he didn't jump in,

3922
02:36:10,740 --> 02:36:12,120
but Dartetsuya jumped in and said,

3923
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:13,720
Baker Prince, and sure enough,

3924
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:17,200
I went to look up the Wiki on it and it was Baker Prince.

3925
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:18,220
The thing about Baker Prince,

3926
02:36:18,220 --> 02:36:21,120
it actually did come out in 96.

3927
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:23,320
I think it was in like Chinese originally.

3928
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:27,600
So the re-translation of the game happened much later.

3929
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:32,600
2006 was, I believe, the tangible release,

3930
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:35,440
and then they did Windows and all that in 2013.

3931
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:36,280
So there you go.

3932
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:38,440
I thought it was more recent, but yeah,

3933
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:40,000
that sounds very plausible.

3934
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,520
Yeah, it's supposed to be just this amazing game.

3935
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:45,440
And at 96, I guess it would have been a pretty late life-

3936
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:46,280
It would have been, yeah.

3937
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:47,640
Mega draft title.

3938
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:50,040
Again, I'm gonna throw that out, 1877 Game OLR,

3939
02:36:50,040 --> 02:36:51,000
our username on Skype,

3940
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,540
OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give the show a call.

3941
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:56,380
Do we have any other last minute stories from Loki?

3942
02:36:56,380 --> 02:36:57,220
No.

3943
02:36:57,220 --> 02:36:58,240
I think I saw anything else on Twitter.

3944
02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:00,220
No, no, we do not.

3945
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:03,800
Well, Dan, if nobody's gonna call in,

3946
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:06,800
you have plenty of time to reminisce more about the Genesis.

3947
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:11,160
My wife showed me a picture of a cat driving a car

3948
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:13,440
on like a Logitech wheel.

3949
02:37:13,440 --> 02:37:14,760
Oh, wait- It's a racing wheel.

3950
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:16,160
I do have some more tweets.

3951
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:17,200
It is awesome.

3952
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:19,040
This is really important.

3953
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:21,440
Vizaya925 sent us two tweets.

3954
02:37:21,440 --> 02:37:22,280
The first one says,

3955
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:23,880
I'd love a complete remaster

3956
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:25,400
of the original Resident Evil.

3957
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:26,460
That game was awesome.

3958
02:37:26,460 --> 02:37:28,120
That was one of our stories last week, if you remember.

3959
02:37:28,120 --> 02:37:31,000
And you can have one, it's on the GameCube.

3960
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:34,240
And Vizaya also responded and said,

3961
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:37,520
Jim Boy's Tacos have the best fish tacos ever.

3962
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:40,040
Tell Jamie she's trippin'.

3963
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:40,860
Which-

3964
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:42,800
No, they have the best vomit tacos.

3965
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:44,960
I wanna point out, I wanna point out-

3966
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:46,440
See, that's what summoned Shane.

3967
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:47,280
No, this is important.

3968
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:48,560
It's the badness of Jim Boy's.

3969
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:49,560
This is important.

3970
02:37:49,560 --> 02:37:52,280
That tweet retweeted by the official

3971
02:37:52,280 --> 02:37:54,160
Jim Boy's Tacos account.

3972
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:59,160
So Jim Boy's Tacos has indirectly told Jamie she's trippin'.

3973
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:02,040
It is, yeah.

3974
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:05,480
Jim Boy's Tacos is this weird acquired taste, I guess.

3975
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:06,840
It's a local chain, I feel like.

3976
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:07,680
It's a local chain.

3977
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:08,920
It's called the International Show.

3978
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:09,760
Oh, gross.

3979
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:11,360
And people are like, what the hell is this taco place

3980
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:12,480
that you're talking about?

3981
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,160
Okay, dear Jim Boy's Tacos,

3982
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:17,120
if you get me free tacos for a year,

3983
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:19,040
I might say that one of them is good.

3984
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:21,040
Why would you want free tacos that you hate?

3985
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:21,880
Take it down to me.

3986
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:24,160
The first night that Jamie moved out here,

3987
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:27,320
I went and picked up Jim Boy's Tacos

3988
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:29,860
and it just destroyed her.

3989
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:32,500
I mean, she was just not a happy girl.

3990
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:34,060
And it's very unfortunate because-

3991
02:38:34,060 --> 02:38:35,580
And then we went to the one by your grandmother's house

3992
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:36,420
and I was taking her bathroom for two hours.

3993
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:38,420
I think that was the one I went to, I think.

3994
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:40,580
You know, there's people that live in like New York

3995
02:38:40,580 --> 02:38:41,740
or something listening to this show going,

3996
02:38:41,740 --> 02:38:43,140
I don't give a fuck about Jim Boy's Tacos.

3997
02:38:43,140 --> 02:38:43,980
You know what?

3998
02:38:43,980 --> 02:38:46,380
We don't give a fuck about you not giving a fuck.

3999
02:38:46,380 --> 02:38:48,420
You want to see how many fucks I have to give?

4000
02:38:48,420 --> 02:38:50,900
My fuck's given ratio is extremely low,

4001
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:52,020
even compared to yours.

4002
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:54,380
So eat a dick, taco.

4003
02:38:54,380 --> 02:38:57,100
1-877-GAMO-L-R.

4004
02:38:57,100 --> 02:38:58,900
Are you using him on Skype or in Sondra?

4005
02:38:58,940 --> 02:38:59,980
No, nobody really felt like that.

4006
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:00,940
It was just Rob talking.

4007
02:39:00,940 --> 02:39:04,540
For what it's worth, Visaya925,

4008
02:39:04,540 --> 02:39:07,340
I had Jim Boy's Tacos on Friday and they were fine.

4009
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:08,740
So just saying.

4010
02:39:08,740 --> 02:39:09,560
I like them.

4011
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:10,880
They're covered with like that weird powdery cheese.

4012
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:11,940
That's amazing.

4013
02:39:11,940 --> 02:39:12,780
It's called Parmesan.

4014
02:39:12,780 --> 02:39:13,620
All right, we got-

4015
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:14,460
It's not Parmesan.

4016
02:39:14,460 --> 02:39:15,520
Finally, our phones are lighting up.

4017
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:16,360
Let's get to it.

4018
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:17,180
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

4019
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:18,780
Who's this?

4020
02:39:18,780 --> 02:39:20,100
Holy crap, I'm on the show.

4021
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:20,940
Holy crap, who's this?

4022
02:39:20,940 --> 02:39:22,180
This is EA Skeezy.

4023
02:39:22,180 --> 02:39:23,220
EA Skeezy?

4024
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:24,100
What's up, buddy?

4025
02:39:25,380 --> 02:39:27,260
Malcolm, how you guys doing?

4026
02:39:27,260 --> 02:39:28,780
We're doing good.

4027
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:30,900
From emailing to live on air,

4028
02:39:30,900 --> 02:39:33,340
what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

4029
02:39:33,340 --> 02:39:35,580
Well, honestly, the girlfriend had to work

4030
02:39:35,580 --> 02:39:37,780
third shift tonight and I randomly thought,

4031
02:39:37,780 --> 02:39:39,420
well, hey, OLR's on.

4032
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:41,620
I don't have to wait till Monday.

4033
02:39:41,620 --> 02:39:43,580
Let's call it and see how the game's doing.

4034
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:44,660
God, I'm lonely.

4035
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:47,520
Are you lonely, EA Skeezy?

4036
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:48,360
Is that what's up?

4037
02:39:48,360 --> 02:39:49,420
I'll smack my husband.

4038
02:39:49,420 --> 02:39:52,220
Are you lonely tonight?

4039
02:39:52,220 --> 02:39:54,060
Do you miss me tonight?

4040
02:39:54,060 --> 02:39:55,060
I'm just bored.

4041
02:39:55,060 --> 02:39:56,260
All right, well, EA Skeezy,

4042
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:59,620
I'm glad you called to get entertained by us.

4043
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:02,540
You don't have any statements or opinions

4044
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:05,300
you wish to inflict upon the show tonight?

4045
02:40:06,420 --> 02:40:10,380
Well, for one, I absolutely hate Time Warner Cable.

4046
02:40:11,860 --> 02:40:13,820
Yeah, dude, they can suck a dick.

4047
02:40:13,820 --> 02:40:16,140
Well, since we were talking about cable companies,

4048
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:17,980
why not spread the hate?

4049
02:40:17,980 --> 02:40:20,340
What did Time Warner do to piss you off?

4050
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:25,380
They sent just, I was a little late on the bill,

4051
02:40:25,380 --> 02:40:28,700
owed them about $100 and that's about it.

4052
02:40:28,700 --> 02:40:32,020
And they sent the guy to the door to come get the modem

4053
02:40:32,020 --> 02:40:34,260
and take everything away.

4054
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:37,020
And I told them, well, I'll just hold on to the modem

4055
02:40:37,020 --> 02:40:38,300
cause I'll make the payment.

4056
02:40:38,300 --> 02:40:39,540
It'll turn back on.

4057
02:40:39,540 --> 02:40:41,180
Everything will be fine.

4058
02:40:41,180 --> 02:40:43,180
Guy said, yeah, that's exactly how it works.

4059
02:40:43,180 --> 02:40:45,700
So he left, but he failed to mention

4060
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:48,740
that he disconnected me downstairs in the basement.

4061
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:50,340
And now I have to go through the process

4062
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:52,540
of having a guy come here and put in a new modem

4063
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:54,040
and all that crap.

4064
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:55,440
And that's, you know, that's weeks

4065
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:58,920
and I got to pay service fees and crap like that.

4066
02:40:58,920 --> 02:40:59,760
So, you know-

4067
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:02,040
That's what happens when you don't pay your bills.

4068
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:04,280
Well, that sounds like a worst interest system

4069
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:06,440
than GameStop's credit card, to be honest.

4070
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:07,280
I don't know.

4071
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:08,360
GameStop has a credit card?

4072
02:41:08,360 --> 02:41:09,200
You didn't hear about that?

4073
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:12,120
Holy fucking crap, that's like the worst idea ever.

4074
02:41:12,120 --> 02:41:12,960
You know what?

4075
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,040
You need to listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

4076
02:41:14,040 --> 02:41:16,800
We talk about all this shit that you're missing.

4077
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:17,640
That's amazing.

4078
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:19,720
You know, you think my wife would come home

4079
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:21,080
and tell me these things.

4080
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:21,920
No, no.

4081
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:23,280
No.

4082
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:24,240
Anyway, all right.

4083
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:29,080
Well, EA Skeezy, to amuse Dan tonight,

4084
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:29,920
since he's taunting you

4085
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:31,760
for not having you paid your bill on time.

4086
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:33,160
What is your favorite Genesis game?

4087
02:41:33,160 --> 02:41:35,120
Yeah, what is your favorite Genesis game?

4088
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:38,600
My favorite Genesis game, honestly,

4089
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:40,680
I did not have one as- Five seconds.

4090
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:41,840
Okay, hang on. Same rock.

4091
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:43,480
I didn't have one.

4092
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:44,600
Super Nintendo, man.

4093
02:41:44,600 --> 02:41:45,960
Yes, he was a Super Nintendo.

4094
02:41:45,960 --> 02:41:48,160
Okay, what's your favorite Super Nintendo game?

4095
02:41:49,480 --> 02:41:50,960
Super Metroid, for sure.

4096
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:52,120
Dude, dude, fuck yes.

4097
02:41:52,120 --> 02:41:53,680
All right, correct answer.

4098
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:55,440
Correct answer.

4099
02:41:55,440 --> 02:41:57,720
Honestly, I honestly played it two weeks ago.

4100
02:41:57,720 --> 02:41:58,960
You are damn right.

4101
02:41:58,960 --> 02:42:00,720
See, at the very least, I can get behind you.

4102
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:01,560
If you didn't have a Genesis,

4103
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:03,200
but you were rocking Super Metroid,

4104
02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:04,560
you made the right choice.

4105
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:06,520
Which, every time I try to get you

4106
02:42:06,520 --> 02:42:08,360
to play Super Metroid, you won't.

4107
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:11,360
Because my thumbs are terrible now,

4108
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:14,400
and the Super Nintendo controller actually hurts my thumbs.

4109
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:16,240
EA Skeezy, will you come over, crash on-

4110
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:17,600
If I could use my Genesis 6 button pad,

4111
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:18,440
I'm on the Super Nintendo.

4112
02:42:18,440 --> 02:42:19,360
Will you come crash on our couch

4113
02:42:19,360 --> 02:42:20,200
and play Super Metroid for us?

4114
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:22,240
None of these people are ever touching my sofa.

4115
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:23,080
What?

4116
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:25,560
Especially this guy, he can't pay his bills,

4117
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:27,760
he didn't own a Genesis.

4118
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:29,480
I'm gonna punch my husband in the face.

4119
02:42:29,480 --> 02:42:31,600
His only redeeming quality is that he listens to OLR

4120
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:32,600
and he likes Super Metroid.

4121
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:34,160
You don't even listen to OLR.

4122
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:35,440
I know.

4123
02:42:35,440 --> 02:42:36,280
This man has no redeeming qualities.

4124
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:38,440
That's basically Rob's redeeming qualities, too.

4125
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:40,960
All right.

4126
02:42:40,960 --> 02:42:44,280
If I'm ever in the area, I can cook and clean,

4127
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:46,680
and I can maybe stay a night just to hang out.

4128
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:48,720
So when changing the cat's litter and you're in.

4129
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:49,800
Dear God, no.

4130
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:51,880
That's not even a good deal for you.

4131
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:53,640
My girlfriend makes me do it all the time.

4132
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:55,240
I hate to fucking do the cat's litter,

4133
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:57,280
but I'm fucking pro at it now.

4134
02:42:57,280 --> 02:42:58,120
All right.

4135
02:42:58,120 --> 02:43:01,960
EA Skeezy, any last thoughts for our listeners tonight

4136
02:43:01,960 --> 02:43:03,000
before we let you go?

4137
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:06,040
No, I just hope everybody enjoyed the show.

4138
02:43:06,040 --> 02:43:08,080
I look forward to hearing the majority

4139
02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:09,560
that I missed in the morning.

4140
02:43:09,560 --> 02:43:10,400
All right, sounds good.

4141
02:43:10,400 --> 02:43:11,240
We'll try to get it up for you.

4142
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:12,080
Keep writing us every week

4143
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:12,960
because I like your emails.

4144
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:13,800
All right.

4145
02:43:13,800 --> 02:43:14,640
Yeah.

4146
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:15,480
Definitely.

4147
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:16,320
Bye, my friend.

4148
02:43:16,320 --> 02:43:17,160
I'll send you a new one next week.

4149
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:18,120
Yep, good to hear you guys.

4150
02:43:18,120 --> 02:43:19,200
Later.

4151
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:20,040
All right.

4152
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:20,880
That was EA Skeezy,

4153
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:23,080
who I believe is the first time actually on the show,

4154
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:24,800
even though we get the emails a lot.

4155
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:26,000
Now the phones are lighting up.

4156
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:27,160
Let's go back to it again.

4157
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:28,040
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

4158
02:43:28,040 --> 02:43:28,880
Who's this?

4159
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:29,960
Hey, guys, it's Jason.

4160
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:30,800
Hey, Jason.

4161
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:31,640
How you doing?

4162
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:32,480
Doing pretty good.

4163
02:43:32,480 --> 02:43:33,720
Good to hear from you.

4164
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:36,040
Every show that's a reminiscing show is a good show

4165
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:38,160
because after reading,

4166
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:40,600
it's funny because I jumped in on Facebook

4167
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:43,400
just to correct the fact that Alan said 13 and not eight

4168
02:43:43,400 --> 02:43:44,800
because he said X and not V.

4169
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:45,640
Oh, did he?

4170
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:46,480
I didn't even catch it.

4171
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:47,300
Yeah.

4172
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:48,140
Maybe he edited it since-

4173
02:43:48,140 --> 02:43:49,900
Did it make you feel better about yourself?

4174
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:54,260
I am one of those assholes on the internet, unfortunately.

4175
02:43:54,260 --> 02:43:55,100
So yes.

4176
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:55,920
Good man.

4177
02:43:55,920 --> 02:43:56,760
So scary.

4178
02:43:56,760 --> 02:43:57,600
And I meant to read the comments

4179
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:59,700
to see if anybody else had the whole Crackdown Halo thing.

4180
02:43:59,700 --> 02:44:02,540
I'm totally not surprised that they did.

4181
02:44:02,540 --> 02:44:05,580
But one of the other things that sprang to mind,

4182
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:07,980
talking about PlayStation Magazine demos and whatnot,

4183
02:44:07,980 --> 02:44:11,440
was the disc, the issue, whatever date, whatever issue,

4184
02:44:11,440 --> 02:44:13,140
that had Jet Moto 2 on it.

4185
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:16,200
Everybody else, if I remember correctly,

4186
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:18,560
I seem to remember three games on that disc.

4187
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,000
I love Jet Moto 2.

4188
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,840
The level, the music for the stage that they picked,

4189
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:25,760
I'm fairly sure it was just a one level demo, was amazing.

4190
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:26,720
But if I remember correctly,

4191
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:29,840
that same disc also had Xenogears

4192
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:32,360
and either Tomba 1 or Tomba 2.

4193
02:44:33,400 --> 02:44:35,480
Oh, Tomba's such a good game.

4194
02:44:35,480 --> 02:44:37,200
And I've never played either of them.

4195
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:38,400
People know about it,

4196
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:41,640
but the mainstream audience doesn't know about it.

4197
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:44,200
Yes, that game definitely has cult status.

4198
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:46,080
Man, I miss Jet Moto.

4199
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:47,680
That series is awesome.

4200
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:49,600
No, Jet Moto 1 and 2 were awesome.

4201
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:50,440
And then what was it?

4202
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:52,600
The third one was the 989 one, right?

4203
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:54,120
Because the first two were by Singletrack,

4204
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:54,960
if I remember correctly.

4205
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:55,800
Oh, I never played the third one.

4206
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:57,760
The third one went to 989 Studios.

4207
02:44:57,760 --> 02:44:59,760
And 989 Studios had a way of taking everything

4208
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:02,480
that they touched and just making absolute shit out of it.

4209
02:45:02,480 --> 02:45:04,200
Was that also the case with Cool Borders?

4210
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:06,320
That like the first three was somebody with a 989 afterword?

4211
02:45:06,320 --> 02:45:07,940
Every Sony franchise,

4212
02:45:07,940 --> 02:45:09,960
when they got rid of that original,

4213
02:45:09,960 --> 02:45:11,200
when the PlayStation came out,

4214
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:13,240
Sony had a literal dream team of developers.

4215
02:45:13,240 --> 02:45:14,280
It just wasn't pushed as much,

4216
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:17,840
but they had guys who were just really good at making games.

4217
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:19,640
And then they ended up taking those guys.

4218
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:21,720
And after they built these franchises and said,

4219
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:23,960
all right, now fucking pay us.

4220
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:25,840
Sony said, oh, thank you for your work.

4221
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:28,480
We're going to give your franchise over to 989 Studios

4222
02:45:28,480 --> 02:45:30,040
who made games for, you know,

4223
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:34,080
peanuts and toffee and just fucking ruined them.

4224
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:36,360
And the game and the fact that they were made

4225
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:37,200
at that scale show.

4226
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:38,600
Jet Moto, blah.

4227
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:41,040
All their sports franchises, blah.

4228
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:43,120
Jesus Christ.

4229
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:44,080
It's a little unfortunate

4230
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:47,800
because I actually bought Jet Moto 2 for original PSP.

4231
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:49,280
I don't know if it's going to be better on the Vita.

4232
02:45:49,280 --> 02:45:52,440
Probably not because like the game just doesn't feel right.

4233
02:45:52,440 --> 02:45:54,040
And I don't know if that's just because

4234
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:55,640
I'm missing the second triggers

4235
02:45:55,640 --> 02:45:58,000
because the PSPs don't have two sets of triggers

4236
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:58,840
on each side.

4237
02:45:58,840 --> 02:46:00,280
You got to have that PlayStation control.

4238
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:01,640
Yeah, you really do.

4239
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:03,920
It's I, and I also,

4240
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:06,140
I actually don't even have a console PlayStation anymore,

4241
02:46:06,140 --> 02:46:07,720
but I'm looking forward to,

4242
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:11,200
I want to say that the store said that you could play it

4243
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:12,040
on a console as well, but I'm sure.

4244
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:13,240
PlayStation stuff is still cheap

4245
02:46:13,240 --> 02:46:15,800
and it's still out there and just get it now

4246
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:17,100
because they're mechanical.

4247
02:46:17,100 --> 02:46:19,160
They're only going to get harder to find

4248
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:21,080
and they're going to get more expensive

4249
02:46:21,080 --> 02:46:25,560
and just, you know, eventually titles like, you know,

4250
02:46:25,560 --> 02:46:28,860
Warhawk and Jet Moto and ESPN Extreme Games,

4251
02:46:28,860 --> 02:46:32,440
all those weird early PlayStation games that were so good

4252
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:35,040
from that early generation will be gone

4253
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:37,960
because they're not going to age like cartridges do

4254
02:46:37,960 --> 02:46:39,240
where there's no moving parts.

4255
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:40,740
There's really nothing to break.

4256
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:44,020
Eventually it's going to be damn hard to find a PlayStation.

4257
02:46:44,020 --> 02:46:44,860
Yup.

4258
02:46:47,220 --> 02:46:48,800
All right, wow, all right.

4259
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:51,420
It's sort of, I just,

4260
02:46:51,420 --> 02:46:53,620
you guys talking about like the PS1 demos and everything,

4261
02:46:53,620 --> 02:46:55,420
it really does make me think about how all of that

4262
02:46:55,420 --> 02:46:57,140
is really like a lost art because, you know,

4263
02:46:57,140 --> 02:46:59,100
now obviously we do all the download demos,

4264
02:46:59,100 --> 02:47:02,460
but even it seems like download demos even are less and less

4265
02:47:02,460 --> 02:47:03,620
depending on the console.

4266
02:47:03,620 --> 02:47:05,360
Like I think about like Wii U,

4267
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:06,700
it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot

4268
02:47:06,700 --> 02:47:08,720
of downloadable demos on something like Wii U.

4269
02:47:08,720 --> 02:47:10,340
Want me to tell you why?

4270
02:47:10,980 --> 02:47:13,700
Because they figured it was a waste of time.

4271
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:16,100
The problem was is that they figured out eventually

4272
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:17,580
after all these years of doing demos

4273
02:47:17,580 --> 02:47:20,660
that having a demo out didn't really affect

4274
02:47:20,660 --> 02:47:23,500
the sales of your title positively

4275
02:47:23,500 --> 02:47:27,900
and could in fact greatly affect it negatively.

4276
02:47:27,900 --> 02:47:30,580
And since demos are typically early versions of games

4277
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:32,420
that lack polish and whatnot,

4278
02:47:32,420 --> 02:47:35,220
unless you spent a lot of extra time and development money

4279
02:47:35,220 --> 02:47:38,840
making a good demo, you probably were going to ruin your game.

4280
02:47:38,840 --> 02:47:41,440
Plus tons of people would just play that demo and go,

4281
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:42,980
eh, it was cool.

4282
02:47:42,980 --> 02:47:44,560
So companies pretty much decided

4283
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:47,120
unless it's something AAA and they need to create hype

4284
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:49,320
to buy themselves another six months of development time

4285
02:47:49,320 --> 02:47:50,880
without losing momentum,

4286
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:52,640
then they're not going to give you that free taste.

4287
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:54,720
They're just going to let us sit back.

4288
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:56,880
At the same time, you know what's kind of weird about that?

4289
02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:59,000
That was probably always the case for consoles.

4290
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,960
I know it was always the case for consoles,

4291
02:48:00,960 --> 02:48:03,600
but like I started playing through Serious Sam

4292
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:07,720
and I was reminded of how that and Shadow Warrior

4293
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:11,560
and I know at least one or two other games

4294
02:48:11,560 --> 02:48:14,160
that the demo was the same engine,

4295
02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:17,380
but had otherwise shorter, unique content.

4296
02:48:17,380 --> 02:48:19,640
And when you actually bought the full game, it said,

4297
02:48:19,640 --> 02:48:22,060
hey, here's the extra content from the demo

4298
02:48:22,060 --> 02:48:23,640
in addition to what you can play with the whole,

4299
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:25,380
with the full game, which is,

4300
02:48:25,380 --> 02:48:27,360
and my idea, really cool way of doing it,

4301
02:48:27,360 --> 02:48:29,680
especially since demos are more or less,

4302
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:31,760
we're more or less always digital,

4303
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:32,980
you know, BBSs and whatnot.

4304
02:48:32,980 --> 02:48:35,060
They can make the game, master it, ship it,

4305
02:48:35,060 --> 02:48:37,360
get it into stores during that time,

4306
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:39,120
whip up new content,

4307
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:41,280
be able to put that on digital mechanisms.

4308
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:42,880
And there's really no way,

4309
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:44,840
no reason why they couldn't be doing that right now.

4310
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:46,920
Well, PC demos are kind of a different world.

4311
02:48:46,920 --> 02:48:47,760
Sure, absolutely.

4312
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:49,160
Because usually it's just like,

4313
02:48:49,160 --> 02:48:50,920
they're going to take a little bit of the code,

4314
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:52,280
they're going to polish it up a tiny bit

4315
02:48:52,280 --> 02:48:54,500
and they're going to make it available for download.

4316
02:48:54,500 --> 02:48:55,340
With console demos,

4317
02:48:55,340 --> 02:48:58,280
because they needed to be mastered onto a disc,

4318
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:01,400
they needed more lead time.

4319
02:49:01,400 --> 02:49:04,780
So, I mean, that's a super, super valid point.

4320
02:49:04,780 --> 02:49:06,320
And it's also not applicable to everything.

4321
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:09,520
It's super applicable to those frenzied action games,

4322
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:12,400
which you get an RPG or an adventure game or a puzzle.

4323
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:14,380
I guess there's room for new puzzles

4324
02:49:14,380 --> 02:49:16,280
to be made in a puzzle game, but like-

4325
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:17,240
Yeah, you know, it's a puzzle game,

4326
02:49:17,240 --> 02:49:18,080
you want to do the demo-

4327
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:20,440
Peggle and other little trash games like that.

4328
02:49:20,440 --> 02:49:21,760
Trash is the wrong word, but, you know,

4329
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:22,880
simple little games,

4330
02:49:22,880 --> 02:49:24,920
there's not going to be interesting, unique content

4331
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:26,880
you're going to be able to do with those sorts of things.

4332
02:49:26,880 --> 02:49:27,980
All right, well, Jason,

4333
02:49:27,980 --> 02:49:30,640
I appreciate the walk down memory lane of demos here.

4334
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:32,240
Any other quick thoughts before we let you go?

4335
02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:33,960
Because the phones are lighting up,

4336
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:36,300
so I want to try and get one more call in.

4337
02:49:36,300 --> 02:49:37,640
I'm not witty enough this fast enough.

4338
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:38,480
Take another call.

4339
02:49:38,480 --> 02:49:40,140
All right, take care, buddy.

4340
02:49:40,140 --> 02:49:40,980
Bye.

4341
02:49:40,980 --> 02:49:42,740
That guy's my favorite caller.

4342
02:49:42,740 --> 02:49:43,580
He's a good guy.

4343
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:44,400
He's a good guy.

4344
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:45,240
All right, yeah, our phones are lighting up,

4345
02:49:45,240 --> 02:49:47,300
so let's try to take at least one more call here

4346
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:48,960
before we wrap up the show tonight.

4347
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:49,800
Let's get to it.

4348
02:49:49,800 --> 02:49:50,620
Hi, you're on Orange Home Radio.

4349
02:49:50,620 --> 02:49:51,460
Who's this?

4350
02:49:51,460 --> 02:49:52,300
Hey, can you hear me?

4351
02:49:52,300 --> 02:49:54,360
Yeah, we can hear you, and we can see you.

4352
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:55,420
Hey, hello.

4353
02:49:55,420 --> 02:49:56,740
Hi, it's Brozime.

4354
02:49:56,740 --> 02:49:57,740
Brozime!

4355
02:49:57,740 --> 02:49:59,940
Hey, is this your first time calling the show?

4356
02:49:59,940 --> 02:50:00,780
Yeah, yes.

4357
02:50:00,780 --> 02:50:01,620
That is two first time calls?

4358
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:02,620
Completely the first time.

4359
02:50:02,620 --> 02:50:05,340
Actually, I think it's my first time here being live at all.

4360
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:06,180
Oh my gosh.

4361
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:08,120
The people are coming in the new crowd.

4362
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:08,960
The people are coming to see Dan.

4363
02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:10,460
Were you here just to see Dan?

4364
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:12,260
Just say yes.

4365
02:50:12,260 --> 02:50:13,980
I think the first time I heard Dan,

4366
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:16,780
since I've only been listening since like episode 500,

4367
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:20,100
was just a voice in the background yelling at you.

4368
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:21,420
That is, because I was asking.

4369
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:22,260
That's about accurate.

4370
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:23,100
I believe the quote was,

4371
02:50:23,100 --> 02:50:23,940
What's up, bitches?

4372
02:50:23,940 --> 02:50:24,760
Sup, bitches?

4373
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:25,600
Yeah, because...

4374
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:26,500
Oh yeah, that sounds about right.

4375
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:28,300
Dan had brought over a bed.

4376
02:50:28,300 --> 02:50:30,140
When Jamie and Dan moved, they had an extra bed,

4377
02:50:30,140 --> 02:50:31,300
so they brought it over to this house,

4378
02:50:31,300 --> 02:50:32,380
because we have all this space now.

4379
02:50:32,380 --> 02:50:34,340
So yeah, that was the episode they brought it over.

4380
02:50:34,340 --> 02:50:36,180
When we brought Shane something to sleep on.

4381
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:37,840
Yeah, you guys definitely don't want to hear

4382
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:38,900
about the beds in my house.

4383
02:50:38,900 --> 02:50:40,860
I want to hear about what you want to say tonight.

4384
02:50:40,860 --> 02:50:42,220
What's up?

4385
02:50:42,220 --> 02:50:43,380
Uh, not much.

4386
02:50:43,380 --> 02:50:46,240
Got off work early and was able to make it home

4387
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:48,540
to be in chat whenever you guys are reading emails and stuff.

4388
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:50,220
So I missed the first part of the show,

4389
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:53,660
but I'm glad I got to hear like the majority, I guess.

4390
02:50:53,660 --> 02:50:55,580
Yeah, we've been having live stream drops anyway.

4391
02:50:55,580 --> 02:50:57,380
Wait, so you're like EA Skis.

4392
02:50:57,380 --> 02:50:58,860
You don't have any comments on what's going on?

4393
02:50:58,860 --> 02:51:00,580
What's your favorite Genesis game?

4394
02:51:00,580 --> 02:51:02,420
Ha.

4395
02:51:02,420 --> 02:51:03,740
Well, please tell us your favorite Genesis game

4396
02:51:03,740 --> 02:51:05,900
if you don't got nothing better to say.

4397
02:51:06,580 --> 02:51:07,740
I think it was Sonic 2.

4398
02:51:07,740 --> 02:51:09,100
Okay, good. That's valid.

4399
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:11,420
Sonic 2 is a great game.

4400
02:51:11,420 --> 02:51:14,280
I think Sonic 2 is the only Sega Genesis game

4401
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:16,020
I played though at a friend's house.

4402
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:17,740
It is the best selling game,

4403
02:51:17,740 --> 02:51:20,100
I believe for the Sega Genesis.

4404
02:51:20,100 --> 02:51:23,500
It is the best selling game of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.

4405
02:51:23,500 --> 02:51:26,060
And it's also probably one of the most like

4406
02:51:26,060 --> 02:51:28,600
speculated about games in terms of beta versions

4407
02:51:28,600 --> 02:51:29,440
in the history of games.

4408
02:51:29,440 --> 02:51:31,500
And it's also one of the most cursed at versions

4409
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:33,460
because of the chemical plant.

4410
02:51:33,460 --> 02:51:34,420
Chemical plant zone.

4411
02:51:34,420 --> 02:51:35,740
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

4412
02:51:36,460 --> 02:51:37,500
And that's like stage two.

4413
02:51:37,500 --> 02:51:39,380
So you mentioned you had to go to a friend's to play it.

4414
02:51:39,380 --> 02:51:40,620
Were you a Super Nintendo guy?

4415
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:42,060
Or let me guess, you're probably-

4416
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:42,900
Oh yeah.

4417
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:44,220
Okay, I was gonna say, you're probably young enough

4418
02:51:44,220 --> 02:51:47,140
where you only had a PlayStation or something.

4419
02:51:47,140 --> 02:51:51,100
Well, the weird thing is that I had a Super Nintendo

4420
02:51:51,100 --> 02:51:54,180
like while the N64 was out.

4421
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:55,220
Okay.

4422
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:57,620
So I was just like late to the party basically

4423
02:51:57,620 --> 02:52:02,180
because my parents had the, not N64, Super Nintendo.

4424
02:52:02,180 --> 02:52:05,700
So I was playing that for ages before I got an N64.

4425
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:08,260
So what was your favorite Super Nintendo game?

4426
02:52:08,260 --> 02:52:10,180
Favorite Super Nintendo game was definitely

4427
02:52:10,180 --> 02:52:12,220
looks like the original Legend of Zelda.

4428
02:52:12,220 --> 02:52:13,780
Like that was my favorite game.

4429
02:52:13,780 --> 02:52:15,580
Well, the original Legend of Zelda was NES.

4430
02:52:15,580 --> 02:52:17,580
But if you're talking about a Link to the Past.

4431
02:52:17,580 --> 02:52:19,100
The Link to the Past, sorry.

4432
02:52:19,100 --> 02:52:21,160
That is, to be fair, that's the second best answer

4433
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:22,480
you could give next to Super Metroid.

4434
02:52:22,480 --> 02:52:23,780
That's another game I cussed out a whole lot.

4435
02:52:23,780 --> 02:52:25,660
I did play a lot of Super Metroid,

4436
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:27,860
but when I was little, I had no hope

4437
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:29,700
of completing Super Metroid.

4438
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:30,840
That's fair.

4439
02:52:30,840 --> 02:52:33,300
And to the chatters, yes, I am saying

4440
02:52:33,300 --> 02:52:34,940
those are better answers than Chrono Trigger.

4441
02:52:35,060 --> 02:52:35,900
Sorry about it.

4442
02:52:35,900 --> 02:52:36,900
Damn right.

4443
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:37,740
Sorry, not sorry.

4444
02:52:37,740 --> 02:52:40,020
I didn't play Chrono Trigger until like

4445
02:52:40,020 --> 02:52:42,460
after I was already done with my N64.

4446
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:45,120
I like this guy.

4447
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:47,720
That was a game I didn't, I had no idea.

4448
02:52:47,720 --> 02:52:49,620
I had no idea about Chrono Trigger

4449
02:52:49,620 --> 02:52:52,240
until like I was so much older

4450
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:53,580
than whenever I had been playing

4451
02:52:53,580 --> 02:52:55,780
like my Super Nintendo originally.

4452
02:52:55,780 --> 02:52:56,760
It was silly.

4453
02:52:57,940 --> 02:52:58,780
All right.

4454
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:00,840
Bobby's in chat saying,

4455
02:53:00,840 --> 02:53:03,000
I'm gonna take down Rob's internet for reals.

4456
02:53:03,360 --> 02:53:06,400
Great, I'm gonna get a DLS attack

4457
02:53:06,400 --> 02:53:07,240
during the show.

4458
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:08,720
Chrono Trigger is such a good game.

4459
02:53:08,720 --> 02:53:10,240
I'm not dissing Chrono Trigger.

4460
02:53:10,240 --> 02:53:13,400
I like to poke fun at you crazed foamy fanboys.

4461
02:53:13,400 --> 02:53:16,160
I never, never have purchased Chrono Trigger

4462
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:17,660
because my friend left it at my house

4463
02:53:17,660 --> 02:53:18,940
and then he moved to another town

4464
02:53:18,940 --> 02:53:20,780
and then I moved out here with it.

4465
02:53:20,780 --> 02:53:22,920
Then I married her so it became community property

4466
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:26,040
and now it's just as much fun as whoever she stole it from.

4467
02:53:26,040 --> 02:53:28,160
You ever come after it, I will kill you.

4468
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:29,820
I have never played Chrono Trigger.

4469
02:53:29,820 --> 02:53:32,280
However, no prenup.

4470
02:53:32,400 --> 02:53:34,800
So we have 50% ownership of everything.

4471
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:38,480
So that means I also have half the copy of Dracula X

4472
02:53:38,480 --> 02:53:41,240
and all of those boxed SNES games.

4473
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:43,320
I usually need to play half of Dracula X.

4474
02:53:43,320 --> 02:53:45,580
She has that game with the fricking dish.

4475
02:53:46,520 --> 02:53:47,360
Yes, I do.

4476
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:49,220
The Cardcaptor Sakura game.

4477
02:53:49,220 --> 02:53:50,060
I love that game.

4478
02:53:50,060 --> 02:53:51,160
I'm gonna play it.

4479
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:52,000
All right.

4480
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:53,440
Isn't there a Cardcaptor Sakura anime?

4481
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:54,600
Quick, hang up.

4482
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:56,480
All right now, Brozime quick,

4483
02:53:56,480 --> 02:53:59,000
any last thoughts before we let you go?

4484
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:00,560
Thanks for reading my email

4485
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:02,720
and talking about my channel, I guess.

4486
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:05,360
I just started doing it like a while ago.

4487
02:54:05,360 --> 02:54:06,920
So anyone that wants to go check that out

4488
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:07,960
can go check that out.

4489
02:54:07,960 --> 02:54:09,960
And it's fun, I guess.

4490
02:54:09,960 --> 02:54:10,800
I don't know.

4491
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:11,620
I've been playing Nazgoth recently.

4492
02:54:11,620 --> 02:54:12,460
I just came out on Steam.

4493
02:54:12,460 --> 02:54:13,880
Wait, hold up a sign with your address on it.

4494
02:54:13,880 --> 02:54:14,860
It's not a video show.

4495
02:54:14,860 --> 02:54:16,360
We see the video, they don't.

4496
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:18,200
So we'll have to put it out there.

4497
02:54:18,200 --> 02:54:19,760
Oh yeah, that's hilarious.

4498
02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:21,320
Dan, only one plug a show.

4499
02:54:21,320 --> 02:54:24,320
We used to have a video.

4500
02:54:24,320 --> 02:54:25,480
Yeah, back in the day we did.

4501
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:26,320
That was awesome.

4502
02:54:26,320 --> 02:54:27,160
Yeah, it was all right.

4503
02:54:27,160 --> 02:54:28,360
Remember we played Street Fighter on it?

4504
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:29,200
Yeah.

4505
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:30,020
That's so cool.

4506
02:54:30,620 --> 02:54:32,660
All right, Brozime, are you still there, Brozime?

4507
02:54:32,660 --> 02:54:34,340
His video froze up.

4508
02:54:34,340 --> 02:54:37,020
Is Brozime, uh-oh, there's a problem with this call.

4509
02:54:37,020 --> 02:54:39,620
Or did our entire internet just crap out again?

4510
02:54:39,620 --> 02:54:40,460
Is that the problem?

4511
02:54:40,460 --> 02:54:41,560
It's Bobby gotcha.

4512
02:54:41,560 --> 02:54:42,500
Yeah, oh yeah.

4513
02:54:42,500 --> 02:54:43,700
Fucking Bobby.

4514
02:54:44,780 --> 02:54:46,060
All right, I think he came back,

4515
02:54:46,060 --> 02:54:46,900
but we were wrapping it up.

4516
02:54:46,900 --> 02:54:48,220
Sorry about that, don't know what happened.

4517
02:54:48,220 --> 02:54:49,140
I don't know what happened either.

4518
02:54:49,140 --> 02:54:49,980
I'll blame the internet.

4519
02:54:49,980 --> 02:54:51,660
All right, but Brozime, we are gonna let you go

4520
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:53,460
so we can wrap up the show, but have a good night.

4521
02:54:53,460 --> 02:54:54,540
All right, sounds good, you guys too.

4522
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:55,420
All right, later.

4523
02:54:56,420 --> 02:55:00,060
Ah, if it's not the frickin' feed sending

4524
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:03,020
to the Shoutcast server, then it's Skype,

4525
02:55:03,020 --> 02:55:04,500
and if it's not that, then it's this.

4526
02:55:04,500 --> 02:55:06,580
All right, sorry to those that didn't get through,

4527
02:55:06,580 --> 02:55:08,500
because nobody called for five minutes,

4528
02:55:08,500 --> 02:55:10,060
and all of a sudden it was lighting up on fire,

4529
02:55:10,060 --> 02:55:11,420
so there's a few people that didn't get through.

4530
02:55:11,420 --> 02:55:12,820
Please consider sending us an email.

4531
02:55:12,820 --> 02:55:15,640
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

4532
02:55:15,640 --> 02:55:17,820
Give Dark Soccer some work to do.

4533
02:55:17,820 --> 02:55:19,180
Anyhow, that is about it.

4534
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:20,220
We're gonna wrap up the show.

4535
02:55:20,220 --> 02:55:21,420
We were done with last minute stories.

4536
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:23,180
We got the Twitter stuff.

4537
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:25,260
So, actually, wait, no, we didn't finish the Twitter stuff,

4538
02:55:25,940 --> 02:55:27,940
because I had one other tweet I wanted to read here

4539
02:55:27,940 --> 02:55:31,180
from our old pal, Pika Uno had sent something to.

4540
02:55:31,180 --> 02:55:33,320
Oh yes, it was about the whole TV tax,

4541
02:55:33,320 --> 02:55:35,660
because last week we talked about TV tax overseas,

4542
02:55:35,660 --> 02:55:39,220
and Pika Uno does live in what I call London land,

4543
02:55:39,220 --> 02:55:41,620
and Pika Uno says, it's not the TV tax,

4544
02:55:41,620 --> 02:55:44,060
it's the license fee, and no, you'll still have

4545
02:55:44,060 --> 02:55:46,200
to pay the license fee to watch any live TV.

4546
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:48,460
The important difference is that this is how the BBC

4547
02:55:48,460 --> 02:55:50,580
is funded, directly by the public,

4548
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:52,460
not through the government.

4549
02:55:52,460 --> 02:55:55,020
So, a minor correction there too.

4550
02:55:55,660 --> 02:55:57,180
Probably some other Downton Abbey tangent

4551
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:58,140
we went on last week.

4552
02:55:58,140 --> 02:56:00,540
All right, anyway, that is it.

4553
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:02,640
We're gonna wrap up here at Orange Laundry Radio.

4554
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:04,100
Hey, thanks you guys for listening to the show.

4555
02:56:04,100 --> 02:56:05,020
Really appreciate it.

4556
02:56:05,020 --> 02:56:06,980
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio

4557
02:56:06,980 --> 02:56:08,200
and you stuck with us the whole show,

4558
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:11,060
why not tell a friend or two or 17 about our program

4559
02:56:11,060 --> 02:56:11,960
and help spread the word,

4560
02:56:11,960 --> 02:56:14,560
because you're all we got is word of mouth.

4561
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:17,380
We don't have a major magazine backing us.

4562
02:56:17,380 --> 02:56:19,300
We don't have demo discs of OLR out there.

4563
02:56:19,300 --> 02:56:21,660
Actually, 1E3, we did have OLR demo discs,

4564
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:22,500
now that I think about it.

4565
02:56:22,500 --> 02:56:23,540
I still have some.

4566
02:56:23,540 --> 02:56:26,460
I was gonna say, those will be collector's items someday,

4567
02:56:26,460 --> 02:56:28,380
Loki, when we're big and famous.

4568
02:56:28,380 --> 02:56:31,700
All right, anyway, that's about gonna do it,

4569
02:56:31,700 --> 02:56:33,580
but I wanna say, Dan, thank you for being here.

4570
02:56:33,580 --> 02:56:36,260
Always fun, even if you're kind of a dick sometimes.

4571
02:56:36,260 --> 02:56:37,100
No, I'm kidding.

4572
02:56:37,100 --> 02:56:40,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got me, you got me.

4573
02:56:40,480 --> 02:56:43,420
But I'm glad you could be here for the Sega Genesis

4574
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:44,980
and Mega Drive look back episode.

4575
02:56:44,980 --> 02:56:46,860
It seems oddly appropriate.

4576
02:56:46,860 --> 02:56:49,420
Any last thoughts for our listeners tonight, Dan?

4577
02:56:49,420 --> 02:56:50,260
No.

4578
02:56:50,260 --> 02:56:51,540
And also, actually, this is also very important.

4579
02:56:51,580 --> 02:56:53,300
Do you have anything you wanna plug?

4580
02:56:53,300 --> 02:56:55,780
You have like a Twitter or a podcast of your own?

4581
02:56:55,780 --> 02:56:56,620
Everybody has podcasts these days.

4582
02:56:56,620 --> 02:56:58,740
You guys should listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

4583
02:56:58,740 --> 02:57:01,420
My wife is on it and her friends.

4584
02:57:01,420 --> 02:57:03,420
It's pretty amazing.

4585
02:57:03,420 --> 02:57:05,200
They do it all the time.

4586
02:57:05,200 --> 02:57:08,120
And I mean, it's a little pedantic sometimes,

4587
02:57:08,120 --> 02:57:10,500
but in general, it's worth listening to.

4588
02:57:10,500 --> 02:57:11,540
In general.

4589
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:12,780
All right, thank you, Dan.

4590
02:57:12,780 --> 02:57:13,740
Come back any time.

4591
02:57:14,620 --> 02:57:15,860
Anyhow, but not Labor Day weekend,

4592
02:57:15,860 --> 02:57:16,940
because we will be here.

4593
02:57:16,940 --> 02:57:17,780
Neither will I.

4594
02:57:17,780 --> 02:57:18,600
All right.

4595
02:57:18,600 --> 02:57:20,020
Let's see, Darkstar.

4596
02:57:20,020 --> 02:57:20,860
You know what?

4597
02:57:20,860 --> 02:57:22,060
That's our anniversary weekend.

4598
02:57:22,060 --> 02:57:23,100
Oh, there you go.

4599
02:57:23,100 --> 02:57:25,180
The spouse and I will have been married for nine years.

4600
02:57:25,180 --> 02:57:26,700
You going to Disneyland or something?

4601
02:57:26,700 --> 02:57:27,540
No.

4602
02:57:27,540 --> 02:57:28,380
All right.

4603
02:57:28,380 --> 02:57:29,200
You can?

4604
02:57:29,200 --> 02:57:30,040
Yeah, you can.

4605
02:57:32,780 --> 02:57:33,620
That's funny.

4606
02:57:33,620 --> 02:57:35,260
Rob's paying for himself to go to Dragon Con.

4607
02:57:35,260 --> 02:57:36,900
Yeah, I'm going to Atlanta

4608
02:57:36,900 --> 02:57:39,180
to get some of the Sue's infamous gummy bears.

4609
02:57:39,180 --> 02:57:40,500
That's the only reason I go.

4610
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:41,420
That's the only reason I go.

4611
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:43,260
All right, Darkstar, I had to follow Dan here

4612
02:57:43,260 --> 02:57:44,780
with your final thought tonight.

4613
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:46,700
Even though I was super full when we got here,

4614
02:57:46,700 --> 02:57:49,260
I'm super hungry now and really want a fish burrito.

4615
02:57:51,020 --> 02:57:55,020
I'm a good Mexican place like El Forstero.

4616
02:57:56,420 --> 02:57:58,940
My final thought is, now you mentioned that place,

4617
02:57:58,940 --> 02:58:00,300
now I'm craving tortilla chips.

4618
02:58:00,300 --> 02:58:01,600
Damn you.

4619
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:02,440
Damn you.

4620
02:58:02,440 --> 02:58:03,260
All right.

4621
02:58:03,260 --> 02:58:05,200
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.

4622
02:58:05,200 --> 02:58:09,380
My final thought tonight is I should play more games.

4623
02:58:09,380 --> 02:58:10,220
You should.

4624
02:58:10,220 --> 02:58:11,060
Word.

4625
02:58:11,060 --> 02:58:11,900
Because I haven't played any games.

4626
02:58:11,900 --> 02:58:12,740
How about everybody?

4627
02:58:12,740 --> 02:58:13,860
It's the OLR challenge.

4628
02:58:13,860 --> 02:58:16,640
Everybody play one new game this week.

4629
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:18,140
Play something new.

4630
02:58:18,140 --> 02:58:18,980
Yeah.

4631
02:58:19,260 --> 02:58:20,980
Be jeweled, Jesus Christ.

4632
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:22,700
Bonus points if it's indie.

4633
02:58:22,700 --> 02:58:23,540
All right.

4634
02:58:23,540 --> 02:58:24,860
That does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

4635
02:58:24,860 --> 02:58:26,180
We will be back next week

4636
02:58:26,180 --> 02:58:28,420
before our little break for Labor Day.

4637
02:58:28,420 --> 02:58:30,280
So 565 next week.

4638
02:58:30,280 --> 02:58:33,300
We're inching closer and closer to episode 573.

4639
02:58:33,300 --> 02:58:34,140
You know, I gotta be honest.

4640
02:58:34,140 --> 02:58:35,740
I never thought we'd get that high,

4641
02:58:35,740 --> 02:58:37,740
but that is something that's gonna be happening in October,

4642
02:58:37,740 --> 02:58:38,580
believe it or not.

4643
02:58:38,580 --> 02:58:39,400
All right, that does it.

4644
02:58:39,400 --> 02:58:40,440
Have a great week, everybody.

4645
02:58:40,440 --> 02:58:41,820
We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio.

4646
02:58:41,820 --> 02:58:42,800
