7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Not content with the masses of viewers controlling Red's destiny, one streamer wagered as Fish was capable of beating Pokemon as well.
19000	22000	And for you non-adventure fans, you can watch Two Fish playing Street Fighter 2 instead.
22000	27000	Stay tuned for all the updates to the non-Fishy gaming news, your comments, and phone calls on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live with this episode number 565 for August 24th, 2014.
44000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts here in studio.
51000	54000	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	56000	Sup bitches.
56000	58000	How are you DarkSakura?
58000	60000	I'm um, sedate.
60000	62000	Sedate?
62000	64000	Oddly sedate.
64000	66000	But that doesn't mean you're like actually asleep, you're just...
66000	72000	No, it means that I've spent my last month like a sprung coil.
72000	74000	And the coil has sprung.
74000	76000	Right.
76000	78000	And now it's sort of in its relaxed state.
78000	84000	I see, so it's like you kinda, you've been winding up anticipation, anticipation, and now relax, right?
84000	88000	Hopefully not descending toward entropy, like Shane.
88000	90000	Alright, yeah.
90000	94000	I think I agree with Shane though, I think that we need naps.
94000	97000	I know, this is the OLR Siesta show tonight, we'll see.
97000	101000	Alright, well not joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki is not here tonight.
101000	105000	I gotta be honest, I'm not exactly sure why he's not here, I just got a tweet from him saying he wouldn't be coming.
105000	112000	I think that means family related things that he probably forgot about, so we wish Loki well wherever he's at.
112000	115000	But he should be back in two weeks when we are live again.
115000	121000	As a reminder, we're not gonna be live next week over the Labor Day holiday, I'll remind people what's going on in just a moment.
121000	125000	But filling in for Loki tonight, say hello to Shane is joining us.
125000	126000	Hello.
126000	127000	Hey Shane, are you okay?
127000	128000	I'm so tired.
128000	129000	You're tired?
129000	131000	Yes, it's almost my bedtime.
131000	132000	Do you want coffee?
132000	133000	No, that's disgusting.
133000	137000	You can't do the show completely trying to fall asleep, I thought you were gonna be good.
137000	141000	I promised Shane that I would bring him cold brew coffee to see if he likes it better.
141000	143000	I'm just really tired.
143000	144000	Really?
144000	145000	Yes.
145000	149000	I'm gonna bring it to you at work in a flask so that you'll get asked by HR why you have a flask at your desk.
149000	151000	Alright, well I need you to pep up, Shane.
151000	153000	This is me at like a ten.
153000	158000	Okay, okay. No, no, no, no. I know how to turn Shane up to a ten. This is what I'm gonna do.
158000	168000	I am the nicest guy, bestest pal in the whole wide world, so before we get to video game chat, and there's a lot of game chat to get to tonight.
168000	176000	To help Shane pep up tonight, I'm gonna give Shane 60 seconds to say anything he wants about Power Rangers.
176000	177000	Alright, ready?
177000	178000	Can I start now?
178000	179000	Go.
179000	185000	They have Power Morphicon this weekend and it looks so good and they announced a new cast of Dino Charge and the Black Ranger's really hot.
185000	187000	There, that's really all I have to say.
187000	189000	Wow, wow, you did that nine, nine, nine seconds.
189000	191000	But it didn't really wake me up.
191000	193000	Shane, that was supposed to get you excited.
193000	197000	When we both have the same day off, do you want to marathon Mega Ranger with me?
197000	199000	Yeah, I could watch that. I haven't seen that one yet.
199000	201000	Because the Japanese one was the best.
201000	204000	You should watch Gokaiger. That's really good too.
204000	208000	I also have the Mega Ranger vs. Car Ranger movie on Laserdisc.
208000	209000	Car Ranger.
209000	211000	Shane, you're gonna have to speak up or something.
211000	213000	Why? They can't even hear me?
213000	215000	Just because you're so tired.
215000	217000	That's how I normally sound anyway.
217000	219000	Much better, much better.
219000	225000	Rob, we're gonna do it over here too so that when you come home, you'll be greeted by lots of Sendai.
225000	228000	Oh, is that what you're gonna do while I'm out of town in Atlanta?
228000	231000	No, it's what I'm gonna do when Shane and I have the same days off again.
231000	235000	Or when I have the same days off as Shane because my schedule's changing.
235000	244000	Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, immediately after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
244000	248000	And we have some people indulging Shane in Power Rangers chat.
248000	251000	Let's talk about Power Rangers. That will wake me up.
251000	259000	Captain Spike from gamebuoy.org, we love gamebuoy.org, Captain Spike says, I don't agree, re Black Ranger, whatever.
259000	261000	But he did give a nice hearty yass to the...
261000	268000	What? The Black Ranger's so hot. And he's from New Zealand, so you know he's got a really good accent.
268000	270000	Let's see...
270000	274000	And I may have watched an episode of Legend of the Seeker last night because he was on it.
274000	279000	Tigerclaw asks, where was Shane when the earthquake hit? It wasn't big enough to wake Rob.
279000	281000	Yeah, it was a big earthquake in North Calpins.
281000	283000	Yeah, I didn't know about it until I saw it.
283000	285000	I found out from my mother in Alabama.
285000	289000	We appreciate you guys being concerned because I did get a few tweets about it. We appreciate the concern.
289000	292000	But it was in Napa, which is a good hundred miles to the west, northwest.
292000	294000	It should have been closer.
294000	296000	My mom's like, I love earthquakes.
296000	301000	It happened in San Francisco. Call your friends, make sure they're alive. Are you okay?
301000	306000	Did you feel it was like, Mom, I went to bed at four in the morning after playing Final Fantasy all day.
306000	312000	I didn't feel anything. I didn't know anything. And between you and the cat, I'm never gonna sleep again.
312000	314000	I love my mom, though.
314000	318000	Bobby Blackwolf says, when is Shane not really tired other than Pokemon launch day?
318000	324000	I'm super tired on Pokemon launch day because I'm usually up all night to get Pokemon at midnight.
324000	326000	He's up all night to get pokies.
326000	328000	He's up all night to get pokies.
328000	331000	That actually sounds really dirty.
331000	333000	Why do you think I said it?
333000	336000	Oh, God. Somebody's gonna crop that and do something horrible with it.
336000	343000	I'm very sad, though, because the next Power Morphicon is in 2016, I think they said.
343000	346000	I'd have to double check. That's two years.
346000	347000	I'm sorry.
347000	353000	I will go because they're gonna talk about the movie, and I bet Dino Charge Black will be there.
353000	358000	And I'm going to have to drug him and take him to a hotel room.
358000	363000	Misty in chat says, Shane, dude, one of my friends is gonna cosplay a ranger from the train theme series at Wizard Chicago.
363000	365000	Tokijer's the best.
365000	367000	I must link you to pics when I have them.
367000	369000	I did like Mudgey Ranger.
369000	371000	I didn't watch that one.
371000	372000	That one was okay.
372000	376000	And then, let's see, lastly, we'll say, actdeft says, Shane needs to be angry to sound more eager.
376000	377000	That's true.
377000	380000	What makes you angry right now?
382000	384000	Being kept awake.
384000	386000	Yeah, being kept awake.
386000	388000	Well, good, this should be an entertaining three hours.
388000	390000	Alright, we'll try to get into it.
390000	392000	We're gonna get into the show tonight.
392000	394000	He's sliding off of the chair.
394000	396000	Well, sit up, because we got gaming news to discuss.
396000	398000	So, I want to start off with tonight's kickoff topic.
398000	401000	So, where to begin with this?
401000	411000	So, it's no secret, guys, it's been a really weird, crazy, drama, like, sands through the hourglass,
411000	415000	this is the games of our lives type of week in the gaming world.
415000	419000	And I just, here's the thing.
419000	427000	I kind of think the gaming industry is so much bigger than the perception that some of us hardcore fans have of it.
427000	434000	To kind of put this into perspective, Diablo 3, the Ultimate Evil Edition, came out on PlayStation 4 this week,
434000	439000	and I was so busy playing it all night, I think Wednesday or Thursday, one night this week,
439000	441000	that apparently a bunch of drama broke out.
441000	445000	I missed all of it because I was playing games.
445000	448000	And I'm kind of thankful in that regard.
448000	450000	And some of you guys might be sitting there going,
450000	452000	Drama? What drama? There's drama going on? I don't want to...
452000	457000	And honestly, if that's you, trust me, ignorance is bliss.
457000	461000	Ain't nobody got time for that when it comes to a lot of this other stuff that's going on.
461000	464000	Like, I just, I can't. I'm not, I'm unable to.
464000	468000	I cannot even. I can't odd either. It's just, it's, oh my gosh.
468000	476000	So, one good thing that came out of a lot of this stuff that's going on is there was a really cool little hashtag that was on Twitter.
476000	482000	And the next day on Twitter, I saw this floating around. It was hashtag WeLoveGameDevs.
482000	485000	Are you sure it wasn't hashtag ZackAttack?
485000	487000	I think that was trending too.
487000	489000	Yeah, it was.
489000	491000	Oh, now there's a topic that gets you excited.
491000	496000	I won't talk about Zack. I'm a big brother for hours.
496000	505000	But, you know, I love this hashtag WeLoveGameDevs because it really got people to talk about why is it that we are so enthusiastic about games?
505000	512000	Because there's a lot of people out there that will claim to do things because they like video games.
512000	516000	But then I kind of look back and go, but you're hurting games with the things.
517000	523000	How can you do that on one hand and on the other say, oh, I'm trying to protect the game industry?
523000	530000	It's like, from what? The game industry is so much bigger than what you see on Twitter, on Facebook, on Instagram, and all this stuff.
530000	536000	So, I just, I don't know. I want to play games. I like games. I enjoy games.
536000	541000	And I don't, by games, I don't fucking mean mind games. Like, I'm too old for that shit.
541000	547000	So, let's talk about video games and why we here at OLR love game devs, too.
547000	551000	Because I sent out a tweet. I thought that was a really nice little positive tweet.
551000	556000	Because, you know, full disclosure, it's no secret. Yes, I do this show, Orange Lawns Radio.
556000	560000	This is a, you know, gaming enthusiast podcast, I guess some would call it.
560000	562000	And we've been doing this for, what, 12 years.
562000	569000	But thanks to having done this show, I've had the opportunity to make friends in the industry in all different types.
569000	573000	I have friends that do the journalism stuff. I have friends that make games.
573000	579000	Heck, Shane, you used to, I mean, it's no secret, you used to do game development of sorts, right?
579000	583000	And you did DDR with Konami for a while, right?
583000	585000	Yes, among other things.
585000	590000	Which can sometimes bring an interesting dynamic into what we do here on OLR.
590000	595000	Because, you know, I have to kind of take a step, I have to be, you know, there's Rob the friend,
596000	604000	and then I have to take a step back and be Rob the, you know, amateur analyst for, I guess, lack of a better term,
604000	606000	and be able to talk objectively.
606000	607000	An alrapist?
607000	610000	Yeah. What did you just call me? Shut up.
610000	612000	You know what that's from, right?
612000	613000	Yeah, shut up.
613000	618000	So, you know, I have to be able to take a step back and kind of look at, like, all this stuff, you know, objectively.
618000	625000	So, but I know there's so many people out there that really love games and making games and doing this,
625000	629000	and I think there's a lot of positive stuff that goes on in the industry, too.
629000	633000	So I just wanted to talk about, like, why do you guys love video games?
633000	638000	So, Jamie, why do you love videos? Why do you do this show?
638000	641000	You know, we've been doing this for 12 years. Why do you do this show every week for 12 years?
641000	643000	What is it about video games that you love?
643000	644000	The shipping.
648000	651000	It's the garris cross shepherd, is what's been keeping you here.
651000	657000	No. I really do like the bigger phantom communities that have built up around games now,
657000	665000	because we used to not really have much of that when, you know, all I was doing was screaming at playing that god-awful,
665000	669000	super-difficult Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on the Nintendo,
669000	673000	and the fucking water level where you get electrocuted.
673000	675000	No, back then it was spite.
675000	680000	Back then, I loved games because I was a spiteful, spiteful little human being,
680000	685000	and I told the games I would defeat them, and lo and behold, one day I beat the guardian legend.
687000	690000	It was also...
690000	699000	This is going to sound really stupid and neo-rad-femme in a way I don't want it to,
699000	707000	but I really did get a big kick out of being a girl in the late 80s and early 90s that played video games,
707000	713000	when not many other girls were really that into it at the time, or at least weren't supposed to be into it.
713000	722000	I felt like, for me, it was something different that I didn't have to share with anybody else,
722000	726000	and it was a behavior that wasn't expected of me,
726000	733000	so it was a combination of a really good escape and a minor form of rebellion.
733000	739000	Interesting. That's a very neat thing that you say there, too,
739000	744000	because I think I felt some similarities in the expectations.
744000	750000	Not that I'm going to claim to know exactly, but I feel like there are some similarities with me having been a gay guy,
750000	756000	that there are certain expectations about, oh, I should be listening to Madonna and be into fashion,
756000	760000	and I'm not really that kind of guy. Well, Madonna's okay, I guess.
760000	768000	You know what I mean? If you saw where I live, I don't live in a well-decorated house.
768000	771000	You know what I mean? I'm a nerd at heart.
771000	773000	You do have a lot of IKEA furniture.
773000	774000	I do, but IKEA is-
774000	775000	Which is a hallmark of the gay.
775000	779000	IKEA is Lego for adults.
779000	780000	Anyway.
780000	785000	No, but that was part of it, and then I just kept sticking with the stuff that I loved,
785000	792000	and came through all the various games, and then I eventually made my transition to PC gaming,
792000	799000	and then after that, really what kept me in a lot of the games was the fandoms for some of the newer games,
799000	807000	because I could sit and play a casual game, and keep in mind, we had casual games in the 80s and 90s,
807000	813000	but they couldn't be truly casual, because they cost a bunch of money,
813000	817000	but they're the same type of games that we're seeing as casual games now.
817000	825000	So we had those waste of time games, and then once they became more readily available,
825000	832000	they stopped being this big classic concept, and we started looking to games to have more substance to them.
832000	837000	What we would call a real game now is something that's got an engaging story,
837000	845000	or something that is going to be a point A to point Z type of story.
845000	854000	You know, so I think the definition of what has become a true game versus something casual
854000	859000	has evolved with technology, and with our expectations now that we've grown into the genre.
859000	866000	So it's really a part of, I guess in the end, part of it's a social experiment too, for me.
866000	871000	I'm going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, reading some of these, and then I'll go over to Shane.
871000	874000	Code Man says, Video games put me in another world.
874000	878000	They take me out of this fucked world we live in and put us into something that we enjoy, a fantasy.
878000	883000	Final Fantasy XIV, for example, has given me a place to go hang out with people I love and have a good time.
883000	887000	Dungeon Buster says, I love games because I thought they were a different form of storytelling,
887000	889000	and that was exciting to me.
889000	893000	Bochakawa says, Video games give me goals and rules that make sense,
893000	897000	in a world that doesn't let me make goals and rules that are taken too far.
897000	899000	That's some powerful stuff, you guys.
899000	904000	Shane, what do you love about video games? Why have you been into games for so long?
904000	907000	You worked in the industry. What made you want to do that?
907000	913000	Because it's fun. I don't really have some in-depth or deep reasoning.
913000	915000	You don't have to. Just an honest answer is fine.
915000	921000	They're fun. They're enjoyable. There you go. There's my answer.
921000	925000	What was the first video game that you played? Do you remember?
925000	931000	Yes. Stupid Cat in the Hat mix-up game. The Dr. Seuss one on Coleco.
931000	934000	Scared the crap out of me. Ate that game.
934000	939000	If the Cat in the Hat scared the crap out of you, how did you get from that to Video games are fun?
939000	943000	Well, because there were other games that weren't just the Dr. Seuss mix-up game.
943000	947000	Less scary ones.
947000	952000	What made you decide, I want to get a job doing...
952000	956000	What did you first do? You were doing game testing, right? And then it moved into...
956000	959000	No, I was hired to do DDR stuff.
959000	965000	Oh, okay. Well, what made you decide, this is something I want to do? I want to go into this?
965000	970000	Because it sounds like fun. If you're spending so much time already playing this stuff,
970000	975000	why not do something more and be the one on the other side, making stuff for other people to have fun with?
975000	977000	Did you learn anything from that experience?
977000	979000	About video games?
979000	983000	I guess. Video games are the development of said video games.
983000	994000	It's a lot of red tape and a lot of things that people get mad about are things that you don't have any say over and you wish you could.
994000	1000000	Do you mean when people get really angry on Twitter about certain things going on with particular games,
1000000	1005000	or in social media in general? I keep picking on Twitter, but when people get angry out there,
1005000	1013000	you're saying that they'd be surprised how little maybe people like you really have to do with things like that, is that what you're saying?
1013000	1021000	Yeah, the people that make the decisions for the most part are the people that have no real connection to making the game.
1022000	1025000	So, keep complaining. It goes nowhere.
1026000	1035000	Let's see, going to Alan Alchemy says, how did he get from that to, talking about Cat in the Hat, how did he get from that to standing for Silent Hill?
1035000	1037000	What?
1037000	1041000	How did you get from the Cat in the Hat to your Silent Hill fandom?
1042000	1053000	There's no Dr. Seuss in Silent Hill. Like, I busted out the Coleco about a year, two years ago,
1053000	1065000	and it was still working after a little bit of, you know, loving, and I put in that game and it's still scary. I don't like it. It is not fun.
1066000	1068000	You know, E.T. on Atari was scary too.
1068000	1074000	Actually, E.T. was kind of scary. Like, the original jump scare was falling in one of those fucking holes.
1074000	1078000	No, just the whole thing. Well, E.T. scared me as a kid anyway, so there's that.
1078000	1080000	Were you even alive when that movie came out?
1080000	1085000	Probably not. I don't think so, but yeah.
1085000	1089000	Okay. I think I've talked about this a little bit.
1089000	1092000	Oh, you want to know what other thing I learned while I worked at Konami?
1092000	1093000	Of course.
1093000	1099000	There's no way I can do ten Jaeger bombs in 45 minutes and be okay afterwards.
1100000	1102000	Should you really be bringing that up right now?
1102000	1106000	That wasn't during work hours, but I was working there and it was a work thing afterwards.
1106000	1108000	Fair enough, fair enough. All right.
1109000	1113000	Wait, you mean sometimes, like, co-workers hang out and stuff outside of work?
1113000	1114000	Sometimes.
1114000	1117000	You know what, I think that happens in industries that aren't just gaming either.
1117000	1119000	Nope, just gaming.
1120000	1130000	For me, I've talked a little bit about this on the show previously, but I was always really just amazed with being able to,
1130000	1135000	and it's going to make me sound like such a control freak and I can already hear Grandpa in the back of my head teasing me about this,
1135000	1141000	but I loved on the Atari 2600 that I was in control of what was on the TV screen.
1141000	1148000	And, like, that little moving square was me and I was changing the images that were on the screen with that.
1148000	1150000	What, you sound like you're going to say something?
1150000	1152000	No, how do I sound like I'm going to say something?
1152000	1154000	You look like you're going to say something.
1154000	1156000	No, I'm just trying not to fall out of the chair.
1158000	1165000	So, I loved being able to be that little square and I'm thinking of adventure in particular and it's like, you know, I can go anywhere I want.
1165000	1167000	I'm not restricted.
1167000	1170000	I'm sorry, in this game, you play as a square?
1170000	1177000	Yes, in adventure, on the Atari 2600, you were a little yellow square and you would go around and you would try to find, like, the sword that would kill you.
1177000	1179000	Was the sword also a square?
1179000	1185000	No, the sword was kind of a rectangle. Maybe a triangle a little bit.
1185000	1187000	Wow, the games you had when you were young.
1187000	1190000	You just weren't talking about the fucking ColecoVision.
1190000	1193000	Yeah, but you want to look up a video? It's frightening.
1193000	1197000	Adventure on ColecoVision, hello.
1197000	1202000	But anyway, I love being able to control that and really, like, get immersed in that world.
1203000	1214000	And even though maybe I'm not creating the story, so to speak, I still feel like at the end of the day, I'm able to kind of put myself in the shoes of that character on the screen.
1214000	1219000	And not that that character has to be, like, a carbon copy of me. I can be anyone or anything.
1219000	1220000	Unless you were a square back then.
1220000	1222000	Unless, yeah, unless I happen to look like a square.
1222000	1227000	Now I look a little more like a pear, so I don't know what game you can play a pear in. Maybe Fruit Ninja.
1227000	1229000	You don't play as Fruit Ninja.
1229000	1232000	You can be an eggplant in Kid Icarus. Remember when you got turned into an eggplant?
1232000	1234000	Yes, I'm more of an eggplant wizard.
1234000	1237000	And then you just hold down. And you didn't have feet, you were just an eggplant.
1237000	1238000	Yes, I remember that.
1238000	1245000	There's, like, an RPG on Nintendo. It had, like, Princess Tomato in it or something. Maybe there's a pear guy in there.
1245000	1254000	Maybe, maybe. Anyway, so I love being able to really immerse myself in this alternate universe.
1254000	1260000	That's what I've always really loved about games. And to see how far the technology has come is so impressive.
1260000	1265000	And, you know, remember when, like, Mode 7 first debuted on the Super Nintendo?
1265000	1270000	And we all saw, like, Pilotwings and Actraiser and things like that for the first time?
1270000	1277000	And it was like, this is so real. The graphics are so realistic. Oh my gosh. It's like a cartoon on my TV.
1277000	1281000	You know? And just to see things. I mean, now it's like you look at a Super Nintendo game and you're like,
1281000	1292000	it wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. And to see how far things have come just in what the 25-ish years since that system is so amazing.
1292000	1297000	It really makes you wonder, like, in 25 more years, like, are we going to be on the holodeck?
1297000	1300000	Or what is it going to be? How am I going to be transported away?
1300000	1305000	I mean, we're already talking about with Oculus and so forth, virtual reality making another step.
1305000	1311000	So it's just like, you know, it's going to get closer and closer to transporting us to those worlds.
1311000	1316000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1316000	1321000	Bochi Kawa says, that was pretty profound for me too, Rob. It's like, interaction.
1321000	1326000	Tigerclaw says, what about Haunted House on the Atari 2600? All you played was a pair of eyeballs.
1326000	1329000	That game was kind of scary too, actually.
1329000	1333000	Blender says, LOL Sky, I have adventure on PlayStation Home.
1333000	1338000	I didn't know that was a thing you could do. I didn't know the Atari games were there on PlayStation Home. That's pretty cool.
1338000	1341000	Too bad you have to play PlayStation Home to do it.
1341000	1345000	How mean. PlayStation Home, well, we'll get into that a little later.
1345000	1349000	You look like a pedophile in that game. No matter what, you make your character look like.
1349000	1355000	Stop. All right. Let's see. Bochi Kawa says, in Final Fantasy 6, they sang, it blew my mind.
1355000	1361000	Yeah. Oh my God. You want to talk about a story? Final Fantasy 6 was so flippin' amazing. So good.
1361000	1369000	Anyhow, just wanted to, you know, bring a little bit, kind of bring it back to what it's really about, and that is the passion for gaming.
1369000	1380000	And, you know, what kind of motivates us to be here, and what motivates you guys to listen to this podcast, and subscribe to it, and be with other gamers, and talk about these shared experiences, and so on.
1380000	1383000	Please feel free to tweet us or email us if you have more to add to this.
1383000	1389000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com, or of course we're on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1389000	1397000	All right. We're going to get into our gaming week, but first, I guess, well no, we'll do housekeeping later. I'll talk about Dragon Con and all that in a minute.
1397000	1402000	So let's get into our gaming weeks. So Dark Soccer, you want to start off? How was your gaming week? What did you play this week?
1402000	1407000	I played a bunch of Doth. I started another Shepard, a Mass Effect 3.
1407000	1408000	Yay, Shepard.
1408000	1416000	Because I have hair mods, and I'm using my hair mods now, that actually has a decent looking nape bun for Fem Shop.
1416000	1421000	And it's the one that's on all those Ashley mods that's really neat looking.
1421000	1428000	And of course Ashley's alive in my game, because Ashley's awesome. Badass.
1428000	1430000	Boo. Boo racist.
1430000	1431000	What?
1431000	1433000	Ashley's a racist.
1433000	1442000	No, she's not. She's slightly xenophobic until she actually learns that other races are trustworthy.
1442000	1444000	She learned that when she blew up in my game.
1445000	1453000	She overcomes her fuck the aliens tendencies, especially since her boss says, let's fuck the aliens.
1457000	1463000	I got to level 50 in Final Fantasy XIV and then quotey beat the game.
1463000	1466000	Congrats. Did you like that 20 minute ending?
1466000	1471000	I was chatting with Becky. I was like, no, I thought we were on the last battle.
1471000	1473000	Okay, Becky, we're on the last battle, because she was on aim with me.
1473000	1476000	And then I'm like, wait, there's more.
1476000	1482000	I was like, okay, we finally just beat, you know, whatever his name is, Gaius.
1482000	1487000	And then I was like, the fuck? What's this?
1487000	1491000	So I was like, sorry, Becky, there's still more ending to do. No, more fighting to do.
1491000	1497000	She's like, oh my God, how long is this going on? You've been playing for five hours, which is true.
1497000	1502000	And then, so finally we get through the whole thing. It was cool with, like, we had a full party for it.
1502000	1506000	Marching down in our matching Magitek armor. It was really cool.
1506000	1512000	Finally beat the game. Everyone's like, party's out, bye. And I'm like, ending.
1512000	1516000	I was like, hey, Becky, guess what? She's like, well, I was like, the ending's still happening. No.
1516000	1520000	Yeah, the ending in Final Fantasy XIV is like a good, like, 20 minutes.
1520000	1524000	And that's even skipping the full credit sequence, which nobody's going to watch the full credit sequence,
1524000	1528000	because they put every 1.0 player that was subscribed.
1528000	1534000	But they let you skip past the names. You can go to, like, the Zs and then let it play.
1534000	1536000	Yeah, that's what I did.
1536000	1546000	I was looking for people I knew. And then, like, it was, you have, like, three skippable credits. It's stupid.
1546000	1551000	And then I was like, okay, everyone's happy. I bet they're just going to, ooh, there is some shit.
1551000	1557000	Yeah, and then there's the after-credits cutscene that sets up the rest of the game.
1557000	1563000	And, like, this was my quote in the chat from when we fought the one red guy.
1563000	1572000	Way hey hey, Senpai didn't notice me. Way hey hey, I'm going to throw a tamper tantrum. Way hey, you're dead bitch.
1572000	1578000	So, did that. And so now I'm doing the end game.
1578000	1583000	And I spent, like, an hour looking for the stuff for a quest that I've already done.
1583000	1586000	Because I didn't think I'd done the die quest, and I did.
1586000	1592000	So I did the get the Japanese dance quests today, and that was it.
1592000	1595000	So yeah, doing that, more Final Fantasy.
1595000	1600000	Bravely Defart took a rest, just because I haven't been playing much games at work.
1601000	1606000	But I am, I do have, I put in my pre-order officially.
1606000	1610000	I hate using the word pre-order, because it's technically an order.
1610000	1614000	For something that's going to arrive at a later date, but it's still just an order.
1614000	1618000	I ordered Dragon Age Inquisition.
1618000	1619000	Yay.
1619000	1620000	The deluxe edition.
1620000	1621000	Yay.
1621000	1626000	And then I found out today, Varric is not romanceable.
1626000	1628000	Yay.
1628000	1631000	He's probably in a deep relationship with Bianca.
1631000	1634000	That's awkward, because that's his bow. His crossbow.
1634000	1637000	Which he talks about her like she's his mistress.
1637000	1641000	So that means I'm going to be romancing the fuck out of Vivienne.
1641000	1643000	Because she's amazing looking.
1643000	1646000	I heard her voice actress just, like, two days ago.
1646000	1649000	She's awesome. She's in Game of Thrones.
1649000	1652000	I'm going to romance the hell out of Vivienne.
1652000	1654000	Oh, but they haven't said that she's romanceable.
1654000	1656000	I know, but she better be.
1656000	1658000	Because Vivienne.
1658000	1661000	I'm just mad because I don't have a Fenris.
1661000	1666000	ActDeaf in chat is suggesting instead of pre-order, use the word reservation.
1666000	1667000	I like that better.
1667000	1673000	I reserved my copy by paying for it and ordering it to be delivered on the date of its release.
1673000	1677000	The voice actor for Fenris said that he did do some work for this new game.
1677000	1681000	So, crossing my fingers that Fenris shows up with my hawk.
1682000	1687000	SSG100Matt in chat says, how long does it take for someone on average to max level their character in Final Fantasy XIV?
1687000	1690000	That really depends on how many hours a week you're going to put into the game.
1690000	1692000	That depends on if you just sit there chatting with people.
1692000	1694000	Yeah, it really depends on your play style.
1694000	1699000	I think if you're going to put the pedal to the metal and you're going to play a good couple hours every day,
1699000	1701000	you can probably do it six weeks or less.
1701000	1703000	Depends on the class, too.
1703000	1705000	I'll put it this way.
1705000	1711000	By the time that we were at the end of beta, I already saw people running around in Magitek Bounce,
1711000	1713000	which means they'd be the game.
1713000	1716000	Yeah, so it just depends on how much you're willing to put into it.
1716000	1718000	But if you're doing more casual, it'll probably take you a couple months.
1718000	1721000	Unless you're me, then it'll take you all year.
1721000	1723000	Yeah, but you went through long stretches without playing at all.
1723000	1727000	Yeah, well I also went through long stretches of being completely pissed off at the game.
1728000	1735000	Alright, let's see. If that's it for your gaming week between Final Fantasy and all that, let's go over to Shane.
1735000	1737000	Oh, almost.
1737000	1739000	Very solitaire.
1739000	1741000	Of course, of course. Shane, how was your gaming week?
1741000	1743000	It was fine.
1743000	1745000	What'd you play?
1745000	1755000	I played PT, and I played Diablo 3 on PS4, and Final Fantasy, and that's where I'm going to stop.
1756000	1758000	Okay.
1758000	1760000	Except that he's got Pokemon going on right now.
1760000	1763000	Well, that doesn't count. That's like, Shane, did you breathe some air today?
1763000	1765000	Yeah.
1765000	1767000	Did you play Pokemon? Yeah.
1767000	1769000	Did you go to the bathroom? Yeah.
1769000	1771000	What did you think about Diablo 3?
1771000	1773000	It's better on consoles, I think.
1773000	1775000	It's just the way it handles better.
1775000	1777000	That's all it is for you, is the handling that makes it better?
1777000	1785000	Well, also my computer's not the best, so I don't have any frame rate issues or long loads.
1785000	1791000	Because you weren't sure if you were going to buy it at first, but then my copy finally got here late Tuesday night or whatever, so we were playing-
1791000	1794000	Thirty minutes after we realized. Or before we realized.
1794000	1800000	Long story. Anyway, we were playing co-op on the same screen. I didn't even realize you could do until one of my friends texted me.
1800000	1803000	Even though I said, look on the back, it says you can do it, and you ignored me.
1803000	1805000	Yeah, no, I was like, oh, that means over the internet, Shane.
1805000	1809000	No, because I specifically said, look, it's not the internet one, because the internet one is this iPhone.
1809000	1811000	And I was just like, you're wrong, Shane, you're wrong.
1811000	1813000	I'm always right. It does not happen.
1813000	1818000	In this one particular circumstance, you may have been leaning towards the correct answer.
1818000	1822000	No, always right. Ask Flaco Jones.
1822000	1827000	But then you were suddenly like, oh, I got to go get this. You were really sold on it after that one play.
1827000	1828000	Mm-hmm, yep.
1828000	1830000	And that was just the handling and so forth?
1830000	1836000	Yeah, and like I said, it performs better on the PS4 for me than my PC, because my PC's kind of garbage.
1836000	1843000	All right. Let's see, Mike gave me a week. I have also been playing a crapload of Diablo 3, Ultimate Evil Edition.
1843000	1850000	I'm up to maybe level 34, 35, which I'm sure some people are already further than that, but just in the time I had to play.
1850000	1851000	Paragon 782.
1851000	1855000	You're right. I'm sure some people are already, actually, somebody on my friends list is already 70.
1855000	1860000	But I think he did a save file from the PlayStation 3 Diablo, so anyway.
1860000	1868000	But I am enjoying Diablo 3. It's not without its flaws. It does have a few drawbacks.
1868000	1878000	Some of the art, sometimes you get hidden behind things, and you can't really see the items or anything.
1878000	1881000	So some of that art stuff is a really weird drawback.
1881000	1889000	And yeah, I think it's a little weird how you're zoomed in when you're used to the PC's perspective.
1889000	1895000	It's really kind of hard to get used to that zoomed in look. But it works.
1895000	1903000	And I just enjoy being able to plop on the couch and kind of play this mindless, what for me ends up being a beat-em-up.
1903000	1907000	Because I'm playing a barbarian, so barbarians are very kind of beat-em-up.
1907000	1911000	It's almost like I'm playing the Ninja Turtles arcade game over and over and getting loot and all that stuff.
1911000	1917000	You know what else I really don't like about Diablo 3 on console compared to PC is the interface.
1917000	1925000	I really cannot get used to the click wheel and equipping things that way as opposed to the mouse and keyboard.
1925000	1933000	But if you don't have the PC version as a frame of reference, that probably won't bug you nearly as bad as it bugged me.
1933000	1941000	And some of the inventory management actually works out a little better because you can hold more things at a time so you don't have to travel back to town quite as much.
1941000	1943000	So that part's kind of nice.
1943000	1948000	So yeah, I've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 and then I've also been playing some Final Fantasy XIV here and there.
1948000	1951000	But those two games pretty much have been eating up my week.
1951000	1956000	Maybe a couple other little things here and there, like I think I opened my 3DS to play one little thing.
1956000	1962000	I got a blue summoner jacket in Final Fantasy XIV and now that's all I'm ever going to play in that game.
1963000	1966000	You're trying to make everything blue in that game.
1966000	1970000	You're trying to make your clothes blue, now you're trying to make your chocobo blue after the last patch.
1970000	1973000	And so I will get there at one point or another.
1973000	1976000	But you tried dying your chocobo today and it turned out purple.
1976000	1977000	It was lavender purple.
1977000	1978000	Good job.
1978000	1981000	And so I killed it and started over.
1981000	1985000	No you didn't. You can't do that. You did not euthanize your chocobo.
1985000	1988000	I deserve to be for not being the right color that I wanted.
1989000	1992000	Let's see, Bochakawa says, yay, lots of D3 on everyone.
1992000	1994000	I still prefer the PC version though.
1994000	2000000	I did hear on a recent interview that Blizzard is working on doing patches for both consoles and PC at the same time.
2000000	2005000	I really hope that proves true because that was something that really disappointed me about the last versions for the Playstation game.
2005000	2009000	Well, Blizzard is really trustworthy on what they say they're going to do, so...
2009000	2011000	Well yeah, and that's why I have valid concern.
2011000	2013000	I kind of don't believe them when they say that.
2013000	2015000	Exactly, because that was so awesome.
2015000	2021000	They better hold to that because the 2.1 patch sounds really, really good and I want to play that on consoles as well.
2021000	2025000	Cial in chat says, how does Diablo 3 work on a 360?
2025000	2028000	It doesn't because who owns a 360?
2028000	2030000	Oh, there's one right there.
2030000	2032000	What's it doing? How hooked up is it?
2032000	2034000	It's not hooked up right now.
2034000	2036000	That TV doesn't even have a power core.
2036000	2038000	It'll run fine.
2038000	2040000	The Playstation 3 version was fine.
2040000	2042000	Ours isn't hooked up. You know what is hooked up?
2042000	2044000	A Sega CDX.
2044000	2046000	Better system.
2046000	2048000	It'll work fine on the 360.
2048000	2050000	It's just going to be a little...
2050000	2057000	It won't have quite the sharp, rich textures that the Playstation 4 and Xbox One undoubtedly have with them.
2057000	2063000	You'll have a little bit lower of a resolution, but I think the experience is still a pretty good one.
2063000	2066000	However, one word of warning.
2067000	2076000	Apparently, even though they're going to patch the Playstation 4 and Xbox One versions, they may not patch the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.
2076000	2079000	So, buyer beware if you do go for those versions.
2079000	2086000	But the game you get outside of the box and $20 cheaper on those consoles should still be a solid experience.
2086000	2089000	But I don't believe you have cross-play either.
2089000	2092000	I don't think a PS3 person can play with a PS4 person.
2092000	2094000	And that probably has to do with the patching.
2094000	2096000	So, just beware of that stuff.
2096000	2098000	Alright.
2098000	2101000	That is it for our Gaming Week, so let me quickly do housekeeping.
2101000	2104000	We will not be here next week. There's no podcast next week over Labor Day weekend.
2104000	2107000	I hope everybody here in the States has a great Labor Day holiday.
2107000	2111000	For those of you in other places where you don't celebrate Labor Day, well, I hope you just have a good weekend.
2111000	2115000	But with the extended weekend, there's a lot of stuff that goes on.
2115000	2118000	People go camping, or they go on trips, or what have you.
2118000	2120000	And there's a lot of expos going on at that time.
2120000	2125000	PAX Prime, of particular interest to the gaming community, going on up in Seattle.
2125000	2131000	For the broader geek community, there's a huge event in Atlanta called DragonCon.
2131000	2137000	And that's where I'm actually going to be, along with many hosts from the Voice Geeks Network are going to be at DragonCon.
2137000	2144000	Myself, Bobby Blackwolf, Travis Donovan, John from Critical Myth, Brian from British Invaders.
2144000	2146000	And that's all I can think of at the top of my head.
2146000	2149000	I'm pretty sure Pod Culture has some representation as well, even though I know Brad's not there.
2149000	2151000	I think some of his co-hosts are there.
2151000	2155000	And so there's just lots of VOG people are going to be at DragonCon.
2155000	2160000	So if you're going to be in the Atlanta area over Labor Day weekend, please consider come saying hi to us.
2160000	2164000	Bobby is literally on one panel every day.
2164000	2166000	And I'm supposed to be joining him on some of those.
2166000	2171000	The best time to find us will be Monday at 1130, which I know is towards the end of the Con.
2172000	2179000	So that is going to be the participating panel brought to you by the Voice of Geeks Network.
2179000	2181000	That is going to be Monday at 1130 a.m.
2181000	2186000	But if you want to try and meet us earlier in the Con, I would encourage you to go to the podcasting kickoff,
2186000	2188000	which is going to be Friday, I believe, at 1 p.m.
2188000	2193000	Bobby's going to be on that panel, and there'll be a lot of the podcaster audience there, including myself.
2193000	2195000	And I'm sure Travis will be there. A lot of the folks will be there.
2195000	2197000	So check that out.
2197000	2199000	And there's lots of stuff I'm trying to figure out.
2199000	2204000	But the only bummer about Dragon Con is then there's so much to do that things start conflicting.
2204000	2208000	Like, I just found out Brian from British Invaders sadly can't be on our VOG panel
2208000	2213000	because he's on a British television panel at the exact same time, which is a bummer.
2213000	2217000	And then I found out there's this, like, dance party thing I want to go to Saturday night.
2217000	2220000	And you know what's at the exact same time?
2220000	2222000	The Twin Peaks 25th Anniversary panel.
2222000	2224000	And it's like, how do I decide what to do?
2224000	2225000	What would you do, Shane?
2225000	2230000	What would you do, Shane? Would you do the Twin Peaks 25th Anniversary, or would you go to the GLBT event?
2230000	2231000	What would you do?
2231000	2235000	Okay, I was only kind of interested in Twin Peaks. It got kind of dumb.
2235000	2238000	So I don't care about that and gay stuff.
2238000	2243000	Yeah, but you really hate all that, like, dance music and lights and drinks and all that.
2243000	2246000	So what would I do? I would not go to any of those.
2246000	2247000	You would go to the hotel room and sleep.
2247000	2248000	Yes.
2250000	2251000	You're fun.
2251000	2255000	Alright. Oh, Brad from Pod Culture correcting me. Nobody from Pod Culture is going.
2255000	2257000	Well, this year, they're not going.
2257000	2259000	I always enjoy the Hall-Con.
2259000	2263000	Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. At Dragon Con, it's insane.
2263000	2266000	It's when you sit out and hang out with people in the halls or on the lines.
2266000	2270000	There's no standing or sitting room in any of those halls because it's just so painful.
2270000	2271000	I know, you find a place.
2271000	2275000	I know, I know. People have to go around the corners and things like that, so.
2275000	2277000	I have a funny story about sitting in a line.
2277000	2278000	Alright, quickly.
2278000	2282000	I sat in a line for something I didn't go to. It was when Utena was playing at Anime Expo, the Utena movie.
2282000	2288000	And I just sat outside the movie cleaning off a $15 Sega Saturn game that I bought,
2288000	2294000	only to determine that the disc was in perfect shape, and I saved myself about 80 bucks because I bought Grandia.
2294000	2303000	Awesome. Let's see. Other housekeeping. Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2303000	2307000	And we're also on Google Plus. Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
2307000	2310000	One other thing that's very important before we get to the news tonight.
2310000	2315000	We want to wish our friends, sadly these gals are not going to Dragon Con,
2315000	2319000	and I don't think they're going to PAX either, so sadly I will not be able to see them,
2319000	2324000	but I will always cherish our E3 time together and that one PAX East I went to.
2324000	2330000	But these gals are great. The Electric Sistahood, which you can hear Tuesdays here at the Voice of Geeks Network,
2330000	2335000	they are having their 400th episode this week on Tuesday.
2335000	2340000	And that is a huge milestone. Like very few podcasts get to a number like that.
2340000	2348000	So I want to give props to the sisters over at Electric Sistahood on reaching their 400th episode,
2348000	2353000	which I'm imagining they probably taped today in advance of their Tuesday premiere.
2353000	2360000	So big congratulations to them and their show is a lot of fun and I love hanging out with them in person.
2360000	2364000	So big congrats on 400 episodes for you folks.
2364000	2368000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news. Dang it, it's time.
2368000	2373000	So Shane perk up and let's get into some gaming news.
2373000	2375000	Well, I was looking at pictures of Power Morphicons.
2375000	2377000	Did that help you feel better?
2377000	2379000	Yeah, the screen ranger that is cosplaying is super hot.
2379000	2381000	Alright, fair enough.
2381000	2389000	So Atari decided that they didn't ruin Alone in the Dark enough that time they put it out on.
2389000	2395000	I think it was PS3 and Xbox 360, so they're going to reboot it again,
2395000	2399000	along with this dumb game called Haunted House that you guys talked about earlier.
2399000	2401000	That sounded stupid.
2401000	2403000	Okay, wait a minute though, wait a minute though.
2403000	2405000	It's because it was a 2600 game.
2405000	2406000	Doesn't matter.
2406000	2407000	You don't have an appreciation for the classics.
2407000	2409000	No, I don't.
2409000	2411000	Have you ever played like Flappy Bird or...
2411000	2416000	I tried, it was so dumb and then I tried that helicopter one and that was even worse.
2416000	2419000	Yeah, I totally left that out of my gaming week, but I played that swing cop.
2419000	2421000	Yeah, and then I deleted it.
2421000	2423000	But you know what I'm realizing about Dong Wen?
2423000	2431000	Is that he does a really good job making like Atari 2600 style cell phone games.
2431000	2435000	Because Atari 2600 games, most of them were like a singular concept.
2435000	2436000	That's all it was.
2436000	2439000	Like, you know, all the games were one word too.
2439000	2443000	Boxing, pinball, you know, oink.
2443000	2445000	It was a game about the three little pigs.
2445000	2448000	And they were all like just one little thing, but you had to do it very well.
2448000	2451000	And the Dong Wen games kind of do that same thing.
2451000	2452000	They do it really well.
2452000	2454000	The swing copter one, he doesn't do that one very well.
2454000	2455000	It's so hard.
2455000	2456000	Garbage.
2456000	2460000	But so, like if you go play an Atari 2600 game like, oh god, Stampede.
2460000	2462000	Have you ever, you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
2462000	2463000	I don't even know what that is.
2463000	2467000	Okay, like Stampede is a really gross, hard Atari 2600 game as well.
2467000	2469000	At least I think so.
2469000	2471000	E.T. was hard anyway.
2471000	2472000	E.T. was scary.
2472000	2473000	But I digress.
2473000	2475000	Haunted House was a classic.
2475000	2477000	Yeah, you play as Eyeball.
2477000	2479000	And I'm sure they were, I thought they rebooted Haunted House once already.
2479000	2480000	They did, apparently.
2480000	2483000	It was on the Wii and Xbox Live Arcade in 2010.
2483000	2484000	Yeah.
2484000	2485000	I'd never even heard of it.
2485000	2488000	It looked, they cartooned it up.
2488000	2489000	Cartoon eyeballs?
2489000	2494000	No, they, I don't know, they tried to make it look like something else.
2494000	2501000	Anyway, they are going to unveil both Haunted House and that other one I said, Alone in
2501000	2502000	the Dark at PAX.
2502000	2508000	So, if you go to PAX, you can go watch this and then decide that it's terrible, just like
2508000	2509000	I already prejudged it.
2509000	2514000	It sounds like we might get a lot of gaming news out of PAX, which usually you don't get
2514000	2516000	a lot of news out of PAX.
2516000	2519000	It's like you're getting, you might get to play things in advance, like of the holiday
2519000	2522000	season, but you don't get a lot of news out of PAX.
2522000	2527000	This is interesting that you've got some companies waiting on announcements for PAX.
2528000	2535000	All right, well, earlier, Shane was teasing Blizzard for not giving through on some of
2535000	2538000	their promises that they make, so he's doubting the Diablo 3 patch.
2538000	2542000	Well, Blizzard isn't the only company that seems to go back on what they say.
2542000	2547000	In fact, a company that has been giving Blizzard a little bit of competition going back on
2547000	2552000	some of the things that they are saying, and that would be the creators of WildStar.
2552000	2554000	What happened to WildStar?
2554000	2555000	It was awful.
2555000	2557000	Well, I didn't play it, so I don't know.
2557000	2558000	I have friends that are really into it.
2558000	2563000	It's okay, but there was so much momentum behind that game, and then it came out, and
2563000	2565000	it was still there, and then just dropped off.
2565000	2570000	Well, sure enough, there you go, because at Gamescom, the senior game designer, Megan
2570000	2578000	Starks, talked about how the MMO will be going from monthly updates to more occasional updates,
2578000	2580000	one update every few months.
2581000	2587000	They are unable to keep up the smaller, more frequent patches mantra that became somewhat
2587000	2589000	of a rallying cry in MMOs.
2589000	2591000	Here's the quote from Megan.
2591000	2594000	Originally, our idea was to have a really aggressive post-launch schedule, just constantly
2594000	2597000	provide stuff for our players, so there's always things for you to do.
2597000	2600000	Now that we've put out two of our updates, our schedule is still planned out.
2600000	2604000	We decided to work on the upcoming patch until it's a really good quality state.
2604000	2606000	We do know that we want it to come out in the next few months.
2606000	2609000	Instead of saying that we have this hard deadline, that it's going out no matter what,
2609000	2612000	we're going to take the time to make sure that the quality is there.
2612000	2617000	Aw, they must have got that from a Blizzard form letter.
2617000	2619000	Like that little handbook?
2619000	2621000	It sounds like something Blizzard would say.
2621000	2627000	Now, one MMO that you really, really, really tried, very hard to get me back into, was
2627000	2632000	Final Fantasy XI, and you didn't really succeed, maybe a little bit.
2632000	2636000	I didn't really try either, but you did resubscribe and played for a little bit.
2636000	2638000	Technically, I succeeded.
2638000	2640000	My account's still active, so I guess you got that.
2640000	2641000	Mine's not.
2641000	2642000	Really?
2642000	2643000	Yeah.
2643000	2644000	You asshole.
2644000	2645000	All right.
2645000	2647000	I only just canceled it.
2647000	2651000	But the thing about XI, that I was going to say Final Fantasy XI is that they're still
2651000	2652000	doing monthly updates, right?
2652000	2655000	Yeah, and it actually makes the game more fun.
2655000	2659000	It's little content that just makes it more enjoyable each time.
2659000	2662000	I think that's where these developers go wrong.
2662000	2667000	They think they have to have these grandiose patches that can entertain you for forever
2668000	2670000	and will do them every three to five months.
2670000	2676000	But if you just do one little patch a month, then that's all you need.
2676000	2679000	It'll get you to the next month when another patch will be out.
2679000	2681000	Exactly.
2681000	2685000	sg100matt says, I really liked WildStar when I tried it out a few times.
2685000	2687000	Hopefully this isn't a sign of bad things to come.
2687000	2688000	Let's hope not.
2688000	2691000	I wonder how their subscriber numbers are holding up.
2691000	2693000	I wonder if the game's still doing well.
2693000	2696000	I would think that they would have said something by now if it still was doing well,
2696000	2697000	because it's been out for a little bit.
2697000	2700000	Not to be the negative cynical gamer.
2700000	2702000	That's me. Don't take mine.
2702000	2704000	No, there's people on the internet much worse than you.
2704000	2708000	But I would have expected fully by now that Elder Scrolls Online would have changed.
2708000	2711000	I would have thought that that game would have already dropped, but it hasn't.
2711000	2716000	So, I mean, kudos to the support that that game is getting, apparently.
2716000	2718000	It could just be them being stubborn.
2718000	2720000	Yeah, that could be it, too. We'll see.
2720000	2722000	All right, moving on. DarkSakura.
2722000	2729000	Well, this is a little bit of sadness, and it was addressed on Bobby's show earlier.
2729000	2734000	But Sony is going to be shutting down PlayStation Home in Japan.
2734000	2738000	Actually, as far as I'm aware, it's for the Asian region in general.
2738000	2742000	There's nothing to say about North American or European versions yet,
2742000	2749000	but it will be gone as of March 2015 over in Japan.
2749000	2752000	So, boo-hoo.
2752000	2754000	Where are all the pedophiles going to go now?
2754000	2756000	Oh, stop it. Why do you say that?
2756000	2757000	They'll be on 2chan.
2757000	2759000	I don't know what that is, but okay.
2759000	2762000	Well, 4chan started because of 2chan in Japan.
2762000	2765000	Okay. I've never even been to 4chan, so...
2765000	2769000	Good riddance to Sony Home. I'm a Sony fanboy.
2769000	2772000	I think that's safe to say by this point.
2772000	2778000	And I think Home was a neat idea that did not turn out so great when they actually implemented it.
2778000	2780000	So you admit that it was a neat idea.
2780000	2785000	Yeah, but neat ideas don't always give good results to actual things.
2785000	2787000	That was my whole thing.
2787000	2790000	It'd be a neat idea to fly to the sun, because that's cool-sounding.
2790000	2792000	But if you got there, you would die.
2792000	2796000	Alright, look. I'm half with you, I'm half not.
2796000	2800000	Because I definitely see there's a lot of passionate people in the home.
2800000	2805000	Because I remember we did some stuff in the early days of VOG that was a little more involved with Home.
2805000	2808000	And we met a lot of very cool people who I assure you were not pedophiles.
2808000	2810000	Do you have proof?
2810000	2812000	You're such an asshole.
2812000	2813000	Anyway...
2813000	2815000	That's a no.
2815000	2817000	Do you have proof?
2817000	2820000	I don't need it, because I'm the one that's making the claim.
2820000	2821000	You have to defend that.
2821000	2823000	Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot this was the internet.
2823000	2825000	Oh, what a great...
2825000	2829000	What a little current events personified little exchange that was.
2829000	2834000	Anyway, the thing about PlayStation Home, though, is obviously it had a very passionate community.
2834000	2841000	And they were doing a lot of great things that really bent the limitations that Sony really had for Home.
2841000	2845000	I'm not sure if the PlayStation 3 was the right console for Home.
2845000	2852000	And I sort of... It's kind of too bad that because it probably didn't really get fleshed out on the PlayStation 3,
2852000	2854000	that they're going to give it another go on the PlayStation 4.
2854000	2859000	Because I think with the background updating and the quicker turn on and launch times,
2859000	2861000	which is a huge thing, trust me, give it a 3,
2861000	2865000	I think PlayStation 4 actually could have been a lot better for Home.
2865000	2868000	So I'm kind of sad to see it go.
2868000	2874000	But I also kind of feel like Sony kind of had this one idea out there,
2874000	2876000	and then it really didn't end up doing anything.
2876000	2882000	Like, I remember I paid five bucks or whatever for a clubhouse for OLR,
2882000	2885000	because I was like, oh, you know, I like to try to get on new technologies and new social media.
2885000	2888000	And I thought, OK, PlayStation Home might be like this thing.
2888000	2890000	So I got a clubhouse for it.
2890000	2894000	And, you know, one of the things you can do in the clubhouse is you have this TV screen,
2894000	2896000	but you can't do anything with it.
2896000	2901000	And it's like, wouldn't it be great if I could put like a podcast up there
2901000	2904000	or even like a movie with still pictures
2904000	2907000	or something like they do in some of the theater rooms in Sony Home?
2907000	2909000	Like, it would be great.
2909000	2911000	Switch between different members playing a game.
2911000	2912000	Yeah, or something like that.
2912000	2915000	Like, I really feel like I could have done more with that,
2915000	2918000	but I was too limited by Sony Home.
2918000	2921000	And maybe they were just worried that if they made it too free for all,
2921000	2924000	people were just going to show boobs in their clubhouse and things like that,
2924000	2926000	which, you know, whatever, maybe that's what they were worried of.
2926000	2931000	But with some moderation or maybe some more partnerships with, you know,
2931000	2936000	more indie content, I think it could have been like a really cool little thing.
2936000	2938000	So I'm kind of sad to see it go.
2938000	2944000	One thing that Home also did pretty well, I think, was some of the E3 conferences,
2944000	2948000	being able to kind of log in there and see the conferences in Home kind of worked out pretty well.
2948000	2951000	But, you know, again, it's going in Japan.
2951000	2955000	It's not going in the U.S., probably because it has had more popularity here in the U.S.
2955000	2960000	than it has had in Japan, but I imagine its days are sadly numbered here too.
2960000	2963000	And this is going to be a matter of the PlayStation 3 phasing out in general
2963000	2967000	because Sony wants people to upgrade to the PlayStation 4, right?
2967000	2969000	So I'm sure that'll be a thing.
2969000	2971000	I don't know if they want that to happen
2971000	2974000	because they said they don't even know who's buying them.
2974000	2975000	What do you mean? Who's buying what?
2975000	2977000	The PS4s. Did you not see that?
2977000	2980000	Oh, yeah, something about they don't know who's buying them?
2980000	2981000	Yeah.
2981000	2986000	This is weird. Well, I somehow don't think it's PlayStation Home fans, necessarily,
2986000	2988000	who are buying it, so it's not going to affect me.
2988000	2989000	Pedophiles like white vans.
2989000	2991000	Oh, stop it. All right.
2991000	2994000	Moving on. Shane, it's you.
2994000	3001000	Okay, so like in MMOs, people buy and sell gold or currency all the time.
3001000	3009000	Apparently, that's a thing in FIFA as well with the FIFA Ultimate Team thing in FIFA.
3009000	3010000	I don't know what that is.
3010000	3017000	But anyway, so EA is like, you guys can't do that anymore because that's cheating.
3018000	3024000	So they initiated this penalty ban process.
3024000	3032000	So if you are buying coins and promoting the purchase of these coins in FIFA Ultimate Team,
3032000	3035000	you have like a three-strike rule.
3035000	3038000	Oh, I'm sorry. It's soccer, a three-card rule.
3038000	3040000	Well, a whistle and two cards.
3040000	3042000	So the first offense...
3042000	3044000	A whistle and two cards?
3044000	3045000	That's the image. I'm looking right here.
3045000	3048000	This guy's got a whistle and he's got a card and then he has two cards.
3048000	3050000	Anyway, so your first offense.
3050000	3055000	If you are buying coins or promoting the purchase of coins,
3055000	3058000	you will get a warning email and an in-game message.
3058000	3065000	If you do it again, your FIFA Ultimate Team Club will be reset
3065000	3069000	and your FIFA points will be returned to you, and that's a yellow card offense.
3069000	3074000	Your third offense, which is red, you get a permanent FIFA Online ban.
3074000	3081000	However, if you are the one doing the selling or the farming of the coins to be sold,
3081000	3085000	you only get one chance and that chance is...
3085000	3089000	You go straight to red, it says, and once they find you doing that once,
3089000	3094000	you are permanently banned online for all EA games, not just FIFA.
3094000	3095000	Good.
3095000	3099000	I'm kind of glad they're doing this, though, because I seem to remember on the Xbox 360,
3099000	3101000	remember when we all got our accounts hacked?
3101000	3104000	Even though we were all pissed off that the PlayStation Network got breached,
3104000	3108000	everybody was actually losing money on the Xbox 360 hacks that we still, to this day,
3108000	3113000	don't really know how it was done, but they were doing FIFA stuff.
3113000	3114000	It was all FIFA.
3114000	3117000	It was all FIFA card trading and all this stuff, so I'm glad that...
3117000	3119000	Let's see, what are we at here, like eight years later?
3119000	3121000	The EA is really...
3121000	3122000	That was not eight years ago.
3122000	3123000	No, it was not eight years ago.
3123000	3124000	Alright, gee, fair.
3124000	3125000	It was probably more like...
3125000	3126000	Three or four at the most.
3126000	3127000	No, no.
3127000	3128000	Because I remember when it was happening.
3128000	3129000	No.
3129000	3130000	Because it happened to you.
3130000	3131000	Because it was...
3131000	3133000	The 360 was out in 2006, right?
3133000	3135000	Yeah, but it wasn't right then.
3135000	3136000	More like 09.
3136000	3137000	Probably like 09.
3137000	3138000	Which would be like...
3138000	3139000	Five years.
3139000	3145000	But anyway, the specific timing of events aside, it's nice the EA is really putting
3145000	3150000	their foot down on this stuff and discouraging this behavior.
3150000	3154000	And to be fair, they probably have done something similar in previous years,
3154000	3158000	but it's nice to see them step it up and get it out there.
3158000	3161000	This is a no cheatin' zone.
3161000	3162000	A no cheatin'...
3162000	3164000	A no sellin'.
3164000	3168000	They should send pictures of those cards and whistles to the...
3168000	3169000	They should.
3169000	3170000	If the people are causing these offenses.
3170000	3173000	They should actually have an animation where the, you know, thing...
3173000	3178000	If you get the whistle one, you should play a whistle sound as soon as you open your email about it.
3178000	3179000	Or play the whistle song.
3179000	3182000	Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
3182000	3184000	No one else found that funny.
3184000	3187000	There's a DDR fan out there somewhere that understands the joke.
3187000	3188000	All right.
3188000	3189000	Oh, oh.
3189000	3194000	Alan says it was in 2011 because PSN was down for six weeks during Portal when Portal 2 came out.
3194000	3196000	So I was right and you were wrong.
3196000	3197000	Yeah, but the 360 stuff happened before.
3197000	3198000	You were wrong.
3198000	3200000	No, it was during the same time.
3200000	3201000	You're awful.
3201000	3202000	All right.
3202000	3203000	Blame your boyfriend.
3203000	3204000	Okay, wait.
3204000	3207000	No, because I can prove this wrong.
3207000	3214000	Because all that happened when I was living at the house and I moved into the apartment in 2010.
3214000	3216000	So it was when I was in the house.
3216000	3217000	It was 2009.
3217000	3218000	I'm telling you.
3218000	3220000	No, I have anecdotal evidence here.
3220000	3222000	I don't even care anymore.
3222000	3223000	All right.
3223000	3224000	Moving on.
3224000	3226000	Apparently, you know who else doesn't care about things?
3226000	3228000	Ubisoft doesn't care about the Wii U.
3228000	3230000	All right, maybe I'm being a little bit harsh and sensationalist.
3230000	3231000	No.
3231000	3232000	Here's the deal.
3232000	3233000	Here's the deal.
3233000	3234000	That's true.
3234000	3235000	They don't.
3235000	3236000	Ubisoft is officially stepping back development on Wii U.
3236000	3238000	I mean, this really isn't surprising information.
3238000	3241000	This has kind of been something we've seen coming for a while.
3241000	3259000	But this is based on some comments that happened at Gamescom where there was some discussion with the CEO where essentially, you know, they're happy that folks are upgrading to the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 real quick and that things are great for the PlayStation 3 and the 360.
3259000	3264000	But when it comes to sales on the Wii and Wii U, it doesn't look so good.
3264000	3273000	Nintendo Wii U sales represented only 3% of the total for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 2014.
3273000	3277000	To put that into perspective, Xbox 360 was 27%.
3277000	3280000	PlayStation 3 was 25%.
3280000	3284000	PlayStation 4 was 9%, so three times what Wii U was.
3284000	3286000	Xbox One was 6%.
3286000	3288000	You want to hear one that's really scary, though?
3288000	3291000	The Vita was 1%.
3292000	3294000	Would they have out on Vita just an Assassin's Creed game?
3294000	3295000	I think that's it.
3295000	3298000	So the fact that it was even 1% is amazing.
3298000	3299000	Right.
3299000	3300000	So, anyway.
3300000	3302000	I don't think you can get Just Dance on Vita.
3302000	3303000	Yeah.
3303000	3309000	Well, and this is important to say is that Ubisoft is not abandoning Nintendo completely.
3309000	3313000	They're just not going to put out really mature games anymore.
3314000	3323000	Just Dance will be a series that continues on Wii and Wii U because there's a more, I guess, family-friendly perception on the Wii.
3323000	3327000	However, Ubisoft will bring Watch Dogs to Wii U.
3327000	3333000	It will be the only mature game we publish on it, was the quote, even though they did Zombie U, so it won't be the only mature game.
3333000	3335000	Well, and they did Assassin's Creed's End, isn't it?
3335000	3339000	Yeah, it'll be the last, I guess, mature game that they do on it.
3339000	3341000	There you go.
3342000	3346000	I'm surprised they're still even putting Watch Dogs out at this point.
3346000	3347000	I am too, actually.
3347000	3349000	They should really just cancel it.
3349000	3350000	I gotta be honest.
3350000	3359000	If Watch Dogs comes out on Wii U, it's not going to sell for the same reason that all these other ports of year-old games didn't sell on Wii U.
3359000	3363000	The third parties, I kind of think, set the Wii U up to fail in that regard.
3363000	3370000	I mean, I realize some of the ports may be really good versions and so forth, but it's just they're old games.
3370000	3379000	People are not convinced to get a new system and buy these $60 ports of games most people have already played.
3379000	3383000	So I kind of agree that they ought to just cancel Watch Dogs on the Wii U.
3383000	3387000	I mean, I know Nintendo fans are not going to be happy with me saying that, but I'm sorry.
3387000	3393000	Nintendo fans, are you really waiting for Watch Dogs to come out, or is it just another game you want on the system just to have another game?
3393000	3398000	Yeah, or do you really want Smash Brothers and all the other stuff we're all excited about on the Wii U?
3398000	3401000	Yeah, because when did they say Watch Dogs is coming out?
3401000	3402000	Next year, probably.
3402000	3404000	No, they said next year now?
3404000	3408000	I don't know, when is it? I think before the end of the fiscal year, March 31st.
3408000	3415000	Okay, yeah, at that point Smash Brothers will be out and nobody will be playing anything but Smash Brothers on there anyway, or Bayonetta.
3415000	3418000	So then, just cancel it.
3418000	3422000	So yeah, I'm still rooting for the Wii U.
3422000	3429000	I really hope that it gets a lot of sales continuing through the holidays with Mario Kart and so forth, and some third-party companies will step up.
3429000	3436000	But yeah, I think the types of games you're going to see companies putting on it are just, you're going to see less mature titles in general.
3436000	3443000	Because Nintendo doesn't really do a lot of those, unless Bayonetta 2 does really well.
3443000	3447000	But I'm not expecting it to do great.
3447000	3452000	But I'm hoping it will at least be enough to be satisfactory. Let's hope.
3452000	3455000	Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura.
3455000	3462000	Well, there has been a study that was released, and actually this news comes from PBS, which I thought was really interesting.
3462000	3465000	I also do have to thank Ranma for the information.
3466000	3480000	It says that video gamers are now, the highest percentage is adult female gamers outnumbering now teenage boys as the biggest gaming demographic.
3480000	3493000	But mostly that has to do just with casual games, that women were more likely to play iOS games, or other smartphone games, or casual games.
3493000	3500000	But that there are so much more of them than adolescent boys playing Call of Duty.
3500000	3509000	Yeah, but wouldn't adolescence be under 18? So hopefully there's, that is an M-rated game, so I hope there's not a lot of them playing there.
3509000	3522000	But I mean, it's demographic. There are more, now women playing, adult women playing games, broad statements to each, than boys under 18 playing games.
3523000	3534000	So, that just goes back to, you know, if it had been 20 years ago, and everyone had a Super Nintendo, it could just play it on the side.
3534000	3541000	They would all be playing Tetris. They would all be playing, you know, Actraiser or SimEarth.
3541000	3556000	Let me ask a weird question though, because we know that the rise of women gamers to take over this demographic has to do with mobile gaming in large part.
3556000	3564000	Mobile and Facebook gaming, right? But when we talk mobile gaming, we talk about things like Kim Kardashian Hollywood.
3564000	3566000	It was mentioned in the article.
3566000	3568000	It's not a terrible game.
3568000	3570000	I will play it.
3570000	3571000	Really?
3571000	3573000	It's got good music and it's not terrible.
3573000	3583000	Rob, I'm the person who released a picture of the woman with her face photoshopped off that said publicity on it.
3583000	3586000	I don't get it.
3586000	3589000	It was an artistic statement, Rob.
3589000	3592000	Oh, excuse me, I guess I missed it.
3592000	3601000	Because her whole thing is, you know, being all shallow and pretty and whatever it is that her family gets famous for, I have no idea.
3601000	3603000	They're famous for being famous, just like Paris Hilton was.
3603000	3605000	So, I photoshopped off her face.
3605000	3608000	Even in history, there's been people like this, you know.
3608000	3612000	Wasn't Zsa Zsa Gabor kind of in that department originally too?
3612000	3614000	Was she more famous for being famous than anything else?
3615000	3618000	There was her and Ava, both actresses.
3618000	3620000	And did stage, I thought.
3620000	3622000	Yeah, well, Paris Hilton was an actress too.
3622000	3624000	Yeah, but she was...
3624000	3626000	I think it's a little bit different.
3626000	3632000	The people who were famous for being famous would be like the socialite crowd, which there's always been that.
3632000	3640000	I mean, you had people in middling aristocracy who were famous for their reputation and that they showed up everywhere.
3640000	3649000	Rather than them actually having any sort of main claim to proper marriages or sleeping with people on the throne or anything like that.
3649000	3652000	I mean, if you want to look at it in a historical sense.
3652000	3660000	People have been oddly obsessed with the people with money.
3660000	3663000	Which is stupid, but still.
3663000	3664000	Alright.
3671000	3679000	Well, let's travel around the world and check out release dates of some games coming out for boys and girls and men and women everywhere.
3679000	3683000	And I just realized that you probably don't have the US release dates, do you?
3683000	3687000	Sure don't. So nothing's coming out of the US this week, everybody.
3687000	3690000	I'll make stuff up.
3690000	3692000	If we can do things out of order a little bit.
3692000	3694000	Dark Soccer, would you start with the UK releases?
3694000	3696000	And I'll get the US ones up here.
3696000	3698000	You know what? I'm totally not even ready for that.
3698000	3699000	Oh my gosh, you guys!
3699000	3701000	You guys, I didn't do anything wrong.
3701000	3703000	No, I have the dates for the week.
3703000	3707000	Because usually I look up the dates except that the site isn't loading.
3707000	3709000	Because your internet sucks.
3709000	3712000	I did notice that those dates weren't there like an hour ago.
3712000	3714000	I'm sorry, Rob. I have lag.
3714000	3715000	I have lag. Latency.
3715000	3719000	Alright, actually I've got it. I've got US releases. I'll take care of this for Shane.
3719000	3720000	Got it.
3720000	3722000	Okay, so US releases. Here we go.
3722000	3726000	Coming out on the 26th of August.
3726000	3729000	Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 on the PlayStation Vita.
3729000	3732000	Infamous First Light on the PlayStation 4.
3732000	3734000	Oh yeah, Infamous is coming out this week.
3734000	3738000	Metro Redo for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
3738000	3743000	The Walking Dead Season 2 Episode 5 hitting across the various consoles.
3743000	3744000	The final episode.
3744000	3745000	That's right.
3745000	3748000	And the big, big, big, big, big release this week.
3748000	3752000	Madden NFL 15 is out this week.
3752000	3754000	No one cares.
3754000	3756000	Somebody cares. That's a huge selling game.
3756000	3760000	No, no. Because I have friends that play Madden and they agree.
3760000	3764000	It is just the same game every year with a different number.
3764000	3766000	But yet people still buy it.
3766000	3768000	Yeah, because they're dumb.
3768000	3769000	But wouldn't...
3769000	3770000	Because of football!
3770000	3772000	Wasn't DDR the same game with different songs?
3772000	3773000	Yeah.
3773000	3777000	And that was what made it great because of different songs.
3777000	3778000	Geez, Rob. Get it right.
3778000	3780000	No, I'm not even going to defend it.
3780000	3783000	It doesn't need anyone's defense. It's DDR.
3783000	3786000	All right. All right. Going to Japan real quick.
3786000	3788000	I want to go to Japan.
3788000	3789000	Real quick.
3789000	3790000	No, for a long time.
3790000	3795000	On the PlayStation 4, Transformers Rise of the Dark Spark comes out in Japan this week.
3795000	3797000	I know. We are really excited about Transformers here.
3797000	3800000	You know what? Real quick, quick, quick, quick pause.
3800000	3802000	Guardians of the Galaxy beat out Transformers.
3802000	3806000	They actually went behind and then came back and beat out Transformers for top grossing summer meeting.
3806000	3807000	Have you seen that yet?
3807000	3809000	Yes, I have and it was awesome.
3809000	3811000	Except for the end-end.
3811000	3813000	The end-end was great.
3813000	3815000	Oh my god, it's the worst part of the movie.
3815000	3820000	Back to Japan. The PlayStation 3 is very busy this week on August 28th.
3820000	3825000	Callidurius Blaze, I totally mispronounced that I'm sure, comes out on the 28th of August.
3825000	3830000	Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen in a special packaging is out this week as well as Grid Autosport.
3831000	3833000	My favorite game title, Muv Luv.
3833000	3836000	Photon Melodies is out this week in regular and limited edition.
3836000	3840000	Persona 4, the Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold.
3840000	3842000	What the hell is that? Do you know about that?
3842000	3844000	You're a Persona fan, right Shane?
3844000	3845000	What?
3845000	3850000	What is Persona 4, the Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold?
3850000	3852000	It's the fighting game, the updated version of it.
3852000	3855000	I have it on PS3, the first one.
3855000	3856000	Gotcha.
3856000	3857000	It's fun.
3857000	3864000	Sacred 3, out in Japan this week, as well as Super Robot Taisen Oji Saga Maso Kishin F-Coffin of the End.
3864000	3866000	There's another Robot Wars game.
3866000	3868000	When isn't there a Robot Wars game?
3868000	3872000	And Transformers Rise of the Dark Spark on PlayStation 3 as well.
3872000	3874000	On the Wii U...
3874000	3876000	Nothing.
3876000	3879000	On the Vita, believe it or not, quite a bit.
3879000	3880000	There's like a ton of shit on the Vita this week.
3880000	3881000	Japan likes the Vita.
3881000	3882000	Japan loves the Vita.
3882000	3885000	The Vita's great. Japanese people got it right.
3885000	3890000	You can play Cho-Jigen Action Neptune U, regular limited edition.
3890000	3892000	Kiss Bell, regular limited edition.
3892000	3897000	Three different volumes of Love Live School Idol Paradise.
3897000	3899000	There's three different volumes.
3899000	3902000	So, if you are into your idol games.
3902000	3903000	Um...
3903000	3906000	Meccu Cross Blood Infinity Ultimate.
3906000	3909000	Renai Zero Kilometer V.
3909000	3910000	Rewrite.
3911000	3916000	And Tokaidin Kiwami come out in regular and what they call a treasure box this week.
3916000	3919000	Good lord, that's a lot of stuff on the PlayStation Vita.
3919000	3924000	Quickly checking the 3DS to see if maybe there's a little competition in the handheld world.
3924000	3926000	Just one game.
3926000	3931000	Metarot 8 in Kabuto and Kawagata versions coming out this week.
3931000	3935000	Which looks like it's basically probably robot Pokemon.
3935000	3937000	That's kind of what it is.
3937000	3939000	So, there you go.
3939000	3942000	Do you play Pokemon knock off games too, Shane?
3942000	3943000	No.
3943000	3944000	Or do you only play the main series?
3944000	3945000	I'll only play Pokemon.
3945000	3948000	I played the Digimon card game for a while on the Wonderswan.
3948000	3949000	Did you?
3949000	3950000	That was pretty fun.
3950000	3952000	Shane, you're not into Digimon either?
3952000	3953000	Nope.
3953000	3954000	Digimon is better than anything.
3954000	3956000	At least the anime was.
3956000	3958000	Dark Soccer, how about the UK?
3958000	3959000	Yeah, I guess.
3959000	3961000	Now that I've had time to prepare.
3961000	3965000	On the 28th, the Steamworld Dig for Wii U.
3965000	3968000	And then on the 29th, there's a bunch of Madden crap.
3968000	3970000	And then Metro Redux.
3970000	3971000	And that's it.
3971000	3973000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
3973000	3975000	And then the classic game of the week.
3975000	3976000	And it's an awesome game.
3976000	3978000	And I know how to annoy my husband playing it.
3978000	3979000	Wait, wait, wait.
3979000	3982000	According to the chat room, the comment JP was talking about,
3982000	3983000	Yo-kai Watch.
3983000	3986000	I believe that's like a Pokemon ripoff, kind of.
3986000	3987000	I will play that.
3987000	3988000	It does pique my interest.
3988000	3990000	It's huge over there too.
3990000	3993000	They said it's coming out over here in 2015.
3993000	3994000	Yeah.
3994000	3995000	So I will play that.
3995000	3997000	I will play that too.
3997000	4000000	I'll have Shane decide if I should play it or not.
4000000	4002000	Shane, decide for him to play it please.
4002000	4003000	Well, we'll see.
4003000	4004000	We'll see.
4004000	4005000	I'll probably do it though.
4005000	4007000	You should probably convince me to finish playing Pokemon X.
4007000	4009000	Finish playing Pokemon X?
4009000	4010000	That's adorable.
4010000	4012000	There's still so many more gems to go.
4012000	4014000	What is Jamie missing by not playing Pokemon X?
4014000	4017000	Adorable Pokemon.
4017000	4018000	I don't know.
4018000	4020000	I get tired of that rabbit one keep showing up.
4020000	4022000	I love the stupid Bunnelby.
4022000	4023000	He's adorable.
4023000	4024000	I'm like, God damn it.
4024000	4025000	I don't want a Bunnelby.
4025000	4026000	No, you do.
4026000	4032000	You should have heard the disgusting things he was saying about getting a shiny Bumblebee
4032000	4033000	or whatever they're called.
4033000	4034000	Bunnelby.
4034000	4035000	I want a houndoom.
4035000	4037000	I wasn't the one saying it.
4037000	4038000	Somebody else did.
4038000	4039000	I'll play if you give me a houndoom.
4039000	4040000	You want a houndoom?
4040000	4041000	I'll give you a houndoom.
4041000	4042000	Fine.
4042000	4043000	I'll play my game.
4043000	4044000	Okay.
4044000	4045000	We'll do it.
4045000	4046000	Fine.
4046000	4047000	What the fuck is happening?
4047000	4052000	This is why Shane and I don't have a podcast.
4052000	4054000	We did a pilot once.
4054000	4055000	Yeah right.
4055000	4056000	Whatever happened to that show?
4056000	4057000	Whatever happened to that show?
4057000	4059000	Nothing's happening in Mass Effect, so it doesn't even matter.
4059000	4061000	When Mass Effect 4 comes out, we'll do our podcast.
4061000	4063000	Mass Effect 4?
4063000	4064000	Because we don't know.
4064000	4066000	Mass Effect whatever the fuck it is edition.
4066000	4070000	Shane, put down Pokemon because you got a story to read.
4070000	4076000	He's like reluctantly and I'm getting pouty face as he's slowly putting the DS down.
4076000	4078000	Like I just ruined his entire fucking day.
4078000	4080000	I am trying to...
4080000	4082000	It's like you just stabbed his Bunnelby in the face.
4082000	4084000	Don't stab my Bunnelby.
4085000	4087000	I don't want to stab your Bunnelby.
4087000	4089000	Oh, the gross one?
4089000	4090000	Yeah.
4090000	4092000	Somebody did stab that Bunnelby with something else.
4092000	4094000	So video gaming.
4096000	4097000	Sure.
4097000	4103000	So Final Fantasy Explorers is this Final Fantasy game that looks a lot like Phantasy Star Online to me.
4103000	4106000	And it's got a release date in Japan now.
4106000	4107000	It's December 18th.
4107000	4108000	Okay, back to Pokemon.
4109000	4110000	Wait.
4110000	4111000	No, no.
4111000	4114000	As a Final Fantasy fan, because you are, you play a lot of...
4114000	4115000	You know what?
4115000	4117000	I can't even really say I'm a Final Fantasy fan.
4117000	4119000	Like I don't think I am.
4119000	4120000	Really?
4120000	4121000	Yeah.
4121000	4124000	As much as you play 11 and 14 and bully your friends into playing them.
4124000	4125000	Yeah, okay.
4125000	4130000	But if I like count the number of Final Fantasy games that I have either beaten or cared about
4130000	4134000	versus the amount of games that have come out, I don't think I could consider myself a fan.
4134000	4136000	But are you excited about this one because it's like Monster Hunter?
4136000	4140000	No, because I say it's like PSO because I don't care about Monster Hunter.
4140000	4142000	But I do care about PSO.
4144000	4149000	I want to check it out very badly because I love PSO.
4149000	4151000	I'm playing Destiny because it's like PSO.
4151000	4154000	Yeah, I want to play that because it's like PSO too.
4154000	4157000	What's exciting is that I go to Atlanta on Wednesday, right?
4157000	4163000	And I get back on like Monday and we're only going to be like a week away from Destiny at that point.
4163000	4164000	Super excited.
4164000	4166000	Seattle says that I'm a terrible person.
4166000	4167000	I know.
4167000	4168000	We all know that.
4168000	4169000	That's probably true.
4169000	4170000	Why am I a terrible person, Seattle?
4170000	4171000	That's why we love you, Shane.
4171000	4172000	Because you're terrible.
4172000	4176000	Also, you forgot the Professor Layton versus Phoenix Wright game coming out next week, I guess.
4176000	4179000	I forgot about it too because, honestly, I don't care anymore.
4179000	4180000	I forgot about it on purpose.
4180000	4184000	It came out so long ago in every other territory, so I'm over it.
4184000	4187000	Captain Spike, our pal from gamebuoy.org, says,
4187000	4191000	I'll be importing that Final Fantasy X Monster Hunter heart.
4191000	4196000	Now here's the thing, and Captain Spike I know disagrees with me quite strongly on this,
4196000	4199000	but I really tried that Monster Hunter demo on Wii U.
4199000	4200000	I did too.
4200000	4201000	It was so awful.
4201000	4202000	It was garbage.
4202000	4203000	It was awful.
4203000	4205000	And, you know, I've tried it on PSP now.
4205000	4207000	I've tried it on Wii U.
4207000	4210000	It was worse than Ni No Kuni's demo.
4210000	4212000	Oh, and that was a bad demo.
4212000	4213000	That was a bad demo.
4213000	4214000	For a bad game.
4214000	4215000	No, it wasn't a bad game at all.
4215000	4216000	It was a really bad game.
4216000	4217000	But here's the thing.
4217000	4219000	I ended up really liking Ni No Kuni, right?
4219000	4221000	Even though the demo was awful.
4221000	4223000	It had a good combat system.
4223000	4224000	It's like Final Fantasy XII.
4224000	4225000	Great combat system.
4225000	4227000	Ni No Kuni was kind of Pokemon-y.
4227000	4231000	I said the combat system was good, but the game was awful.
4231000	4234000	But I guess I just need to try the full Monster Hunter.
4234000	4235000	I don't know.
4235000	4239000	Captain Spike, you're going to need to bring your copy of Monster Hunter up here and give
4239000	4244000	it a good old try to get me to find the love for this series, I guess.
4244000	4248000	I finally have to update Pokemans, by the way, because I didn't actually have the patch installed.
4248000	4249000	Oops.
4249000	4253000	Jamie, I'm going to give you a Houndour that you evolve into Houndoom.
4253000	4254000	Okay.
4255000	4259000	And Captain Spike says it demos awfully, especially the way they put the demos together.
4259000	4260000	The real games are awesome.
4260000	4263000	I wonder if I could find the Wii U game for like 20 bucks now.
4263000	4266000	Like, I'm sure it's got to be in clearance bins everywhere.
4266000	4267000	Maybe.
4267000	4268000	We'll see.
4268000	4271000	Anyhow, moving on to one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.
4271000	4274000	And this is a follow-up to something we had started with last week.
4274000	4277000	And it's the latest Twitch phenomenon.
4277000	4283000	Well, we had Twitch plays Pokemon, and then we had, you know, all this other crazy stuff.
4283000	4286000	And then we had fish that were playing Pokemon.
4286000	4291000	And I believe Loki on this very show said last week, they ought to be playing fighting
4291000	4294000	games, and the two fish can fight each other and beat each other up.
4294000	4295000	Well, sure enough.
4295000	4299000	And I'm sure they didn't get the idea from this show, but we like to think they did.
4299000	4305000	There are two fish, Aquarius and Robert the Bruce, are playing in a tank, playing Street
4305000	4307000	Fighter II Turbo.
4307000	4311000	And what happens is that the tank, basically in the nine sections, they have the tank split
4311000	4312000	into nine sections.
4312000	4316000	They each correspond to a different button on the controller for whatever the emulator
4316000	4317000	or whatever it is they're running.
4317000	4321000	So, as the fish swims around the tank, it controls their movements.
4321000	4323000	So, there you go.
4323000	4333000	And yeah, you can watch the fish battle each other in Street Fighter II Turbo.
4333000	4339000	And it's kind of, you're literally watching people button mash for an entire tournament.
4339000	4340000	People are really into it.
4340000	4341000	There's talk of betting.
4341000	4344000	I do that when I watch people do that playing Tekken.
4344000	4346000	One of the fish got sponsored.
4346000	4347000	Yeah.
4347000	4348000	But are they fish?
4348000	4349000	Are they fish playing Tekken?
4349000	4351000	Probably have the attention span of fish.
4351000	4353000	Jamie, would you like a male or female Houndour?
4353000	4357000	I think I would like a female, because I'm into the bitches.
4357000	4360000	Well, maybe if you guys could put your Pokemon down for like two seconds.
4360000	4364000	You know, remember a day when you couldn't trade anything from one game to another?
4364000	4369000	Because you had your save file on your cartridge and that was it.
4369000	4372000	We're going to take a step back into gaming's history.
4372000	4376000	And Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
4376000	4379000	hey, you kids should be playing this game this week.
4379000	4382000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4382000	4386000	The classic game of the week is X-Men Children of the Atom.
4386000	4392000	Because I'm going back to my theme of doing CPS2 games by Capcom.
4393000	4398000	So X-Men Children of the Atom is a fighting game that stars the X-Men and the bad guys
4398000	4400000	and the X-Men.
4400000	4404000	So the plot for it is based off the Fatal Attraction storyline.
4404000	4412000	And it's really the X-Men, like the Jim Lee era X-Men versus Magneto, Juggernaut,
4412000	4417000	Omega Red, Silver Samurai.
4417000	4418000	So yeah.
4418000	4420000	And Rama brings up Rod Caliber.
4420000	4425000	Rod Caliber was awesome and everyone should try it at least once.
4425000	4428000	But basically those are some of the other characters in the game.
4428000	4430000	In fact, I will go through the full roster.
4430000	4436000	You have Colossus, Cyclops, Iceman, Psylocke, Storm, and Wolverine.
4436000	4441000	The bad guys were Omega Red, Sentinel, Silver Samurai, Spiral, Juggernaut, and Magneto.
4441000	4447000	So I've recently remembered everyone except for Spiral, who is who I used a lot of times in the game.
4447000	4449000	This came out in December 1994.
4449000	4451000	There was a CD out for it everywhere.
4451000	4455000	And the Saturn version was the best version.
4455000	4464000	The Saturn one allows you to actually play as the Juggernaut in two player versus mode with a cheat code.
4464000	4469000	And the Playstation 1 was kind of crap because it didn't have nearly the memory
4469000	4474000	because the Saturn one used the 4-meg RAM cartridge.
4474000	4477000	It was pretty much arcade perfect.
4477000	4479000	It only missed a few frames.
4479000	4482000	But I mean, yeah, it's just standard fighting game fare.
4482000	4484000	It's, you know, Capcom 90s fighting game.
4484000	4490000	But it was one of the best ones in a franchise that definitely lent itself very well to fighting games.
4490000	4497000	And I know I've already brought up the X-Men game that Konami did, which was a side-scrolling beat-em-up.
4497000	4499000	It was about time we had a fighting game.
4499000	4504000	And of course, after that, Brit spawned one of my favorite, which was X-Men versus Street Fighter,
4504000	4511000	which I think I've brought up before, which means the almighty team of Cammy and Gambit, which my husband hates.
4511000	4512000	So that's it.
4512000	4516000	X-Men Children of the Atom on the CPS2 system.
4516000	4519000	Or the Sega Saturn.
4519000	4523000	I like to play Storm in this and just throw tornadoes over and over and over again.
4523000	4524000	It was a lot of fun.
4524000	4526000	Titan! Titan!
4526000	4529000	I played Psylocke a whole lot. I was also really good with Wolverine.
4532000	4534000	Got your Pokemon for you.
4537000	4539000	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4539000	4541000	X-Men Children of the Atom.
4541000	4544000	Yet another game in Capcom's CPS2 arcade series.
4544000	4547000	I'm still waiting for my Quiz and Dragons, but that's all right.
4548000	4550000	That was a pretty good choice, I suppose.
4550000	4551000	What's a Quiz and Dragon?
4551000	4553000	I'm not even going to try to explain.
4553000	4554000	Was it a Capcom fighting game?
4554000	4558000	No, you had to battle wits.
4560000	4561000	No, it wasn't a fighting game.
4561000	4562000	So it was a school thing.
4562000	4564000	No, it wasn't really a school thing. Forget it.
4565000	4567000	Shane, I think it's too intellectual for you.
4567000	4569000	I think it's the problem.
4570000	4572000	All right, anyhow, we're going to take a break, guys.
4572000	4576000	When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge ready to come, including rapid-fire news, the FUGO Question of the Week,
4576000	4581000	your phone calls at 1877-GAMO-LR, our mailbag, which we have a lot of mail tonight,
4581000	4585000	and more when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
4591000	4597000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, August 24th, 2014,
4597000	4601000	with the 565th episode of our show already in progress.
4601000	4608000	Loki not here tonight, but Shane is filling in tonight, and at the beginning of the show, Shane was super tired,
4608000	4612000	but then suddenly Jamie was like, let's trade Pokémon, and now Shane's like, yay!
4612000	4615000	I can't be awake for that. It's important.
4615000	4621000	I've been naming all of these Pokémon, like Butt This, and this one I'm going to name Farquaad.
4621000	4624000	You guys are so mature. I love it.
4624000	4625000	I'm a grown-up.
4625000	4630000	Anyway, I know we can't play the music for the podcast folks, but for those of you that are listening on the podcast feed,
4630000	4632000	we did some break music there tonight.
4632000	4637000	We did a song from Parappa the Rappa, the last stage where they're kind of doing their big concert,
4637000	4640000	and Shane and Jamie were both singing along, which was kind of adorable.
4640000	4643000	It's a great song.
4643000	4646000	I haven't played that game in forever. I really need to go back.
4646000	4650000	I have Umjama Lamy as a PS1 classic, but I don't know if I ever bought Parappa the Rappa.
4650000	4652000	I like Lamy better.
4652000	4654000	I could let you borrow my copy of Parappa.
4654000	4660000	Well, I think I have Parappa on disc in one of these mini boxes that's still unpacked because LOL moving.
4660000	4662000	I actually have the PSP version.
4662000	4665000	You can't play PS1 games on a PS4.
4665000	4669000	Remember, it doesn't have that backwards compatibility anymore, but I guess I can play it on PlayStation 3.
4669000	4670000	I still have that hooked up.
4670000	4671000	Alright, Shane, we can trade.
4671000	4672000	Oh my god.
4672000	4678000	Also, during the break tonight, we had a song from Katamari Damacy, which is...
4678000	4681000	Not the best song that you could have picked, but...
4681000	4682000	She picked it.
4682000	4683000	I picked it because it's one of my favorites.
4683000	4685000	It's a good one. There's one that's better.
4685000	4687000	I like Wanda Wanda.
4687000	4689000	I like that one.
4689000	4691000	I like Wanda from DDR.
4691000	4697000	I like Katamari Mino.
4697000	4699000	I will always still love Katamari on the Rocks.
4699000	4701000	I mean, that's the one that everybody's...
4701000	4707000	But I really, really like Kei Sera Sera, just because it makes me think of the old crooners.
4707000	4711000	I think that's my second or third favorite song on there.
4711000	4716000	I'm really ready for the return of Katamari Damacy.
4716000	4723000	I know they did the Vita game just a couple years ago, but I'm ready for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Katamari.
4723000	4727000	Like, a new game. I don't know. I miss those games. They were really fun.
4727000	4730000	I mean, well, some of them got a little old, I guess.
4730000	4733000	Maybe that's why they've put the series on hibernation for a while.
4733000	4735000	But I think I'm ready for a new game.
4735000	4738000	Maybe it would be a good download title. I don't know.
4738000	4743000	Would you guys be in for a new Katamari game if they decided to put one out?
4744000	4747000	Maybe. I think the last few were kind of terrible.
4747000	4752000	You know what I think was really part of the charm about Katamari Damacy, and really the key thing,
4752000	4757000	was that the reason why the game did so damn well is that when it first came out on PlayStation 2, it was a $20 game.
4757000	4766000	Like, Namco was experimenting, I think, with this budget series, because there was a music game that was out at the same time as well that was $20 that people didn't talk about as much.
4766000	4771000	But I remember there was that one, too, because it had some of the BeatMania 2DX people that were in it randomly.
4771000	4774000	I can't remember the name of it. Somebody in chat will probably remember, though.
4774000	4776000	It was called NotBeatMania.
4776000	4781000	It didn't look anything like it. It was like a big circle. I can't remember.
4781000	4782000	A big circle?
4782000	4786000	Do you remember Garrett? He really liked that game. Oh well, forget it.
4786000	4787000	Anyway.
4788000	4789000	I'm getting there.
4789000	4794000	Oh my god, you guys are like, consumed with your trading.
4794000	4796000	It says you're not available, Shane.
4796000	4797000	I just hit it.
4797000	4801000	Let's see. But anyway, the thing was that those were budget games. They were like $20 games.
4801000	4805000	And then when the sequels came out, it was like $40, $50.
4805000	4810000	It was like, I don't know, something about paying that budget price for such an awesome little game felt really, really awesome.
4810000	4811000	So anyway.
4812000	4816000	Technic Beat, says Dark Tetsuya. That sounds right, but I might be wrong.
4816000	4818000	And you might be wrong. I don't know.
4818000	4821000	And yeah, Dark Tetsuya says it was Sampling Masters Mega. Yeah, that's it.
4821000	4822000	I don't think I ever played that.
4822000	4823000	It was Technic Beat. That was it.
4824000	4827000	Alright. Okay, going to some of the other comments in our chat room.
4827000	4831000	Fifth Dream says, I'm so fucking wishing for a return of Vib Ribbon. Okay.
4831000	4835000	No, because that's the one thing Sony did wrong was tease us this year.
4835000	4842000	Yeah, when they pulled that shit at E3, where they showed Vib Ribbon, I was like, oh my god, they're gonna bring back Vib Ribbon!
4842000	4845000	And then they were like, hey, remember Vib Ribbon?
4845000	4846000	Here's something else.
4846000	4848000	It didn't come out in America.
4848000	4849000	It didn't come out in America.
4849000	4850000	You son of a bitch.
4850000	4855000	And they used Vib Ribbon, I think, if I remember right, to segue into Dead Island.
4855000	4856000	Yeah, what the?
4857000	4859000	They used a game that didn't come out in the US.
4859000	4860000	So annoying.
4861000	4866000	So annoying. You know what, Sony, however, Sony could, could still right this wrong.
4866000	4867000	I'm just saying.
4868000	4875000	They could, they could put it on their little streaming service or something when they, but then again, you wouldn't be able to use your own music, so it probably wouldn't be as cool.
4875000	4876000	Alright.
4876000	4877000	Oh my god, Asha, that's adorable.
4877000	4880000	Right? That's why I make a million of them.
4880000	4883000	And I even think the clowns are disgusting, so this is awesome.
4883000	4889000	You guys, I need help. If you want this to devolve into Pokemon chat, then, you know, say so in chat.
4889000	4892000	But if you want them to stay on task, then you need to yell.
4892000	4894000	That is the only task that happens.
4894000	4895000	Yell at them in chat. Alright.
4895000	4898000	Let's get to some rapid fire news, though. We gotta try and keep things moving.
4898000	4899000	So Shane, what do you have for us?
4899000	4903000	I'll just do this really quick thing, because it's rapid fire, and I don't know how this is supposed to go anyway.
4903000	4911000	So, there's a guy that was a fan of Metal Gear that was remaking the entire game, like a, like a redo or a reimagining or whatever.
4911000	4916000	And Konami was kinda like, okay, that's fine, whatever. And now they're like, nope.
4916000	4917000	Psych.
4917000	4918000	There's that story.
4918000	4921000	I think it was more than one guy, just so you know, because there were like people-
4921000	4924000	Well, when they say fan remake, I'm just gonna make it singular.
4924000	4928000	People in the industry were like actually helping with that.
4928000	4931000	And I think David Hayter, it said, was a part of it, but whatever.
4931000	4941000	Next story. Some dude named Joshua Rubin, used to work for Bungie, was working on Destiny, he was part of the creative team there.
4941000	4945000	But now he's jumped over to Telltale to work on the Game of Thrones game.
4945000	4947000	And he also-
4947000	4949000	You're a Game of Thrones fan, are you looking forward to that?
4949000	4952000	I don't know, because I'm not a huge fan of Telltale games.
4952000	4953000	Why not?
4953000	4955000	Like, at all. I don't think- I think their games are-
4955000	4956000	I thought you liked The Walking Dead.
4956000	4960000	I can't even really play it, because it's scary, because it's zombies.
4960000	4968000	But, no, every time I play their games, they look really buggy, and I'm not a fan of their art styles, ever.
4968000	4973000	And he used to work for EA as the lead writer, and Capcom.
4973000	4975000	Okay, next story.
4975000	4979000	How many of these do I have? Because I'm just closing windows as I go.
4979000	4981000	The people that make You Don't Know Jack, they have-
4981000	4984000	No, no, no, no, no, the Final Fantasy XIV is your last one.
4984000	4986000	What? Then why is this out of order?
4986000	4987000	It's not out of order.
4987000	4990000	Well, on my thing, it's out of order, because that's where I clicked.
4991000	4993000	Man, this should be a bigger story.
4995000	4997000	Hold on, it's not working. Okay.
4997000	5001000	Final Fantasy, you linked me to the European version.
5001000	5005000	What is your problem? This is probably not even accurate, because of that.
5006000	5009000	I think Shane should be on the show all the time.
5009000	5012000	Because, like, critical of what Rob does.
5012000	5013000	Because it's funny.
5013000	5016000	This is my last Orange Launch Radio, everybody. It's been a pleasure.
5016000	5018000	Last week on Hoard House, he killed me.
5021000	5026000	Because you yelled, you ran into the room, and you threw ice on my head,
5026000	5028000	and Grandpa yelled, Ice Bucket Challenge.
5029000	5033000	Which had nothing to do with the charity itself.
5033000	5037000	First of all, I didn't run in here. I snuck in quietly, because you didn't know I was here.
5037000	5040000	And I dropped an ice cube on your head, because somebody asked me to do it.
5040000	5042000	I was just being nice.
5043000	5050000	Anyway, Final Fantasy XIV, they're doing their one year anniversary celebration right now.
5050000	5057000	And from August 22nd to September 1st, people that have previously played this game,
5057000	5062000	and no longer are active, or subscribed, can hop right back in and play.
5064000	5065000	So, there's that.
5065000	5068000	Hooray, I thought there was something else you wanted to say on Final Fantasy XIV,
5068000	5071000	with the anniversary celebration, like the stream or something.
5071000	5075000	Yeah, they did like a 14 hour stream. I had to sleep for most of it.
5075000	5078000	It looked interesting. They did some atma farming.
5078000	5081000	They got all of their atmas within 14 hours.
5081000	5083000	I was like, you guys know how to do it.
5083000	5086000	Well, what was the technique they used? People need to copy it.
5086000	5090000	I don't think anybody knows.
5090000	5091000	Nobody caught it, huh?
5091000	5092000	Nope.
5094000	5097000	So, that's my story.
5097000	5102000	Alright, moving on. Team Meat, of course you know from the creators of Super Meat Boy,
5102000	5106000	and they did the Tales of Isaac, was the other game too?
5106000	5108000	You mean The Binding of Isaac?
5108000	5109000	Thank you, The Binding of Isaac, sorry.
5109000	5114000	I remember it looked Zelda-esque, but it played more like a twin-stick shooter, kind of.
5114000	5116000	It played more like scary.
5116000	5119000	Yeah, it was kind of creepy, but it was cool.
5119000	5121000	Anyway, they have a new game on their way out.
5121000	5124000	It's called Avoyar for September.
5124000	5128000	But we don't know much more outside of a very artsy kind of trailer that came out.
5128000	5131000	It just had some live action in it and sad music as well.
5131000	5135000	However, more information will be coming out at PAX Prime at the Indie Mega Boost.
5135000	5138000	So, yet again, here's something else to look forward to at PAX Prime.
5138000	5142000	Team Meat will be showing Avoyar for September.
5142000	5150000	Some people have noted that Avoyar for September is an anagram of Super Meat Boy Forever.
5150000	5153000	Hmm.
5153000	5158000	Anyway, on Twitter, interesting tweet.
5158000	5163000	Looks like there'll be no Sims 4 reviews until after it's out.
5163000	5168000	EA tells me no one's getting access ahead of release. I'm nervous.
5168000	5172000	That's probably because of the SimCity Online fiasco.
5172000	5174000	Do you think that could be it?
5174000	5178000	I bet it has persistent online connection needed.
5178000	5180000	They don't want that to get out?
5180000	5185000	Yeah, because the reviews for SimCity were fairly positive up until they had all those problems.
5185000	5188000	So this would just be part two of that.
5188000	5193000	Just so you know, that tweet came from Dan Stapleton, who's one of the IGN reviewer guys.
5193000	5198000	So, I mean, if they're not getting a copy of it, probably nobody is getting a copy of that.
5198000	5201000	Does that make you nervous, Dark Soccer? Because you're a Sims fan.
5201000	5205000	I mean, I don't know anybody more into that series than you, even though you kind of fell out.
5205000	5207000	I'm on team not give a shit anymore.
5207000	5208000	Really?
5208000	5210000	I have Sims 2 and I got it for free.
5210000	5214000	And I have all of my dirty things, my weird animations in Sims 2 again.
5214000	5215000	Well.
5215000	5217000	Except I haven't touched it in three weeks.
5217000	5219000	Do you have the patch that unblurs the nudity?
5219000	5221000	Well, everyone has that. That's the first thing that people do.
5221000	5222000	Pervert.
5222000	5225000	No, because they're all like freaking Barbie dolls.
5225000	5230000	No, I have, um, there's a site that I go to called Mod The Sims.
5230000	5233000	And they have a sister site called Sexy Sims.
5233000	5237000	Which is like, you can get like fetish gear and dirty shit. So it's kind of funny.
5237000	5239000	Ooh, you nasty. All right.
5239000	5245000	I just think it's funny having them go to work wearing, you know, a strap-on on their chest.
5245000	5247000	It's hilarious.
5247000	5250000	You all try that tomorrow and see what kind of response I get.
5250000	5253000	Your job is hunting down the supernatural.
5253000	5256000	Look, you've got a cock on your chest.
5256000	5258000	It's funny.
5258000	5260000	Oh, my God. What the hell? You're giving me an Evangelion.
5260000	5266000	All right. Anyway, one more story here about the free-to-play game Path of Exile.
5266000	5269000	Path of Exile has a new expansion coming.
5269000	5273000	And this is following the Sacrifice of the Vaal expansion that the game got in March.
5273000	5278000	Path of Exile is getting Forsaken Masters as the new free expansion coming out for this game.
5278000	5285000	So Path of Exile, kind of noted because it's a Diablo alternative of sorts because it's free.
5285000	5287000	It has a lot of similarities with Diablo.
5287000	5290000	Although Path of Exile, you know, the classes are a little different.
5290000	5292000	And the skill tree is, holy shit, different.
5292000	5295000	Like, the skill tree is crazy.
5295000	5298000	I could never figure out how to build a decent character in that game.
5298000	5299000	That was kind of tricky.
5299000	5301000	Does this new expansion bring fun?
5301000	5302000	I thought it was great.
5302000	5304000	I don't know why you didn't like Path of Exile.
5304000	5306000	I thought it was actually really well done.
5306000	5308000	In fact, it's one of those games I really need to go back and play more of.
5308000	5315000	It was one of those few free-to-play games I felt inclined to give money to because I enjoyed it that much,
5315000	5319000	especially when they were in the early demo phases of that game.
5319000	5323000	Some of the stuff that's coming with that, they say it's Train with the Masters,
5323000	5326000	something that you do missions for the Masters to get reputations.
5326000	5329000	There's lots of mission variations with that.
5329000	5333000	You're going to have a hideout, which sounds like their own kind of version of player housing in a way,
5333000	5336000	so you'll be able to customize the hideout in there.
5336000	5340000	You'll also have crafting ventures that are upgradeable.
5340000	5341000	What?
5341000	5343000	Pokemon in the next game coming out.
5343000	5348000	New items and mods, new support and skill gems, new challenge leagues,
5348000	5353000	including Rampage, Beyond Challenge League, and an updated passive skill tree.
5353000	5355000	Lots and lots of stuff.
5355000	5360000	And I guess they're revamping some of the existing boss fights in Path of Exile as well,
5360000	5363000	so they're more intense and surprising, they say.
5363000	5368000	That is all coming on August 20th, and that will be released at 3 p.m. Pacific time.
5368000	5371000	If you are a fan of Path of Exile, I'm sure you already have that on your calendar.
5371000	5374000	Actually, August 20th already happened, so it just came out.
5374000	5376000	I need to check this out. I'm a little behind.
5376000	5378000	So, very cool. Congrats to them on that release.
5378000	5379000	Dark Sakura.
5379000	5382000	If you're a little behind, does it make you a bit of an ass?
5385000	5388000	So, Dead Rising movie has a director now.
5388000	5398000	It's Zach Lepofsky, who is going to be doing basically the Dead Rising movie, as they've said.
5398000	5403000	I don't even know about a Dead Rising movie right now, to be honest, because I'm like, whatever.
5403000	5410000	But anyway, he's said that he's in the director's chair, and he's doing most of the work for the movies so far,
5410000	5417000	although so far he has only done TV movies to date, and his most notable credit is Leprechaun Origins,
5417000	5419000	so yeah, I'm just going to forget that this exists.
5420000	5428000	And then, there is a game I'm excited about. Excited!
5428000	5435000	And it's Puyo Puyo Tetris. It's going to be on Xbox One and PS4, which I don't have, so I'm going to have to get one.
5435000	5444000	But it'll be... this is also the first time there is a Puyo Puyo game on a Microsoft system, so yay!
5444000	5448000	You need to hold something of Dan's ransom until he decides it's a good idea for the household.
5448000	5450000	Oh, we're probably going to get one anyway.
5450000	5451000	Hooray!
5451000	5453000	Are you going to get it before Dragon Age?
5453000	5454000	I'm playing Dragon Age on PC.
5454000	5455000	Oh.
5455000	5458000	Because mods? Hello, high-res mods.
5458000	5461000	Why do you think my Shepard looks so gorgeous?
5461000	5464000	She makes a fair point. I don't say that much about her.
5464000	5468000	And then, this is something... hey, girl.
5468000	5476000	So I brought this up before about them discussing the pinball ban in Oakland, California, and it's finally been lifted.
5476000	5483000	It is no longer considered a form of... wait, yeah. It's no longer considered a form of gambling,
5483000	5493000	so now they're actually going to be having a thing with RadioShack Stern Pinball and the International Flipper Pinball Association
5493000	5502000	to have a month-long tournament at the 3040 East 9th Street location of RadioShack in Oakland,
5502000	5505000	which probably is the only way RadioShack's going to get any business.
5505000	5507000	Doesn't say, wow, a reason to go to RadioShack.
5507000	5510000	I know, right? BRB going to Oakland.
5511000	5515000	We'll have to send... you know, we'll have to send our man on the street in Oakland.
5515000	5517000	Extefer would be the perfect person to cover this.
5517000	5521000	Hey, guys! I'm at RadioShack!
5524000	5527000	And not a bleached asshole inside.
5527000	5529000	Except maybe his.
5529000	5533000	Hey, you guys! I'm at RadioShack and I'm going to play with some balls!
5533000	5535000	That's your Christopher impression.
5535000	5537000	That's my Christopher impression.
5537000	5540000	I'm going to have to have him listen to this.
5540000	5544000	Rob used pester voice. It's super annoying.
5545000	5549000	Alright, let's go to the FUGL question of the week, you guys.
5557000	5563000	Alright, every week you guys answer our question over on our Facebook community and our Google Plus community.
5563000	5566000	You slam Facebook and Google Plus together and you get FUGL.
5566000	5569000	So here it is. Thank you, DarkTetsuya.
5569000	5572000	DarkTetsuya says, Rob does a pretty good Extefer.
5572000	5576000	And CaptainSpike says, why do you make Extefer sound like Alaska Thunderfucker?
5576000	5579000	That was nothing like my Alaska impersonation.
5579000	5583000	My Alaska impersonation is... never mind. I'm not going to do my Alaska impersonation.
5583000	5585000	Alright. Hi!
5586000	5588000	On Facebook, one game...
5588000	5591000	That just is your normal way you say hi to everybody.
5591000	5592000	It kind of is. Alright.
5592000	5597000	One game we've talked about before a lot on the show is Paths of Exile, which gets us thinking about free-to-play games.
5597000	5601000	Do you play any free-to-play games? Be honest, are they really free?
5601000	5603000	Or have you found yourself sinking a bit of money into it?
5603000	5610000	Or do you think free-to-play games will never be as good as the quote-unquote standard purchase-to-play games that are available?
5610000	5615000	Not a lot of answers tonight. I think Facebook is blocking us.
5615000	5619000	Because you know how you have to like, you know, pay to get your post noticed on Facebook.
5619000	5623000	So I would encourage you guys, if you want to answer the question, you don't see it coming up on your feed.
5623000	5624000	You have to pay the lube.
5624000	5626000	Go to Facebook.com slash OrangeLunchRadio and look at it there.
5626000	5627000	Alright, anyway.
5630000	5632000	We got some answers about the free-to-play games.
5632000	5635000	Tech2030 says, I used to play Clash of Clans.
5635000	5641000	But the longer you play, the longer the wait times get so long you're either forced to quit or pay up.
5641000	5643000	I chose the former.
5643000	5645000	William Murderface.
5645000	5647000	Friendliest. Our friendliest.
5647000	5650000	It comes from Metalocalypse.
5650000	5651000	Oh, does it?
5651000	5655000	Yeah. He's the guy with the bushy hair and the thick mustache.
5655000	5657000	I just thought it was a friendly name.
5657000	5662000	Alright. William Murderface says, I've played Rift and I play Smite, Marvel Heroes, and Swator.
5662000	5668000	I think that with the exception of Swator, I've never felt the need to invest into a free-to-play game in order to enjoy its content.
5668000	5673000	That being said, I will probably spend money in Smite and Marvel Heroes, likely for skins.
5673000	5677000	This is not something I normally pay money for, but I feel that those two games are a lot of fun,
5677000	5681000	and I wish to support the developers' decision to employ well-designed free-to-play models.
5681000	5688000	And RedTheHaze says, I play two free-to-play games and they are Destiny of Spirits on Vita and School Idol Festival on mobile.
5688000	5689000	I don't see my...
5689000	5692000	God, I tried that because I think Rama suggests that one.
5692000	5697000	I don't see myself ever putting money into these since they are pretty generous with even the paid in-game currency.
5697000	5705000	I think certain free-to-play games can be good as standard games as long as they were built to be fair and not give advantages to paying players,
5705000	5710000	unless it's a co-op-only game like Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
5710000	5715000	Let's see, we just had one more answer come in, so I'll read that too, from Kieran M.
5715000	5717000	Hope I said that right, sorry if I didn't.
5717000	5724000	Replied and said, I play Marvel Heroes. I put way too much money in it, but it is a lot of fun and I feel like I get my money's worth.
5724000	5730000	Marvel Heroes was pretty good, speaking of like Diablo-esque kind of games, I did enjoy Marvel Heroes as well.
5730000	5737000	Let's go over to Google Plus and get some of the answers over there, of which we have two.
5737000	5742000	And starting with ActDeft who says, I play Team Fortress 2 on a regular basis.
5742000	5746000	Granted, I paid for that game back in 2008 or 2009, but still.
5746000	5751000	And yeah, I've sunk some money into opening some of those crates, they give us drops, but I only do it when I have extra money.
5751000	5756000	I have also sunk some money into some mobile free-to-play games, but never again.
5756000	5764000	And lastly, Rettertainment says, right now I'm playing WWE Supercard, a collectible card game where you can spend real money to get cards for use in the game.
5764000	5770000	I'm not currently motivated to spend any money on this game, but if I lose again to Zack Ryder, I just might.
5770000	5771000	So there's some of our answers.
5772000	5783000	I am really surprised that nobody named League of Legends, which is kind of like the Queen Bee of all the free-to-play games right now.
5783000	5786000	You go to Twitch, it's always the number one thing being streamed.
5786000	5788000	I'm planning on starting that up, actually.
5788000	5794000	It's interesting. I think if you want to get into a MOBA and you've never played one before, I don't know if you've played one before or not,
5794000	5801000	I think Heroes of the Storm is the easiest one to learn, Blizzards, but you also have to be in their super special secret club to get it.
5801000	5807000	I believe Renee DNL told you to refresh Google+.
5807000	5809000	Oh, did I miss an answer?
5809000	5811000	Probably hers if she's telling you to refresh it.
5811000	5816000	I'm sorry! I literally just pulled it up.
5816000	5823000	I gave all my League of Legends swag that I got at GamerX to my friend, who plays a whole lot more than I do.
5823000	5826000	Oh, there it is. DNL replied and said,
5826000	5830000	I play free-to-play and started with Gunbound back in 2004.
5830000	5838000	I think the difference between mobile and PC free-to-plays do make a huge difference as far as how much developers feel they should make on a full-fledged game.
5838000	5842000	Would love to talk more on Aris. I've been in the industry for five plus years.
5842000	5846000	I would love to hear. I just love Renee in general and I hope she calls in later in the show.
5846000	5848000	We would love to hear from her.
5849000	5851000	So, what was I going to say on free-to-play?
5851000	5854000	So, what free-to-play games do you guys play, if any?
5854000	5857000	I used to play Ragnarok Online. A whole bunch.
5857000	5858000	Was that free?
5858000	5862000	It was when I was in the beta, then it went to pay, and then I actually paid for it.
5862000	5863000	I thought it was a pay game. Okay.
5863000	5865000	Well, the original is still a pay.
5865000	5868000	R02 is free-to-play, which I'll play sometimes.
5868000	5876000	I played Star Trek Online when I was already paying for a subscription, and then I played in the free-to-play era off and on.
5876000	5883000	And I didn't get into Guild Wars too much. A copy was gifted to me and I didn't really play it.
5883000	5894000	So, yeah. I mean, I played that Sims game on Facebook for a while, and then I got into my anti-all-Facebook-games phase.
5894000	5897000	Shane, is there any free-to-play games you enjoy?
5897000	5902000	On my phone, I spent a lot of money on DJ Max.
5902000	5903000	Oh, yeah.
5903000	5904000	Lots.
5904000	5905000	I forgot that was free-to-play.
5905000	5912000	Yep. And the Record Runner game, I haven't paid any money for it, but I play it a lot.
5912000	5913000	Oh, yeah. The harmonics one, right?
5913000	5914000	Mm-hmm.
5914000	5915000	Yeah.
5915000	5918000	And the other DJ Max game, but I didn't put any money into that one either.
5918000	5919000	So, lots of music games.
5919000	5920000	Yeah. Lots of music games.
5920000	5923000	Do you play U-Beat and Reflect Beat and all that stuff too?
5923000	5929000	Yeah, I have it on there. I have... No, I think I purchased something for Reflect Beat.
5929000	5932000	U-Beat is not very fun on the iPhone.
5932000	5935000	It is fun on the arcade now that I've played it.
5935000	5941000	But, no, pretty much just DJ Max, I think, is the only thing I've ever put money into that's free-to-play.
5941000	5943000	So, here's the thing.
5943000	5951000	I think my gamer ADD, where I just go from one game to another without ever beating the game or whatever, unless it's an MMO,
5951000	5956000	I think that kind of stops me from really getting immersed in these free-to-play games,
5956000	5964000	especially like one of our Facebook answers said, to the point where you either have to kind of pay money or, you know, you have to wait forever to do things.
5964000	5967000	I did play the Dragon Age game on Facebook when it was around.
5967000	5970000	That was a free-to-play that had pay options too, which I always did.
5970000	5972000	Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted.
5972000	5974000	Whatever you rudely interrupt all the time.
5974000	5976000	I was...
5976000	5977000	Interrupt.
5977000	5985000	I've been enjoying lately, like, I played Marvel Puzzle Quest, but then I just kind of stopped, and I don't know why.
5985000	5988000	Like, I enjoyed the game, but then I was like, ooh, something else to play.
5988000	5995000	Now I started playing Neverwinter, which I touched for like five minutes, you know, just a hot minute, like a while ago,
5995000	6000000	but now, like, I went back to it because I had some friends that were playing it and were like, you've got to go check it out.
6000000	6002000	And now I've been playing that, like, a lot.
6002000	6004000	So that's kind of like my free-to-play game at the moment.
6004000	6006000	But then I'm like, ooh, Path of Exile got an expansion.
6006000	6007000	I've got to go check that out too.
6007000	6009000	That's a free-to-play game as well.
6009000	6013000	So, that's my problem with free-to-play games.
6013000	6014000	I only have time for one.
6014000	6021000	You know a random, like, music game that just popped in my head that I would have paid lots of money to do if it was a free-to-play game?
6021000	6022000	Mm.
6022000	6023000	Because it never came out?
6023000	6024000	Mm-hmm.
6024000	6025000	X-Tango.
6025000	6026000	I don't know why that even came into my head.
6026000	6027000	X-Tango was great.
6027000	6028000	It was such a good game.
6028000	6030000	Yeah.
6030000	6032000	All right, good stuff, good stuff.
6032000	6036000	Let's see, Game Geeks in Chat says, I miss SimSocial on Facebook.
6036000	6039000	That's what reminded me of the Dragon Age one.
6039000	6042000	They actually, yeah, closed that one, huh?
6042000	6047000	Let's see, Hitstun says, whoa, I didn't know DJMax Technical was on Android getting that now.
6047000	6049000	So, there you go.
6049000	6053000	All right, let's move on to some more news.
6053000	6054000	Shane.
6054000	6057000	Okay, let me pull this up.
6057000	6064000	So, the people that make You Don't Know Jack have a new game on Xbox One right now called Fibbage.
6064000	6073000	To me, it looks like Balderdash, the game where you make up definitions for things except kind of in reverse.
6073000	6081000	No, I guess it would, yeah, it'd be in reverse because they give you the definition and you come up with what you're trying to define.
6081000	6082000	I don't know what I'm saying.
6082000	6083000	I'm tired.
6083000	6084000	Anyway.
6084000	6086000	They give you the meaning, you give them the word?
6086000	6088000	Yes.
6088000	6094000	It's hosted by Cookie Masterson who does the classic You Don't Know Jack games.
6094000	6106000	Apparently, you can play up to eight players and it is coming out on PS4 this September as well and PS3 for cross-compatibility.
6106000	6109000	It's going to be seven bucks on Xbox One.
6109000	6112000	I assume it'll be the same on PS4 and PS3.
6113000	6118000	I love You Don't Know Jack so I actually am very excited about this.
6118000	6126000	It could be the next UNO game for Xbox Live because UNO got a lot of play back in the day.
6126000	6127000	It sure did.
6127000	6129000	Except this is funny.
6129000	6133000	I loved the You Don't Know Jack reboot they did.
6133000	6137000	I hope that isn't the only thing we're ever going to get out of that kind of reboot of that.
6137000	6139000	That's a free-to-play game I do too.
6139000	6141000	Oh yeah, because it was on Facebook, right?
6141000	6142000	It's also on iPhone.
6142000	6143000	Oh, is it?
6143000	6144000	Yeah, I have it on my phone.
6144000	6148000	Do they update it with new episodes?
6148000	6149000	I don't know if they do anymore.
6152000	6154000	Let's move on.
6154000	6157000	I got some news regarding Smash Brothers.
6157000	6161000	Why is there a gap between the Wii U version and the 3DS version?
6161000	6166000	This was explained by Mashihiro Sakurai in his weekly column this week.
6166000	6170000	Basically, it's because of the debug period in testing for bugs.
6170000	6178000	What they're doing is by delaying the Wii U version, they can shift the debugging periods and get the 3DS version out the gate at first.
6178000	6181000	So, quote, checking is done both domestically and overseas.
6181000	6184000	So for a game like Smash Brothers, several hundred people are employed.
6184000	6186000	So debugging alone becomes a huge project.
6186000	6192000	So much so that one of the biggest reasons for the separate release dates for 3DS and Wii U was so that we could shift the debugging periods.
6192000	6201000	In a previous Smash Brothers, we found a bug during the debugging process where if Fighter A hits item B and Fighter C and D are simultaneously affected, the game would freeze.
6201000	6208000	Considering not only the different fighters, but item stages, color settings, play rules, and game modes, the number of varying combinations are astronomical.
6208000	6211000	In order to properly debug, every pattern must be tried.
6211000	6215000	But such a task would be impossible no matter how many decades or centuries you take.
6215000	6221000	There are many reasons why a game's release dates will be delayed, but 8 or 9 times out of 10 it's because a bug couldn't be fixed in time.
6221000	6224000	But it's better than releasing a product like that.
6224000	6228000	There's a lot of companies out there that would have released it anyway, just saying.
6228000	6231000	But I'm glad they are holding it for quality.
6231000	6237000	Now something else really exciting, the list of Smash Brothers 3DS composers came out this week.
6237000	6241000	And there's some pretty cool people contributing to the game.
6241000	6243000	Is a Kiriyama Oka one of them?
6243000	6247000	Is a Kiriyama Oka one of them? I actually don't think I saw a Kiriyama Oka's name on the list.
6247000	6249000	This is garbage.
6250000	6254000	It would be cool if he did the Legend of Zelda theme.
6254000	6259000	I will say this, Yuzo Koshiro is one of the contributors, which I think is really cool.
6259000	6263000	Yuzo Koshiro did the Wangen Midnight Maximum 2 and I really like his stuff.
6263000	6267000	Yasunori Mitsuda from Chrono Trigger is one of the contributors, which I think is really cool.
6267000	6270000	Ace from Xenoblade Chronicles.
6270000	6275000	Okay, okay. How about Shota Kageyama, Shane?
6275000	6276000	Who's that?
6276000	6278000	Pokemon X and Y.
6281000	6285000	The music in that game is pretty good out of the Pokemon games, I'll give it that.
6285000	6291000	And Junichi Nakatsuru from Katamari no Mashii is going to be on the soundtrack as well.
6291000	6292000	So that's pretty cool.
6292000	6294000	What about the Beatles?
6294000	6297000	The Beatles, I don't believe.
6297000	6299000	Don't say that while I'm drinking stuff.
6299000	6302000	I'm not sure how they relate.
6302000	6305000	I'm just thinking of famous music people.
6305000	6308000	No, no, I don't think that one counts.
6308000	6310000	Don't forget about the Bach stage.
6310000	6312000	I was going to say Bach next.
6312000	6317000	A post-humous composition just for Smash Brothers.
6317000	6318000	What?
6318000	6322000	I'm so jealous of Renee right now because of the things she's saying in chat.
6322000	6325000	It's not even... I have to throw the mic down and leave.
6325000	6329000	We have an email about that actually, so hold that mic throw.
6329000	6333000	Alright, let's move on with some more Dark Sakura.
6333000	6338000	Well, you can get now the Wii U version of Disney Infinity for free.
6338000	6340000	You can download it via the Nintendo eShop.
6340000	6342000	But you know what you do have to buy?
6342000	6345000	All the figures so that you can play it at all.
6345000	6351000	So it's like when they give away free coffee machines,
6351000	6354000	but you have to spend a fortune buying all the pods and stuff for it.
6354000	6356000	It's the same thing.
6356000	6358000	Get addicted! Oh wait, you can't play it.
6358000	6361000	Get the stuff that makes you be able to play it.
6361000	6362000	The end.
6362000	6365000	Yeah, I was going to say, but you still have to get the little reader thing too,
6365000	6367000	and that's going to cost money.
6367000	6368000	Yeah.
6368000	6372000	So it's like, well, if the reader costs 30 bucks, then it's really not that free.
6372000	6379000	It's like they make you buy the needle first and then give you the heroin.
6381000	6382000	You know what?
6382000	6383000	What?
6383000	6385000	I'm actually going to be buying a Disney Infinity figure.
6385000	6386000	Are you?
6386000	6388000	Yep. I'm not even going to get the game.
6388000	6389000	You're going to get Rocket Raccoon?
6389000	6390000	Heck yeah!
6390000	6391000	I just knew it.
6391000	6395000	Dude, Rocket Raccoon was one of my favorite characters from the 90s and everything.
6395000	6399000	Okay, great question from Port Center in our chat room who says,
6399000	6401000	Doesn't the Wii U game pad have the built-in sensor?
6401000	6404000	Why, yes it does, but this game doesn't use it for some reason.
6404000	6408000	Actually, it doesn't use it with Skylanders either.
6408000	6412000	Well, yeah, the Wii U sensor isn't activated for anything yet.
6412000	6413000	Wise.
6413000	6414000	You're wrong.
6414000	6415000	What?
6415000	6416000	Pokemon Rumble U.
6416000	6418000	Oh, okay, so there is that.
6418000	6421000	Well, I was thinking Amiibo was going to be the first big, big thing that used it.
6421000	6424000	It'll probably be the first big thing that uses it.
6424000	6425000	Yeah.
6425000	6426000	Because Pokemon Rumble U, I don't think it does so well.
6426000	6428000	Remember, Nintendo has to build stuff for themselves first,
6428000	6432000	and then maybe if you're worthy enough, the third-party companies can use it, I guess.
6432000	6433000	So.
6433000	6437000	ActDeft brings up, though, the portal can cost $10 used,
6437000	6440000	and the PS3 one can be used with the Wii U version.
6440000	6442000	Oh, that's a good little tip.
6443000	6449000	Especially if you find a place that's, like, you know, overcharging for the Wii U one,
6449000	6451000	because they know it's free.
6451000	6452000	So, hmm.
6452000	6454000	Good little tip there from ActDeft.
6454000	6455000	Shane.
6455000	6462000	So, this renowned French coder, Smeelum, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right,
6462000	6470000	has announced that he has created a homebrew channel for the Nintendo 3DS,
6470000	6473000	and it's coming out very soon.
6473000	6481000	It will work on the current 3DS firmware, unlike, I guess, the other homebrew channels before it.
6481000	6486000	Unless I'm reading this wrong, but whatever, I don't care.
6486000	6488000	But it'll allow you to play games from any region,
6488000	6494000	but you can't run commercial or pirated 3DS roms on it.
6494000	6498000	It will support the North American, European, and Japanese systems,
6498000	6502000	and you'll still need a homebrew device to patch your system, presumably.
6504000	6508000	Hackers gonna hack, but I love the fact that they're gonna get around that region lock.
6508000	6511000	Yeah, that region lock is so dumb.
6511000	6513000	Like, so dumb.
6513000	6517000	It almost, like, I usually don't, you know, really condone a lot of this stuff.
6517000	6519000	You know, I don't want to steal games.
6519000	6521000	I want to support game makers and all that stuff.
6521000	6522000	I don't support, yeah.
6522000	6527000	When it comes to the region locking and that kind of fuckery, I'm like, all bets are off, quite frankly.
6527000	6531000	If, you know, because I want to play this game, even if it's not necessarily in my region.
6531000	6534000	Like, this is a world market now when it comes to games, so.
6534000	6537000	But anyway, that's soapbox aside.
6537000	6541000	Would you consider putting homebrew channel on your 3DS, Shane?
6541000	6543000	I don't know.
6543000	6551000	I'm trying to think of any 3DS games that are not available here that I would import.
6551000	6554000	Because eventually the stuff I want will come over here.
6554000	6556000	I probably want Mother 3.
6556000	6562000	And it is noted you can't run commercial or pirated 3DS roms just to reemphasize that, so.
6562000	6566000	And Mother 3 was GBA, so you wouldn't be able to do that.
6566000	6570000	Hitstun in chat says, well, that solves the Puyo Puyo Tetris problem.
6570000	6574000	Because, yeah, folks in chat, when you were talking about Puyo Puyo Tetris earlier were saying,
6574000	6581000	oh, great, we can finally play this because it's out on all these other systems like 3DS and so forth in Japan, but not here.
6581000	6582000	And so it's region locked.
6582000	6587000	So this homebrew would allow Puyo Puyo Tetris for all. Yay.
6587000	6591000	I could get, like, I guess I could get Sentai games. That would be awesome.
6591000	6592000	You could. That would be fun.
6592000	6593000	Yeah, I would play those.
6593000	6597000	Dungeon Buster says, I modded my Wii to play Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii early.
6597000	6600000	The extra functionality for the rest of my games was worth it, too.
6600000	6602000	To be honest, Dungeon Buster, that was the thing.
6602000	6605000	I unapologetically did it for the exact same reason.
6605000	6611000	That Xenoblade Chronicles thing was such fuckery, I have no regrets over modding my Wii to do that, so.
6611000	6616000	And then the fact that they release it at only two places or whatever was stupid.
6616000	6620000	So, anyway, off my soapbox.
6620000	6629000	Let's move on to something less stupid and more awesome, because I love it when we can make games more accessible for more people.
6629000	6634000	And I actually know we have some people that, at least historically, have listened to OLR.
6634000	6638000	I don't know if we have some folks that are still listening to OLR that are visually impaired.
6639000	6641000	Perhaps even legally blind.
6641000	6646000	And yet, these folks, at least the ones we've talked to over the years, still have a great love for video games.
6646000	6652000	Even though, obviously, you have to kind of learn to appreciate them probably in a different way.
6652000	6659000	That somebody who has sight, like myself, or, you know, Darcyro or whoever, can enjoy them.
6659000	6661000	So, what is happening?
6661000	6664000	And this is pretty cool, because this is actually a report that came out of the BBC.
6664000	6667000	So this is something that was kind of running from a major, major news outlet.
6667000	6674000	And this is about a video-less 3D game being developed for blind players.
6674000	6679000	And the concept is to make the industry more accessible to blind and visually impaired people.
6679000	6685000	And what video-less games do is they use a production technique known as binaural...
6685000	6687000	Sorry, I can't pronounce this word at all.
6687000	6691000	I think this thing that they're doing applies to you all of a sudden.
6691000	6698000	Oral binaural recording to do an immersive audio-only world.
6698000	6704000	And what they do is they fit a dummy with condenser microphones that mimic the way the ears hear sound.
6704000	6707000	And then scenes in the game are recorded using that method.
6707000	6711000	And what you get out of that is a realistic three-dimensional experience.
6711000	6716000	Now, there's no graphics, because again, these games are being created for the visually impaired.
6716000	6719000	But you rely on those senses to navigate through levels.
6719000	6723000	It's like all the games would be Silent Hill. It'd be so scary.
6723000	6725000	Not necessarily, they're all.
6725000	6732000	Let's see, Blind Legend is a team at DeWino Studios.
6732000	6735000	Sorry, Blind Legend is the game that this team is making.
6735000	6740000	That's, quote, we wanted to put blind and disabled gamers in the same field of quality as sighted gamers.
6740000	6743000	That was our main aim. That was our main challenge.
6743000	6747000	So that's pretty cool. And I guess they're using some crowdfunding to make it happen.
6747000	6750000	What you do in Blind Legend, it's not Silent Hill.
6750000	6757000	You are a knight who loses their eyesight, and you journey through a forest to free your wife from her violent kidnappers.
6757000	6760000	A scary forest.
6760000	6762000	So there you go.
6762000	6766000	The noises of the forest, the birds flying above, the river flowing, you hear these sounds.
6766000	6770000	And that information helps the gamer locate themselves in that environment.
6771000	6781000	This sounds like a really awesome way to kind of be able to maybe experience what somebody who is visually impaired has to go through.
6781000	6787000	Did they ever do that to you in elementary school where it's like you have to wear a blindfold for an entire day to see what it's like?
6787000	6793000	Or you have to wear headphones or something to simulate being deaf or something?
6793000	6798000	Did they ever do that to you in school? We had to do the blindfold thing.
6798000	6799000	No.
6799000	6800000	Really?
6800000	6801000	No.
6801000	6807000	Well, this would just be a really cool way to, like, everybody has the same experience in a way. So I like that.
6807000	6812000	Bochikawa says, so it's like an audiobook for a game? That sounds so cool.
6812000	6818000	As long as it's not a scary game, I think it could be fun. But I just imagine Silent Hill.
6818000	6826000	Well, now, in 2010, Something Else, which is a British game studio, did a game called Papa Sangre, which is an audio-driven thriller.
6826000	6832000	There's no graphics in the game. So, yes, there are thrillers as well, if you want to check that out.
6832000	6834000	Good luck.
6834000	6843000	Marissa Cungusto in chat says, hi, Marissa, by the way, says, sensitivity training. I had to wear gloves for tactile disabilities.
6843000	6850000	Black Wolf, our pal Bobby Black Wolf, says they actually had an art installation here in Atlanta that was pitch black.
6850000	6853000	It was called Dialogue in the Dark. Isn't there, like, a restaurant like that?
6853000	6855000	I've seen that on Facebook or something.
6855000	6861000	There's a deaf restaurant where it's staffed entirely by deaf people.
6861000	6862000	There's one in San Francisco.
6862000	6864000	And you have to sign your order.
6864000	6865000	Oh, wow.
6865000	6867000	Because my friend was talking about it.
6867000	6872000	Game Geeks in chat says, we had to do vision, hearing, and tactile for dementia training.
6872000	6880000	I love this idea of making really cool experiences that are really accessible to more gaming fans.
6880000	6885000	And trust me, there are blind gaming fans out there. We've heard from them here at OLR.
6885000	6890000	So I'm really happy that, you know, they're trying to make more experiences for everybody.
6890000	6896000	And I'm sure lots of other types of disabled folks would appreciate the accessibility.
6896000	6899000	Like, it always blows my mind when a game does not have button mapping.
6899000	6904000	There should be no reason why you can't remap buttons to wherever a person might need them.
6904000	6906000	It always struck me as a little silly.
6906000	6909000	All right. Let's move on. Let's go to our mailbag.
6909000	6913000	Every week you guys send us email at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
6913000	6918000	And DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and finds some emails that she thinks,
6918000	6920000	hey, I'm going to read these on the show.
6920000	6925000	Which I got to say, this is so weird because last week we said send us four emails
6925000	6928000	or else we're going to do the Kim Kardashian music during the break.
6928000	6930000	And you failed and you got Kim Kardashian music.
6930000	6933000	However, this week, there was at least five emails last I checked.
6933000	6937000	There are, but one of them is saying that Dan was too loud, so I'm not going to read it, narc.
6937000	6942000	Can't take the criticisms, huh?
6942000	6951000	Well, I have to be a good wife and defend my husband's lack of control of his vocal range.
6951000	6956000	To be fair, you know, we have to do everything live and on the fly and I try to sound balance people.
6956000	6961000	But you guys know I love Loki dearly. He's notorious for this, right?
6961000	6965000	When we do the mic check, he'll be his normal Loki voice.
6965000	6967000	Check one, two, check one, two, right?
6967000	6975000	I don't understand. Dan is always in that.
6975000	6978000	I don't understand. Dan projects.
6978000	6985000	He's got massive lung capacity and cannot help but project because he's that kind of awesome guy.
6985000	6990000	He cannot be contained by your audio control, Rob.
6991000	6995000	I will say there was a comment at vognetwork.com on last week's show.
6995000	6999000	I believe it was from Flaco Jones. I apologize if I'm misappropriating it, but I don't have it in front of me.
6999000	7004000	Who basically said, I love it when you guys have Shane on and some of the other people you have on,
7004000	7007000	but Dan is the best guest you guys get on that show.
7007000	7010000	So you take the positive with an A.
7010000	7012000	Dan is the best guest. Sorry, Shane. Dan's the best.
7012000	7014000	I'm not even paying attention.
7014000	7018000	You know what? Yeah, exactly. You know what? That's exactly why Shane's not the best guest.
7018000	7021000	I'm thinking about Power Rangers. It's very important right now.
7021000	7030000	For the record, Dan and I have been working on an idea for a podcast together, which I would sit him down and have a chat.
7030000	7036000	Maybe you want to get three microphone condoms to help muffle the sound.
7036000	7044000	Last week's episode was actually turned down two decibels in post-production, the entire episode, just saying.
7044000	7047000	But I think Dan's great too, even when he and I disagree.
7047000	7050000	This also is a bit more of an open room.
7050000	7052000	That is true. That is true.
7052000	7058000	And Marissa gets a very big claim as also a great guest.
7058000	7060000	I love Marissa. When's she coming back?
7060000	7063000	Now, I hope. Come on, Marissa.
7063000	7068000	Hi, OLR crew. By the way, Enark also did say that the show was good.
7068000	7074000	Hi, OLR crew. AZHP here. I've had about ten jello shots and a shot of tequila, so I'm pretty drunk.
7074000	7081000	But I just got back from the Japan Expo convention concert in San Mateo with Akira Yamaoka and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.
7081000	7084000	And during a break, she said her favorite movie was Showgirls.
7084000	7089000	And if she ever opened a movie theater, the movies would only show Showgirls and Starship Troopers.
7089000	7097000	I wonder if she just drove up to San Francisco for the Peaches Christ showing, because that was this weekend, the 18th or 19th annual Showgirls.
7097000	7100000	They were here in San Mateo? That's not that far.
7100000	7103000	Shane, how did you not know about this?
7103000	7104000	I don't know.
7104000	7106000	You failed. You failed too.
7106000	7109000	I need to yell at Shane.
7109000	7112000	You live with him. Yell at him when I'm not here.
7112000	7114000	I have to get up early in the morning.
7114000	7119000	So if you ever wondered if this singer from all Silent Hill games is fucking awesome, wonder no more.
7119000	7120000	Here's truly AZHP.
7120000	7123000	P.S. Akira Yamaoka came on stage wearing a luchador mask.
7123000	7126000	He is as crazy as you would expect considering the music he makes.
7126000	7128000	But damn, he can play the guitar.
7128000	7130000	P.P.S. God bless autocorrect.
7130000	7135000	So in other words, what he's saying is that if you don't think she's the best singer, then you don't know shit.
7139000	7141000	Darlin', you are a whore.
7141000	7145000	Where's this expo going? Back east? Where back east?
7145000	7147000	Different places!
7147000	7149000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
7149000	7153000	Read your Power Rangers article. Alright, next up.
7153000	7158000	Alright. Hey O.L.R., just writing in to get your thoughts on something that blew up on Twitter last weekend.
7159000	7162000	The background requires a bit of explanation, so here goes the game.
7162000	7166000	Akiba's Trip is a quirky beat-em-up that came out a few weeks ago.
7166000	7170000	It's set in Akihabara and has a lot of parody of otaku culture,
7170000	7175000	including one feature called Pitter, a 2chan slash 4chan slash Twitter knockoff.
7177000	7180000	The feature runs constantly on the side of the game, not necessary for gameplay,
7180000	7187000	but lets you follow some of the other denizens of Akiba for some insight into this fake Akihabara.
7188000	7191000	One such reoccurring poster is an oblivious hater troll,
7191000	7194000	and that is meant to be someone we're not supposed to like.
7194000	7200000	The thing that blew up on Twitter, the real one, is that this troll likes to harass an apparently transgender poster.
7200000	7204000	I only say apparently because we're given no real means to determine it,
7204000	7209000	and I haven't given any case this character confirming or denying it yet in game.
7209000	7214000	By replying with mean things, such as including a particular term for transgender people,
7214000	7220000	the use of that term offended some transgender gamers who took to asking XSeed,
7220000	7222000	the publisher that they remove it from the game.
7222000	7225000	I'm not sure if you want to use the term on your show or not,
7225000	7229000	the word that caused all this was, quote, trap, end quote.
7230000	7232000	XSeed's response was that they'll look into the situation,
7232000	7237000	and the person who translated much of the dialogue posted a pretty interesting look into the process
7237000	7240000	and why the term was used, despite it potentially being offensive.
7240000	7244000	Her Tumblr is Hatsu, to use, if you're interested.
7244000	7249000	Naturally, some people jumped to defend the game and argue that others were too thin-skinned,
7249000	7251000	and that's what led up to the blowup.
7251000	7255000	Might be worth pointing out, thanks to screenshots of the lines and questions circulating online,
7255000	7258000	many people on both sides were working without full context to the scenes,
7258000	7263000	nor with knowledge that the other fictional posters in the game do not attack the transgender character,
7263000	7266000	and quite a few of them even tell the hater to knock it off.
7267000	7270000	The base level question is this, I guess.
7270000	7272000	What do you make of this situation?
7272000	7275000	How would you think you would have handled it even in the lines themselves or after the blowup
7275000	7277000	if you were in XSeed's position?
7279000	7283000	This is a really weird thing to say, but I honestly feel like I'm in no position
7283000	7287000	to really be able to accurately say if it is offensive or not,
7287000	7289000	because I'm going to be completely honest.
7289000	7292000	I started to read this email before the show, and as I'm reading through the email
7292000	7295000	and they're talking about the transgender slur,
7295000	7301000	I immediately assumed that that was the word that rhymes with Aunt Franny, right?
7301000	7304000	I assumed that that was the word that they were talking about.
7304000	7309000	And then when he said the word in the email, which we repeated for educational purposes,
7309000	7312000	sorry if anybody was offended by that, because honest-
7312000	7313000	I said quotey fingers.
7313000	7318000	Right. Well, honest to God, call me ignorant or privileged or whatever you want,
7318000	7321000	I had no idea that was a slur.
7321000	7326000	No, I would never use- I can't think of a possible reason why I would use that word.
7326000	7329000	And I actually did Google research.
7329000	7332000	I was like, how is that- because I wanted to educate myself, okay?
7332000	7334000	So I was like, how is that an offensive word?
7334000	7337000	And now I see, oh, okay, that's why it's offensive or whatever,
7337000	7342000	which if- how do I say this in a politically correct way?
7342000	7345000	And I really apologize if anybody's offended, but I'm saying this for educational purposes.
7345000	7347000	Please understand.
7347000	7354000	That basically, like, somebody may not be the gender that somebody assumed they were.
7354000	7356000	That is a- right, okay.
7356000	7359000	So- but ridiculous, right?
7359000	7364000	So the reason why I tell you that story about me having to, like, Google this
7364000	7372000	to figure out why it's offensive, this is why there's always that call for diversity in gaming.
7372000	7379000	And I know a lot of people are like, why do women force themselves in the game industry
7379000	7383000	and complain and- why do the social justice warrior, transgender, blah, blah, blah.
7383000	7388000	And look, look, guys, I get issues with a lot of social justice warrior shit, too.
7388000	7392000	I think there's way too much slacktivism that happens on the internet.
7392000	7396000	I think there's a lot of people that will retweet a lot of things,
7396000	7401000	but then be too lazy to vote when it really counts, and that fucking pisses me off.
7401000	7412000	However, by the same token, I can also recognize that this exact story is why we can use more diversity.
7412000	7419000	Maybe somebody should have played through this who knows this word and knows this slur
7419000	7424000	and some of the negative connotations a little better than I that could have said,
7424000	7431000	okay, this makes sense because, you know, this is part of the story, or this is parody a la South Park
7431000	7436000	and it feels that way, or, you know what, no, this is offensive and you should change this word
7436000	7440000	to a more generic, you know, not offensive terminology.
7440000	7445000	But seeing as I- honestly, I really appreciate the email because I really wanted to make sure this topic
7445000	7450000	got brought up on the show, but as I, A, haven't played the game, and B, don't have the proper perspective,
7450000	7453000	I'm not sure if I can sit here and tell you it's right or wrong.
7453000	7456000	But I will say, yeah, South Park gets away with a lot of shit.
7459000	7466000	I would also, though, point out that people should just not jump to initially blaming social justice warriors on this.
7466000	7475000	While they do overstate, or I'd say take things way too, what's the word I'm thinking of, way too far to extremes,
7476000	7483000	this was actually people who were transgender who had some problems with the terminology as well,
7483000	7485000	according to the email from what I read.
7486000	7491000	You know, and I'm seeing a lot of comments in chat that's like, you know, hitstun's like, wait, that offends people?
7491000	7495000	And Act F says, Sky, this day and age of Tumblr and social justice warriors, anything can be offensive.
7495000	7500000	And Kaijuto, or who is it, yeah, Kaijuto says, oh no, they're going to have to edit Star Wars now.
7500000	7505000	And Fifth Dream says, like many offensive words, people who might be offended by the word also use the word.
7505000	7507000	So it's hard to know what's offensive and what isn't sometimes.
7507000	7512000	You know, I think in general, like, you know, we've had this discussion here to try to educate people.
7512000	7519000	And I think what needs to happen on both sides, what I would like to see the social justice warriors of the world,
7519000	7526000	and the people who love to push their buttons, what I think we fucking need on both sides is more patience.
7526000	7528000	You know what really bugs me?
7528000	7530000	I was going to say valium, but yeah, patience too.
7530000	7535000	It really bugs me and it makes me sad. And it's one of the worst traits.
7535000	7540000	Not to get too deep here, but like, especially with all the bullshit that's been going on in the gaming world this week,
7540000	7542000	I think this is important.
7542000	7549000	I think it's always a sad case of humanity when we always instantly want to assume the worst in people.
7549000	7553000	And the internet brings this out in a horrific way.
7553000	7558000	And yes, there are some pretty awful people out there like, look at all the fuckery going on with the hacks today.
7558000	7564000	But my point is that most people, most people are inherently good people.
7564000	7569000	And we could learn a lot from each other if we would just be patient with each other and listen to each other
7569000	7576000	and stop assuming that somebody is instantly only existing to piss you off.
7578000	7579000	I disagree.
7579000	7580000	Okay.
7580000	7584000	I believe that most people individually can be good people.
7584000	7593000	You get people into a large group where you have one voice rising above the other ones and most people, sorry, are followers.
7593000	7602000	If we didn't have most people being followers, we wouldn't have the massive amounts of police brutality that we're seeing today
7602000	7607000	by people making assumptions about other people or being thrown into situations in front of groups
7607000	7613000	and making up lies about a particular victim of a murder just because of his skin color.
7613000	7618000	We wouldn't have whole groups of ideologies going around beheading people in the Middle East at this point.
7618000	7631000	We wouldn't have people deciding to throw bombs into cities and using their own towns as basically using their own citizens as human shields in retaliation.
7631000	7641000	We wouldn't have any of that if people would start thinking for themselves and act on their innate goodness rather than let that be silenced by those in power.
7641000	7644000	So in other words, don't be a follower.
7645000	7647000	Be passionate and act on it.
7647000	7650000	Yeah. That I can agree with. Yes.
7650000	7659000	Because when the moment that you let your voice be silenced by somebody else or let yourself be distracted by watching fucking reality TV or, you know.
7659000	7662000	Well, but not, see, not all reality TV is necessarily bad.
7662000	7670000	I know, but I'm saying this. That a lot of people would rather just, between watching the news and watching, you know, something mindless on TV,
7670000	7674000	they'll watch the mindless thing on TV and just go, oh, well, that's bad. What can I do about it?
7674000	7678000	They can do something about it. They just don't think they can because they don't trust their voice.
7678000	7685000	But this is a show about video games and a lot of times those mindless reality shows and video games are an escape from all that other bullshit that goes on in the world.
7685000	7690000	I'm not saying you have to stay ignorant to that bullshit in the world. You should be aware of what's going on, but I think it's okay.
7690000	7692000	You don't make it your life. Yeah.
7692000	7699000	Your life should not be escape. Your life should be living. The escape is to have a moment of a break.
7699000	7708000	It's when you forget to live and forget that other people are trying to live, that you actually play a hand in the disaster that goes on in the world.
7708000	7713000	As I say, it's the biggest evil is when good people do nothing.
7714000	7719000	The Legend of Zaku in chat says, reject false icons indeed. So, all right.
7719000	7723000	Wow. This got way too deep. I need more. I can't believe I'm going to say this.
7723000	7727000	I need more Pokemon chat or Power Rangers chat to help us.
7727000	7729000	No, you don't want the Power Rangers chat. Trust me.
7729000	7732000	There's more in the email. So, okay. Yeah.
7732000	7736000	My other question, I think that begets this is where do we draw the line for parody?
7736000	7741000	My mind immediately jumps to South Park, which gets away with some pretty offensive stuff in the name of parody.
7741000	7747000	At this point, South Park has been around long enough that I don't feel like I see many people get offended with the show anymore.
7747000	7753000	I'm not sure if that's just because everyone dismisses it now or if they've gotten good at walking the thin line.
7753000	7761000	Do you all think we should avoid offending anyone in games or is there a place for parody that some might find offensive?
7761000	7766000	Anyway, thanks for the responses and the podcast. And this comes from Andy R.
7767000	7771000	And in regards to that, I think that people have become desensitized to a lot of it.
7771000	7775000	I mean, if you want to hear some offensive shit, listen to Lisa Lampanelli.
7775000	7782000	But she does it in such a way that one, you see the humor in it.
7782000	7787000	And number two, you see how ridiculous the stereotypes are. And that's why I like listening to her.
7787000	7789000	And that's kind of how South Park does it, too.
7789000	7794000	It's like you kind of need a little bit of parody and a sense of humor to keep things in check.
7794000	7797000	I mean, something like South Park is going to make fun of everybody.
7797000	7800000	Everybody. Everything is a target in that show.
7800000	7805000	But if it's not your cup of tea, don't watch it.
7805000	7808000	And there's nothing wrong with you if you get offended by South Park.
7808000	7813000	It's just not a show for you. But at the same time, don't judge me if I have a giggle at it.
7813000	7816000	And I've said this before a long time ago on this show.
7816000	7821000	But I said that people should learn to be offended because there are some things that are going to offend you.
7821000	7824000	And they can be said with the most innocence in mind.
7824000	7831000	And the thing is that the person, you know, yeah, you may have an opportunity to educate somebody
7831000	7838000	if something that they don't seem to realize might be inherently misogynistic or inherently, you know.
7838000	7843000	But it's not something that you just call them out on in a public forum and rake them over the coals for it.
7843000	7844000	You pull them aside.
7844000	7846000	So stop assuming the worst in people.
7846000	7853000	Exactly. I myself post a lot of social justice stuff on Tumblr.
7853000	7855000	Of course, I also go to protests.
7855000	7857000	And you vote.
7857000	7862000	And I vote and I volunteer my design time for charities that I believe in.
7862000	7866000	So I'm not just sitting on my ass going, oh, post, post, post.
7866000	7873000	But the thing is that I think that when you get into reacting instead of acting,
7873000	7878000	that that's why we have these MRAs now in response to the rise of feminism,
7878000	7883000	because we have now the radfems that are assuming the worst about every man in the world.
7883000	7892000	And I know that the not all men thing was really detracting from the whole issue that was going on.
7892000	7899000	But at the same time, we need to understand that not everybody wears the face of what we see in the news.
7899000	7900000	Right.
7900000	7901000	Sorry to get serious again.
7901000	7908000	No, it's some of this actually kind of scary relates to gaming and things that are going on right now.
7908000	7913000	So, you know, it's it's a good conversation to have.
7913000	7914000	Well, look at this.
7914000	7917000	OK. And I've made no secret of this on the show.
7917000	7924000	I am a Jewish convert and I was getting crap for the stuff going on in Gaza.
7924000	7928000	And I've never been to Israel and I wasn't born Jewish.
7928000	7931000	But it's you've seen what's going on in France.
7931000	7935000	You've seen what's been going on with people blaming an entire group for the actions of one place.
7935000	7939000	And that's, you know, again, we're seeing that across the board.
7939000	7950000	You know, that's why I think that Anita, what's her name, gets so much crap is because she's made herself a voice to bring different,
7950000	7957000	I would say, ongoing misogynistic views going on in the gaming industry to light.
7957000	7963000	And then she becomes a target because no one wants to admit that maybe she might be right.
7963000	7969000	So I'm trying to get a few more comments here in our chat room over at live dot network dot com because it's lighting up here.
7969000	7971000	So I want to make sure we get some more voices.
7971000	7980000	Marissa Congusto says, I have no problem with a comedian saying something offensive, but calling a friend jerk if they do the same context matters.
7980000	7984000	Hitstun says feminists and men's right activists are both poorly named.
7984000	7986000	Just don't be a dick to any gender.
7986000	7990000	And then Fifth Dream follows that up with dick is sexist.
7990000	7994000	But I think I still get Hitstun's point.
7994000	7997000	Don't be don't be a jerk. Period.
7997000	7998000	All right.
7999000	8001000	You know, I.
8001000	8011000	If everyone just tries to give another person the benefit of a doubt, it tries to engage somebody in conversation instead of finger pointing.
8011000	8014000	And I mean, intelligent discourse.
8014000	8017000	I think we'd see things a lot better in the world.
8017000	8023000	Captain Spike in chat says, I think it's interesting to think on the intersection of art and games as it relates to this discussion.
8023000	8029000	And Mega Man X 400, our buddy from video game realness, says, how about them video games?
8029000	8034000	Hey, look, you know, there's a lot of crazy shit going on in gaming.
8034000	8039000	And I like to be able to not just report on all the negativity, but kind of try to dig a little deeper than that.
8039000	8043000	So, you know, we've been looking at the same thing over the course of history.
8043000	8047000	I'm going to bring up one big event in history quickly.
8047000	8050000	We really need to move on. Are you familiar with the Bonfire of the Vanities?
8050000	8051000	Yes.
8051000	8052000	Not the movie.
8052000	8053000	Yes.
8053000	8058000	It was in during the age of the Renaissance, during when the Medicis were in power.
8058000	8066000	There was a big issue going on in Italy where they were burning works of art because they were considered to be a disease of the rich.
8066000	8070000	We learned about this in world history because it related to another big event.
8070000	8082000	But we get some of the same things, too, where video games are being pointed at as being the cause for violence or for being a cause for promoting misogynistic views.
8082000	8086000	When in reality, it's the people who are behind it looking for a scapegoat.
8086000	8092000	And people just need to realize we humans can be pretty shitty.
8092000	8095000	We've all got a bit of crap in us.
8095000	8097000	I mean, what's the word I'm thinking of?
8097000	8101000	I think everyone has a bit of evil intent.
8101000	8105000	You know, sometimes you get spiteful. Sometimes you get angry at somebody.
8105000	8112000	But it's when you let that reaction guide your judgment that you don't listen to the positive voice that's in your head, too.
8112000	8114000	All right. Let's go to the next email.
8114000	8116000	All right. This is from Robert M.
8116000	8126000	I may have asked whether you guys collect game-related merchandise, but do Jamie and Dan have any interest in the Japanese sentinel slash Takara original PlayStation Optimus and Mega?
8126000	8132000	Yes, I do. The PlayStation Optimus Prime and Mega Drive Megatron.
8132000	8136000	Yes, yes. Totally have interest in it, but they seemed a little bit outside of our budget.
8136000	8142000	And then, PS, I had the original clickable iPod version of Bejeweled. Interesting, but not friendly to control.
8142000	8144000	Thank goodness for touch screens.
8144000	8146000	This is how we talked about Bejeweled before.
8146000	8150000	But oh, my God, I really want the Mega Drive Megatron.
8150000	8153000	I think that would be so awesome to have.
8153000	8163000	But it's been outside the budget, especially since we are looking to purchase a house, so.
8163000	8169000	And. So, yeah.
8169000	8172000	All right. We've got more email.
8172000	8175000	I know there's lots of email that I'm sorry we're not getting too in depth with some of these, but.
8175000	8180000	Hey, Orange Lounge, it was cool to finally talk to you guys last week. Hope the weekend treated you well.
8180000	8184000	What are your favorite Easter eggs? Don't say the ones you paint and hide in April.
8184000	8190000	A friend and I recently replayed some old school Call of Duty zombies and we went through one of the maps Easter eggs.
8190000	8196000	I remembered how cool it was for the developers to throw a random hidden story into their multiplayer wave based game mode.
8196000	8201000	So from any game, what were your favorite secrets that weren't completely meant for everyone to find?
8201000	8205000	Keep gaming. Much love. EA skeezy.
8206000	8209000	God, there's a bunch.
8209000	8213000	I like I like I like doing Siri Easter eggs, to be honest.
8213000	8220000	Asking Siri random things until I get a funny response. But there was.
8220000	8225000	Actually, there was.
8225000	8232000	Great. Now I can't remember his name, but did Dragon Ball Z, Akira.
8232000	8239000	Toriyama. Thank you, Brian. Having the little appearance amongst all the developers ending basically for Chrono Trigger.
8239000	8246000	I consider that a huge Easter egg. I would go back to the original, which was one of the first Easter eggs ever,
8246000	8250000	which, funny enough, was a game I already talked about earlier in the show, Adventure on the Atari 2600,
8250000	8256000	where there was a secret room you could get to that has the programmers initials in it, because it's more about what that stood for.
8256000	8262000	Because remember, back in the day of the development of those early 2600 games, the programmers, of which it was oftentimes one person,
8262000	8268000	sometimes two people was like one person that made the majority of the game at the time, didn't get credit for it.
8268000	8272000	And, you know, people, the programmers used to get really miffed at this.
8272000	8281000	And this is how a lot of the third party things started. And, you know, Activision made a really big deal about crediting some of their designers that made the games.
8281000	8291000	But I like the Easter egg as kind of like an act of defiance, in a way, as getting the person who made the game credit in the game anyway.
8291000	8295000	So, I guess that would be my classic. Otherwise, my other standby answer would probably be another classic, which would be,
8295000	8300000	I always thought the minus world in Super Mario Brothers, the original, was a really cool thing.
8300000	8305000	But that's probably more of a bug than an Easter egg at the end of the day. I really think that's more of a bug than an Easter egg.
8305000	8315000	But I think that's just really cool to find these things, these whole levels, that were unintended, that probably end up the result of some algorithm gone wrong in the game.
8315000	8317000	I remember catching one in Final Fantasy VII.
8317000	8318000	Oh yeah?
8318000	8326000	When Cloud was kind of crazy. And he would go, Zen-no-ge-as, before Xenogears were out.
8327000	8336000	That one was a big one for me. There were, you know, I had actually, a couple of my friends did the localization for rival schools.
8336000	8337000	Oh cool.
8337000	8348000	And so, there would be, but they also did some of the localization for, crap what was it, for Puzzle Fighter.
8348000	8356000	And so, they'd throw in jokes that I knew were jokes to them. But then there were like, say that you had Devilot, for example.
8356000	8360000	Don't you know CyberBots is Capcom's number one game? That's, you know, reference to CyberBots.
8360000	8366000	You'd have characters from other Capcom games in the background in some of the levels, you know, different things like that.
8366000	8370000	SSG 100 Matt has a great one. The dog ending in Silent Hill 2. How could you forget that?
8370000	8371000	Bark, bark, bark.
8373000	8374000	Alright.
8376000	8379000	That is a classic. That's a classic. Good memory, SJ100.
8379000	8382000	You like Castlevania, don't you?
8382000	8384000	Alright, more emails?
8385000	8390000	Yeah. Hold on, let me get back to them because I can't find where I put it.
8392000	8394000	So, there's two left.
8395000	8398000	Oh yeah, nevermind. I already read that one.
8398000	8400000	Because I want the Megadrive Megatron.
8400000	8404000	Hey guys! Just writing in to say I'm very frustrated about this hacker group
8404000	8407000	whose name I don't even want to say as they seem to be enjoying getting publicity,
8407000	8409000	taking away my online gaming for the night.
8409000	8416000	I've recently been feeling really attached to people in the end of Line Free Company and Final Fantasy XIV
8416000	8423000	as everyone has been so kind in helping me to progress in all the past level 50 areas.
8423000	8424000	Post level 50 areas.
8424000	8425000	Hearts.
8425000	8429000	Now it's night because of this asshole extremist group. I can't hang out with any of them.
8429000	8433000	PSN is down, Battle.net is down, League of Legends servers are down, and now reports are coming in,
8433000	8436000	the Xbox Live has been taken down as well.
8436000	8439000	My question is, what the hell drives people to do this?
8439000	8442000	Why take away entertainment from people looking to find an escape? Frown.
8443000	8448000	Now switching gears a bit here, I remember Rob and Jamie were both a GamerX too.
8448000	8455000	I do know there have been talks about changing the name of this con to represent something more all-inclusive
8455000	8460000	as GamerX has never been about singing out just gay gamers excluding other groups.
8460000	8465000	There's something that has been on my mind as I am both a gay gamer and a person in another group
8465000	8468000	that's often looked at as being weird. Furries.
8469000	8475000	Personally, I take pride in being one and have made so many friends, have been given so much love and support,
8475000	8479000	and I've found someone that I care for on a deeper level in this furry fandom.
8479000	8484000	To put it simply, was there any representation of furries that you guys saw at GamerX too?
8484000	8485000	Yes, there were.
8485000	8490000	Oh yeah, because they were there promoting FurCon or the other big event.
8490000	8491000	So yeah, oh yeah.
8491000	8497000	And we actually had a discussion about actually making the fursuits.
8498000	8505000	And some of the stereotypes, I forgot the guy's name unfortunately, but we were just talking about what goes into making the fursuits
8505000	8511000	and you know, about how yes, there are people who are fetishists, but every group has its fetishist.
8511000	8512000	Right.
8512000	8513000	You know.
8513000	8516000	You're not hurting anybody. It's all consensual. Have fun.
8516000	8523000	Thanks so much for reading this and for keeping my night occupied in a time where other groups of people want to take the fun and entertainment out of our lives.
8523000	8526000	Sincerely, Ospher, aka Syria Knoxfall.
8526000	8532000	Well, I'm glad we could help. I want to go back to the first half of the email though, because we never, like what motivates people to do this.
8532000	8534000	It's the power.
8534000	8535000	Power.
8535000	8539000	Power trip. The fact that they have power over other people. But here's the thing.
8539000	8545000	People like this, it only takes one fuckup to bring the whole thing down.
8545000	8550000	And this really reminds me of what was that a few years ago, that whole LulzSec did a whole bunch of stuff, right?
8550000	8554000	That was the name of the group. LulzSec did a whole bunch of stuff. And what happened?
8554000	8561000	One of the guys got caught early on into it, but got flipped around to be a mole and brought the whole damn thing down from the inside.
8561000	8569000	And it only takes one. And a lot of times this thing ends up with infighting or any of this stuff, you know, and it's not going to end well.
8569000	8579000	Because these guys today, not only have they been posting pictures of like ISIS and all this stuff and glorifying that, which is a terrorist organization.
8579000	8586000	Then they called in this fake bomb threat to try and ruin the day of some mucky muck high up at Sony Online Entertainment.
8586000	8594000	You know, that is going to be some serious shit that no amount of crying and I didn't know what I was doing is going to get a person out of.
8594000	8602000	I mean, that was like, essentially it was a terrorist act, what that person did. You might think I'm being dramatic, but I mean, that was what it was.
8602000	8613000	So, when these guys get caught, and they will get caught, because they're going to fuck up. If they keep going on their power trip, they're going to make a fuck up.
8613000	8616000	And they're going to get caught. And it's going to be serious.
8616000	8625000	This is a sad thing, though, about how things work in this country. They are going to get on the bad side of a large corporation with lots of money and government influence.
8625000	8631000	Because the government does not like when the people who pay them are in trouble. End of story.
8632000	8634000	That's when they're going to fuck up.
8635000	8644000	Well, they've already pissed off, let's see, Sony, Microsoft, American Airlines, Activision. The list is growing pretty rapidly.
8644000	8654000	And we know that, you know, especially given that they're doing DDoS attacks, too, then that's going to go back to the ISPs, who, as we know, bankroll quite a bit for the government.
8654000	8659000	Anyway, I didn't want to focus on this negativity too much, but there's the answer to your question.
8659000	8660000	Alright.
8660000	8666000	I've been a lot in being fed up with a lot of stuff lately, so I'm sorry if that's come through.
8667000	8669000	Alright. That's it for the mailbag, right?
8669000	8672000	That's it. At least that's all I'm going to read.
8672000	8678000	Good job tonight, guys. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Make Jamie work.
8678000	8682000	You've got two weeks to fill it up, because, again, we won't be here next week.
8682000	8684000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
8690000	8698000	All this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...
8698000	8700000	This is fucked up.
8700000	8703000	Uh, Shane, I haven't heard from you. I'll let you start tonight.
8703000	8709000	Uh, an FU to Bandai for possibly thinking about skipping Tokuja in America.
8709000	8710000	What?
8710000	8717000	Yep, apparently they don't think that the suits look good, they don't think that the swords look good, so they're thinking about skipping it.
8717000	8719000	Which makes me upset.
8719000	8726000	Um, that's really it. FU to being really tired. Really tired.
8727000	8728000	Uh, Dark Sakura.
8730000	8735000	FU to the dumb shits who pulled out me in front of me while I was driving here.
8735000	8738000	Just some dumb kid who can't drive.
8739000	8742000	And, uh, FU to...
8744000	8749000	Nah, not really any FUs. I'm kind of done with that right now. I'm just sort of done.
8750000	8752000	D, U, and done.
8753000	8763000	Um, let's see, my FU of the week goes to, um, oh my god, last minute planning and procrastination, because I'm really, really bad at both those things.
8763000	8766000	And I'm getting on a plane Wednesday, and I'm so not ready for it. Woohoo!
8767000	8769000	There you go, there's the FUs of the week.
8770000	8772000	Uh, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then your phone calls.
8772000	8775000	1-877-GAMELR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8775000	8776000	Uh, Loki!
8776000	8777000	He's not here.
8777000	8778000	He's not here.
8779000	8781000	How about Shane instead? Sorry.
8781000	8783000	No, we'll wait for him to do his story.
8783000	8791000	I was too lazy, and my show role tonight still says Loki on it, and not Shane, so I'm just out of habits at Loki.
8791000	8795000	I'm sorry, Shane, who is filling in for Loki tonight. What do you have? Come on, Shane!
8795000	8796000	We can call him Shanky.
8797000	8800000	Shane, it's an excuse to talk about P.T. You're not going to give that up.
8800000	8801000	Do it!
8801000	8802000	No, I'm not going to.
8802000	8803000	P.T.
8803000	8812000	Um, so somebody put a mashup of the narration from, uh, Stanley Parable, and, uh, some gameplay footage of P.T., and it's decent.
8812000	8820000	I, as a huge fan of both the P.T. demo game thing and Stanley Parable, I was hoping for a lot more from it.
8820000	8823000	It's only, like, a minute or two long.
8823000	8826000	Um, so it's good for what it tries to do.
8826000	8833000	I wish it would have incorporated more scary stuff from the P.T., uh, demo, but whatever.
8833000	8835000	It's still worth watching once. Only once.
8836000	8840000	I had a really good time watching the, uh, kids from Koopa Club playing, uh, P.T. yesterday.
8840000	8843000	You saw that, too, right? The whole feed of them playing?
8843000	8846000	Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They were, uh, Jeremy was hilarious.
8846000	8849000	Yeah, I love watching people play through that for the first time. It was a lot of fun.
8849000	8857000	I, uh, I was playing with my friend today from Kansas, and when he got killed by the ghost, he screamed and threw his arms up in the air.
8857000	8858000	It was awesome.
8860000	8868000	I saw the funniest video of someone who was fine with all the ghost appearances until she appeared in the balcony.
8868000	8870000	Oh, that's a creepy scene.
8870000	8872000	I was like, oh my god, she's grinning at me!
8872000	8874000	Yeah, because she's smiling. That makes it so much worse.
8874000	8877000	And, uh, to answer Rama's question real quick, I said there's-
8877000	8878000	What did Rama ask?
8878000	8882000	Uh, they're thinking about skipping Tokujo. They already are skipping GoBusters.
8882000	8892000	Oh, wow. Um, the thing is, though, this, this silly little trailer thing has set the bar so high for the Silent Hill game.
8892000	8894000	Yeah, it has.
8894000	8900000	That's the problem, is that heaven help that game if people look at it and go, ah, that PT was better.
8900000	8903000	Yeah, and there will be people that'll say that regardless.
8903000	8904000	Of course, of course.
8904000	8913000	There was one thing, though, that put itself, uh, that I realized, like, after playing the PT, is that you remember where it says hello by the phone?
8913000	8914000	Mm-hmm.
8914000	8916000	And then the letters start disappearing?
8916000	8917000	Yeah.
8917000	8919000	The same letters appear over where it says in hell?
8919000	8923000	Yeah, yeah, that's what it's supposed to be. So each letter, if you walk all the way over there-
8923000	8924000	Yeah.
8924000	8925000	When it disappears, that letter will appear.
8925000	8926000	Yeah, that's the puzzle.
8926000	8927000	Yeah.
8927000	8928000	Yeah.
8928000	8932000	We didn't know at first that you could just turn your camera to make those letters go away. We thought you had to look at the letter, walk over there.
8932000	8936000	But from what I understand, that's part of the- one of the puzzles that has to be solved before you can do the baby stuff.
8936000	8937000	Right.
8937000	8938000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8938000	8939000	Yeah, it does.
8939000	8949000	All right, and last night, before we get to our Skypline, um, you know, this is, this is going around everywhere on social media, and that is the, um, Ice Bucket Challenge for, um, ALS.
8949000	8957000	And look, I don't want to get into the whole debate over is this a good thing or not. At the end of the day, I think charity in general is a great thing.
8957000	8965000	And if you are looking to do great things for charity, I think one great thing you can do is donate, uh, as in money, or you can even donate time.
8965000	8972000	Uh, you know, that could be for maybe even like a political cause you, uh, believe in as well, or what have you.
8972000	8979000	But regardless, this, um, Ice Bucket thing has been going around like crazy, uh, getting people more aware of ALS.
8979000	8983000	And this does include industry people as well, which is why I'm reporting on it.
8983000	8987000	Uh, there's a lot of people in the industry that have done the, um, Ice Bucket Challenge.
8987000	8992000	Uh, there's a little list here of some people, uh, including Notch, the creator of Minecraft.
8992000	8994000	Cliffy B, who's creator of Gears of War.
8994000	8996000	Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox.
8996000	9001000	Uh, Shawn Layden, who's the, uh, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment in America.
9001000	9008000	Some other people have been called out, such as Reggie Fils-Aime, who promises to one-up Phil Spencer's video, so that should be interesting.
9008000	9017000	So, um, you know, again, uh, as long as this, uh, organization is raising tons and tons of money, which I hear they are, uh, I think that is a good thing.
9017000	9026000	But don't forget about other charities too, because I know there's some causes. I know me personally, uh, tried to do stuff for the multiple sclerosis, uh, organizations.
9026000	9032000	Just don't give the Komen Foundation any of your money, because they will waste it and, uh, hate other people.
9032000	9038000	By, by the way, by the way, did you, I liked the one, there's two of those that I have, actually three that I have been really impressed by.
9038000	9045000	One of them is Ayumi Kawasaki, squealing like crazy, and then calling out Yu Darvish, who is actually super hot.
9045000	9053000	Um, seriously, Iranian Japanese. Hot. Anyway, um, then, um, he's a baseball player.
9053000	9060000	Um, anyway, then there was, uh, I watched, uh, what was the other one that I thought was really great?
9060000	9066000	Oh yeah, Vin Diesel, who's challenged people, instead of doing the bucket challenge, to plant a tree.
9066000	9069000	That was really cool, because he was Groot.
9069000	9074000	And then, um, I'm actually growing a Eucalyptus tree, by the way.
9074000	9075000	Nice.
9075000	9078000	So, and then my other one that I liked was the Old Spice guy.
9078000	9081000	Oh yeah, from the commercials? I haven't seen that one.
9081000	9087000	He challenged Bruce Campbell, everyone named John Johnson, and Fabio.
9087000	9092000	I was like, that one was, I posted it on my Facebook, it was pretty fun, pretty funny.
9092000	9094000	And yes, Akira Yamaka did it as well.
9094000	9096000	Well, I'm sorry.
9096000	9097000	And Mark Mir.
9097000	9098000	Yes.
9098000	9099000	Oh really?
9099000	9100000	And Jennifer Hale did.
9100000	9103000	Oh, and the Luciano, the guy who did it too.
9103000	9104000	Oh, he did too?
9104000	9105000	Yeah.
9105000	9106000	I didn't see that one.
9106000	9107000	I'm surprised you haven't looked that up yet.
9107000	9108000	I saw Justin Theroux, that was a nice video.
9108000	9110000	Well, the Benedict Cumberbatch one was hilarious.
9110000	9111000	That was funny.
9111000	9117000	Anyway, anyway, also of note with this whole thing, which is, you know, becoming quite
9117000	9122000	the little pop culture thing that I'm sure they'll look back on, remember 2014?
9122000	9124000	This was one of those fads people did.
9124000	9127000	This is something that's actually coming to video games.
9127000	9131000	And Destiny is actually getting in on this as well.
9132000	9141000	They actually put out a little YouTube where they did the little ghost guy as a participant
9141000	9142000	in the ice bucket challenge.
9142000	9144000	I thought that was kind of neat that they kind of rendered that.
9144000	9146000	So, pretty cool.
9146000	9147000	Win-win around for charity.
9147000	9149000	And, you know.
9149000	9155000	I just would wish that people would do this on my lawn because my lawn is a wasteland
9155000	9157000	of dead grass and weeds thanks to the drought.
9157000	9162000	Yeah, I'm a little bit like, I'm kind of like, you guys, there's a drought going on
9162000	9166000	and there's people, but I understand too, it's charity, it's awareness, whatever.
9166000	9170000	There are people in other countries who don't have safe drinking water and we're wasting
9170000	9171000	it dumping on our heads.
9171000	9172000	We could just give the money.
9172000	9177000	I asked my friend when we're going to have the immolation challenge because then people
9177000	9179000	would really be willing to give some money.
9179000	9182000	But regardless, it's awareness, so cool.
9182000	9187000	I think they've definitely succeeded where a lot of charities would give a lot to get
9187000	9189000	that same type of awareness.
9189000	9191000	But anyway, let's move on.
9191000	9192000	Let's go to the phones.
9192000	9194000	It's time to have you guys call in.
9194000	9198000	1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9198000	9200000	All one word.
9200000	9203000	If you'd like to call the show, now's a fantastic time to do so.
9205000	9209000	Meanwhile, this is where I usually open it up for last minute stories.
9209000	9212000	But since Loki's not here, I know Shane's not going to have anything.
9212000	9213000	Or am I wrong?
9213000	9215000	I could just talk about Power Rangers.
9215000	9217000	We could or how cuter new Pokemans are.
9217000	9219000	What was that Evangelion one you gave me?
9219000	9221000	What did I give you?
9221000	9222000	It was big and purple.
9222000	9223000	Palkia.
9223000	9225000	Yeah, he looks like an Eva.
9225000	9227000	He's from Diamond and Pearl.
9227000	9229000	So he's pretty old.
9229000	9232000	You're not going to be able to use him right away though because he's level 100, so he
9232000	9233000	won't obey you.
9233000	9236000	But sometimes he will, but he won't all the time.
9236000	9238000	I will make him obey me with cookies.
9239000	9242000	I have some tweets I want to make sure I get to as well.
9242000	9245000	There's a lot of people tweeting about the show, so I really appreciate that.
9245000	9247000	Thank you guys for the support there.
9247000	9249000	But then we have SSG100Matt saying,
9249000	9252000	After a month of brewing, my home brew beer is done.
9252000	9255000	It's a chocolate maple porter, but it needs a name.
9255000	9256000	Ideas?
9257000	9259000	What would you call a chocolate maple porter?
9259000	9260000	Dark Sakura?
9260000	9262000	Sticky pole.
9264000	9265000	Sticky pole.
9265000	9266000	There you go.
9266000	9267000	Sticky pole.
9267000	9268000	Sticky pole.
9269000	9270000	Let's see.
9270000	9272000	Dark Tetsuya tweets us saying,
9272000	9278000	On fish playing Street Fighter, apparently Aquarius got signed on with MLG group Always Godlike.
9278000	9281000	His avatar features a little headset now.
9281000	9283000	That's adorable.
9283000	9285000	Alright, the phone is ringing off the hook.
9285000	9287000	Let's get to the phones and get some calls.
9287000	9289000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9289000	9291000	Hi, it's DNL.
9291000	9293000	Oh my gosh, DNL, how are you?
9293000	9294000	Yay!
9294000	9296000	I'm so excited to hear from you.
9296000	9297000	Hi guys.
9297000	9300000	You know when my voice goes up an entire octave, I mean it.
9302000	9303000	Parts, parts.
9303000	9305000	Oh my god, I'm so happy to be here.
9305000	9309000	Yeah, so I'm sorry it's been a long time since I last called in,
9309000	9313000	and I know that with you guys, I was actually even a guest once,
9313000	9315000	so many, many, many years ago.
9315000	9319000	But I thought I'd go ahead and call in today because
9319000	9324000	you guys had brought up about Free to Play earlier on the call,
9324000	9327000	or on there, and yeah, I've been in the video game industry
9327000	9330000	for as long as Shane, if you guys can believe it.
9330000	9333000	We started off at Konami like years and years and years ago.
9333000	9335000	Yeah, together pretty much at the same time.
9335000	9337000	Yeah, I know.
9337000	9342000	And yeah, I mean from there I kind of just went and
9342000	9345000	just kept on working in the video game industry all the way to the point
9345000	9349000	where my previous company was Perfect World Entertainment,
9349000	9352000	and some of you may know of them.
9352000	9356000	They are a Chinese MMO development company,
9356000	9359000	and then when they came here to the US,
9359000	9362000	one of the purchases that they made was actually of Cryptic Studios,
9362000	9364000	which makes Neverwinter online.
9364000	9368000	And yeah, so I worked for them for about almost four years,
9368000	9374000	and since then I've kind of gone into mobile Free to Play.
9374000	9377000	So it's kind of really interesting to see the difference between
9377000	9383000	how people perceive Free to Play, which started from South Korean games
9383000	9385000	like Gunbound and so forth,
9385000	9391000	to now the backbone of mobile apps and everything,
9391000	9394000	and that whole ecosystem.
9394000	9397000	But yeah, I guess it was more of a comment.
9397000	9399000	No, no, that's neat.
9399000	9403000	And I like to hear from people in your perspective as well,
9403000	9408000	who kind of are there working with those Free to Play games.
9408000	9413000	What do you think people who are really quick to criticize the Free to Play model,
9413000	9416000	what do you think they might be missing?
9416000	9420000	Well, I mean, of course people are going to really kind of criticize it
9420000	9425000	because from the very beginning a lot of people feel that it's more of a
9425000	9429000	pay to win or pay for power kind of model,
9429000	9431000	and I completely understand where people are coming with that.
9431000	9434000	But I think someone else brought it up earlier in one of their comments,
9434000	9439000	is that when people are really cognizant of making sure that the game is balanced
9439000	9443000	without even the need to purchase anything,
9443000	9446000	that really makes it an immersive experience.
9446000	9449000	And I think that's one of the things that we've been able to kind of see
9449000	9452000	the whole industry kind of catering to.
9452000	9457000	I mean, for example, Star Trek Online used to be a subscription model
9457000	9459000	and now it's a Free to Play model.
9459000	9462000	And the same thing with Star Wars Old Republic,
9462000	9465000	and the whole point is that they needed to build a game
9465000	9468000	that was a full-out fledged game
9468000	9471000	where you can be able to purchase and play with other people
9471000	9476000	and then be able to then turn it into something that as a convenience
9476000	9479000	you can be able to purchase these items just in case,
9479000	9483000	because like you were saying earlier, there's just so much time for anything
9483000	9486000	and really you kind of have to focus on one thing at a time.
9486000	9489000	And if you do come back and play maybe once every 30 days,
9489000	9492000	you don't want to feel like you're lagged behind by everyone.
9492000	9497000	And that's kind of what I'm hoping to continue to cater in this industry
9497000	9501000	is that we want to be able to allow people who don't have enough time to play
9501000	9505000	to be able to still feel like they can by giving them these,
9505000	9508000	we call them convenience items so that they don't have to feel like
9508000	9512000	they're lagging behind all of their friends who can be able to grind 12 hours a day kind of thing.
9512000	9515000	So that's when I feel like it's probably the biggest criticism.
9515000	9522000	And I think in a lot of ways, for me, what really made me enjoy certain free-to-play games more
9522000	9525000	was that games are always better with friends.
9525000	9526000	Absolutely.
9526000	9528000	And I think especially like in MMO, I think I mentioned this earlier in the show,
9528000	9531000	when you mentioned that you'd been involved with Neverwinter.
9531000	9533000	When I first played it, I didn't know anybody else into it.
9533000	9538000	So I was kind of like, I'm alone and this is scary and sparkles, something else, squirrel.
9538000	9543000	But then now that I have friends that play it too, I'm like, oh, hell, this is really good.
9543000	9547000	This is pretty deep for a free-to-play game. There's a lot of stuff you can do in this.
9547000	9549000	Yeah, absolutely.
9549000	9551000	And that's the whole thing, right?
9551000	9555000	It's making sure that you can be able to have a robust experience on top of everything else.
9555000	9560000	And I think that's one of the things that is the turning point of the industry altogether.
9560000	9567000	And so you can really see that come and shine through as starting as much as three years ago, really,
9567000	9572000	is when it really started to submit this is what free-to-play means and this is kind of the future.
9572000	9575000	So you'll see less and less of those premium apps, what they call it.
9575000	9580000	Basically, you have to pay to buy the app before you can even start using it.
9580000	9591000	Those are starting to dissipate more and more as the premium freemium model is actually being more used.
9591000	9594000	But yeah, okay. That's all.
9594000	9596000	But I just wanted to say hi.
9596000	9598000	No, I so appreciate that perspective. That's awesome.
9598000	9601000	Hey, I got one more question for you though before you go because I'd like to ask,
9601000	9607000	especially from callers we don't hear from all the time, DNL, what is a game that you are really into right now,
9607000	9610000	but no fair naming something you've worked on or are working on?
9610000	9616000	Of course, of course. Well, one of the things that I've really been playing over is Last of Us.
9616000	9622000	When they came out with the HD version for PS4, I don't have a PS4, unfortunately.
9622000	9629000	Oh no, what kind of game am I, right? Anyway, but I do have a PS3, so I started playing it again.
9629000	9632000	One who has to save their nickels and dimes like a lot of people.
9634000	9639000	But yeah, we've been playing that. I've just been crying and, you know, crying my eyes out all over again.
9639000	9647000	I really love Naughty Dog's game, Last of Us. And I'm really looking forward to the movie, if it is.
9647000	9654000	And also, if you guys didn't check it out, you guys need to go to YouTube and check out when Naughty Dog did their midnight release.
9655000	9661000	It was phenomenal. They even did the ending that was the musical version.
9661000	9665000	Yes, I did see that. And they did a deleted scene and stuff, too, huh?
9665000	9668000	Yes, oh my god. It was phenomenal and you have to see it.
9668000	9670000	I agree. Awesome.
9670000	9672000	All right, nice talking with you guys.
9672000	9675000	You have a fantastic night. Thanks so much for listening and participating tonight.
9675000	9677000	Not a problem. I'll talk to you guys later.
9677000	9678000	All right, take care.
9678000	9679000	Bye.
9679000	9680000	Bye.
9680000	9681000	Bye.
9681000	9684000	One of my best E3 memories involves DNL.
9684000	9686000	But I'll have to save that for another night.
9686000	9691000	I'll have to save that for another night because our phones are lighting up and I've got to get to some more calls.
9691000	9693000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this?
9693000	9695000	Hey, it's Brad from Pod Culture.
9695000	9698000	Brad from Pod Culture! So happy to hear from you, buddy.
9698000	9703000	I am distraught that you will not be at Dragon Con this year, but I completely understand the reasons behind it.
9703000	9706000	I will just keep my fingers and toes crossed for 2015.
9707000	9712000	Oh, I certainly hope so. It's going to be a rough thing. That's kind of like the Geek Family reunion.
9712000	9717000	It is, it is. Well, a shot of Fireball will be had in your honor, my friend.
9717000	9721000	Well, that's actually part of the reason why I was calling. You look at the avatar on my Skype handle right now.
9721000	9725000	I was noticing you have a little shot of Fireball. What's on your mind, buddy?
9725000	9729000	Well, hey, I can't have a drink with you at Dragon Con, so here you go.
9730000	9738000	I wasn't prepared. I'm holding up my root beer from Jack in the Box. Close enough.
9738000	9741000	But you were talking about free-to-play games earlier.
9741000	9742000	Yeah.
9742000	9749000	And I've talked about this on our show a lot, especially with TARDIS Interruptus, but Doctor Who Legacy.
9749000	9755000	It's actually a lot like that Marvel game you were talking about earlier.
9755000	9761000	But it's a dual match-three kind of thing. And they're always cranking out content.
9761000	9764000	And you do not have to spend a cent to play it.
9764000	9768000	That's awesome. That's so awesome. And, you know, it's not that I...
9768000	9774000	I like to give to games, you know, when, especially if I've dropped a lot of time in them, like Path of Exile.
9774000	9778000	But I also realize that, you know, there's other ways that the companies can make money, too.
9778000	9783000	Like, be it maybe through ads in the game. Like, Flappy Bird was a free game, wasn't it?
9783000	9785000	And that guy's made a killing off of the ads alone, you know?
9785000	9787000	That's one way to kind of make the money and so forth.
9787000	9791000	So I think it's really cool when you find just that right magic where it's like,
9791000	9796000	I can pay my people that are developing the game and make that tiny little bit of profit,
9796000	9801000	and yet still create a rich experience that rewards the people who put the time into it.
9801000	9804000	It's a tricky balance, but that's so awesome when people can find it.
9804000	9810000	Yeah. I mean, they do. And, of course, there's time crystals and stuff that you can buy in the store, too.
9810000	9817000	They have what they call a fan area. And if you make a purchase, that unlocks the fan area.
9817000	9823000	And it's just some extra levels and different outfits for characters and things like that.
9823000	9827000	So it's nothing important to the game, really, at all.
9827000	9835000	But the neat thing is the developers and people that are working on this game are super fast at communicating back
9835000	9837000	if you get a hold of them about something.
9837000	9838000	Yeah.
9839000	9843000	Because they'll do unlock codes with various groups.
9843000	9850000	And I think there was a comic shop over in the UK that had a special code to unlock the TARDIS as a playable character.
9850000	9854000	And I just sent them an email or a tweet or something about,
9854000	9858000	you know, what about those of us that aren't in the UK able to go over and get this?
9858000	9860000	They're like, don't worry, it's going to drop.
9861000	9869000	But the really neat thing is, you know, the season eight of Doctor Who premiered this weekend.
9869000	9876000	And all season, they're going to be introducing new content each week, like levels that are themed on that episode.
9876000	9878000	Oh, that's pretty cool.
9878000	9883000	Yeah, it's kind of neat. And three different skill levels.
9883000	9888000	I mean, they're small, but it's just small stuff that they're releasing and it's a free game.
9888000	9893000	Well, and we were even talking about that a little bit earlier with the premium games where Shane was talking about Final Fantasy 11.
9893000	9898000	You know, they do these very small patches, but it's enough to keep it going for another month until the next patch.
9898000	9902000	Not everything has to be a major ordeal. I mean, those are nice to have, too.
9902000	9907000	But, you know, when you have the really small little things that give you a little extra content,
9907000	9911000	a little perk for your $12.95 or whatever you paid that month for a subscription model game,
9911000	9913000	it makes it so much more worth it.
9913000	9925000	Yeah, and they do a live stream Oedipo's TV about every week, and there's usually some giveaway codes there, too, to unlock stuff.
9925000	9933000	But, yeah, I've spent more than a few bucks on it, but it's just because I've spent so much time with this game and I enjoy it.
9933000	9937000	And, of course, it doesn't hurt that it's Doctor Who, either.
9938000	9946000	Well, Brad, I'll be looking forward to hearing more on the new Doctor Who on Pod Culture, possibly TARDIS Interruptus, on a future week.
9946000	9949000	Brad, you will be missed at Dragon Con very much.
9949000	9954000	As apparently the whole crew, I didn't realize none of you guys were going this year. That's unfortunate.
9954000	9961000	Best of luck with the par six, but even if you don't win, you guys are still all winners, and we love having you guys here at the network.
9962000	9968000	Well, on the off chance that we do win, I hope that you would be kind enough to go up for us.
9968000	9972000	I absolutely will, and I will have the fireball ready to go.
9972000	9975000	There you go. All right, guys, talk to you later.
9975000	9976000	All right, bye, Brad.
9976000	9977000	Bye.
9977000	9984000	Always good to hear from our buddy Brad there from Pod Culture, Monday nights here at the Voice of the Geek's network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
9984000	9988000	I can probably squeeze in one other call, but I think, am I saying goodbye to Jamie is leaving?
9988000	9994000	Yeah, got ahead. I have to get up early tomorrow because of good things.
9994000	9999000	All right, well, good. DarkSakura, I'm glad to hear good things, even if it does mean getting up early.
9999000	10002000	Quickly, though, final thought for listeners tonight before I take another call here.
10002000	10005000	Form your own opinion.
10005000	10008000	All right. Don't be a follower, right?
10008000	10009000	Don't be a follower.
10009000	10010000	All right.
10010000	10011000	Reject false icons.
10011000	10016000	Fair enough. All right, let's see if I can squeeze in at least one more call here before we wrap up for tonight.
10016000	10017000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10017000	10022000	Howdy. My name is Ben. I do a little web series called Port Center, which you've probably never heard of.
10022000	10025000	I have not, but I saw your name in chat earlier.
10025000	10029000	Yeah, actually, this is the first time I've listened to your show at all.
10029000	10033000	A friend of mine recommended that I tune in and catch you guys live, so I thought, yeah, why not?
10033000	10034000	You guys are a hoot.
10034000	10035000	Thank you.
10035000	10036000	Thank you.
10036000	10037000	Thank you.
10037000	10038000	You're very welcome.
10038000	10040000	We're usually a lot funnier when Shane's not here.
10040000	10042000	Burn.
10042000	10045000	Shane sounds suspiciously like a friend of mine called Jeff.
10045000	10047000	I live in Los Angeles. I don't know the accent for you.
10047000	10053000	And he sounds almost identical to the point that whenever I hear him, I think, what is Jeff doing on this show?
10053000	10054000	That's weird.
10054000	10058000	I have my own plane, so I fly back and forth.
10058000	10060000	It's like Scooby Doo.
10060000	10061000	He teleports.
10061000	10064000	He's going to pull off his mask, and it was Jeff the whole time.
10064000	10068000	Well, who's your friend that told you to listen? Because I want to give them an OLR Gold Star.
10068000	10071000	There's my friend Marissa. I don't know if she's in the chat right now.
10071000	10072000	Marissa!
10072000	10076000	Oh, shit. Marissa's got an entire collection of Gold Stars. She's got a bucket.
10076000	10078000	She's got too many. Too many, I think.
10078000	10080000	She can take the Gold Star challenge and dump it.
10080000	10083000	Marissa's ample bosoms are covered in Gold Stars.
10083000	10088000	Marissa's the best ever. She already knew that. There's literally nothing else I can give her.
10088000	10089000	Well, thanks, Marissa.
10089000	10093000	But thank you for listening and tuning in. How can we help you tonight? What do you want to talk about?
10093000	10098000	Well, actually, I recently did an episode of my show. I'm not going to plug my thing. That's crass.
10098000	10104000	But I did an episode about the Addams Family video game that was based on the movie that came out in 1991.
10104000	10108000	There was a game for the Sega Genesis and the Amiga and the Super Nintendo.
10108000	10112000	It was a really solid kind of Mario-style platform game.
10112000	10119000	And I've been thinking over the last couple of days about how there's this idea that a lot of people who play games have
10119000	10122000	where if it's a licensed game, it's going to be terrible.
10123000	10129000	And I think that's not really... I don't think that's a fair kind of generalization to make about what is...
10129000	10132000	It's not really a subgenre, but it's a kind of a category of game is the licensed game.
10132000	10134000	There's a lot of really solid stuff out there.
10134000	10141000	So I thought maybe I'd ask you guys if you guys had any recommendations for licensed games or any games that were
10141000	10146000	licensed that you were expecting to basically be terrible. But it turns out, actually, they're not bad.
10146000	10149000	Well, since you brought up the Addams Family, I can't help but go here.
10149000	10156000	If you're a fan of the Addams Family, I will say it produced easily one of the top three pinball tables of all time.
10156000	10159000	I love the Addams Family pinball machine. Spectacular.
10159000	10162000	The existence of the Addams Family pinball led to Twilight Zone. Directly led to Twilight Zone.
10162000	10167000	It was Lawler did it.
10167000	10171000	And in naming off the various ports of the Addams Family game,
10171000	10175000	regretfully, you missed the one on the NES that I enjoyed, which was Fester's Quest.
10175000	10182000	Now, a lot of people really kind of hammed on that game because it was basically Blaster Master, but without the 2D stuff.
10182000	10186000	It was only kind of the overhead stuff, but they did it. They made like a Fester game out of it.
10186000	10191000	So it really wasn't bad, especially now that it's so easy to go back and revisit some of those NES classics.
10191000	10196000	But getting away from the Addams Family a little bit, as much as I freaking love those movies, by the way,
10196000	10198000	those are like the best movies. Some of the best movies came out of the 90s.
10199000	10206000	I would say I think some of the all-time classics that are based on license have to do with Star Wars.
10206000	10211000	I think just last night, I was talking to a friend about the vector-based Star Wars game.
10211000	10215000	That was the Atari. That game was incredible.
10215000	10221000	I know I've brought this up before on the show, and some people kind of controversially, Super Star Wars.
10221000	10224000	Some people don't agree with me. I think it was Jason, wasn't it? Was not a fan of it.
10224000	10228000	But we kind of reached an understanding there. Are you thinking of something, Shane?
10228000	10230000	Jeff has a suggestion here.
10230000	10232000	Yes, Jeff. What's your suggestion?
10232000	10236000	So, Gremlins 2 on regular Nintendo. So good.
10236000	10238000	I remember that.
10238000	10243000	That was a genuine, just a wonderful little top-down adventure game.
10243000	10245000	Yeah, and you threw tomatoes.
10245000	10247000	And it had the lady gremlin in it.
10248000	10254000	I'd actually say just things based off of anime series, because I was a big importer,
10254000	10259000	is I actually super liked the Rurouni Kenshin RPG that came out.
10259000	10263000	I have the Blue Seed RPG, which is also really good.
10263000	10270000	And the Macross Do You Remember Love? and VFX2 was really good.
10270000	10272000	So the Macross games were really good.
10272000	10277000	I do want to say, though, I think the reason why a lot of licensed games get a lot of crap
10277000	10283000	is because they're trying to get out in time for the release of said movie or said TV show or what have you,
10283000	10290000	they're rushed. And if it's not able to sit in the oven long enough to cook properly, it's going to come out a little raw.
10290000	10294000	It's just like that story we had earlier about the Super Smash Brothers,
10294000	10297000	where they're talking about the bugs and having to test every single possible combination.
10297000	10301000	When you rush something, it's going to not have that quality process.
10301000	10307000	The most classic example of all time is the E.T. game on the Atari 2600.
10307000	10312000	Howard Scott Warshaw, who was a magnificent programmer for Atari 2600,
10312000	10316000	created one of the best experiences on the console, the Yars Revenge.
10316000	10319000	He had to turn that shit out in six weeks, and that's what you got. Shit.
10319000	10322000	Because if somebody had bug processed that game and said,
10322000	10326000	you know, you really do fall down these holes one too many times,
10326000	10330000	you know, it could have been fixed, but it couldn't because of the aggressive schedule.
10330000	10332000	I have another one. Jeff, do you have another one?
10332000	10333000	I have like a hundred actually.
10333000	10336000	Okay, yeah, I have a few more too. Go ahead.
10336000	10338000	Power Rangers the movie on Super Nintendo.
10338000	10339000	Of course.
10339000	10343000	Great. Any Capcom Disney game on the NES for the most part?
10343000	10344000	Oh, absolutely.
10344000	10346000	All those were great.
10346000	10351000	The X-Men game on Genesis, I don't remember what it was called, but it was really good.
10351000	10355000	So just, I don't know, I can't actually help with that one.
10355000	10359000	I would say Jurassic Park on both the Super Nintendo and the Genesis,
10359000	10362000	even though they were very different games, were both really not bad.
10362000	10367000	Indiana Jones had an amazing arcade game that was so good.
10367000	10368000	It was on the same engine.
10368000	10369000	Simpsons arcade game?
10369000	10370000	Oh, yeah.
10370000	10372000	Oh, Simpsons arcade game. Spectacular.
10372000	10373000	Ninja Turtles beat up.
10373000	10375000	That's a classic.
10375000	10377000	So, Ben, I mean, that's a lot.
10377000	10378000	What about a newer game?
10378000	10379000	Can you think of a newer game?
10379000	10381000	No, because they're all awful.
10381000	10384000	I think kind of a go-to, I mean, in terms of,
10384000	10388000	you mentioned before that sometimes it's because of release dates that these games have to be rushed out.
10388000	10392000	An example of an awful licensed game where that wasn't the case is actually Deadpool,
10392000	10395000	because Activision told the developers during development,
10395000	10397000	we're not aiming for high review scores.
10397000	10398000	We're looking for about a six out of ten.
10398000	10401000	So that's one of the reasons why that game wasn't that good.
10401000	10405000	But in terms of games, licensed games that are really solid,
10405000	10410000	I still kind of go to the gold standard for me for the last generation is Batman Arkham Asylum.
10410000	10413000	It is such an enjoyable experience from start to finish.
10413000	10417000	Good choice. Very good choice. I would agree with that.
10417000	10421000	All those games, I mean, I'm looking forward to the next one that's coming out.
10421000	10424000	They got pushed back to next year, but that's going to be great, too.
10424000	10428000	So, alright, Ben, I have to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10428000	10431000	But, Ben, I'm a big supporter of indie broadcasters, indie podcasts.
10431000	10434000	Go ahead. It's not crass. Plug your stuff. Come on.
10434000	10435000	Oh, thank you very much.
10435000	10437000	It's a web series about change in video games.
10437000	10440000	It's about interesting and unique ports and conversions of video games.
10440000	10443000	You can find it online at portcenter.tv.
10443000	10447000	It's portcenter, like SportsCenter, but without the S at the front, .tv.
10447000	10450000	Alright, I love it. That's a cute little play on words you got there.
10450000	10453000	Thanks so much for listening, Ben, and participating in calling in on your first night.
10453000	10456000	See you this week, Ben. This is Jeff.
10456000	10459000	I'll see you at D&D.
10459000	10461000	Oh, maybe not.
10461000	10463000	I knew it. You were a D&D player the whole time.
10463000	10465000	Now, if it's second edition, count me in.
10465000	10467000	Alright. Alright, take care, Ben.
10467000	10468000	Bye.
10468000	10472000	Give Marissa a big hug, because you'll probably see her before we do, sadly.
10472000	10474000	I might be seeing her on Monday. Maybe.
10474000	10476000	Lucky brat.
10476000	10477000	Do my squeeze.
10477000	10478000	Alright, take care, my friend.
10478000	10479000	See ya.
10479000	10481000	Rob, I just saved your life.
10481000	10482000	What? How? What'd you do?
10482000	10483000	I killed a Black Widow.
10483000	10485000	Oh, are they in the house?
10485000	10486000	There was one in the bathroom.
10486000	10488000	That's scary. So you saved Shane's life.
10488000	10489000	I saved Shane's life.
10489000	10491000	And Sanrio.
10491000	10495000	That's scary. Alright, I'm going to make this call really quick, but I do want to fit in one more call before we go.
10495000	10497000	Hi, you're on Orange Falls Radio. Who's this?
10497000	10499000	It's the resident whore of anime conventions, Rama.
10499000	10501000	Rama, you almost didn't get in tonight.
10501000	10504000	We've had a lot of, like, returning and new callers tonight.
10504000	10506000	It's kind of awesome.
10506000	10507000	But we love you too, Rama.
10507000	10509000	You'd be the whore if they paid you.
10509000	10512000	You're like the slut of anime cons.
10512000	10514000	You pay your cover to get in.
10514000	10515000	I am an anime consul.
10515000	10519000	So what Jamie is saying is, you are a whore, darlin'.
10519000	10521000	And then how?
10521000	10523000	If he gets paid, he's the whore.
10523000	10526000	Alright, we're going to make this quick. Rama, what's on your mind? Quick.
10526000	10536000	Look, I just got to say that the ALS Ice Water Challenge, originally, the challenge was happening, but people were picking whatever charity you wanted to go to.
10536000	10541000	And then this. I've also been called out five times to do the challenge.
10543000	10549000	Yeah, you need some sort of, like, achievement unlocked where people can see the trophy on your Facebook page where it's like,
10549000	10553000	or if somebody chooses not to participate, I think that's okay too.
10553000	10559000	Like, I kind of said, you know, I would choose to help charities in my own ways that I come up with.
10559000	10562000	So, and that's what I do.
10562000	10566000	But I'm not going to sit there and say, you guys do the ice bucket challenge, you're stupid.
10566000	10568000	No, that's stupid. It's great.
10568000	10570000	That's a story for another time.
10570000	10574000	Because honestly, money is coming out. I think it's a good thing.
10574000	10577000	Now, last thing I want to get off my chest before I get out of here.
10577000	10581000	I found your DragonCon solution. This is what you do.
10581000	10582000	Alright.
10582000	10586000	About a good forty, about a good fifteen, half hour before the panels.
10586000	10589000	Get your drink on, okay? Seriously, get your drink on.
10589000	10592000	Well, that will be the entire weekend, but yes.
10592000	10595000	Go down to that dance party, okay?
10595000	10597000	Go up for about ten, fifteen minutes.
10597000	10600000	Leave. Go to the Twin Peaks one.
10600000	10603000	Leave. Go back to the dance party.
10603000	10607000	It'll become a sausage fest and you can just sit there and laugh your ass off.
10607000	10611000	No, in reality, Rama, they are at the same time.
10611000	10615000	But the Twin Peaks panel is an hour and the LGBT thing is 5.5 hours.
10615000	10619000	And let's be real, that community tends to run late to everything.
10619000	10622000	So, I'm going to just go to the Twin Peaks thing and then go to the party,
10622000	10625000	which will probably just be starting at that time, to be real.
10625000	10626000	So, that's my plan.
10626000	10628000	That's all. There you go.
10628000	10633000	But I appreciate the advice of a seasoned pro as well.
10633000	10636000	I am no seasoned pro, good sir.
10636000	10641000	Rama, what do you think about Tokujir maybe getting skipped?
10641000	10645000	The fact, I can kind of understand because of the color of the outfits,
10645000	10647000	but this is Saban here.
10647000	10652000	He's going to skip it because you got Dino Charge and Super Dino Charge,
10652000	10656000	AKA 52 episodes, which will be edited down to about...
10656000	10657000	Forty.
10657000	10659000	No, thirty. Fifteen per season.
10659000	10664000	I'm still sitting here waiting for them to finish up with whatever the hell,
10664000	10666000	whatever the hell they want to call this crap.
10666000	10669000	So, I can sit here and rent and flip my table and call it a day.
10669000	10672000	Why do you think I only stick to the Japanese ones?
10672000	10674000	I just like to sit and compare and be like, really?
10674000	10679000	But do I have to realize it's the same thing when it comes to Ninja Turtles,
10679000	10681000	all these other franchises.
10681000	10684000	Yeah, these producers may wreck it for us, but it ain't for us.
10684000	10688000	It's for the average person that's going to sit there and watch it anyway.
10688000	10692000	So, no matter how much we bitch mode complain about how it's not like the source material.
10692000	10694000	They do not care about us.
10694000	10698000	They more care about the average user who's going to spend more money on it than what we will.
10698000	10701000	Because fifteen minutes in, we're going to be like, fuck this, I'm out.
10701000	10707000	Hey, at least they changed the pink Zord back to pink for Dino Charge instead of purple.
10707000	10709000	So, that's nice of them.
10709000	10713000	Point taken. So, are you picking up the Zoo Ranger box set?
10713000	10718000	No, I watched a little bit of that. I didn't really find it that interesting.
10718000	10720000	I thought Die Ranger was better than Zoo Ranger.
10720000	10722000	And if you want to hear this conversation continue,
10722000	10727000	tune into Anime Jam Session on Tuesday nights at the Boise Geese Network.
10727000	10730000	I get the hit, Rob.
10730000	10732000	I really need to go, so bye, Rajan.
10732000	10734000	Stop taking over this show with your Power Rangers chat.
10734000	10736000	Bye, Rob. Bye, Jeff.
10736000	10738000	Bye, Rama. Take care, buddy.
10738000	10740000	Nice meeting you.
10740000	10741000	I will, as always.
10741000	10742000	Bye.
10742000	10743000	Alright, bye.
10743000	10746000	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skyline. It was on fire tonight.
10746000	10748000	I'm really sorry to those of you that didn't get through.
10748000	10750000	Please consider sending us an email.
10750000	10753000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send us an email.
10753000	10757000	Or you can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10757000	10759000	You can even post on our Facebook page as well.
10759000	10761000	Send a carrier pigeon for all I care.
10761000	10764000	Just, you know, let us know you care.
10764000	10766000	And that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10766000	10769000	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and participating with the program.
10769000	10771000	If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
10771000	10773000	just tell a friend or five about the show.
10773000	10776000	Just like Marissa did, who got our gold star tonight for following,
10776000	10781000	I guess, not really following because it's not a demand.
10781000	10783000	It's more of a request for granting.
10783000	10785000	It's granting our request. No, you talking about Power Rangers.
10785000	10787000	That's a demand.
10787000	10789000	That didn't even make sense.
10789000	10793000	Granting our request to tell a few people about Orange Lounge Radio.
10793000	10795000	It helps spread the word because we don't have a magazine
10795000	10797000	or a big publishing arm behind us.
10797000	10799000	We just have word of mouth.
10799000	10801000	Thanks for keeping it positive, too, you guys.
10801000	10803000	You know, it's been a rough week.
10803000	10806000	And I hope you guys got some positivity and some laughs out of tonight's show.
10806000	10809000	And we could bring some more positive things.
10809000	10812000	So even if you don't feel like telling people you listen to OLR,
10812000	10815000	at least try to spread some positivity out there
10815000	10818000	because it's a really, it can be a really shitty world sometimes.
10818000	10820000	And, you know, just don't be a part of it.
10820000	10823000	So before I close up shop tonight, though,
10823000	10825000	I got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10825000	10827000	Shane, despite all the shit I give you on the show,
10827000	10830000	you know, you're kind of awesome sometimes.
10830000	10832000	All the time. And I'm always right.
10832000	10834000	And I really appreciate you filling in tonight in a pinch.
10834000	10836000	Especially since it's way past my bedtime.
10836000	10838000	Do you have anything you want to plug before you go to bed?
10838000	10839000	Power Rangers.
10839000	10841000	All right. And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10841000	10842000	Power Rangers.
10842000	10844000	Power Rangers. All right.
10844000	10848000	And my final thought tonight is, oh, my gosh,
10848000	10851000	I'm leaving in, like, less than 72 hours.
10851000	10854000	I might be freaking out just a little bit.
10854000	10858000	Anyway, I can't wait to see many of you at Dragon Con.
10858000	10860000	And for those of you guys that are going to other conventions this weekend,
10860000	10862000	or even if you're just staying at home and having a barbecue,
10862000	10864000	I hope you have a fantastic, long weekend.
10864000	10867000	And we'll be back in two weeks to do it all again
10867000	10869000	with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10869000	10871000	Have a wonderful night, everybody. Good night.
