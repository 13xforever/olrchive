00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Not content with the masses of viewers controlling Red's destiny, one streamer wagered as Fish was capable of beating Pokemon as well.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
And for you non-adventure fans, you can watch Two Fish playing Street Fighter 2 instead.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Stay tuned for all the updates to the non-Fishy gaming news, your comments, and phone calls on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live with this episode number 565 for August 24th, 2014.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts here in studio.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Sup bitches.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
How are you DarkSakura?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm um, sedate.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Sedate?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Oddly sedate.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
But that doesn't mean you're like actually asleep, you're just...

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
No, it means that I've spent my last month like a sprung coil.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
And the coil has sprung.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Right.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
And now it's sort of in its relaxed state.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
I see, so it's like you kinda, you've been winding up anticipation, anticipation, and now relax, right?

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Hopefully not descending toward entropy, like Shane.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Alright, yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
I think I agree with Shane though, I think that we need naps.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I know, this is the OLR Siesta show tonight, we'll see.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Alright, well not joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki is not here tonight.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
I gotta be honest, I'm not exactly sure why he's not here, I just got a tweet from him saying he wouldn't be coming.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
I think that means family related things that he probably forgot about, so we wish Loki well wherever he's at.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
But he should be back in two weeks when we are live again.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
As a reminder, we're not gonna be live next week over the Labor Day holiday, I'll remind people what's going on in just a moment.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
But filling in for Loki tonight, say hello to Shane is joining us.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Hello.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Hey Shane, are you okay?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm so tired.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
You're tired?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Yes, it's almost my bedtime.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Do you want coffee?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
No, that's disgusting.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
You can't do the show completely trying to fall asleep, I thought you were gonna be good.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
I promised Shane that I would bring him cold brew coffee to see if he likes it better.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I'm just really tired.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Really?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yes.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
I'm gonna bring it to you at work in a flask so that you'll get asked by HR why you have a flask at your desk.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Alright, well I need you to pep up, Shane.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
This is me at like a ten.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Okay, okay. No, no, no, no. I know how to turn Shane up to a ten. This is what I'm gonna do.

02:38.000 --> 02:48.000
I am the nicest guy, bestest pal in the whole wide world, so before we get to video game chat, and there's a lot of game chat to get to tonight.

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
To help Shane pep up tonight, I'm gonna give Shane 60 seconds to say anything he wants about Power Rangers.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Alright, ready?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Can I start now?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Go.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
They have Power Morphicon this weekend and it looks so good and they announced a new cast of Dino Charge and the Black Ranger's really hot.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
There, that's really all I have to say.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Wow, wow, you did that nine, nine, nine seconds.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
But it didn't really wake me up.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Shane, that was supposed to get you excited.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
When we both have the same day off, do you want to marathon Mega Ranger with me?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah, I could watch that. I haven't seen that one yet.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Because the Japanese one was the best.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
You should watch Gokaiger. That's really good too.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
I also have the Mega Ranger vs. Car Ranger movie on Laserdisc.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Car Ranger.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Shane, you're gonna have to speak up or something.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Why? They can't even hear me?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Just because you're so tired.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
That's how I normally sound anyway.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Much better, much better.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
Rob, we're gonna do it over here too so that when you come home, you'll be greeted by lots of Sendai.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, is that what you're gonna do while I'm out of town in Atlanta?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
No, it's what I'm gonna do when Shane and I have the same days off again.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Or when I have the same days off as Shane because my schedule's changing.

03:55.000 --> 04:04.000
Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, immediately after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
And we have some people indulging Shane in Power Rangers chat.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Let's talk about Power Rangers. That will wake me up.

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
Captain Spike from gamebuoy.org, we love gamebuoy.org, Captain Spike says, I don't agree, re Black Ranger, whatever.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
But he did give a nice hearty yass to the...

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
What? The Black Ranger's so hot. And he's from New Zealand, so you know he's got a really good accent.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Let's see...

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
And I may have watched an episode of Legend of the Seeker last night because he was on it.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Tigerclaw asks, where was Shane when the earthquake hit? It wasn't big enough to wake Rob.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah, it was a big earthquake in North Calpins.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah, I didn't know about it until I saw it.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I found out from my mother in Alabama.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
We appreciate you guys being concerned because I did get a few tweets about it. We appreciate the concern.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
But it was in Napa, which is a good hundred miles to the west, northwest.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It should have been closer.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
My mom's like, I love earthquakes.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
It happened in San Francisco. Call your friends, make sure they're alive. Are you okay?

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Did you feel it was like, Mom, I went to bed at four in the morning after playing Final Fantasy all day.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
I didn't feel anything. I didn't know anything. And between you and the cat, I'm never gonna sleep again.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I love my mom, though.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, when is Shane not really tired other than Pokemon launch day?

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm super tired on Pokemon launch day because I'm usually up all night to get Pokemon at midnight.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
He's up all night to get pokies.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
He's up all night to get pokies.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
That actually sounds really dirty.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Why do you think I said it?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Oh, God. Somebody's gonna crop that and do something horrible with it.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
I'm very sad, though, because the next Power Morphicon is in 2016, I think they said.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I'd have to double check. That's two years.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I'm sorry.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
I will go because they're gonna talk about the movie, and I bet Dino Charge Black will be there.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
And I'm going to have to drug him and take him to a hotel room.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Misty in chat says, Shane, dude, one of my friends is gonna cosplay a ranger from the train theme series at Wizard Chicago.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Tokijer's the best.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I must link you to pics when I have them.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I did like Mudgey Ranger.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I didn't watch that one.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
That one was okay.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
And then, let's see, lastly, we'll say, actdeft says, Shane needs to be angry to sound more eager.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
That's true.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
What makes you angry right now?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Being kept awake.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, being kept awake.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Well, good, this should be an entertaining three hours.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Alright, we'll try to get into it.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We're gonna get into the show tonight.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
He's sliding off of the chair.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Well, sit up, because we got gaming news to discuss.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So, I want to start off with tonight's kickoff topic.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
So, where to begin with this?

06:41.000 --> 06:51.000
So, it's no secret, guys, it's been a really weird, crazy, drama, like, sands through the hourglass,

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
this is the games of our lives type of week in the gaming world.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
And I just, here's the thing.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
I kind of think the gaming industry is so much bigger than the perception that some of us hardcore fans have of it.

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
To kind of put this into perspective, Diablo 3, the Ultimate Evil Edition, came out on PlayStation 4 this week,

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
and I was so busy playing it all night, I think Wednesday or Thursday, one night this week,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
that apparently a bunch of drama broke out.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
I missed all of it because I was playing games.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And I'm kind of thankful in that regard.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And some of you guys might be sitting there going,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Drama? What drama? There's drama going on? I don't want to...

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
And honestly, if that's you, trust me, ignorance is bliss.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Ain't nobody got time for that when it comes to a lot of this other stuff that's going on.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Like, I just, I can't. I'm not, I'm unable to.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I cannot even. I can't odd either. It's just, it's, oh my gosh.

07:48.000 --> 07:56.000
So, one good thing that came out of a lot of this stuff that's going on is there was a really cool little hashtag that was on Twitter.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
And the next day on Twitter, I saw this floating around. It was hashtag WeLoveGameDevs.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Are you sure it wasn't hashtag ZackAttack?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I think that was trending too.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah, it was.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Oh, now there's a topic that gets you excited.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
I won't talk about Zack. I'm a big brother for hours.

08:16.000 --> 08:25.000
But, you know, I love this hashtag WeLoveGameDevs because it really got people to talk about why is it that we are so enthusiastic about games?

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
Because there's a lot of people out there that will claim to do things because they like video games.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
But then I kind of look back and go, but you're hurting games with the things.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
How can you do that on one hand and on the other say, oh, I'm trying to protect the game industry?

08:43.000 --> 08:50.000
It's like, from what? The game industry is so much bigger than what you see on Twitter, on Facebook, on Instagram, and all this stuff.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
So, I just, I don't know. I want to play games. I like games. I enjoy games.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
And I don't, by games, I don't fucking mean mind games. Like, I'm too old for that shit.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
So, let's talk about video games and why we here at OLR love game devs, too.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Because I sent out a tweet. I thought that was a really nice little positive tweet.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Because, you know, full disclosure, it's no secret. Yes, I do this show, Orange Lawns Radio.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
This is a, you know, gaming enthusiast podcast, I guess some would call it.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And we've been doing this for, what, 12 years.

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
But thanks to having done this show, I've had the opportunity to make friends in the industry in all different types.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
I have friends that do the journalism stuff. I have friends that make games.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
Heck, Shane, you used to, I mean, it's no secret, you used to do game development of sorts, right?

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
And you did DDR with Konami for a while, right?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Yes, among other things.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Which can sometimes bring an interesting dynamic into what we do here on OLR.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Because, you know, I have to kind of take a step, I have to be, you know, there's Rob the friend,

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
and then I have to take a step back and be Rob the, you know, amateur analyst for, I guess, lack of a better term,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
and be able to talk objectively.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
An alrapist?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah. What did you just call me? Shut up.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
You know what that's from, right?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah, shut up.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
So, you know, I have to be able to take a step back and kind of look at, like, all this stuff, you know, objectively.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
So, but I know there's so many people out there that really love games and making games and doing this,

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
and I think there's a lot of positive stuff that goes on in the industry, too.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
So I just wanted to talk about, like, why do you guys love video games?

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
So, Jamie, why do you love videos? Why do you do this show?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
You know, we've been doing this for 12 years. Why do you do this show every week for 12 years?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
What is it about video games that you love?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
The shipping.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
It's the garris cross shepherd, is what's been keeping you here.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
No. I really do like the bigger phantom communities that have built up around games now,

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
because we used to not really have much of that when, you know, all I was doing was screaming at playing that god-awful,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
super-difficult Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on the Nintendo,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
and the fucking water level where you get electrocuted.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
No, back then it was spite.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
Back then, I loved games because I was a spiteful, spiteful little human being,

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
and I told the games I would defeat them, and lo and behold, one day I beat the guardian legend.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
It was also...

11:30.000 --> 11:39.000
This is going to sound really stupid and neo-rad-femme in a way I don't want it to,

11:39.000 --> 11:47.000
but I really did get a big kick out of being a girl in the late 80s and early 90s that played video games,

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
when not many other girls were really that into it at the time, or at least weren't supposed to be into it.

11:53.000 --> 12:02.000
I felt like, for me, it was something different that I didn't have to share with anybody else,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
and it was a behavior that wasn't expected of me,

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
so it was a combination of a really good escape and a minor form of rebellion.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
Interesting. That's a very neat thing that you say there, too,

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
because I think I felt some similarities in the expectations.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
Not that I'm going to claim to know exactly, but I feel like there are some similarities with me having been a gay guy,

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
that there are certain expectations about, oh, I should be listening to Madonna and be into fashion,

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
and I'm not really that kind of guy. Well, Madonna's okay, I guess.

12:40.000 --> 12:48.000
You know what I mean? If you saw where I live, I don't live in a well-decorated house.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
You know what I mean? I'm a nerd at heart.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
You do have a lot of IKEA furniture.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
I do, but IKEA is-

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Which is a hallmark of the gay.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
IKEA is Lego for adults.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Anyway.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
No, but that was part of it, and then I just kept sticking with the stuff that I loved,

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
and came through all the various games, and then I eventually made my transition to PC gaming,

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
and then after that, really what kept me in a lot of the games was the fandoms for some of the newer games,

13:19.000 --> 13:27.000
because I could sit and play a casual game, and keep in mind, we had casual games in the 80s and 90s,

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
but they couldn't be truly casual, because they cost a bunch of money,

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
but they're the same type of games that we're seeing as casual games now.

13:37.000 --> 13:45.000
So we had those waste of time games, and then once they became more readily available,

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
they stopped being this big classic concept, and we started looking to games to have more substance to them.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
What we would call a real game now is something that's got an engaging story,

13:57.000 --> 14:05.000
or something that is going to be a point A to point Z type of story.

14:05.000 --> 14:14.000
You know, so I think the definition of what has become a true game versus something casual

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
has evolved with technology, and with our expectations now that we've grown into the genre.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
So it's really a part of, I guess in the end, part of it's a social experiment too, for me.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
I'm going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, reading some of these, and then I'll go over to Shane.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Code Man says, Video games put me in another world.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
They take me out of this fucked world we live in and put us into something that we enjoy, a fantasy.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
Final Fantasy XIV, for example, has given me a place to go hang out with people I love and have a good time.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
Dungeon Buster says, I love games because I thought they were a different form of storytelling,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
and that was exciting to me.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
Bochakawa says, Video games give me goals and rules that make sense,

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
in a world that doesn't let me make goals and rules that are taken too far.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
That's some powerful stuff, you guys.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
Shane, what do you love about video games? Why have you been into games for so long?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
You worked in the industry. What made you want to do that?

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
Because it's fun. I don't really have some in-depth or deep reasoning.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
You don't have to. Just an honest answer is fine.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
They're fun. They're enjoyable. There you go. There's my answer.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
What was the first video game that you played? Do you remember?

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
Yes. Stupid Cat in the Hat mix-up game. The Dr. Seuss one on Coleco.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Scared the crap out of me. Ate that game.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
If the Cat in the Hat scared the crap out of you, how did you get from that to Video games are fun?

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Well, because there were other games that weren't just the Dr. Seuss mix-up game.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Less scary ones.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
What made you decide, I want to get a job doing...

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
What did you first do? You were doing game testing, right? And then it moved into...

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
No, I was hired to do DDR stuff.

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
Oh, okay. Well, what made you decide, this is something I want to do? I want to go into this?

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
Because it sounds like fun. If you're spending so much time already playing this stuff,

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
why not do something more and be the one on the other side, making stuff for other people to have fun with?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Did you learn anything from that experience?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
About video games?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
I guess. Video games are the development of said video games.

16:23.000 --> 16:34.000
It's a lot of red tape and a lot of things that people get mad about are things that you don't have any say over and you wish you could.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
Do you mean when people get really angry on Twitter about certain things going on with particular games,

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
or in social media in general? I keep picking on Twitter, but when people get angry out there,

16:45.000 --> 16:53.000
you're saying that they'd be surprised how little maybe people like you really have to do with things like that, is that what you're saying?

16:53.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah, the people that make the decisions for the most part are the people that have no real connection to making the game.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
So, keep complaining. It goes nowhere.

17:06.000 --> 17:15.000
Let's see, going to Alan Alchemy says, how did he get from that to, talking about Cat in the Hat, how did he get from that to standing for Silent Hill?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
What?

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
How did you get from the Cat in the Hat to your Silent Hill fandom?

17:22.000 --> 17:33.000
There's no Dr. Seuss in Silent Hill. Like, I busted out the Coleco about a year, two years ago,

17:33.000 --> 17:45.000
and it was still working after a little bit of, you know, loving, and I put in that game and it's still scary. I don't like it. It is not fun.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
You know, E.T. on Atari was scary too.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
Actually, E.T. was kind of scary. Like, the original jump scare was falling in one of those fucking holes.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
No, just the whole thing. Well, E.T. scared me as a kid anyway, so there's that.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Were you even alive when that movie came out?

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
Probably not. I don't think so, but yeah.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Okay. I think I've talked about this a little bit.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Oh, you want to know what other thing I learned while I worked at Konami?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Of course.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
There's no way I can do ten Jaeger bombs in 45 minutes and be okay afterwards.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Should you really be bringing that up right now?

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
That wasn't during work hours, but I was working there and it was a work thing afterwards.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Fair enough, fair enough. All right.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Wait, you mean sometimes, like, co-workers hang out and stuff outside of work?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Sometimes.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
You know what, I think that happens in industries that aren't just gaming either.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Nope, just gaming.

18:40.000 --> 18:50.000
For me, I've talked a little bit about this on the show previously, but I was always really just amazed with being able to,

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
and it's going to make me sound like such a control freak and I can already hear Grandpa in the back of my head teasing me about this,

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
but I loved on the Atari 2600 that I was in control of what was on the TV screen.

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
And, like, that little moving square was me and I was changing the images that were on the screen with that.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
What, you sound like you're going to say something?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
No, how do I sound like I'm going to say something?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
You look like you're going to say something.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
No, I'm just trying not to fall out of the chair.

19:18.000 --> 19:25.000
So, I loved being able to be that little square and I'm thinking of adventure in particular and it's like, you know, I can go anywhere I want.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm not restricted.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
I'm sorry, in this game, you play as a square?

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
Yes, in adventure, on the Atari 2600, you were a little yellow square and you would go around and you would try to find, like, the sword that would kill you.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Was the sword also a square?

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
No, the sword was kind of a rectangle. Maybe a triangle a little bit.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Wow, the games you had when you were young.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
You just weren't talking about the fucking ColecoVision.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Yeah, but you want to look up a video? It's frightening.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Adventure on ColecoVision, hello.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
But anyway, I love being able to control that and really, like, get immersed in that world.

20:03.000 --> 20:14.000
And even though maybe I'm not creating the story, so to speak, I still feel like at the end of the day, I'm able to kind of put myself in the shoes of that character on the screen.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
And not that that character has to be, like, a carbon copy of me. I can be anyone or anything.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Unless you were a square back then.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Unless, yeah, unless I happen to look like a square.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
Now I look a little more like a pear, so I don't know what game you can play a pear in. Maybe Fruit Ninja.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
You don't play as Fruit Ninja.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
You can be an eggplant in Kid Icarus. Remember when you got turned into an eggplant?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Yes, I'm more of an eggplant wizard.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
And then you just hold down. And you didn't have feet, you were just an eggplant.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yes, I remember that.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
There's, like, an RPG on Nintendo. It had, like, Princess Tomato in it or something. Maybe there's a pear guy in there.

20:45.000 --> 20:54.000
Maybe, maybe. Anyway, so I love being able to really immerse myself in this alternate universe.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
That's what I've always really loved about games. And to see how far the technology has come is so impressive.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
And, you know, remember when, like, Mode 7 first debuted on the Super Nintendo?

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
And we all saw, like, Pilotwings and Actraiser and things like that for the first time?

21:10.000 --> 21:17.000
And it was like, this is so real. The graphics are so realistic. Oh my gosh. It's like a cartoon on my TV.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
You know? And just to see things. I mean, now it's like you look at a Super Nintendo game and you're like,

21:21.000 --> 21:32.000
it wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. And to see how far things have come just in what the 25-ish years since that system is so amazing.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
It really makes you wonder, like, in 25 more years, like, are we going to be on the holodeck?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Or what is it going to be? How am I going to be transported away?

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
I mean, we're already talking about with Oculus and so forth, virtual reality making another step.

21:45.000 --> 21:51.000
So it's just like, you know, it's going to get closer and closer to transporting us to those worlds.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
Bochi Kawa says, that was pretty profound for me too, Rob. It's like, interaction.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
Tigerclaw says, what about Haunted House on the Atari 2600? All you played was a pair of eyeballs.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
That game was kind of scary too, actually.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
Blender says, LOL Sky, I have adventure on PlayStation Home.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
I didn't know that was a thing you could do. I didn't know the Atari games were there on PlayStation Home. That's pretty cool.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Too bad you have to play PlayStation Home to do it.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
How mean. PlayStation Home, well, we'll get into that a little later.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
You look like a pedophile in that game. No matter what, you make your character look like.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
Stop. All right. Let's see. Bochi Kawa says, in Final Fantasy 6, they sang, it blew my mind.

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
Yeah. Oh my God. You want to talk about a story? Final Fantasy 6 was so flippin' amazing. So good.

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
Anyhow, just wanted to, you know, bring a little bit, kind of bring it back to what it's really about, and that is the passion for gaming.

22:49.000 --> 23:00.000
And, you know, what kind of motivates us to be here, and what motivates you guys to listen to this podcast, and subscribe to it, and be with other gamers, and talk about these shared experiences, and so on.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Please feel free to tweet us or email us if you have more to add to this.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com, or of course we're on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

23:09.000 --> 23:17.000
All right. We're going to get into our gaming week, but first, I guess, well no, we'll do housekeeping later. I'll talk about Dragon Con and all that in a minute.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
So let's get into our gaming weeks. So Dark Soccer, you want to start off? How was your gaming week? What did you play this week?

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
I played a bunch of Doth. I started another Shepard, a Mass Effect 3.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Yay, Shepard.

23:28.000 --> 23:36.000
Because I have hair mods, and I'm using my hair mods now, that actually has a decent looking nape bun for Fem Shop.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
And it's the one that's on all those Ashley mods that's really neat looking.

23:41.000 --> 23:48.000
And of course Ashley's alive in my game, because Ashley's awesome. Badass.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Boo. Boo racist.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
What?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Ashley's a racist.

23:53.000 --> 24:02.000
No, she's not. She's slightly xenophobic until she actually learns that other races are trustworthy.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
She learned that when she blew up in my game.

24:05.000 --> 24:13.000
She overcomes her fuck the aliens tendencies, especially since her boss says, let's fuck the aliens.

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
I got to level 50 in Final Fantasy XIV and then quotey beat the game.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Congrats. Did you like that 20 minute ending?

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
I was chatting with Becky. I was like, no, I thought we were on the last battle.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Okay, Becky, we're on the last battle, because she was on aim with me.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
And then I'm like, wait, there's more.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
I was like, okay, we finally just beat, you know, whatever his name is, Gaius.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
And then I was like, the fuck? What's this?

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
So I was like, sorry, Becky, there's still more ending to do. No, more fighting to do.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.000
She's like, oh my God, how long is this going on? You've been playing for five hours, which is true.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
And then, so finally we get through the whole thing. It was cool with, like, we had a full party for it.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Marching down in our matching Magitek armor. It was really cool.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
Finally beat the game. Everyone's like, party's out, bye. And I'm like, ending.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
I was like, hey, Becky, guess what? She's like, well, I was like, the ending's still happening. No.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah, the ending in Final Fantasy XIV is like a good, like, 20 minutes.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
And that's even skipping the full credit sequence, which nobody's going to watch the full credit sequence,

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
because they put every 1.0 player that was subscribed.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
But they let you skip past the names. You can go to, like, the Zs and then let it play.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Yeah, that's what I did.

25:36.000 --> 25:46.000
I was looking for people I knew. And then, like, it was, you have, like, three skippable credits. It's stupid.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
And then I was like, okay, everyone's happy. I bet they're just going to, ooh, there is some shit.

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
Yeah, and then there's the after-credits cutscene that sets up the rest of the game.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
And, like, this was my quote in the chat from when we fought the one red guy.

26:03.000 --> 26:12.000
Way hey hey, Senpai didn't notice me. Way hey hey, I'm going to throw a tamper tantrum. Way hey, you're dead bitch.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
So, did that. And so now I'm doing the end game.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
And I spent, like, an hour looking for the stuff for a quest that I've already done.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Because I didn't think I'd done the die quest, and I did.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
So I did the get the Japanese dance quests today, and that was it.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
So yeah, doing that, more Final Fantasy.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
Bravely Defart took a rest, just because I haven't been playing much games at work.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
But I am, I do have, I put in my pre-order officially.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
I hate using the word pre-order, because it's technically an order.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
For something that's going to arrive at a later date, but it's still just an order.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
I ordered Dragon Age Inquisition.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Yay.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
The deluxe edition.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Yay.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
And then I found out today, Varric is not romanceable.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Yay.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
He's probably in a deep relationship with Bianca.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
That's awkward, because that's his bow. His crossbow.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Which he talks about her like she's his mistress.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
So that means I'm going to be romancing the fuck out of Vivienne.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Because she's amazing looking.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I heard her voice actress just, like, two days ago.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
She's awesome. She's in Game of Thrones.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
I'm going to romance the hell out of Vivienne.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Oh, but they haven't said that she's romanceable.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I know, but she better be.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Because Vivienne.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
I'm just mad because I don't have a Fenris.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
ActDeaf in chat is suggesting instead of pre-order, use the word reservation.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
I like that better.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
I reserved my copy by paying for it and ordering it to be delivered on the date of its release.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
The voice actor for Fenris said that he did do some work for this new game.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
So, crossing my fingers that Fenris shows up with my hawk.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
SSG100Matt in chat says, how long does it take for someone on average to max level their character in Final Fantasy XIV?

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
That really depends on how many hours a week you're going to put into the game.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
That depends on if you just sit there chatting with people.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah, it really depends on your play style.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
I think if you're going to put the pedal to the metal and you're going to play a good couple hours every day,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
you can probably do it six weeks or less.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Depends on the class, too.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I'll put it this way.

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
By the time that we were at the end of beta, I already saw people running around in Magitek Bounce,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
which means they'd be the game.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
Yeah, so it just depends on how much you're willing to put into it.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
But if you're doing more casual, it'll probably take you a couple months.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Unless you're me, then it'll take you all year.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah, but you went through long stretches without playing at all.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah, well I also went through long stretches of being completely pissed off at the game.

28:48.000 --> 28:55.000
Alright, let's see. If that's it for your gaming week between Final Fantasy and all that, let's go over to Shane.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh, almost.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Very solitaire.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Of course, of course. Shane, how was your gaming week?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
It was fine.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
What'd you play?

29:05.000 --> 29:15.000
I played PT, and I played Diablo 3 on PS4, and Final Fantasy, and that's where I'm going to stop.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Okay.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Except that he's got Pokemon going on right now.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Well, that doesn't count. That's like, Shane, did you breathe some air today?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Did you play Pokemon? Yeah.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Did you go to the bathroom? Yeah.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
What did you think about Diablo 3?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
It's better on consoles, I think.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
It's just the way it handles better.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
That's all it is for you, is the handling that makes it better?

29:37.000 --> 29:45.000
Well, also my computer's not the best, so I don't have any frame rate issues or long loads.

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
Because you weren't sure if you were going to buy it at first, but then my copy finally got here late Tuesday night or whatever, so we were playing-

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Thirty minutes after we realized. Or before we realized.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
Long story. Anyway, we were playing co-op on the same screen. I didn't even realize you could do until one of my friends texted me.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Even though I said, look on the back, it says you can do it, and you ignored me.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Yeah, no, I was like, oh, that means over the internet, Shane.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
No, because I specifically said, look, it's not the internet one, because the internet one is this iPhone.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And I was just like, you're wrong, Shane, you're wrong.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
I'm always right. It does not happen.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
In this one particular circumstance, you may have been leaning towards the correct answer.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
No, always right. Ask Flaco Jones.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
But then you were suddenly like, oh, I got to go get this. You were really sold on it after that one play.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Mm-hmm, yep.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
And that was just the handling and so forth?

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah, and like I said, it performs better on the PS4 for me than my PC, because my PC's kind of garbage.

30:36.000 --> 30:43.000
All right. Let's see, Mike gave me a week. I have also been playing a crapload of Diablo 3, Ultimate Evil Edition.

30:43.000 --> 30:50.000
I'm up to maybe level 34, 35, which I'm sure some people are already further than that, but just in the time I had to play.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Paragon 782.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
You're right. I'm sure some people are already, actually, somebody on my friends list is already 70.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
But I think he did a save file from the PlayStation 3 Diablo, so anyway.

31:00.000 --> 31:08.000
But I am enjoying Diablo 3. It's not without its flaws. It does have a few drawbacks.

31:08.000 --> 31:18.000
Some of the art, sometimes you get hidden behind things, and you can't really see the items or anything.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
So some of that art stuff is a really weird drawback.

31:21.000 --> 31:29.000
And yeah, I think it's a little weird how you're zoomed in when you're used to the PC's perspective.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
It's really kind of hard to get used to that zoomed in look. But it works.

31:35.000 --> 31:43.000
And I just enjoy being able to plop on the couch and kind of play this mindless, what for me ends up being a beat-em-up.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
Because I'm playing a barbarian, so barbarians are very kind of beat-em-up.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
It's almost like I'm playing the Ninja Turtles arcade game over and over and getting loot and all that stuff.

31:51.000 --> 31:57.000
You know what else I really don't like about Diablo 3 on console compared to PC is the interface.

31:57.000 --> 32:05.000
I really cannot get used to the click wheel and equipping things that way as opposed to the mouse and keyboard.

32:05.000 --> 32:13.000
But if you don't have the PC version as a frame of reference, that probably won't bug you nearly as bad as it bugged me.

32:13.000 --> 32:21.000
And some of the inventory management actually works out a little better because you can hold more things at a time so you don't have to travel back to town quite as much.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
So that part's kind of nice.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
So yeah, I've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 and then I've also been playing some Final Fantasy XIV here and there.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
But those two games pretty much have been eating up my week.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
Maybe a couple other little things here and there, like I think I opened my 3DS to play one little thing.

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
I got a blue summoner jacket in Final Fantasy XIV and now that's all I'm ever going to play in that game.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
You're trying to make everything blue in that game.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
You're trying to make your clothes blue, now you're trying to make your chocobo blue after the last patch.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
And so I will get there at one point or another.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
But you tried dying your chocobo today and it turned out purple.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
It was lavender purple.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Good job.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
And so I killed it and started over.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
No you didn't. You can't do that. You did not euthanize your chocobo.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
I deserve to be for not being the right color that I wanted.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Let's see, Bochakawa says, yay, lots of D3 on everyone.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I still prefer the PC version though.

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
I did hear on a recent interview that Blizzard is working on doing patches for both consoles and PC at the same time.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
I really hope that proves true because that was something that really disappointed me about the last versions for the Playstation game.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
Well, Blizzard is really trustworthy on what they say they're going to do, so...

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Well yeah, and that's why I have valid concern.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I kind of don't believe them when they say that.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Exactly, because that was so awesome.

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
They better hold to that because the 2.1 patch sounds really, really good and I want to play that on consoles as well.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
Cial in chat says, how does Diablo 3 work on a 360?

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
It doesn't because who owns a 360?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Oh, there's one right there.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
What's it doing? How hooked up is it?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
It's not hooked up right now.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
That TV doesn't even have a power core.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
It'll run fine.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
The Playstation 3 version was fine.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Ours isn't hooked up. You know what is hooked up?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
A Sega CDX.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Better system.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
It'll work fine on the 360.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
It's just going to be a little...

34:10.000 --> 34:17.000
It won't have quite the sharp, rich textures that the Playstation 4 and Xbox One undoubtedly have with them.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
You'll have a little bit lower of a resolution, but I think the experience is still a pretty good one.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
However, one word of warning.

34:27.000 --> 34:36.000
Apparently, even though they're going to patch the Playstation 4 and Xbox One versions, they may not patch the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
So, buyer beware if you do go for those versions.

34:39.000 --> 34:46.000
But the game you get outside of the box and $20 cheaper on those consoles should still be a solid experience.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
But I don't believe you have cross-play either.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
I don't think a PS3 person can play with a PS4 person.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
And that probably has to do with the patching.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So, just beware of that stuff.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Alright.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
That is it for our Gaming Week, so let me quickly do housekeeping.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
We will not be here next week. There's no podcast next week over Labor Day weekend.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
I hope everybody here in the States has a great Labor Day holiday.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
For those of you in other places where you don't celebrate Labor Day, well, I hope you just have a good weekend.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
But with the extended weekend, there's a lot of stuff that goes on.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
People go camping, or they go on trips, or what have you.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
And there's a lot of expos going on at that time.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
PAX Prime, of particular interest to the gaming community, going on up in Seattle.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.000
For the broader geek community, there's a huge event in Atlanta called DragonCon.

35:31.000 --> 35:37.000
And that's where I'm actually going to be, along with many hosts from the Voice Geeks Network are going to be at DragonCon.

35:37.000 --> 35:44.000
Myself, Bobby Blackwolf, Travis Donovan, John from Critical Myth, Brian from British Invaders.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
And that's all I can think of at the top of my head.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
I'm pretty sure Pod Culture has some representation as well, even though I know Brad's not there.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I think some of his co-hosts are there.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
And so there's just lots of VOG people are going to be at DragonCon.

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
So if you're going to be in the Atlanta area over Labor Day weekend, please consider come saying hi to us.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
Bobby is literally on one panel every day.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
And I'm supposed to be joining him on some of those.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
The best time to find us will be Monday at 1130, which I know is towards the end of the Con.

36:12.000 --> 36:19.000
So that is going to be the participating panel brought to you by the Voice of Geeks Network.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
That is going to be Monday at 1130 a.m.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
But if you want to try and meet us earlier in the Con, I would encourage you to go to the podcasting kickoff,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
which is going to be Friday, I believe, at 1 p.m.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
Bobby's going to be on that panel, and there'll be a lot of the podcaster audience there, including myself.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
And I'm sure Travis will be there. A lot of the folks will be there.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
So check that out.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
And there's lots of stuff I'm trying to figure out.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
But the only bummer about Dragon Con is then there's so much to do that things start conflicting.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
Like, I just found out Brian from British Invaders sadly can't be on our VOG panel

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
because he's on a British television panel at the exact same time, which is a bummer.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
And then I found out there's this, like, dance party thing I want to go to Saturday night.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
And you know what's at the exact same time?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
The Twin Peaks 25th Anniversary panel.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
And it's like, how do I decide what to do?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
What would you do, Shane?

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
What would you do, Shane? Would you do the Twin Peaks 25th Anniversary, or would you go to the GLBT event?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
What would you do?

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
Okay, I was only kind of interested in Twin Peaks. It got kind of dumb.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
So I don't care about that and gay stuff.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
Yeah, but you really hate all that, like, dance music and lights and drinks and all that.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
So what would I do? I would not go to any of those.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
You would go to the hotel room and sleep.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Yes.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
You're fun.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
Alright. Oh, Brad from Pod Culture correcting me. Nobody from Pod Culture is going.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Well, this year, they're not going.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I always enjoy the Hall-Con.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. At Dragon Con, it's insane.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
It's when you sit out and hang out with people in the halls or on the lines.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
There's no standing or sitting room in any of those halls because it's just so painful.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
I know, you find a place.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
I know, I know. People have to go around the corners and things like that, so.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I have a funny story about sitting in a line.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Alright, quickly.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
I sat in a line for something I didn't go to. It was when Utena was playing at Anime Expo, the Utena movie.

38:02.000 --> 38:08.000
And I just sat outside the movie cleaning off a $15 Sega Saturn game that I bought,

38:08.000 --> 38:14.000
only to determine that the disc was in perfect shape, and I saved myself about 80 bucks because I bought Grandia.

38:14.000 --> 38:23.000
Awesome. Let's see. Other housekeeping. Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
And we're also on Google Plus. Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
One other thing that's very important before we get to the news tonight.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
We want to wish our friends, sadly these gals are not going to Dragon Con,

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
and I don't think they're going to PAX either, so sadly I will not be able to see them,

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
but I will always cherish our E3 time together and that one PAX East I went to.

38:44.000 --> 38:50.000
But these gals are great. The Electric Sistahood, which you can hear Tuesdays here at the Voice of Geeks Network,

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
they are having their 400th episode this week on Tuesday.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
And that is a huge milestone. Like very few podcasts get to a number like that.

39:00.000 --> 39:08.000
So I want to give props to the sisters over at Electric Sistahood on reaching their 400th episode,

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
which I'm imagining they probably taped today in advance of their Tuesday premiere.

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
So big congratulations to them and their show is a lot of fun and I love hanging out with them in person.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
So big congrats on 400 episodes for you folks.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news. Dang it, it's time.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
So Shane perk up and let's get into some gaming news.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Well, I was looking at pictures of Power Morphicons.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Did that help you feel better?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Yeah, the screen ranger that is cosplaying is super hot.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Alright, fair enough.

39:41.000 --> 39:49.000
So Atari decided that they didn't ruin Alone in the Dark enough that time they put it out on.

39:49.000 --> 39:55.000
I think it was PS3 and Xbox 360, so they're going to reboot it again,

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
along with this dumb game called Haunted House that you guys talked about earlier.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
That sounded stupid.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Okay, wait a minute though, wait a minute though.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
It's because it was a 2600 game.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Doesn't matter.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
You don't have an appreciation for the classics.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
No, I don't.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Have you ever played like Flappy Bird or...

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
I tried, it was so dumb and then I tried that helicopter one and that was even worse.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
Yeah, I totally left that out of my gaming week, but I played that swing cop.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Yeah, and then I deleted it.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
But you know what I'm realizing about Dong Wen?

40:23.000 --> 40:31.000
Is that he does a really good job making like Atari 2600 style cell phone games.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
Because Atari 2600 games, most of them were like a singular concept.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
That's all it was.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Like, you know, all the games were one word too.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
Boxing, pinball, you know, oink.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
It was a game about the three little pigs.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
And they were all like just one little thing, but you had to do it very well.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
And the Dong Wen games kind of do that same thing.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
They do it really well.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
The swing copter one, he doesn't do that one very well.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
It's so hard.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Garbage.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
But so, like if you go play an Atari 2600 game like, oh god, Stampede.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Have you ever, you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
I don't even know what that is.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
Okay, like Stampede is a really gross, hard Atari 2600 game as well.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
At least I think so.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
E.T. was hard anyway.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
E.T. was scary.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
But I digress.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Haunted House was a classic.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah, you play as Eyeball.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
And I'm sure they were, I thought they rebooted Haunted House once already.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
They did, apparently.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
It was on the Wii and Xbox Live Arcade in 2010.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Yeah.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
I'd never even heard of it.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
It looked, they cartooned it up.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Cartoon eyeballs?

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
No, they, I don't know, they tried to make it look like something else.

41:34.000 --> 41:41.000
Anyway, they are going to unveil both Haunted House and that other one I said, Alone in

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
the Dark at PAX.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
So, if you go to PAX, you can go watch this and then decide that it's terrible, just like

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
I already prejudged it.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
It sounds like we might get a lot of gaming news out of PAX, which usually you don't get

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
a lot of news out of PAX.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
It's like you're getting, you might get to play things in advance, like of the holiday

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
season, but you don't get a lot of news out of PAX.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
This is interesting that you've got some companies waiting on announcements for PAX.

42:08.000 --> 42:15.000
All right, well, earlier, Shane was teasing Blizzard for not giving through on some of

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
their promises that they make, so he's doubting the Diablo 3 patch.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
Well, Blizzard isn't the only company that seems to go back on what they say.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
In fact, a company that has been giving Blizzard a little bit of competition going back on

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
some of the things that they are saying, and that would be the creators of WildStar.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
What happened to WildStar?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
It was awful.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Well, I didn't play it, so I don't know.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
I have friends that are really into it.

42:38.000 --> 42:43.000
It's okay, but there was so much momentum behind that game, and then it came out, and

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
it was still there, and then just dropped off.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
Well, sure enough, there you go, because at Gamescom, the senior game designer, Megan

42:50.000 --> 42:58.000
Starks, talked about how the MMO will be going from monthly updates to more occasional updates,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
one update every few months.

43:01.000 --> 43:07.000
They are unable to keep up the smaller, more frequent patches mantra that became somewhat

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
of a rallying cry in MMOs.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Here's the quote from Megan.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
Originally, our idea was to have a really aggressive post-launch schedule, just constantly

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
provide stuff for our players, so there's always things for you to do.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
Now that we've put out two of our updates, our schedule is still planned out.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
We decided to work on the upcoming patch until it's a really good quality state.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
We do know that we want it to come out in the next few months.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Instead of saying that we have this hard deadline, that it's going out no matter what,

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
we're going to take the time to make sure that the quality is there.

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
Aw, they must have got that from a Blizzard form letter.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Like that little handbook?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It sounds like something Blizzard would say.

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
Now, one MMO that you really, really, really tried, very hard to get me back into, was

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
Final Fantasy XI, and you didn't really succeed, maybe a little bit.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
I didn't really try either, but you did resubscribe and played for a little bit.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Technically, I succeeded.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
My account's still active, so I guess you got that.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Mine's not.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Really?

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Yeah.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
You asshole.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
All right.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I only just canceled it.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
But the thing about XI, that I was going to say Final Fantasy XI is that they're still

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
doing monthly updates, right?

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Yeah, and it actually makes the game more fun.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
It's little content that just makes it more enjoyable each time.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
I think that's where these developers go wrong.

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
They think they have to have these grandiose patches that can entertain you for forever

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
and will do them every three to five months.

44:30.000 --> 44:36.000
But if you just do one little patch a month, then that's all you need.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
It'll get you to the next month when another patch will be out.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Exactly.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
sg100matt says, I really liked WildStar when I tried it out a few times.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Hopefully this isn't a sign of bad things to come.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Let's hope not.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
I wonder how their subscriber numbers are holding up.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
I wonder if the game's still doing well.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
I would think that they would have said something by now if it still was doing well,

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
because it's been out for a little bit.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Not to be the negative cynical gamer.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
That's me. Don't take mine.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
No, there's people on the internet much worse than you.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
But I would have expected fully by now that Elder Scrolls Online would have changed.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
I would have thought that that game would have already dropped, but it hasn't.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
So, I mean, kudos to the support that that game is getting, apparently.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
It could just be them being stubborn.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah, that could be it, too. We'll see.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
All right, moving on. DarkSakura.

45:22.000 --> 45:29.000
Well, this is a little bit of sadness, and it was addressed on Bobby's show earlier.

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
But Sony is going to be shutting down PlayStation Home in Japan.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
Actually, as far as I'm aware, it's for the Asian region in general.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
There's nothing to say about North American or European versions yet,

45:42.000 --> 45:49.000
but it will be gone as of March 2015 over in Japan.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
So, boo-hoo.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Where are all the pedophiles going to go now?

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Oh, stop it. Why do you say that?

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
They'll be on 2chan.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
I don't know what that is, but okay.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Well, 4chan started because of 2chan in Japan.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
Okay. I've never even been to 4chan, so...

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
Good riddance to Sony Home. I'm a Sony fanboy.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
I think that's safe to say by this point.

46:12.000 --> 46:18.000
And I think Home was a neat idea that did not turn out so great when they actually implemented it.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
So you admit that it was a neat idea.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
Yeah, but neat ideas don't always give good results to actual things.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
That was my whole thing.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
It'd be a neat idea to fly to the sun, because that's cool-sounding.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
But if you got there, you would die.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
Alright, look. I'm half with you, I'm half not.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Because I definitely see there's a lot of passionate people in the home.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
Because I remember we did some stuff in the early days of VOG that was a little more involved with Home.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
And we met a lot of very cool people who I assure you were not pedophiles.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Do you have proof?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
You're such an asshole.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Anyway...

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
That's a no.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Do you have proof?

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
I don't need it, because I'm the one that's making the claim.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
You have to defend that.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot this was the internet.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Oh, what a great...

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
What a little current events personified little exchange that was.

47:09.000 --> 47:14.000
Anyway, the thing about PlayStation Home, though, is obviously it had a very passionate community.

47:14.000 --> 47:21.000
And they were doing a lot of great things that really bent the limitations that Sony really had for Home.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
I'm not sure if the PlayStation 3 was the right console for Home.

47:25.000 --> 47:32.000
And I sort of... It's kind of too bad that because it probably didn't really get fleshed out on the PlayStation 3,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
that they're going to give it another go on the PlayStation 4.

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
Because I think with the background updating and the quicker turn on and launch times,

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
which is a huge thing, trust me, give it a 3,

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
I think PlayStation 4 actually could have been a lot better for Home.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
So I'm kind of sad to see it go.

47:48.000 --> 47:54.000
But I also kind of feel like Sony kind of had this one idea out there,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and then it really didn't end up doing anything.

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
Like, I remember I paid five bucks or whatever for a clubhouse for OLR,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
because I was like, oh, you know, I like to try to get on new technologies and new social media.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
And I thought, OK, PlayStation Home might be like this thing.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
So I got a clubhouse for it.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
And, you know, one of the things you can do in the clubhouse is you have this TV screen,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
but you can't do anything with it.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
And it's like, wouldn't it be great if I could put like a podcast up there

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
or even like a movie with still pictures

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
or something like they do in some of the theater rooms in Sony Home?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Like, it would be great.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Switch between different members playing a game.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Yeah, or something like that.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
Like, I really feel like I could have done more with that,

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
but I was too limited by Sony Home.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
And maybe they were just worried that if they made it too free for all,

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
people were just going to show boobs in their clubhouse and things like that,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
which, you know, whatever, maybe that's what they were worried of.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
But with some moderation or maybe some more partnerships with, you know,

48:51.000 --> 48:56.000
more indie content, I think it could have been like a really cool little thing.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
So I'm kind of sad to see it go.

48:58.000 --> 49:04.000
One thing that Home also did pretty well, I think, was some of the E3 conferences,

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
being able to kind of log in there and see the conferences in Home kind of worked out pretty well.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
But, you know, again, it's going in Japan.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
It's not going in the U.S., probably because it has had more popularity here in the U.S.

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
than it has had in Japan, but I imagine its days are sadly numbered here too.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
And this is going to be a matter of the PlayStation 3 phasing out in general

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
because Sony wants people to upgrade to the PlayStation 4, right?

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
So I'm sure that'll be a thing.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I don't know if they want that to happen

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
because they said they don't even know who's buying them.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
What do you mean? Who's buying what?

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
The PS4s. Did you not see that?

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Oh, yeah, something about they don't know who's buying them?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Yeah.

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
This is weird. Well, I somehow don't think it's PlayStation Home fans, necessarily,

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
who are buying it, so it's not going to affect me.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Pedophiles like white vans.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Oh, stop it. All right.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
Moving on. Shane, it's you.

49:54.000 --> 50:01.000
Okay, so like in MMOs, people buy and sell gold or currency all the time.

50:01.000 --> 50:09.000
Apparently, that's a thing in FIFA as well with the FIFA Ultimate Team thing in FIFA.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
I don't know what that is.

50:10.000 --> 50:17.000
But anyway, so EA is like, you guys can't do that anymore because that's cheating.

50:18.000 --> 50:24.000
So they initiated this penalty ban process.

50:24.000 --> 50:32.000
So if you are buying coins and promoting the purchase of these coins in FIFA Ultimate Team,

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
you have like a three-strike rule.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
Oh, I'm sorry. It's soccer, a three-card rule.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Well, a whistle and two cards.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
So the first offense...

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
A whistle and two cards?

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
That's the image. I'm looking right here.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
This guy's got a whistle and he's got a card and then he has two cards.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Anyway, so your first offense.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
If you are buying coins or promoting the purchase of coins,

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
you will get a warning email and an in-game message.

50:58.000 --> 51:05.000
If you do it again, your FIFA Ultimate Team Club will be reset

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
and your FIFA points will be returned to you, and that's a yellow card offense.

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
Your third offense, which is red, you get a permanent FIFA Online ban.

51:14.000 --> 51:21.000
However, if you are the one doing the selling or the farming of the coins to be sold,

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
you only get one chance and that chance is...

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
You go straight to red, it says, and once they find you doing that once,

51:29.000 --> 51:34.000
you are permanently banned online for all EA games, not just FIFA.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Good.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
I'm kind of glad they're doing this, though, because I seem to remember on the Xbox 360,

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
remember when we all got our accounts hacked?

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
Even though we were all pissed off that the PlayStation Network got breached,

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
everybody was actually losing money on the Xbox 360 hacks that we still, to this day,

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
don't really know how it was done, but they were doing FIFA stuff.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
It was all FIFA.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
It was all FIFA card trading and all this stuff, so I'm glad that...

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Let's see, what are we at here, like eight years later?

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
The EA is really...

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
That was not eight years ago.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
No, it was not eight years ago.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
Alright, gee, fair.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
It was probably more like...

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Three or four at the most.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
No, no.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
Because I remember when it was happening.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
No.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Because it happened to you.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
Because it was...

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
The 360 was out in 2006, right?

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Yeah, but it wasn't right then.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
More like 09.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Probably like 09.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Which would be like...

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Five years.

52:19.000 --> 52:25.000
But anyway, the specific timing of events aside, it's nice the EA is really putting

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
their foot down on this stuff and discouraging this behavior.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
And to be fair, they probably have done something similar in previous years,

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
but it's nice to see them step it up and get it out there.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
This is a no cheatin' zone.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
A no cheatin'...

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
A no sellin'.

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
They should send pictures of those cards and whistles to the...

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
They should.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
If the people are causing these offenses.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
They should actually have an animation where the, you know, thing...

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
If you get the whistle one, you should play a whistle sound as soon as you open your email about it.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Or play the whistle song.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
No one else found that funny.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
There's a DDR fan out there somewhere that understands the joke.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
All right.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Oh, oh.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
Alan says it was in 2011 because PSN was down for six weeks during Portal when Portal 2 came out.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
So I was right and you were wrong.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Yeah, but the 360 stuff happened before.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
You were wrong.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
No, it was during the same time.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
You're awful.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
All right.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Blame your boyfriend.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
Okay, wait.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
No, because I can prove this wrong.

53:27.000 --> 53:34.000
Because all that happened when I was living at the house and I moved into the apartment in 2010.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
So it was when I was in the house.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
It was 2009.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
I'm telling you.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
No, I have anecdotal evidence here.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I don't even care anymore.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
All right.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Moving on.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Apparently, you know who else doesn't care about things?

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Ubisoft doesn't care about the Wii U.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
All right, maybe I'm being a little bit harsh and sensationalist.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
No.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Here's the deal.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Here's the deal.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
That's true.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
They don't.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Ubisoft is officially stepping back development on Wii U.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I mean, this really isn't surprising information.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
This has kind of been something we've seen coming for a while.

54:01.000 --> 54:19.000
But this is based on some comments that happened at Gamescom where there was some discussion with the CEO where essentially, you know, they're happy that folks are upgrading to the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 real quick and that things are great for the PlayStation 3 and the 360.

54:19.000 --> 54:24.000
But when it comes to sales on the Wii and Wii U, it doesn't look so good.

54:24.000 --> 54:33.000
Nintendo Wii U sales represented only 3% of the total for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 2014.

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
To put that into perspective, Xbox 360 was 27%.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
PlayStation 3 was 25%.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
PlayStation 4 was 9%, so three times what Wii U was.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Xbox One was 6%.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
You want to hear one that's really scary, though?

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
The Vita was 1%.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Would they have out on Vita just an Assassin's Creed game?

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
I think that's it.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
So the fact that it was even 1% is amazing.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Right.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
So, anyway.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
I don't think you can get Just Dance on Vita.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Yeah.

55:03.000 --> 55:09.000
Well, and this is important to say is that Ubisoft is not abandoning Nintendo completely.

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
They're just not going to put out really mature games anymore.

55:14.000 --> 55:23.000
Just Dance will be a series that continues on Wii and Wii U because there's a more, I guess, family-friendly perception on the Wii.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
However, Ubisoft will bring Watch Dogs to Wii U.

55:27.000 --> 55:33.000
It will be the only mature game we publish on it, was the quote, even though they did Zombie U, so it won't be the only mature game.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Well, and they did Assassin's Creed's End, isn't it?

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
Yeah, it'll be the last, I guess, mature game that they do on it.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
There you go.

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
I'm surprised they're still even putting Watch Dogs out at this point.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
I am too, actually.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
They should really just cancel it.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
I gotta be honest.

55:50.000 --> 55:59.000
If Watch Dogs comes out on Wii U, it's not going to sell for the same reason that all these other ports of year-old games didn't sell on Wii U.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
The third parties, I kind of think, set the Wii U up to fail in that regard.

56:03.000 --> 56:10.000
I mean, I realize some of the ports may be really good versions and so forth, but it's just they're old games.

56:10.000 --> 56:19.000
People are not convinced to get a new system and buy these $60 ports of games most people have already played.

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
So I kind of agree that they ought to just cancel Watch Dogs on the Wii U.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
I mean, I know Nintendo fans are not going to be happy with me saying that, but I'm sorry.

56:27.000 --> 56:33.000
Nintendo fans, are you really waiting for Watch Dogs to come out, or is it just another game you want on the system just to have another game?

56:33.000 --> 56:38.000
Yeah, or do you really want Smash Brothers and all the other stuff we're all excited about on the Wii U?

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
Yeah, because when did they say Watch Dogs is coming out?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Next year, probably.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
No, they said next year now?

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
I don't know, when is it? I think before the end of the fiscal year, March 31st.

56:48.000 --> 56:55.000
Okay, yeah, at that point Smash Brothers will be out and nobody will be playing anything but Smash Brothers on there anyway, or Bayonetta.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
So then, just cancel it.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
So yeah, I'm still rooting for the Wii U.

57:02.000 --> 57:09.000
I really hope that it gets a lot of sales continuing through the holidays with Mario Kart and so forth, and some third-party companies will step up.

57:09.000 --> 57:16.000
But yeah, I think the types of games you're going to see companies putting on it are just, you're going to see less mature titles in general.

57:16.000 --> 57:23.000
Because Nintendo doesn't really do a lot of those, unless Bayonetta 2 does really well.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
But I'm not expecting it to do great.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
But I'm hoping it will at least be enough to be satisfactory. Let's hope.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura.

57:35.000 --> 57:42.000
Well, there has been a study that was released, and actually this news comes from PBS, which I thought was really interesting.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
I also do have to thank Ranma for the information.

57:46.000 --> 58:00.000
It says that video gamers are now, the highest percentage is adult female gamers outnumbering now teenage boys as the biggest gaming demographic.

58:00.000 --> 58:13.000
But mostly that has to do just with casual games, that women were more likely to play iOS games, or other smartphone games, or casual games.

58:13.000 --> 58:20.000
But that there are so much more of them than adolescent boys playing Call of Duty.

58:20.000 --> 58:29.000
Yeah, but wouldn't adolescence be under 18? So hopefully there's, that is an M-rated game, so I hope there's not a lot of them playing there.

58:29.000 --> 58:42.000
But I mean, it's demographic. There are more, now women playing, adult women playing games, broad statements to each, than boys under 18 playing games.

58:43.000 --> 58:54.000
So, that just goes back to, you know, if it had been 20 years ago, and everyone had a Super Nintendo, it could just play it on the side.

58:54.000 --> 59:01.000
They would all be playing Tetris. They would all be playing, you know, Actraiser or SimEarth.

59:01.000 --> 59:16.000
Let me ask a weird question though, because we know that the rise of women gamers to take over this demographic has to do with mobile gaming in large part.

59:16.000 --> 59:24.000
Mobile and Facebook gaming, right? But when we talk mobile gaming, we talk about things like Kim Kardashian Hollywood.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
It was mentioned in the article.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
It's not a terrible game.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I will play it.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Really?

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
It's got good music and it's not terrible.

59:33.000 --> 59:43.000
Rob, I'm the person who released a picture of the woman with her face photoshopped off that said publicity on it.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
I don't get it.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
It was an artistic statement, Rob.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
Oh, excuse me, I guess I missed it.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Because her whole thing is, you know, being all shallow and pretty and whatever it is that her family gets famous for, I have no idea.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
They're famous for being famous, just like Paris Hilton was.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So, I photoshopped off her face.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Even in history, there's been people like this, you know.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Wasn't Zsa Zsa Gabor kind of in that department originally too?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Was she more famous for being famous than anything else?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
There was her and Ava, both actresses.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And did stage, I thought.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Yeah, well, Paris Hilton was an actress too.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Yeah, but she was...

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I think it's a little bit different.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
The people who were famous for being famous would be like the socialite crowd, which there's always been that.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I mean, you had people in middling aristocracy who were famous for their reputation and that they showed up everywhere.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Rather than them actually having any sort of main claim to proper marriages or sleeping with people on the throne or anything like that.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I mean, if you want to look at it in a historical sense.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:00.000
People have been oddly obsessed with the people with money.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Which is stupid, but still.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Alright.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Well, let's travel around the world and check out release dates of some games coming out for boys and girls and men and women everywhere.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And I just realized that you probably don't have the US release dates, do you?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Sure don't. So nothing's coming out of the US this week, everybody.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I'll make stuff up.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
If we can do things out of order a little bit.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Dark Soccer, would you start with the UK releases?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And I'll get the US ones up here.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You know what? I'm totally not even ready for that.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Oh my gosh, you guys!

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You guys, I didn't do anything wrong.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
No, I have the dates for the week.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Because usually I look up the dates except that the site isn't loading.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Because your internet sucks.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I did notice that those dates weren't there like an hour ago.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I'm sorry, Rob. I have lag.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I have lag. Latency.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Alright, actually I've got it. I've got US releases. I'll take care of this for Shane.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Got it.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Okay, so US releases. Here we go.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Coming out on the 26th of August.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 on the PlayStation Vita.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Infamous First Light on the PlayStation 4.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Oh yeah, Infamous is coming out this week.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Metro Redo for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
The Walking Dead Season 2 Episode 5 hitting across the various consoles.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
The final episode.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
That's right.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And the big, big, big, big, big release this week.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Madden NFL 15 is out this week.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
No one cares.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Somebody cares. That's a huge selling game.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
No, no. Because I have friends that play Madden and they agree.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It is just the same game every year with a different number.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
But yet people still buy it.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Yeah, because they're dumb.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
But wouldn't...

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Because of football!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Wasn't DDR the same game with different songs?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Yeah.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And that was what made it great because of different songs.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Geez, Rob. Get it right.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
No, I'm not even going to defend it.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
It doesn't need anyone's defense. It's DDR.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
All right. All right. Going to Japan real quick.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I want to go to Japan.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Real quick.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
No, for a long time.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
On the PlayStation 4, Transformers Rise of the Dark Spark comes out in Japan this week.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I know. We are really excited about Transformers here.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
You know what? Real quick, quick, quick, quick pause.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Guardians of the Galaxy beat out Transformers.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
They actually went behind and then came back and beat out Transformers for top grossing summer meeting.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Have you seen that yet?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Yes, I have and it was awesome.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Except for the end-end.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
The end-end was great.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Oh my god, it's the worst part of the movie.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Back to Japan. The PlayStation 3 is very busy this week on August 28th.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Callidurius Blaze, I totally mispronounced that I'm sure, comes out on the 28th of August.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen in a special packaging is out this week as well as Grid Autosport.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
My favorite game title, Muv Luv.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Photon Melodies is out this week in regular and limited edition.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Persona 4, the Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
What the hell is that? Do you know about that?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
You're a Persona fan, right Shane?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
What?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
What is Persona 4, the Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It's the fighting game, the updated version of it.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I have it on PS3, the first one.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Gotcha.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It's fun.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Sacred 3, out in Japan this week, as well as Super Robot Taisen Oji Saga Maso Kishin F-Coffin of the End.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
There's another Robot Wars game.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
When isn't there a Robot Wars game?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And Transformers Rise of the Dark Spark on PlayStation 3 as well.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
On the Wii U...

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Nothing.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
On the Vita, believe it or not, quite a bit.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
There's like a ton of shit on the Vita this week.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Japan likes the Vita.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Japan loves the Vita.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
The Vita's great. Japanese people got it right.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
You can play Cho-Jigen Action Neptune U, regular limited edition.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Kiss Bell, regular limited edition.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Three different volumes of Love Live School Idol Paradise.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
There's three different volumes.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
So, if you are into your idol games.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Um...

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Meccu Cross Blood Infinity Ultimate.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Renai Zero Kilometer V.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Rewrite.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And Tokaidin Kiwami come out in regular and what they call a treasure box this week.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Good lord, that's a lot of stuff on the PlayStation Vita.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Quickly checking the 3DS to see if maybe there's a little competition in the handheld world.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Just one game.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Metarot 8 in Kabuto and Kawagata versions coming out this week.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Which looks like it's basically probably robot Pokemon.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
That's kind of what it is.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
So, there you go.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Do you play Pokemon knock off games too, Shane?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
No.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Or do you only play the main series?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I'll only play Pokemon.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I played the Digimon card game for a while on the Wonderswan.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Did you?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
That was pretty fun.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Shane, you're not into Digimon either?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Nope.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Digimon is better than anything.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
At least the anime was.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Dark Soccer, how about the UK?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Yeah, I guess.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Now that I've had time to prepare.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
On the 28th, the Steamworld Dig for Wii U.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And then on the 29th, there's a bunch of Madden crap.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And then Metro Redux.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And that's it.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And then the classic game of the week.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And it's an awesome game.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And I know how to annoy my husband playing it.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
According to the chat room, the comment JP was talking about,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Yo-kai Watch.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I believe that's like a Pokemon ripoff, kind of.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I will play that.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
It does pique my interest.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
It's huge over there too.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
They said it's coming out over here in 2015.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Yeah.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So I will play that.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I will play that too.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I'll have Shane decide if I should play it or not.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Shane, decide for him to play it please.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Well, we'll see.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
We'll see.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I'll probably do it though.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
You should probably convince me to finish playing Pokemon X.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Finish playing Pokemon X?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
That's adorable.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
There's still so many more gems to go.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
What is Jamie missing by not playing Pokemon X?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Adorable Pokemon.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I don't know.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I get tired of that rabbit one keep showing up.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I love the stupid Bunnelby.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
He's adorable.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I'm like, God damn it.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I don't want a Bunnelby.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
No, you do.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000
You should have heard the disgusting things he was saying about getting a shiny Bumblebee

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
or whatever they're called.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Bunnelby.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I want a houndoom.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I wasn't the one saying it.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Somebody else did.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I'll play if you give me a houndoom.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
You want a houndoom?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I'll give you a houndoom.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Fine.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I'll play my game.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Okay.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
We'll do it.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Fine.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
What the fuck is happening?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
This is why Shane and I don't have a podcast.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
We did a pilot once.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Yeah right.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Whatever happened to that show?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Whatever happened to that show?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Nothing's happening in Mass Effect, so it doesn't even matter.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
When Mass Effect 4 comes out, we'll do our podcast.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Mass Effect 4?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Because we don't know.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Mass Effect whatever the fuck it is edition.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Shane, put down Pokemon because you got a story to read.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000
He's like reluctantly and I'm getting pouty face as he's slowly putting the DS down.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Like I just ruined his entire fucking day.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I am trying to...

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
It's like you just stabbed his Bunnelby in the face.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Don't stab my Bunnelby.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I don't want to stab your Bunnelby.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Oh, the gross one?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Yeah.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Somebody did stab that Bunnelby with something else.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So video gaming.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Sure.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
So Final Fantasy Explorers is this Final Fantasy game that looks a lot like Phantasy Star Online to me.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
And it's got a release date in Japan now.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
It's December 18th.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Okay, back to Pokemon.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Wait.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
No, no.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
As a Final Fantasy fan, because you are, you play a lot of...

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
You know what?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I can't even really say I'm a Final Fantasy fan.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Like I don't think I am.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Really?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Yeah.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
As much as you play 11 and 14 and bully your friends into playing them.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Yeah, okay.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000
But if I like count the number of Final Fantasy games that I have either beaten or cared about

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
versus the amount of games that have come out, I don't think I could consider myself a fan.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
But are you excited about this one because it's like Monster Hunter?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
No, because I say it's like PSO because I don't care about Monster Hunter.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
But I do care about PSO.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I want to check it out very badly because I love PSO.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I'm playing Destiny because it's like PSO.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Yeah, I want to play that because it's like PSO too.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
What's exciting is that I go to Atlanta on Wednesday, right?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And I get back on like Monday and we're only going to be like a week away from Destiny at that point.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Super excited.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Seattle says that I'm a terrible person.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I know.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
We all know that.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
That's probably true.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Why am I a terrible person, Seattle?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
That's why we love you, Shane.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Because you're terrible.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Also, you forgot the Professor Layton versus Phoenix Wright game coming out next week, I guess.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I forgot about it too because, honestly, I don't care anymore.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I forgot about it on purpose.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It came out so long ago in every other territory, so I'm over it.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Captain Spike, our pal from gamebuoy.org, says,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I'll be importing that Final Fantasy X Monster Hunter heart.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Now here's the thing, and Captain Spike I know disagrees with me quite strongly on this,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
but I really tried that Monster Hunter demo on Wii U.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I did too.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
It was so awful.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
It was garbage.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
It was awful.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And, you know, I've tried it on PSP now.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I've tried it on Wii U.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
It was worse than Ni No Kuni's demo.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Oh, and that was a bad demo.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
That was a bad demo.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
For a bad game.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
No, it wasn't a bad game at all.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
It was a really bad game.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
But here's the thing.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I ended up really liking Ni No Kuni, right?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Even though the demo was awful.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
It had a good combat system.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
It's like Final Fantasy XII.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Great combat system.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Ni No Kuni was kind of Pokemon-y.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I said the combat system was good, but the game was awful.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
But I guess I just need to try the full Monster Hunter.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I don't know.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Captain Spike, you're going to need to bring your copy of Monster Hunter up here and give

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000
it a good old try to get me to find the love for this series, I guess.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I finally have to update Pokemans, by the way, because I didn't actually have the patch installed.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Oops.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Jamie, I'm going to give you a Houndour that you evolve into Houndoom.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Okay.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And Captain Spike says it demos awfully, especially the way they put the demos together.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
The real games are awesome.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I wonder if I could find the Wii U game for like 20 bucks now.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Like, I'm sure it's got to be in clearance bins everywhere.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Maybe.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
We'll see.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Anyhow, moving on to one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And this is a follow-up to something we had started with last week.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And it's the latest Twitch phenomenon.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Well, we had Twitch plays Pokemon, and then we had, you know, all this other crazy stuff.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And then we had fish that were playing Pokemon.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
And I believe Loki on this very show said last week, they ought to be playing fighting

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
games, and the two fish can fight each other and beat each other up.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Well, sure enough.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And I'm sure they didn't get the idea from this show, but we like to think they did.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000
There are two fish, Aquarius and Robert the Bruce, are playing in a tank, playing Street

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Fighter II Turbo.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And what happens is that the tank, basically in the nine sections, they have the tank split

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
into nine sections.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
They each correspond to a different button on the controller for whatever the emulator

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
or whatever it is they're running.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
So, as the fish swims around the tank, it controls their movements.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
So, there you go.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And yeah, you can watch the fish battle each other in Street Fighter II Turbo.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.000
And it's kind of, you're literally watching people button mash for an entire tournament.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
People are really into it.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
There's talk of betting.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I do that when I watch people do that playing Tekken.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
One of the fish got sponsored.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Yeah.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
But are they fish?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Are they fish playing Tekken?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Probably have the attention span of fish.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Jamie, would you like a male or female Houndour?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I think I would like a female, because I'm into the bitches.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Well, maybe if you guys could put your Pokemon down for like two seconds.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
You know, remember a day when you couldn't trade anything from one game to another?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Because you had your save file on your cartridge and that was it.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
We're going to take a step back into gaming's history.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
And Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
hey, you kids should be playing this game this week.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
The classic game of the week is X-Men Children of the Atom.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Because I'm going back to my theme of doing CPS2 games by Capcom.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
So X-Men Children of the Atom is a fighting game that stars the X-Men and the bad guys

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and the X-Men.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
So the plot for it is based off the Fatal Attraction storyline.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And it's really the X-Men, like the Jim Lee era X-Men versus Magneto, Juggernaut,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Omega Red, Silver Samurai.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
So yeah.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And Rama brings up Rod Caliber.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Rod Caliber was awesome and everyone should try it at least once.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
But basically those are some of the other characters in the game.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
In fact, I will go through the full roster.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000
You have Colossus, Cyclops, Iceman, Psylocke, Storm, and Wolverine.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
The bad guys were Omega Red, Sentinel, Silver Samurai, Spiral, Juggernaut, and Magneto.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So I've recently remembered everyone except for Spiral, who is who I used a lot of times in the game.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
This came out in December 1994.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
There was a CD out for it everywhere.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And the Saturn version was the best version.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:24.000
The Saturn one allows you to actually play as the Juggernaut in two player versus mode with a cheat code.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And the Playstation 1 was kind of crap because it didn't have nearly the memory

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000
because the Saturn one used the 4-meg RAM cartridge.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It was pretty much arcade perfect.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It only missed a few frames.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
But I mean, yeah, it's just standard fighting game fare.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It's, you know, Capcom 90s fighting game.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000
But it was one of the best ones in a franchise that definitely lent itself very well to fighting games.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.000
And I know I've already brought up the X-Men game that Konami did, which was a side-scrolling beat-em-up.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It was about time we had a fighting game.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
And of course, after that, Brit spawned one of my favorite, which was X-Men versus Street Fighter,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000
which I think I've brought up before, which means the almighty team of Cammy and Gambit, which my husband hates.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
So that's it.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
X-Men Children of the Atom on the CPS2 system.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Or the Sega Saturn.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
I like to play Storm in this and just throw tornadoes over and over and over again.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
It was a lot of fun.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Titan! Titan!

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I played Psylocke a whole lot. I was also really good with Wolverine.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Got your Pokemon for you.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
X-Men Children of the Atom.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yet another game in Capcom's CPS2 arcade series.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I'm still waiting for my Quiz and Dragons, but that's all right.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
That was a pretty good choice, I suppose.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
What's a Quiz and Dragon?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I'm not even going to try to explain.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Was it a Capcom fighting game?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
No, you had to battle wits.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
No, it wasn't a fighting game.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
So it was a school thing.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
No, it wasn't really a school thing. Forget it.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Shane, I think it's too intellectual for you.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I think it's the problem.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
All right, anyhow, we're going to take a break, guys.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge ready to come, including rapid-fire news, the FUGO Question of the Week,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
your phone calls at 1877-GAMO-LR, our mailbag, which we have a lot of mail tonight,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
and more when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, August 24th, 2014,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
with the 565th episode of our show already in progress.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Loki not here tonight, but Shane is filling in tonight, and at the beginning of the show, Shane was super tired,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
but then suddenly Jamie was like, let's trade Pokémon, and now Shane's like, yay!

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I can't be awake for that. It's important.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I've been naming all of these Pokémon, like Butt This, and this one I'm going to name Farquaad.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You guys are so mature. I love it.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I'm a grown-up.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Anyway, I know we can't play the music for the podcast folks, but for those of you that are listening on the podcast feed,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
we did some break music there tonight.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000
We did a song from Parappa the Rappa, the last stage where they're kind of doing their big concert,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
and Shane and Jamie were both singing along, which was kind of adorable.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
It's a great song.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I haven't played that game in forever. I really need to go back.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I have Umjama Lamy as a PS1 classic, but I don't know if I ever bought Parappa the Rappa.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I like Lamy better.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
I could let you borrow my copy of Parappa.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Well, I think I have Parappa on disc in one of these mini boxes that's still unpacked because LOL moving.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I actually have the PSP version.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
You can't play PS1 games on a PS4.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Remember, it doesn't have that backwards compatibility anymore, but I guess I can play it on PlayStation 3.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I still have that hooked up.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Alright, Shane, we can trade.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Oh my god.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Also, during the break tonight, we had a song from Katamari Damacy, which is...

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Not the best song that you could have picked, but...

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
She picked it.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I picked it because it's one of my favorites.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
It's a good one. There's one that's better.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I like Wanda Wanda.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I like that one.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I like Wanda from DDR.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I like Katamari Mino.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I will always still love Katamari on the Rocks.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I mean, that's the one that everybody's...

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000
But I really, really like Kei Sera Sera, just because it makes me think of the old crooners.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I think that's my second or third favorite song on there.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I'm really ready for the return of Katamari Damacy.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I know they did the Vita game just a couple years ago, but I'm ready for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Katamari.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Like, a new game. I don't know. I miss those games. They were really fun.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I mean, well, some of them got a little old, I guess.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Maybe that's why they've put the series on hibernation for a while.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But I think I'm ready for a new game.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Maybe it would be a good download title. I don't know.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Would you guys be in for a new Katamari game if they decided to put one out?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Maybe. I think the last few were kind of terrible.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
You know what I think was really part of the charm about Katamari Damacy, and really the key thing,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
was that the reason why the game did so damn well is that when it first came out on PlayStation 2, it was a $20 game.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Like, Namco was experimenting, I think, with this budget series, because there was a music game that was out at the same time as well that was $20 that people didn't talk about as much.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
But I remember there was that one, too, because it had some of the BeatMania 2DX people that were in it randomly.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I can't remember the name of it. Somebody in chat will probably remember, though.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
It was called NotBeatMania.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000
It didn't look anything like it. It was like a big circle. I can't remember.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
A big circle?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Do you remember Garrett? He really liked that game. Oh well, forget it.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Anyway.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I'm getting there.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Oh my god, you guys are like, consumed with your trading.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
It says you're not available, Shane.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I just hit it.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Let's see. But anyway, the thing was that those were budget games. They were like $20 games.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And then when the sequels came out, it was like $40, $50.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
It was like, I don't know, something about paying that budget price for such an awesome little game felt really, really awesome.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
So anyway.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Technic Beat, says Dark Tetsuya. That sounds right, but I might be wrong.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And you might be wrong. I don't know.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And yeah, Dark Tetsuya says it was Sampling Masters Mega. Yeah, that's it.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I don't think I ever played that.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
It was Technic Beat. That was it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Alright. Okay, going to some of the other comments in our chat room.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Fifth Dream says, I'm so fucking wishing for a return of Vib Ribbon. Okay.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
No, because that's the one thing Sony did wrong was tease us this year.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Yeah, when they pulled that shit at E3, where they showed Vib Ribbon, I was like, oh my god, they're gonna bring back Vib Ribbon!

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And then they were like, hey, remember Vib Ribbon?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Here's something else.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
It didn't come out in America.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
It didn't come out in America.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
You son of a bitch.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And they used Vib Ribbon, I think, if I remember right, to segue into Dead Island.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Yeah, what the?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
They used a game that didn't come out in the US.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
So annoying.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So annoying. You know what, Sony, however, Sony could, could still right this wrong.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I'm just saying.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:15.000
They could, they could put it on their little streaming service or something when they, but then again, you wouldn't be able to use your own music, so it probably wouldn't be as cool.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Alright.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Oh my god, Asha, that's adorable.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Right? That's why I make a million of them.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And I even think the clowns are disgusting, so this is awesome.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000
You guys, I need help. If you want this to devolve into Pokemon chat, then, you know, say so in chat.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
But if you want them to stay on task, then you need to yell.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
That is the only task that happens.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Yell at them in chat. Alright.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Let's get to some rapid fire news, though. We gotta try and keep things moving.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
So Shane, what do you have for us?

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I'll just do this really quick thing, because it's rapid fire, and I don't know how this is supposed to go anyway.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:51.000
So, there's a guy that was a fan of Metal Gear that was remaking the entire game, like a, like a redo or a reimagining or whatever.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And Konami was kinda like, okay, that's fine, whatever. And now they're like, nope.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Psych.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
There's that story.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I think it was more than one guy, just so you know, because there were like people-

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Well, when they say fan remake, I'm just gonna make it singular.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
People in the industry were like actually helping with that.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And I think David Hayter, it said, was a part of it, but whatever.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Next story. Some dude named Joshua Rubin, used to work for Bungie, was working on Destiny, he was part of the creative team there.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
But now he's jumped over to Telltale to work on the Game of Thrones game.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And he also-

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
You're a Game of Thrones fan, are you looking forward to that?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I don't know, because I'm not a huge fan of Telltale games.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Why not?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Like, at all. I don't think- I think their games are-

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I thought you liked The Walking Dead.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I can't even really play it, because it's scary, because it's zombies.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.000
But, no, every time I play their games, they look really buggy, and I'm not a fan of their art styles, ever.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000
And he used to work for EA as the lead writer, and Capcom.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Okay, next story.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
How many of these do I have? Because I'm just closing windows as I go.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
The people that make You Don't Know Jack, they have-

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
No, no, no, no, no, the Final Fantasy XIV is your last one.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
What? Then why is this out of order?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
It's not out of order.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Well, on my thing, it's out of order, because that's where I clicked.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Man, this should be a bigger story.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Hold on, it's not working. Okay.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Final Fantasy, you linked me to the European version.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
What is your problem? This is probably not even accurate, because of that.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I think Shane should be on the show all the time.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Because, like, critical of what Rob does.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Because it's funny.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
This is my last Orange Launch Radio, everybody. It's been a pleasure.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Last week on Hoard House, he killed me.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Because you yelled, you ran into the room, and you threw ice on my head,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
and Grandpa yelled, Ice Bucket Challenge.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Which had nothing to do with the charity itself.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
First of all, I didn't run in here. I snuck in quietly, because you didn't know I was here.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
And I dropped an ice cube on your head, because somebody asked me to do it.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I was just being nice.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Anyway, Final Fantasy XIV, they're doing their one year anniversary celebration right now.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And from August 22nd to September 1st, people that have previously played this game,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
and no longer are active, or subscribed, can hop right back in and play.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
So, there's that.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Hooray, I thought there was something else you wanted to say on Final Fantasy XIV,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
with the anniversary celebration, like the stream or something.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Yeah, they did like a 14 hour stream. I had to sleep for most of it.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
It looked interesting. They did some atma farming.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
They got all of their atmas within 14 hours.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I was like, you guys know how to do it.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Well, what was the technique they used? People need to copy it.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I don't think anybody knows.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Nobody caught it, huh?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Nope.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
So, that's my story.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Alright, moving on. Team Meat, of course you know from the creators of Super Meat Boy,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
and they did the Tales of Isaac, was the other game too?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
You mean The Binding of Isaac?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Thank you, The Binding of Isaac, sorry.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I remember it looked Zelda-esque, but it played more like a twin-stick shooter, kind of.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
It played more like scary.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Yeah, it was kind of creepy, but it was cool.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Anyway, they have a new game on their way out.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
It's called Avoyar for September.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
But we don't know much more outside of a very artsy kind of trailer that came out.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It just had some live action in it and sad music as well.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
However, more information will be coming out at PAX Prime at the Indie Mega Boost.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
So, yet again, here's something else to look forward to at PAX Prime.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Team Meat will be showing Avoyar for September.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Some people have noted that Avoyar for September is an anagram of Super Meat Boy Forever.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Hmm.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Anyway, on Twitter, interesting tweet.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Looks like there'll be no Sims 4 reviews until after it's out.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000
EA tells me no one's getting access ahead of release. I'm nervous.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
That's probably because of the SimCity Online fiasco.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Do you think that could be it?

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
I bet it has persistent online connection needed.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
They don't want that to get out?

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Yeah, because the reviews for SimCity were fairly positive up until they had all those problems.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So this would just be part two of that.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Just so you know, that tweet came from Dan Stapleton, who's one of the IGN reviewer guys.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000
So, I mean, if they're not getting a copy of it, probably nobody is getting a copy of that.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Does that make you nervous, Dark Soccer? Because you're a Sims fan.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I mean, I don't know anybody more into that series than you, even though you kind of fell out.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I'm on team not give a shit anymore.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Really?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I have Sims 2 and I got it for free.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
And I have all of my dirty things, my weird animations in Sims 2 again.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Well.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Except I haven't touched it in three weeks.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Do you have the patch that unblurs the nudity?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Well, everyone has that. That's the first thing that people do.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Pervert.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
No, because they're all like freaking Barbie dolls.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.000
No, I have, um, there's a site that I go to called Mod The Sims.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And they have a sister site called Sexy Sims.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Which is like, you can get like fetish gear and dirty shit. So it's kind of funny.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Ooh, you nasty. All right.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I just think it's funny having them go to work wearing, you know, a strap-on on their chest.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
It's hilarious.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
You all try that tomorrow and see what kind of response I get.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Your job is hunting down the supernatural.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Look, you've got a cock on your chest.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
It's funny.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Oh, my God. What the hell? You're giving me an Evangelion.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000
All right. Anyway, one more story here about the free-to-play game Path of Exile.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Path of Exile has a new expansion coming.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And this is following the Sacrifice of the Vaal expansion that the game got in March.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Path of Exile is getting Forsaken Masters as the new free expansion coming out for this game.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:05.000
So Path of Exile, kind of noted because it's a Diablo alternative of sorts because it's free.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
It has a lot of similarities with Diablo.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Although Path of Exile, you know, the classes are a little different.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And the skill tree is, holy shit, different.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Like, the skill tree is crazy.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I could never figure out how to build a decent character in that game.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
That was kind of tricky.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Does this new expansion bring fun?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I thought it was great.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I don't know why you didn't like Path of Exile.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I thought it was actually really well done.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
In fact, it's one of those games I really need to go back and play more of.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.000
It was one of those few free-to-play games I felt inclined to give money to because I enjoyed it that much,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
especially when they were in the early demo phases of that game.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Some of the stuff that's coming with that, they say it's Train with the Masters,

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
something that you do missions for the Masters to get reputations.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
There's lots of mission variations with that.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
You're going to have a hideout, which sounds like their own kind of version of player housing in a way,

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
so you'll be able to customize the hideout in there.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
You'll also have crafting ventures that are upgradeable.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
What?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Pokemon in the next game coming out.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000
New items and mods, new support and skill gems, new challenge leagues,

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000
including Rampage, Beyond Challenge League, and an updated passive skill tree.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Lots and lots of stuff.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And I guess they're revamping some of the existing boss fights in Path of Exile as well,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
so they're more intense and surprising, they say.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000
That is all coming on August 20th, and that will be released at 3 p.m. Pacific time.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
If you are a fan of Path of Exile, I'm sure you already have that on your calendar.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Actually, August 20th already happened, so it just came out.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I need to check this out. I'm a little behind.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
So, very cool. Congrats to them on that release.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Dark Sakura.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
If you're a little behind, does it make you a bit of an ass?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
So, Dead Rising movie has a director now.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:58.000
It's Zach Lepofsky, who is going to be doing basically the Dead Rising movie, as they've said.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I don't even know about a Dead Rising movie right now, to be honest, because I'm like, whatever.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:10.000
But anyway, he's said that he's in the director's chair, and he's doing most of the work for the movies so far,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
although so far he has only done TV movies to date, and his most notable credit is Leprechaun Origins,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
so yeah, I'm just going to forget that this exists.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:28.000
And then, there is a game I'm excited about. Excited!

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And it's Puyo Puyo Tetris. It's going to be on Xbox One and PS4, which I don't have, so I'm going to have to get one.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:44.000
But it'll be... this is also the first time there is a Puyo Puyo game on a Microsoft system, so yay!

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
You need to hold something of Dan's ransom until he decides it's a good idea for the household.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Oh, we're probably going to get one anyway.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Hooray!

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Are you going to get it before Dragon Age?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I'm playing Dragon Age on PC.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Oh.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Because mods? Hello, high-res mods.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Why do you think my Shepard looks so gorgeous?

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
She makes a fair point. I don't say that much about her.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
And then, this is something... hey, girl.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:16.000
So I brought this up before about them discussing the pinball ban in Oakland, California, and it's finally been lifted.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:23.000
It is no longer considered a form of... wait, yeah. It's no longer considered a form of gambling,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:33.000
so now they're actually going to be having a thing with RadioShack Stern Pinball and the International Flipper Pinball Association

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:42.000
to have a month-long tournament at the 3040 East 9th Street location of RadioShack in Oakland,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
which probably is the only way RadioShack's going to get any business.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Doesn't say, wow, a reason to go to RadioShack.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I know, right? BRB going to Oakland.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000
We'll have to send... you know, we'll have to send our man on the street in Oakland.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Extefer would be the perfect person to cover this.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Hey, guys! I'm at RadioShack!

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
And not a bleached asshole inside.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Except maybe his.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Hey, you guys! I'm at RadioShack and I'm going to play with some balls!

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
That's your Christopher impression.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
That's my Christopher impression.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I'm going to have to have him listen to this.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Rob used pester voice. It's super annoying.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Alright, let's go to the FUGL question of the week, you guys.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Alright, every week you guys answer our question over on our Facebook community and our Google Plus community.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
You slam Facebook and Google Plus together and you get FUGL.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
So here it is. Thank you, DarkTetsuya.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
DarkTetsuya says, Rob does a pretty good Extefer.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
And CaptainSpike says, why do you make Extefer sound like Alaska Thunderfucker?

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
That was nothing like my Alaska impersonation.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
My Alaska impersonation is... never mind. I'm not going to do my Alaska impersonation.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Alright. Hi!

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
On Facebook, one game...

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
That just is your normal way you say hi to everybody.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
It kind of is. Alright.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.000
One game we've talked about before a lot on the show is Paths of Exile, which gets us thinking about free-to-play games.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Do you play any free-to-play games? Be honest, are they really free?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Or have you found yourself sinking a bit of money into it?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Or do you think free-to-play games will never be as good as the quote-unquote standard purchase-to-play games that are available?

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Not a lot of answers tonight. I think Facebook is blocking us.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Because you know how you have to like, you know, pay to get your post noticed on Facebook.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000
So I would encourage you guys, if you want to answer the question, you don't see it coming up on your feed.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
You have to pay the lube.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Go to Facebook.com slash OrangeLunchRadio and look at it there.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Alright, anyway.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
We got some answers about the free-to-play games.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Tech2030 says, I used to play Clash of Clans.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:01.000
But the longer you play, the longer the wait times get so long you're either forced to quit or pay up.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I chose the former.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
William Murderface.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Friendliest. Our friendliest.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
It comes from Metalocalypse.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Oh, does it?

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Yeah. He's the guy with the bushy hair and the thick mustache.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I just thought it was a friendly name.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Alright. William Murderface says, I've played Rift and I play Smite, Marvel Heroes, and Swator.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I think that with the exception of Swator, I've never felt the need to invest into a free-to-play game in order to enjoy its content.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
That being said, I will probably spend money in Smite and Marvel Heroes, likely for skins.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
This is not something I normally pay money for, but I feel that those two games are a lot of fun,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
and I wish to support the developers' decision to employ well-designed free-to-play models.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And RedTheHaze says, I play two free-to-play games and they are Destiny of Spirits on Vita and School Idol Festival on mobile.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I don't see my...

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
God, I tried that because I think Rama suggests that one.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I don't see myself ever putting money into these since they are pretty generous with even the paid in-game currency.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I think certain free-to-play games can be good as standard games as long as they were built to be fair and not give advantages to paying players,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000
unless it's a co-op-only game like Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Let's see, we just had one more answer come in, so I'll read that too, from Kieran M.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Hope I said that right, sorry if I didn't.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Replied and said, I play Marvel Heroes. I put way too much money in it, but it is a lot of fun and I feel like I get my money's worth.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Marvel Heroes was pretty good, speaking of like Diablo-esque kind of games, I did enjoy Marvel Heroes as well.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Let's go over to Google Plus and get some of the answers over there, of which we have two.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000
And starting with ActDeft who says, I play Team Fortress 2 on a regular basis.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Granted, I paid for that game back in 2008 or 2009, but still.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And yeah, I've sunk some money into opening some of those crates, they give us drops, but I only do it when I have extra money.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I have also sunk some money into some mobile free-to-play games, but never again.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:04.000
And lastly, Rettertainment says, right now I'm playing WWE Supercard, a collectible card game where you can spend real money to get cards for use in the game.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I'm not currently motivated to spend any money on this game, but if I lose again to Zack Ryder, I just might.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
So there's some of our answers.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I am really surprised that nobody named League of Legends, which is kind of like the Queen Bee of all the free-to-play games right now.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
You go to Twitch, it's always the number one thing being streamed.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I'm planning on starting that up, actually.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.000
It's interesting. I think if you want to get into a MOBA and you've never played one before, I don't know if you've played one before or not,

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I think Heroes of the Storm is the easiest one to learn, Blizzards, but you also have to be in their super special secret club to get it.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I believe Renee DNL told you to refresh Google+.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Oh, did I miss an answer?

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Probably hers if she's telling you to refresh it.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I'm sorry! I literally just pulled it up.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I gave all my League of Legends swag that I got at GamerX to my friend, who plays a whole lot more than I do.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Oh, there it is. DNL replied and said,

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I play free-to-play and started with Gunbound back in 2004.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I think the difference between mobile and PC free-to-plays do make a huge difference as far as how much developers feel they should make on a full-fledged game.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Would love to talk more on Aris. I've been in the industry for five plus years.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I would love to hear. I just love Renee in general and I hope she calls in later in the show.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
We would love to hear from her.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
So, what was I going to say on free-to-play?

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
So, what free-to-play games do you guys play, if any?

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I used to play Ragnarok Online. A whole bunch.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Was that free?

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
It was when I was in the beta, then it went to pay, and then I actually paid for it.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I thought it was a pay game. Okay.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Well, the original is still a pay.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
R02 is free-to-play, which I'll play sometimes.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I played Star Trek Online when I was already paying for a subscription, and then I played in the free-to-play era off and on.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:03.000
And I didn't get into Guild Wars too much. A copy was gifted to me and I didn't really play it.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:14.000
So, yeah. I mean, I played that Sims game on Facebook for a while, and then I got into my anti-all-Facebook-games phase.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Shane, is there any free-to-play games you enjoy?

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
On my phone, I spent a lot of money on DJ Max.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Oh, yeah.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Lots.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I forgot that was free-to-play.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Yep. And the Record Runner game, I haven't paid any money for it, but I play it a lot.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Oh, yeah. The harmonics one, right?

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Mm-hmm.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Yeah.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000
And the other DJ Max game, but I didn't put any money into that one either.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So, lots of music games.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Yeah. Lots of music games.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Do you play U-Beat and Reflect Beat and all that stuff too?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Yeah, I have it on there. I have... No, I think I purchased something for Reflect Beat.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
U-Beat is not very fun on the iPhone.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It is fun on the arcade now that I've played it.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:01.000
But, no, pretty much just DJ Max, I think, is the only thing I've ever put money into that's free-to-play.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
So, here's the thing.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I think my gamer ADD, where I just go from one game to another without ever beating the game or whatever, unless it's an MMO,

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I think that kind of stops me from really getting immersed in these free-to-play games,

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:24.000
especially like one of our Facebook answers said, to the point where you either have to kind of pay money or, you know, you have to wait forever to do things.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I did play the Dragon Age game on Facebook when it was around.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
That was a free-to-play that had pay options too, which I always did.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Whatever you rudely interrupt all the time.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I was...

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Interrupt.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:45.000
I've been enjoying lately, like, I played Marvel Puzzle Quest, but then I just kind of stopped, and I don't know why.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Like, I enjoyed the game, but then I was like, ooh, something else to play.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Now I started playing Neverwinter, which I touched for like five minutes, you know, just a hot minute, like a while ago,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000
but now, like, I went back to it because I had some friends that were playing it and were like, you've got to go check it out.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And now I've been playing that, like, a lot.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
So that's kind of like my free-to-play game at the moment.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
But then I'm like, ooh, Path of Exile got an expansion.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I've got to go check that out too.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
That's a free-to-play game as well.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
So, that's my problem with free-to-play games.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I only have time for one.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:21.000
You know a random, like, music game that just popped in my head that I would have paid lots of money to do if it was a free-to-play game?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Mm.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Because it never came out?

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Mm-hmm.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000
X-Tango.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I don't know why that even came into my head.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
X-Tango was great.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
It was such a good game.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Yeah.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
All right, good stuff, good stuff.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Let's see, Game Geeks in Chat says, I miss SimSocial on Facebook.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
That's what reminded me of the Dragon Age one.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
They actually, yeah, closed that one, huh?

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Let's see, Hitstun says, whoa, I didn't know DJMax Technical was on Android getting that now.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
So, there you go.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
All right, let's move on to some more news.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Shane.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Okay, let me pull this up.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:04.000
So, the people that make You Don't Know Jack have a new game on Xbox One right now called Fibbage.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:13.000
To me, it looks like Balderdash, the game where you make up definitions for things except kind of in reverse.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:21.000
No, I guess it would, yeah, it'd be in reverse because they give you the definition and you come up with what you're trying to define.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
I'm tired.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Anyway.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
They give you the meaning, you give them the word?

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Yes.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000
It's hosted by Cookie Masterson who does the classic You Don't Know Jack games.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Apparently, you can play up to eight players and it is coming out on PS4 this September as well and PS3 for cross-compatibility.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
It's going to be seven bucks on Xbox One.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I assume it'll be the same on PS4 and PS3.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I love You Don't Know Jack so I actually am very excited about this.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:06.000
It could be the next UNO game for Xbox Live because UNO got a lot of play back in the day.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
It sure did.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Except this is funny.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I loved the You Don't Know Jack reboot they did.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I hope that isn't the only thing we're ever going to get out of that kind of reboot of that.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
That's a free-to-play game I do too.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Oh yeah, because it was on Facebook, right?

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
It's also on iPhone.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Oh, is it?

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Yeah, I have it on my phone.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Do they update it with new episodes?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I don't know if they do anymore.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Let's move on.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I got some news regarding Smash Brothers.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Why is there a gap between the Wii U version and the 3DS version?

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:46.000
This was explained by Mashihiro Sakurai in his weekly column this week.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Basically, it's because of the debug period in testing for bugs.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:58.000
What they're doing is by delaying the Wii U version, they can shift the debugging periods and get the 3DS version out the gate at first.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
So, quote, checking is done both domestically and overseas.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000
So for a game like Smash Brothers, several hundred people are employed.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
So debugging alone becomes a huge project.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.000
So much so that one of the biggest reasons for the separate release dates for 3DS and Wii U was so that we could shift the debugging periods.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:21.000
In a previous Smash Brothers, we found a bug during the debugging process where if Fighter A hits item B and Fighter C and D are simultaneously affected, the game would freeze.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Considering not only the different fighters, but item stages, color settings, play rules, and game modes, the number of varying combinations are astronomical.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.000
In order to properly debug, every pattern must be tried.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000
But such a task would be impossible no matter how many decades or centuries you take.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.000
There are many reasons why a game's release dates will be delayed, but 8 or 9 times out of 10 it's because a bug couldn't be fixed in time.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
But it's better than releasing a product like that.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
There's a lot of companies out there that would have released it anyway, just saying.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000
But I'm glad they are holding it for quality.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Now something else really exciting, the list of Smash Brothers 3DS composers came out this week.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
And there's some pretty cool people contributing to the game.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Is a Kiriyama Oka one of them?

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Is a Kiriyama Oka one of them? I actually don't think I saw a Kiriyama Oka's name on the list.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
This is garbage.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000
It would be cool if he did the Legend of Zelda theme.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000
I will say this, Yuzo Koshiro is one of the contributors, which I think is really cool.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Yuzo Koshiro did the Wangen Midnight Maximum 2 and I really like his stuff.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Yasunori Mitsuda from Chrono Trigger is one of the contributors, which I think is really cool.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Ace from Xenoblade Chronicles.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Okay, okay. How about Shota Kageyama, Shane?

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Who's that?

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Pokemon X and Y.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
The music in that game is pretty good out of the Pokemon games, I'll give it that.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.000
And Junichi Nakatsuru from Katamari no Mashii is going to be on the soundtrack as well.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
What about the Beatles?

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
The Beatles, I don't believe.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Don't say that while I'm drinking stuff.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I'm not sure how they relate.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
I'm just thinking of famous music people.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
No, no, I don't think that one counts.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Don't forget about the Bach stage.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I was going to say Bach next.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
A post-humous composition just for Smash Brothers.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
What?

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000
I'm so jealous of Renee right now because of the things she's saying in chat.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
It's not even... I have to throw the mic down and leave.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
We have an email about that actually, so hold that mic throw.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Alright, let's move on with some more Dark Sakura.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Well, you can get now the Wii U version of Disney Infinity for free.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
You can download it via the Nintendo eShop.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
But you know what you do have to buy?

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
All the figures so that you can play it at all.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000
So it's like when they give away free coffee machines,

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
but you have to spend a fortune buying all the pods and stuff for it.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
It's the same thing.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Get addicted! Oh wait, you can't play it.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Get the stuff that makes you be able to play it.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
The end.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Yeah, I was going to say, but you still have to get the little reader thing too,

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
and that's going to cost money.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Yeah.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000
So it's like, well, if the reader costs 30 bucks, then it's really not that free.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:19.000
It's like they make you buy the needle first and then give you the heroin.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
You know what?

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
What?

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I'm actually going to be buying a Disney Infinity figure.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Are you?

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Yep. I'm not even going to get the game.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
You're going to get Rocket Raccoon?

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Heck yeah!

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I just knew it.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Dude, Rocket Raccoon was one of my favorite characters from the 90s and everything.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Okay, great question from Port Center in our chat room who says,

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Doesn't the Wii U game pad have the built-in sensor?

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Why, yes it does, but this game doesn't use it for some reason.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Actually, it doesn't use it with Skylanders either.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Well, yeah, the Wii U sensor isn't activated for anything yet.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Wise.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000
You're wrong.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
What?

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Pokemon Rumble U.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Oh, okay, so there is that.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Well, I was thinking Amiibo was going to be the first big, big thing that used it.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
It'll probably be the first big thing that uses it.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Yeah.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Because Pokemon Rumble U, I don't think it does so well.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Remember, Nintendo has to build stuff for themselves first,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000
and then maybe if you're worthy enough, the third-party companies can use it, I guess.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
So.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
ActDeft brings up, though, the portal can cost $10 used,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000
and the PS3 one can be used with the Wii U version.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Oh, that's a good little tip.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Especially if you find a place that's, like, you know, overcharging for the Wii U one,

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
because they know it's free.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
So, hmm.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Good little tip there from ActDeft.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Shane.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:42.000
So, this renowned French coder, Smeelum, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:50.000
has announced that he has created a homebrew channel for the Nintendo 3DS,

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
and it's coming out very soon.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:01.000
It will work on the current 3DS firmware, unlike, I guess, the other homebrew channels before it.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Unless I'm reading this wrong, but whatever, I don't care.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
But it'll allow you to play games from any region,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:14.000
but you can't run commercial or pirated 3DS roms on it.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
It will support the North American, European, and Japanese systems,

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
and you'll still need a homebrew device to patch your system, presumably.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Hackers gonna hack, but I love the fact that they're gonna get around that region lock.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Yeah, that region lock is so dumb.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Like, so dumb.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
It almost, like, I usually don't, you know, really condone a lot of this stuff.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
You know, I don't want to steal games.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
I want to support game makers and all that stuff.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I don't support, yeah.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.000
When it comes to the region locking and that kind of fuckery, I'm like, all bets are off, quite frankly.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.000
If, you know, because I want to play this game, even if it's not necessarily in my region.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Like, this is a world market now when it comes to games, so.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
But anyway, that's soapbox aside.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Would you consider putting homebrew channel on your 3DS, Shane?

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I don't know.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:11.000
I'm trying to think of any 3DS games that are not available here that I would import.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Because eventually the stuff I want will come over here.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I probably want Mother 3.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.000
And it is noted you can't run commercial or pirated 3DS roms just to reemphasize that, so.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And Mother 3 was GBA, so you wouldn't be able to do that.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Hitstun in chat says, well, that solves the Puyo Puyo Tetris problem.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Because, yeah, folks in chat, when you were talking about Puyo Puyo Tetris earlier were saying,

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:41.000
oh, great, we can finally play this because it's out on all these other systems like 3DS and so forth in Japan, but not here.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
And so it's region locked.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
So this homebrew would allow Puyo Puyo Tetris for all. Yay.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
I could get, like, I guess I could get Sentai games. That would be awesome.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
You could. That would be fun.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Yeah, I would play those.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Dungeon Buster says, I modded my Wii to play Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii early.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
The extra functionality for the rest of my games was worth it, too.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
To be honest, Dungeon Buster, that was the thing.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I unapologetically did it for the exact same reason.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:11.000
That Xenoblade Chronicles thing was such fuckery, I have no regrets over modding my Wii to do that, so.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.000
And then the fact that they release it at only two places or whatever was stupid.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
So, anyway, off my soapbox.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Let's move on to something less stupid and more awesome, because I love it when we can make games more accessible for more people.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000
And I actually know we have some people that, at least historically, have listened to OLR.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000
I don't know if we have some folks that are still listening to OLR that are visually impaired.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Perhaps even legally blind.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And yet, these folks, at least the ones we've talked to over the years, still have a great love for video games.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Even though, obviously, you have to kind of learn to appreciate them probably in a different way.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.000
That somebody who has sight, like myself, or, you know, Darcyro or whoever, can enjoy them.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
So, what is happening?

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
And this is pretty cool, because this is actually a report that came out of the BBC.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
So this is something that was kind of running from a major, major news outlet.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And this is about a video-less 3D game being developed for blind players.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000
And the concept is to make the industry more accessible to blind and visually impaired people.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:25.000
And what video-less games do is they use a production technique known as binaural...

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Sorry, I can't pronounce this word at all.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I think this thing that they're doing applies to you all of a sudden.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Oral binaural recording to do an immersive audio-only world.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:44.000
And what they do is they fit a dummy with condenser microphones that mimic the way the ears hear sound.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000
And then scenes in the game are recorded using that method.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
And what you get out of that is a realistic three-dimensional experience.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Now, there's no graphics, because again, these games are being created for the visually impaired.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
But you rely on those senses to navigate through levels.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000
It's like all the games would be Silent Hill. It'd be so scary.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Not necessarily, they're all.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Let's see, Blind Legend is a team at DeWino Studios.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Sorry, Blind Legend is the game that this team is making.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.000
That's, quote, we wanted to put blind and disabled gamers in the same field of quality as sighted gamers.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
That was our main aim. That was our main challenge.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
So that's pretty cool. And I guess they're using some crowdfunding to make it happen.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
What you do in Blind Legend, it's not Silent Hill.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:37.000
You are a knight who loses their eyesight, and you journey through a forest to free your wife from her violent kidnappers.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
A scary forest.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
So there you go.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.000
The noises of the forest, the birds flying above, the river flowing, you hear these sounds.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000
And that information helps the gamer locate themselves in that environment.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:53:01.000
This sounds like a really awesome way to kind of be able to maybe experience what somebody who is visually impaired has to go through.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Did they ever do that to you in elementary school where it's like you have to wear a blindfold for an entire day to see what it's like?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Or you have to wear headphones or something to simulate being deaf or something?

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Did they ever do that to you in school? We had to do the blindfold thing.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
No.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Really?

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
No.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Well, this would just be a really cool way to, like, everybody has the same experience in a way. So I like that.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Bochikawa says, so it's like an audiobook for a game? That sounds so cool.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000
As long as it's not a scary game, I think it could be fun. But I just imagine Silent Hill.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Well, now, in 2010, Something Else, which is a British game studio, did a game called Papa Sangre, which is an audio-driven thriller.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.000
There's no graphics in the game. So, yes, there are thrillers as well, if you want to check that out.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Good luck.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Marissa Cungusto in chat says, hi, Marissa, by the way, says, sensitivity training. I had to wear gloves for tactile disabilities.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Black Wolf, our pal Bobby Black Wolf, says they actually had an art installation here in Atlanta that was pitch black.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000
It was called Dialogue in the Dark. Isn't there, like, a restaurant like that?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
I've seen that on Facebook or something.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:21.000
There's a deaf restaurant where it's staffed entirely by deaf people.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
There's one in San Francisco.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
And you have to sign your order.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Oh, wow.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Because my friend was talking about it.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Game Geeks in chat says, we had to do vision, hearing, and tactile for dementia training.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I love this idea of making really cool experiences that are really accessible to more gaming fans.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And trust me, there are blind gaming fans out there. We've heard from them here at OLR.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.000
So I'm really happy that, you know, they're trying to make more experiences for everybody.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
And I'm sure lots of other types of disabled folks would appreciate the accessibility.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Like, it always blows my mind when a game does not have button mapping.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.000
There should be no reason why you can't remap buttons to wherever a person might need them.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
It always struck me as a little silly.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
All right. Let's move on. Let's go to our mailbag.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Every week you guys send us email at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000
And DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and finds some emails that she thinks,

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
hey, I'm going to read these on the show.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Which I got to say, this is so weird because last week we said send us four emails

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
or else we're going to do the Kim Kardashian music during the break.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And you failed and you got Kim Kardashian music.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
However, this week, there was at least five emails last I checked.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.000
There are, but one of them is saying that Dan was too loud, so I'm not going to read it, narc.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Can't take the criticisms, huh?

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Well, I have to be a good wife and defend my husband's lack of control of his vocal range.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.000
To be fair, you know, we have to do everything live and on the fly and I try to sound balance people.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:01.000
But you guys know I love Loki dearly. He's notorious for this, right?

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000
When we do the mic check, he'll be his normal Loki voice.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Check one, two, check one, two, right?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I don't understand. Dan is always in that.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I don't understand. Dan projects.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:25.000
He's got massive lung capacity and cannot help but project because he's that kind of awesome guy.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:30.000
He cannot be contained by your audio control, Rob.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.000
I will say there was a comment at vognetwork.com on last week's show.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.000
I believe it was from Flaco Jones. I apologize if I'm misappropriating it, but I don't have it in front of me.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Who basically said, I love it when you guys have Shane on and some of the other people you have on,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
but Dan is the best guest you guys get on that show.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000
So you take the positive with an A.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Dan is the best guest. Sorry, Shane. Dan's the best.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I'm not even paying attention.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.000
You know what? Yeah, exactly. You know what? That's exactly why Shane's not the best guest.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I'm thinking about Power Rangers. It's very important right now.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:10.000
For the record, Dan and I have been working on an idea for a podcast together, which I would sit him down and have a chat.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Maybe you want to get three microphone condoms to help muffle the sound.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Last week's episode was actually turned down two decibels in post-production, the entire episode, just saying.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
But I think Dan's great too, even when he and I disagree.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
This also is a bit more of an open room.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
That is true. That is true.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.000
And Marissa gets a very big claim as also a great guest.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I love Marissa. When's she coming back?

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Now, I hope. Come on, Marissa.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Hi, OLR crew. By the way, Enark also did say that the show was good.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Hi, OLR crew. AZHP here. I've had about ten jello shots and a shot of tequila, so I'm pretty drunk.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:01.000
But I just got back from the Japan Expo convention concert in San Mateo with Akira Yamaoka and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000
And during a break, she said her favorite movie was Showgirls.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.000
And if she ever opened a movie theater, the movies would only show Showgirls and Starship Troopers.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:17.000
I wonder if she just drove up to San Francisco for the Peaches Christ showing, because that was this weekend, the 18th or 19th annual Showgirls.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000
They were here in San Mateo? That's not that far.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Shane, how did you not know about this?

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000
I don't know.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
You failed. You failed too.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I need to yell at Shane.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
You live with him. Yell at him when I'm not here.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
I have to get up early in the morning.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:39.000
So if you ever wondered if this singer from all Silent Hill games is fucking awesome, wonder no more.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Here's truly AZHP.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
P.S. Akira Yamaoka came on stage wearing a luchador mask.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
He is as crazy as you would expect considering the music he makes.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
But damn, he can play the guitar.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
P.P.S. God bless autocorrect.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.000
So in other words, what he's saying is that if you don't think she's the best singer, then you don't know shit.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Darlin', you are a whore.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Where's this expo going? Back east? Where back east?

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Different places!

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Read your Power Rangers article. Alright, next up.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Alright. Hey O.L.R., just writing in to get your thoughts on something that blew up on Twitter last weekend.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000
The background requires a bit of explanation, so here goes the game.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Akiba's Trip is a quirky beat-em-up that came out a few weeks ago.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.000
It's set in Akihabara and has a lot of parody of otaku culture,

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:35.000
including one feature called Pitter, a 2chan slash 4chan slash Twitter knockoff.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
The feature runs constantly on the side of the game, not necessary for gameplay,

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:47.000
but lets you follow some of the other denizens of Akiba for some insight into this fake Akihabara.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
One such reoccurring poster is an oblivious hater troll,

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
and that is meant to be someone we're not supposed to like.

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:00.000
The thing that blew up on Twitter, the real one, is that this troll likes to harass an apparently transgender poster.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I only say apparently because we're given no real means to determine it,

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:09.000
and I haven't given any case this character confirming or denying it yet in game.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:14.000
By replying with mean things, such as including a particular term for transgender people,

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.000
the use of that term offended some transgender gamers who took to asking XSeed,

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
the publisher that they remove it from the game.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
I'm not sure if you want to use the term on your show or not,

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.000
the word that caused all this was, quote, trap, end quote.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
XSeed's response was that they'll look into the situation,

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000
and the person who translated much of the dialogue posted a pretty interesting look into the process

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
and why the term was used, despite it potentially being offensive.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Her Tumblr is Hatsu, to use, if you're interested.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Naturally, some people jumped to defend the game and argue that others were too thin-skinned,

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
and that's what led up to the blowup.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Might be worth pointing out, thanks to screenshots of the lines and questions circulating online,

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.000
many people on both sides were working without full context to the scenes,

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.000
nor with knowledge that the other fictional posters in the game do not attack the transgender character,

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000
and quite a few of them even tell the hater to knock it off.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
The base level question is this, I guess.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
What do you make of this situation?

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
How would you think you would have handled it even in the lines themselves or after the blowup

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
if you were in XSeed's position?

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.000
This is a really weird thing to say, but I honestly feel like I'm in no position

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.000
to really be able to accurately say if it is offensive or not,

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
because I'm going to be completely honest.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I started to read this email before the show, and as I'm reading through the email

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000
and they're talking about the transgender slur,

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:41.000
I immediately assumed that that was the word that rhymes with Aunt Franny, right?

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000
I assumed that that was the word that they were talking about.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.000
And then when he said the word in the email, which we repeated for educational purposes,

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000
sorry if anybody was offended by that, because honest-

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I said quotey fingers.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Right. Well, honest to God, call me ignorant or privileged or whatever you want,

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
I had no idea that was a slur.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.000
No, I would never use- I can't think of a possible reason why I would use that word.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000
And I actually did Google research.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
I was like, how is that- because I wanted to educate myself, okay?

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
So I was like, how is that an offensive word?

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000
And now I see, oh, okay, that's why it's offensive or whatever,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.000
which if- how do I say this in a politically correct way?

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000
And I really apologize if anybody's offended, but I'm saying this for educational purposes.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Please understand.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:34.000
That basically, like, somebody may not be the gender that somebody assumed they were.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
That is a- right, okay.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
So- but ridiculous, right?

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:44.000
So the reason why I tell you that story about me having to, like, Google this

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:52.000
to figure out why it's offensive, this is why there's always that call for diversity in gaming.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:59.000
And I know a lot of people are like, why do women force themselves in the game industry

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.000
and complain and- why do the social justice warrior, transgender, blah, blah, blah.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:08.000
And look, look, guys, I get issues with a lot of social justice warrior shit, too.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I think there's way too much slacktivism that happens on the internet.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000
I think there's a lot of people that will retweet a lot of things,

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.000
but then be too lazy to vote when it really counts, and that fucking pisses me off.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:32.000
However, by the same token, I can also recognize that this exact story is why we can use more diversity.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Maybe somebody should have played through this who knows this word and knows this slur

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.000
and some of the negative connotations a little better than I that could have said,

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:51.000
okay, this makes sense because, you know, this is part of the story, or this is parody a la South Park

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.000
and it feels that way, or, you know what, no, this is offensive and you should change this word

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000
to a more generic, you know, not offensive terminology.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000
But seeing as I- honestly, I really appreciate the email because I really wanted to make sure this topic

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000
got brought up on the show, but as I, A, haven't played the game, and B, don't have the proper perspective,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I'm not sure if I can sit here and tell you it's right or wrong.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
But I will say, yeah, South Park gets away with a lot of shit.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I would also, though, point out that people should just not jump to initially blaming social justice warriors on this.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:35.000
While they do overstate, or I'd say take things way too, what's the word I'm thinking of, way too far to extremes,

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:43.000
this was actually people who were transgender who had some problems with the terminology as well,

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
according to the email from what I read.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
You know, and I'm seeing a lot of comments in chat that's like, you know, hitstun's like, wait, that offends people?

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000
And Act F says, Sky, this day and age of Tumblr and social justice warriors, anything can be offensive.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:00.000
And Kaijuto, or who is it, yeah, Kaijuto says, oh no, they're going to have to edit Star Wars now.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:05.000
And Fifth Dream says, like many offensive words, people who might be offended by the word also use the word.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
So it's hard to know what's offensive and what isn't sometimes.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000
You know, I think in general, like, you know, we've had this discussion here to try to educate people.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:19.000
And I think what needs to happen on both sides, what I would like to see the social justice warriors of the world,

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:26.000
and the people who love to push their buttons, what I think we fucking need on both sides is more patience.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
You know what really bugs me?

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I was going to say valium, but yeah, patience too.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.000
It really bugs me and it makes me sad. And it's one of the worst traits.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Not to get too deep here, but like, especially with all the bullshit that's been going on in the gaming world this week,

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I think this is important.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:49.000
I think it's always a sad case of humanity when we always instantly want to assume the worst in people.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:53.000
And the internet brings this out in a horrific way.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:58.000
And yes, there are some pretty awful people out there like, look at all the fuckery going on with the hacks today.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:04.000
But my point is that most people, most people are inherently good people.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:09.000
And we could learn a lot from each other if we would just be patient with each other and listen to each other

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:16.000
and stop assuming that somebody is instantly only existing to piss you off.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000
I disagree.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Okay.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I believe that most people individually can be good people.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:33.000
You get people into a large group where you have one voice rising above the other ones and most people, sorry, are followers.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:42.000
If we didn't have most people being followers, we wouldn't have the massive amounts of police brutality that we're seeing today

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.000
by people making assumptions about other people or being thrown into situations in front of groups

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:53.000
and making up lies about a particular victim of a murder just because of his skin color.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
We wouldn't have whole groups of ideologies going around beheading people in the Middle East at this point.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:11.000
We wouldn't have people deciding to throw bombs into cities and using their own towns as basically using their own citizens as human shields in retaliation.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:21.000
We wouldn't have any of that if people would start thinking for themselves and act on their innate goodness rather than let that be silenced by those in power.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.000
So in other words, don't be a follower.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Be passionate and act on it.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Yeah. That I can agree with. Yes.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Because when the moment that you let your voice be silenced by somebody else or let yourself be distracted by watching fucking reality TV or, you know.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Well, but not, see, not all reality TV is necessarily bad.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:50.000
I know, but I'm saying this. That a lot of people would rather just, between watching the news and watching, you know, something mindless on TV,

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:54.000
they'll watch the mindless thing on TV and just go, oh, well, that's bad. What can I do about it?

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.000
They can do something about it. They just don't think they can because they don't trust their voice.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:05.000
But this is a show about video games and a lot of times those mindless reality shows and video games are an escape from all that other bullshit that goes on in the world.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000
I'm not saying you have to stay ignorant to that bullshit in the world. You should be aware of what's going on, but I think it's okay.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
You don't make it your life. Yeah.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Your life should not be escape. Your life should be living. The escape is to have a moment of a break.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:28.000
It's when you forget to live and forget that other people are trying to live, that you actually play a hand in the disaster that goes on in the world.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.000
As I say, it's the biggest evil is when good people do nothing.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.000
The Legend of Zaku in chat says, reject false icons indeed. So, all right.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Wow. This got way too deep. I need more. I can't believe I'm going to say this.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:47.000
I need more Pokemon chat or Power Rangers chat to help us.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
No, you don't want the Power Rangers chat. Trust me.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000
There's more in the email. So, okay. Yeah.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
My other question, I think that begets this is where do we draw the line for parody?

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.000
My mind immediately jumps to South Park, which gets away with some pretty offensive stuff in the name of parody.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:07.000
At this point, South Park has been around long enough that I don't feel like I see many people get offended with the show anymore.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:13.000
I'm not sure if that's just because everyone dismisses it now or if they've gotten good at walking the thin line.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Do you all think we should avoid offending anyone in games or is there a place for parody that some might find offensive?

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Anyway, thanks for the responses and the podcast. And this comes from Andy R.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.000
And in regards to that, I think that people have become desensitized to a lot of it.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.000
I mean, if you want to hear some offensive shit, listen to Lisa Lampanelli.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:42.000
But she does it in such a way that one, you see the humor in it.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000
And number two, you see how ridiculous the stereotypes are. And that's why I like listening to her.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
And that's kind of how South Park does it, too.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000
It's like you kind of need a little bit of parody and a sense of humor to keep things in check.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
I mean, something like South Park is going to make fun of everybody.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Everybody. Everything is a target in that show.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.000
But if it's not your cup of tea, don't watch it.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
And there's nothing wrong with you if you get offended by South Park.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:13.000
It's just not a show for you. But at the same time, don't judge me if I have a giggle at it.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000
And I've said this before a long time ago on this show.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:21.000
But I said that people should learn to be offended because there are some things that are going to offend you.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000
And they can be said with the most innocence in mind.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:31.000
And the thing is that the person, you know, yeah, you may have an opportunity to educate somebody

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:38.000
if something that they don't seem to realize might be inherently misogynistic or inherently, you know.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000
But it's not something that you just call them out on in a public forum and rake them over the coals for it.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
You pull them aside.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
So stop assuming the worst in people.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Exactly. I myself post a lot of social justice stuff on Tumblr.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Of course, I also go to protests.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
And you vote.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.000
And I vote and I volunteer my design time for charities that I believe in.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000
So I'm not just sitting on my ass going, oh, post, post, post.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:13.000
But the thing is that I think that when you get into reacting instead of acting,

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:18.000
that that's why we have these MRAs now in response to the rise of feminism,

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.000
because we have now the radfems that are assuming the worst about every man in the world.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:32.000
And I know that the not all men thing was really detracting from the whole issue that was going on.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:39.000
But at the same time, we need to understand that not everybody wears the face of what we see in the news.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Right.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Sorry to get serious again.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:48.000
No, it's some of this actually kind of scary relates to gaming and things that are going on right now.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:53.000
So, you know, it's it's a good conversation to have.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Well, look at this.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000
OK. And I've made no secret of this on the show.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:04.000
I am a Jewish convert and I was getting crap for the stuff going on in Gaza.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000
And I've never been to Israel and I wasn't born Jewish.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
But it's you've seen what's going on in France.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:15.000
You've seen what's been going on with people blaming an entire group for the actions of one place.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.000
And that's, you know, again, we're seeing that across the board.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:30.000
You know, that's why I think that Anita, what's her name, gets so much crap is because she's made herself a voice to bring different,

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:37.000
I would say, ongoing misogynistic views going on in the gaming industry to light.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:43.000
And then she becomes a target because no one wants to admit that maybe she might be right.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:49.000
So I'm trying to get a few more comments here in our chat room over at live dot network dot com because it's lighting up here.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
So I want to make sure we get some more voices.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Marissa Congusto says, I have no problem with a comedian saying something offensive, but calling a friend jerk if they do the same context matters.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Hitstun says feminists and men's right activists are both poorly named.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Just don't be a dick to any gender.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.000
And then Fifth Dream follows that up with dick is sexist.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.000
But I think I still get Hitstun's point.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Don't be don't be a jerk. Period.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
All right.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
You know, I.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:31.000
If everyone just tries to give another person the benefit of a doubt, it tries to engage somebody in conversation instead of finger pointing.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
And I mean, intelligent discourse.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
I think we'd see things a lot better in the world.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Captain Spike in chat says, I think it's interesting to think on the intersection of art and games as it relates to this discussion.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:49.000
And Mega Man X 400, our buddy from video game realness, says, how about them video games?

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Hey, look, you know, there's a lot of crazy shit going on in gaming.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.000
And I like to be able to not just report on all the negativity, but kind of try to dig a little deeper than that.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.000
So, you know, we've been looking at the same thing over the course of history.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.000
I'm going to bring up one big event in history quickly.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
We really need to move on. Are you familiar with the Bonfire of the Vanities?

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Yes.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Not the movie.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Yes.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:18.000
It was in during the age of the Renaissance, during when the Medicis were in power.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:26.000
There was a big issue going on in Italy where they were burning works of art because they were considered to be a disease of the rich.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.000
We learned about this in world history because it related to another big event.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:42.000
But we get some of the same things, too, where video games are being pointed at as being the cause for violence or for being a cause for promoting misogynistic views.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.000
When in reality, it's the people who are behind it looking for a scapegoat.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:52.000
And people just need to realize we humans can be pretty shitty.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.000
We've all got a bit of crap in us.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
I mean, what's the word I'm thinking of?

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.000
I think everyone has a bit of evil intent.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.000
You know, sometimes you get spiteful. Sometimes you get angry at somebody.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:12.000
But it's when you let that reaction guide your judgment that you don't listen to the positive voice that's in your head, too.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
All right. Let's go to the next email.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
All right. This is from Robert M.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:26.000
I may have asked whether you guys collect game-related merchandise, but do Jamie and Dan have any interest in the Japanese sentinel slash Takara original PlayStation Optimus and Mega?

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Yes, I do. The PlayStation Optimus Prime and Mega Drive Megatron.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Yes, yes. Totally have interest in it, but they seemed a little bit outside of our budget.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:42.000
And then, PS, I had the original clickable iPod version of Bejeweled. Interesting, but not friendly to control.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Thank goodness for touch screens.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
This is how we talked about Bejeweled before.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
But oh, my God, I really want the Mega Drive Megatron.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
I think that would be so awesome to have.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:03.000
But it's been outside the budget, especially since we are looking to purchase a house, so.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:09.000
And. So, yeah.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000
All right. We've got more email.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.000
I know there's lots of email that I'm sorry we're not getting too in depth with some of these, but.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Hey, Orange Lounge, it was cool to finally talk to you guys last week. Hope the weekend treated you well.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000
What are your favorite Easter eggs? Don't say the ones you paint and hide in April.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:30.000
A friend and I recently replayed some old school Call of Duty zombies and we went through one of the maps Easter eggs.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:36.000
I remembered how cool it was for the developers to throw a random hidden story into their multiplayer wave based game mode.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.000
So from any game, what were your favorite secrets that weren't completely meant for everyone to find?

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Keep gaming. Much love. EA skeezy.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.000
God, there's a bunch.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.000
I like I like I like doing Siri Easter eggs, to be honest.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Asking Siri random things until I get a funny response. But there was.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Actually, there was.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Great. Now I can't remember his name, but did Dragon Ball Z, Akira.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Toriyama. Thank you, Brian. Having the little appearance amongst all the developers ending basically for Chrono Trigger.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:26.000
I consider that a huge Easter egg. I would go back to the original, which was one of the first Easter eggs ever,

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000
which, funny enough, was a game I already talked about earlier in the show, Adventure on the Atari 2600,

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:36.000
where there was a secret room you could get to that has the programmers initials in it, because it's more about what that stood for.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Because remember, back in the day of the development of those early 2600 games, the programmers, of which it was oftentimes one person,

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:48.000
sometimes two people was like one person that made the majority of the game at the time, didn't get credit for it.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.000
And, you know, people, the programmers used to get really miffed at this.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:18:01.000
And this is how a lot of the third party things started. And, you know, Activision made a really big deal about crediting some of their designers that made the games.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:11.000
But I like the Easter egg as kind of like an act of defiance, in a way, as getting the person who made the game credit in the game anyway.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.000
So, I guess that would be my classic. Otherwise, my other standby answer would probably be another classic, which would be,

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:20.000
I always thought the minus world in Super Mario Brothers, the original, was a really cool thing.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:25.000
But that's probably more of a bug than an Easter egg at the end of the day. I really think that's more of a bug than an Easter egg.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:35.000
But I think that's just really cool to find these things, these whole levels, that were unintended, that probably end up the result of some algorithm gone wrong in the game.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I remember catching one in Final Fantasy VII.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Oh yeah?

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:46.000
When Cloud was kind of crazy. And he would go, Zen-no-ge-as, before Xenogears were out.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:56.000
That one was a big one for me. There were, you know, I had actually, a couple of my friends did the localization for rival schools.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Oh cool.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:08.000
And so, there would be, but they also did some of the localization for, crap what was it, for Puzzle Fighter.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:16.000
And so, they'd throw in jokes that I knew were jokes to them. But then there were like, say that you had Devilot, for example.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Don't you know CyberBots is Capcom's number one game? That's, you know, reference to CyberBots.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:26.000
You'd have characters from other Capcom games in the background in some of the levels, you know, different things like that.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:30.000
SSG 100 Matt has a great one. The dog ending in Silent Hill 2. How could you forget that?

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Bark, bark, bark.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Alright.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
That is a classic. That's a classic. Good memory, SJ100.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
You like Castlevania, don't you?

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Alright, more emails?

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Yeah. Hold on, let me get back to them because I can't find where I put it.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
So, there's two left.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Oh yeah, nevermind. I already read that one.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Because I want the Megadrive Megatron.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Hey guys! Just writing in to say I'm very frustrated about this hacker group

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.000
whose name I don't even want to say as they seem to be enjoying getting publicity,

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
taking away my online gaming for the night.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I've recently been feeling really attached to people in the end of Line Free Company and Final Fantasy XIV

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:23.000
as everyone has been so kind in helping me to progress in all the past level 50 areas.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Post level 50 areas.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Hearts.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Now it's night because of this asshole extremist group. I can't hang out with any of them.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:33.000
PSN is down, Battle.net is down, League of Legends servers are down, and now reports are coming in,

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
the Xbox Live has been taken down as well.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000
My question is, what the hell drives people to do this?

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Why take away entertainment from people looking to find an escape? Frown.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Now switching gears a bit here, I remember Rob and Jamie were both a GamerX too.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I do know there have been talks about changing the name of this con to represent something more all-inclusive

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:00.000
as GamerX has never been about singing out just gay gamers excluding other groups.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:05.000
There's something that has been on my mind as I am both a gay gamer and a person in another group

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000
that's often looked at as being weird. Furries.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Personally, I take pride in being one and have made so many friends, have been given so much love and support,

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:19.000
and I've found someone that I care for on a deeper level in this furry fandom.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:24.000
To put it simply, was there any representation of furries that you guys saw at GamerX too?

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Yes, there were.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Oh yeah, because they were there promoting FurCon or the other big event.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000
So yeah, oh yeah.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:37.000
And we actually had a discussion about actually making the fursuits.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:45.000
And some of the stereotypes, I forgot the guy's name unfortunately, but we were just talking about what goes into making the fursuits

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:51.000
and you know, about how yes, there are people who are fetishists, but every group has its fetishist.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Right.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
You know.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.000
You're not hurting anybody. It's all consensual. Have fun.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Thanks so much for reading this and for keeping my night occupied in a time where other groups of people want to take the fun and entertainment out of our lives.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Sincerely, Ospher, aka Syria Knoxfall.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Well, I'm glad we could help. I want to go back to the first half of the email though, because we never, like what motivates people to do this.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
It's the power.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Power.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Power trip. The fact that they have power over other people. But here's the thing.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:25.000
People like this, it only takes one fuckup to bring the whole thing down.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.000
And this really reminds me of what was that a few years ago, that whole LulzSec did a whole bunch of stuff, right?

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.000
That was the name of the group. LulzSec did a whole bunch of stuff. And what happened?

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:41.000
One of the guys got caught early on into it, but got flipped around to be a mole and brought the whole damn thing down from the inside.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:49.000
And it only takes one. And a lot of times this thing ends up with infighting or any of this stuff, you know, and it's not going to end well.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Because these guys today, not only have they been posting pictures of like ISIS and all this stuff and glorifying that, which is a terrorist organization.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Then they called in this fake bomb threat to try and ruin the day of some mucky muck high up at Sony Online Entertainment.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:14.000
You know, that is going to be some serious shit that no amount of crying and I didn't know what I was doing is going to get a person out of.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:22.000
I mean, that was like, essentially it was a terrorist act, what that person did. You might think I'm being dramatic, but I mean, that was what it was.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:33.000
So, when these guys get caught, and they will get caught, because they're going to fuck up. If they keep going on their power trip, they're going to make a fuck up.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000
And they're going to get caught. And it's going to be serious.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:45.000
This is a sad thing, though, about how things work in this country. They are going to get on the bad side of a large corporation with lots of money and government influence.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Because the government does not like when the people who pay them are in trouble. End of story.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
That's when they're going to fuck up.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Well, they've already pissed off, let's see, Sony, Microsoft, American Airlines, Activision. The list is growing pretty rapidly.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And we know that, you know, especially given that they're doing DDoS attacks, too, then that's going to go back to the ISPs, who, as we know, bankroll quite a bit for the government.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Anyway, I didn't want to focus on this negativity too much, but there's the answer to your question.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Alright.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I've been a lot in being fed up with a lot of stuff lately, so I'm sorry if that's come through.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Alright. That's it for the mailbag, right?

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000
That's it. At least that's all I'm going to read.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Good job tonight, guys. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Make Jamie work.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:42.000
You've got two weeks to fill it up, because, again, we won't be here next week.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:58.000
All this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
This is fucked up.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Uh, Shane, I haven't heard from you. I'll let you start tonight.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Uh, an FU to Bandai for possibly thinking about skipping Tokuja in America.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.000
What?

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Yep, apparently they don't think that the suits look good, they don't think that the swords look good, so they're thinking about skipping it.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Which makes me upset.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Um, that's really it. FU to being really tired. Really tired.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Uh, Dark Sakura.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:35.000
FU to the dumb shits who pulled out me in front of me while I was driving here.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Just some dumb kid who can't drive.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000
And, uh, FU to...

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Nah, not really any FUs. I'm kind of done with that right now. I'm just sort of done.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
D, U, and done.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Um, let's see, my FU of the week goes to, um, oh my god, last minute planning and procrastination, because I'm really, really bad at both those things.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.000
And I'm getting on a plane Wednesday, and I'm so not ready for it. Woohoo!

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
There you go, there's the FUs of the week.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Uh, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then your phone calls.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000
1-877-GAMELR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Uh, Loki!

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.000
He's not here.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
He's not here.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
How about Shane instead? Sorry.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
No, we'll wait for him to do his story.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I was too lazy, and my show role tonight still says Loki on it, and not Shane, so I'm just out of habits at Loki.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.000
I'm sorry, Shane, who is filling in for Loki tonight. What do you have? Come on, Shane!

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
We can call him Shanky.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Shane, it's an excuse to talk about P.T. You're not going to give that up.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Do it!

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.000
No, I'm not going to.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.000
P.T.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Um, so somebody put a mashup of the narration from, uh, Stanley Parable, and, uh, some gameplay footage of P.T., and it's decent.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:27:00.000
I, as a huge fan of both the P.T. demo game thing and Stanley Parable, I was hoping for a lot more from it.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
It's only, like, a minute or two long.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Um, so it's good for what it tries to do.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I wish it would have incorporated more scary stuff from the P.T., uh, demo, but whatever.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
It's still worth watching once. Only once.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:20.000
I had a really good time watching the, uh, kids from Koopa Club playing, uh, P.T. yesterday.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.000
You saw that, too, right? The whole feed of them playing?

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They were, uh, Jeremy was hilarious.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Yeah, I love watching people play through that for the first time. It was a lot of fun.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I, uh, I was playing with my friend today from Kansas, and when he got killed by the ghost, he screamed and threw his arms up in the air.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
It was awesome.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:48.000
I saw the funniest video of someone who was fine with all the ghost appearances until she appeared in the balcony.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Oh, that's a creepy scene.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
I was like, oh my god, she's grinning at me!

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Yeah, because she's smiling. That makes it so much worse.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000
And, uh, to answer Rama's question real quick, I said there's-

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
What did Rama ask?

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Uh, they're thinking about skipping Tokujo. They already are skipping GoBusters.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Oh, wow. Um, the thing is, though, this, this silly little trailer thing has set the bar so high for the Silent Hill game.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Yeah, it has.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:20.000
That's the problem, is that heaven help that game if people look at it and go, ah, that PT was better.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Yeah, and there will be people that'll say that regardless.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Of course, of course.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:33.000
There was one thing, though, that put itself, uh, that I realized, like, after playing the PT, is that you remember where it says hello by the phone?

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Mm-hmm.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
And then the letters start disappearing?

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Yeah.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
The same letters appear over where it says in hell?

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Yeah, yeah, that's what it's supposed to be. So each letter, if you walk all the way over there-

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Yeah.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000
When it disappears, that letter will appear.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Yeah, that's the puzzle.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Yeah.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Yeah.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.000
We didn't know at first that you could just turn your camera to make those letters go away. We thought you had to look at the letter, walk over there.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.000
But from what I understand, that's part of the- one of the puzzles that has to be solved before you can do the baby stuff.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Right.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Yeah, it does.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:09.000
All right, and last night, before we get to our Skypline, um, you know, this is, this is going around everywhere on social media, and that is the, um, Ice Bucket Challenge for, um, ALS.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:17.000
And look, I don't want to get into the whole debate over is this a good thing or not. At the end of the day, I think charity in general is a great thing.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:25.000
And if you are looking to do great things for charity, I think one great thing you can do is donate, uh, as in money, or you can even donate time.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Uh, you know, that could be for maybe even like a political cause you, uh, believe in as well, or what have you.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:39.000
But regardless, this, um, Ice Bucket thing has been going around like crazy, uh, getting people more aware of ALS.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.000
And this does include industry people as well, which is why I'm reporting on it.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Uh, there's a lot of people in the industry that have done the, um, Ice Bucket Challenge.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Uh, there's a little list here of some people, uh, including Notch, the creator of Minecraft.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Cliffy B, who's creator of Gears of War.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Uh, Shawn Layden, who's the, uh, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment in America.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Some other people have been called out, such as Reggie Fils-Aime, who promises to one-up Phil Spencer's video, so that should be interesting.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:17.000
So, um, you know, again, uh, as long as this, uh, organization is raising tons and tons of money, which I hear they are, uh, I think that is a good thing.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:26.000
But don't forget about other charities too, because I know there's some causes. I know me personally, uh, tried to do stuff for the multiple sclerosis, uh, organizations.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Just don't give the Komen Foundation any of your money, because they will waste it and, uh, hate other people.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:38.000
By, by the way, by the way, did you, I liked the one, there's two of those that I have, actually three that I have been really impressed by.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:45.000
One of them is Ayumi Kawasaki, squealing like crazy, and then calling out Yu Darvish, who is actually super hot.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Um, seriously, Iranian Japanese. Hot. Anyway, um, then, um, he's a baseball player.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Um, anyway, then there was, uh, I watched, uh, what was the other one that I thought was really great?

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Oh yeah, Vin Diesel, who's challenged people, instead of doing the bucket challenge, to plant a tree.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:09.000
That was really cool, because he was Groot.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:14.000
And then, um, I'm actually growing a Eucalyptus tree, by the way.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Nice.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
So, and then my other one that I liked was the Old Spice guy.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Oh yeah, from the commercials? I haven't seen that one.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:27.000
He challenged Bruce Campbell, everyone named John Johnson, and Fabio.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:32.000
I was like, that one was, I posted it on my Facebook, it was pretty fun, pretty funny.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
And yes, Akira Yamaka did it as well.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Well, I'm sorry.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:37.000
And Mark Mir.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Yes.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Oh really?

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
And Jennifer Hale did.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Oh, and the Luciano, the guy who did it too.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Oh, he did too?

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Yeah.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:46.000
I didn't see that one.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:47.000
I'm surprised you haven't looked that up yet.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.000
I saw Justin Theroux, that was a nice video.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Well, the Benedict Cumberbatch one was hilarious.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000
That was funny.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Anyway, anyway, also of note with this whole thing, which is, you know, becoming quite

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:02.000
the little pop culture thing that I'm sure they'll look back on, remember 2014?

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
This was one of those fads people did.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:07.000
This is something that's actually coming to video games.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:11.000
And Destiny is actually getting in on this as well.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:21.000
They actually put out a little YouTube where they did the little ghost guy as a participant

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:22.000
in the ice bucket challenge.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
I thought that was kind of neat that they kind of rendered that.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
So, pretty cool.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Win-win around for charity.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
And, you know.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I just would wish that people would do this on my lawn because my lawn is a wasteland

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
of dead grass and weeds thanks to the drought.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Yeah, I'm a little bit like, I'm kind of like, you guys, there's a drought going on

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000
and there's people, but I understand too, it's charity, it's awareness, whatever.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:50.000
There are people in other countries who don't have safe drinking water and we're wasting

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
it dumping on our heads.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.000
We could just give the money.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:57.000
I asked my friend when we're going to have the immolation challenge because then people

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
would really be willing to give some money.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
But regardless, it's awareness, so cool.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:07.000
I think they've definitely succeeded where a lot of charities would give a lot to get

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
that same type of awareness.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
But anyway, let's move on.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Let's go to the phones.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
It's time to have you guys call in.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
All one word.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:23.000
If you'd like to call the show, now's a fantastic time to do so.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Meanwhile, this is where I usually open it up for last minute stories.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:32.000
But since Loki's not here, I know Shane's not going to have anything.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Or am I wrong?

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
I could just talk about Power Rangers.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
We could or how cuter new Pokemans are.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
What was that Evangelion one you gave me?

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
What did I give you?

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.000
It was big and purple.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Palkia.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Yeah, he looks like an Eva.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
He's from Diamond and Pearl.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
So he's pretty old.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.000
You're not going to be able to use him right away though because he's level 100, so he

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000
won't obey you.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:56.000
But sometimes he will, but he won't all the time.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
I will make him obey me with cookies.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.000
I have some tweets I want to make sure I get to as well.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000
There's a lot of people tweeting about the show, so I really appreciate that.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Thank you guys for the support there.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
But then we have SSG100Matt saying,

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.000
After a month of brewing, my home brew beer is done.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:15.000
It's a chocolate maple porter, but it needs a name.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Ideas?

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
What would you call a chocolate maple porter?

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Dark Sakura?

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Sticky pole.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Sticky pole.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:26.000
There you go.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Sticky pole.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Sticky pole.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Let's see.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Dark Tetsuya tweets us saying,

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.000
On fish playing Street Fighter, apparently Aquarius got signed on with MLG group Always Godlike.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.000
His avatar features a little headset now.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
That's adorable.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Alright, the phone is ringing off the hook.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Let's get to the phones and get some calls.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Hi, it's DNL.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Oh my gosh, DNL, how are you?

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Yay!

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
I'm so excited to hear from you.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:57.000
Hi guys.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.000
You know when my voice goes up an entire octave, I mean it.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Parts, parts.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Oh my god, I'm so happy to be here.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Yeah, so I'm sorry it's been a long time since I last called in,

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.000
and I know that with you guys, I was actually even a guest once,

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
so many, many, many years ago.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:19.000
But I thought I'd go ahead and call in today because

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:24.000
you guys had brought up about Free to Play earlier on the call,

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.000
or on there, and yeah, I've been in the video game industry

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:30.000
for as long as Shane, if you guys can believe it.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.000
We started off at Konami like years and years and years ago.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Yeah, together pretty much at the same time.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Yeah, I know.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:42.000
And yeah, I mean from there I kind of just went and

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:45.000
just kept on working in the video game industry all the way to the point

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:49.000
where my previous company was Perfect World Entertainment,

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.000
and some of you may know of them.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:56.000
They are a Chinese MMO development company,

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:59.000
and then when they came here to the US,

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:02.000
one of the purchases that they made was actually of Cryptic Studios,

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
which makes Neverwinter online.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.000
And yeah, so I worked for them for about almost four years,

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:14.000
and since then I've kind of gone into mobile Free to Play.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000
So it's kind of really interesting to see the difference between

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:23.000
how people perceive Free to Play, which started from South Korean games

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
like Gunbound and so forth,

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:31.000
to now the backbone of mobile apps and everything,

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.000
and that whole ecosystem.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:37.000
But yeah, I guess it was more of a comment.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
No, no, that's neat.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000
And I like to hear from people in your perspective as well,

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.000
who kind of are there working with those Free to Play games.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.000
What do you think people who are really quick to criticize the Free to Play model,

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:56.000
what do you think they might be missing?

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Well, I mean, of course people are going to really kind of criticize it

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:05.000
because from the very beginning a lot of people feel that it's more of a

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:09.000
pay to win or pay for power kind of model,

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
and I completely understand where people are coming with that.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.000
But I think someone else brought it up earlier in one of their comments,

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:19.000
is that when people are really cognizant of making sure that the game is balanced

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.000
without even the need to purchase anything,

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.000
that really makes it an immersive experience.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.000
And I think that's one of the things that we've been able to kind of see

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:32.000
the whole industry kind of catering to.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:37.000
I mean, for example, Star Trek Online used to be a subscription model

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
and now it's a Free to Play model.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.000
And the same thing with Star Wars Old Republic,

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:45.000
and the whole point is that they needed to build a game

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:48.000
that was a full-out fledged game

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.000
where you can be able to purchase and play with other people

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:56.000
and then be able to then turn it into something that as a convenience

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.000
you can be able to purchase these items just in case,

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:03.000
because like you were saying earlier, there's just so much time for anything

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:06.000
and really you kind of have to focus on one thing at a time.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:09.000
And if you do come back and play maybe once every 30 days,

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:12.000
you don't want to feel like you're lagged behind by everyone.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:17.000
And that's kind of what I'm hoping to continue to cater in this industry

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:21.000
is that we want to be able to allow people who don't have enough time to play

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:25.000
to be able to still feel like they can by giving them these,

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000
we call them convenience items so that they don't have to feel like

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.000
they're lagging behind all of their friends who can be able to grind 12 hours a day kind of thing.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:35.000
So that's when I feel like it's probably the biggest criticism.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:42.000
And I think in a lot of ways, for me, what really made me enjoy certain free-to-play games more

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.000
was that games are always better with friends.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Absolutely.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
And I think especially like in MMO, I think I mentioned this earlier in the show,

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:51.000
when you mentioned that you'd been involved with Neverwinter.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
When I first played it, I didn't know anybody else into it.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:58.000
So I was kind of like, I'm alone and this is scary and sparkles, something else, squirrel.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:03.000
But then now that I have friends that play it too, I'm like, oh, hell, this is really good.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.000
This is pretty deep for a free-to-play game. There's a lot of stuff you can do in this.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Yeah, absolutely.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
And that's the whole thing, right?

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.000
It's making sure that you can be able to have a robust experience on top of everything else.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:20.000
And I think that's one of the things that is the turning point of the industry altogether.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:27.000
And so you can really see that come and shine through as starting as much as three years ago, really,

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:32.000
is when it really started to submit this is what free-to-play means and this is kind of the future.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.000
So you'll see less and less of those premium apps, what they call it.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Basically, you have to pay to buy the app before you can even start using it.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Those are starting to dissipate more and more as the premium freemium model is actually being more used.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:54.000
But yeah, okay. That's all.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
But I just wanted to say hi.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
No, I so appreciate that perspective. That's awesome.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Hey, I got one more question for you though before you go because I'd like to ask,

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:07.000
especially from callers we don't hear from all the time, DNL, what is a game that you are really into right now,

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:10.000
but no fair naming something you've worked on or are working on?

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Of course, of course. Well, one of the things that I've really been playing over is Last of Us.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:22.000
When they came out with the HD version for PS4, I don't have a PS4, unfortunately.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Oh no, what kind of game am I, right? Anyway, but I do have a PS3, so I started playing it again.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:32.000
One who has to save their nickels and dimes like a lot of people.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.000
But yeah, we've been playing that. I've just been crying and, you know, crying my eyes out all over again.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I really love Naughty Dog's game, Last of Us. And I'm really looking forward to the movie, if it is.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:54.000
And also, if you guys didn't check it out, you guys need to go to YouTube and check out when Naughty Dog did their midnight release.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:01.000
It was phenomenal. They even did the ending that was the musical version.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.000
Yes, I did see that. And they did a deleted scene and stuff, too, huh?

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Yes, oh my god. It was phenomenal and you have to see it.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
I agree. Awesome.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
All right, nice talking with you guys.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.000
You have a fantastic night. Thanks so much for listening and participating tonight.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Not a problem. I'll talk to you guys later.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:18.000
All right, take care.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Bye.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Bye.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Bye.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000
One of my best E3 memories involves DNL.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
But I'll have to save that for another night.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:31.000
I'll have to save that for another night because our phones are lighting up and I've got to get to some more calls.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this?

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Hey, it's Brad from Pod Culture.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Brad from Pod Culture! So happy to hear from you, buddy.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:43.000
I am distraught that you will not be at Dragon Con this year, but I completely understand the reasons behind it.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:46.000
I will just keep my fingers and toes crossed for 2015.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Oh, I certainly hope so. It's going to be a rough thing. That's kind of like the Geek Family reunion.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.000
It is, it is. Well, a shot of Fireball will be had in your honor, my friend.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Well, that's actually part of the reason why I was calling. You look at the avatar on my Skype handle right now.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.000
I was noticing you have a little shot of Fireball. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Well, hey, I can't have a drink with you at Dragon Con, so here you go.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:18.000
I wasn't prepared. I'm holding up my root beer from Jack in the Box. Close enough.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:21.000
But you were talking about free-to-play games earlier.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Yeah.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:29.000
And I've talked about this on our show a lot, especially with TARDIS Interruptus, but Doctor Who Legacy.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:35.000
It's actually a lot like that Marvel game you were talking about earlier.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:41.000
But it's a dual match-three kind of thing. And they're always cranking out content.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000
And you do not have to spend a cent to play it.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:48.000
That's awesome. That's so awesome. And, you know, it's not that I...

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:54.000
I like to give to games, you know, when, especially if I've dropped a lot of time in them, like Path of Exile.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.000
But I also realize that, you know, there's other ways that the companies can make money, too.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Like, be it maybe through ads in the game. Like, Flappy Bird was a free game, wasn't it?

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
And that guy's made a killing off of the ads alone, you know?

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
That's one way to kind of make the money and so forth.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.000
So I think it's really cool when you find just that right magic where it's like,

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:16.000
I can pay my people that are developing the game and make that tiny little bit of profit,

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:21.000
and yet still create a rich experience that rewards the people who put the time into it.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:24.000
It's a tricky balance, but that's so awesome when people can find it.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Yeah. I mean, they do. And, of course, there's time crystals and stuff that you can buy in the store, too.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:37.000
They have what they call a fan area. And if you make a purchase, that unlocks the fan area.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:43.000
And it's just some extra levels and different outfits for characters and things like that.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
So it's nothing important to the game, really, at all.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:55.000
But the neat thing is the developers and people that are working on this game are super fast at communicating back

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
if you get a hold of them about something.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Yeah.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Because they'll do unlock codes with various groups.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:10.000
And I think there was a comic shop over in the UK that had a special code to unlock the TARDIS as a playable character.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:14.000
And I just sent them an email or a tweet or something about,

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.000
you know, what about those of us that aren't in the UK able to go over and get this?

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
They're like, don't worry, it's going to drop.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:29.000
But the really neat thing is, you know, the season eight of Doctor Who premiered this weekend.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:36.000
And all season, they're going to be introducing new content each week, like levels that are themed on that episode.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Yeah, it's kind of neat. And three different skill levels.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.000
I mean, they're small, but it's just small stuff that they're releasing and it's a free game.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Well, and we were even talking about that a little bit earlier with the premium games where Shane was talking about Final Fantasy 11.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:58.000
You know, they do these very small patches, but it's enough to keep it going for another month until the next patch.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Not everything has to be a major ordeal. I mean, those are nice to have, too.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:07.000
But, you know, when you have the really small little things that give you a little extra content,

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.000
a little perk for your $12.95 or whatever you paid that month for a subscription model game,

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
it makes it so much more worth it.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Yeah, and they do a live stream Oedipo's TV about every week, and there's usually some giveaway codes there, too, to unlock stuff.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:33.000
But, yeah, I've spent more than a few bucks on it, but it's just because I've spent so much time with this game and I enjoy it.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:37.000
And, of course, it doesn't hurt that it's Doctor Who, either.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Well, Brad, I'll be looking forward to hearing more on the new Doctor Who on Pod Culture, possibly TARDIS Interruptus, on a future week.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Brad, you will be missed at Dragon Con very much.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:54.000
As apparently the whole crew, I didn't realize none of you guys were going this year. That's unfortunate.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Best of luck with the par six, but even if you don't win, you guys are still all winners, and we love having you guys here at the network.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Well, on the off chance that we do win, I hope that you would be kind enough to go up for us.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.000
I absolutely will, and I will have the fireball ready to go.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.000
There you go. All right, guys, talk to you later.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:16.000
All right, bye, Brad.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:17.000
Bye.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Always good to hear from our buddy Brad there from Pod Culture, Monday nights here at the Voice of the Geek's network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.000
I can probably squeeze in one other call, but I think, am I saying goodbye to Jamie is leaving?

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Yeah, got ahead. I have to get up early tomorrow because of good things.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:39.000
All right, well, good. DarkSakura, I'm glad to hear good things, even if it does mean getting up early.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Quickly, though, final thought for listeners tonight before I take another call here.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:45.000
Form your own opinion.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.000
All right. Don't be a follower, right?

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:49.000
Don't be a follower.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:50.000
All right.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Reject false icons.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:56.000
Fair enough. All right, let's see if I can squeeze in at least one more call here before we wrap up for tonight.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Howdy. My name is Ben. I do a little web series called Port Center, which you've probably never heard of.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:05.000
I have not, but I saw your name in chat earlier.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:09.000
Yeah, actually, this is the first time I've listened to your show at all.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:13.000
A friend of mine recommended that I tune in and catch you guys live, so I thought, yeah, why not?

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:14.000
You guys are a hoot.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Thank you.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Thank you.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Thank you.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:18.000
You're very welcome.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
We're usually a lot funnier when Shane's not here.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Burn.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Shane sounds suspiciously like a friend of mine called Jeff.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
I live in Los Angeles. I don't know the accent for you.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:33.000
And he sounds almost identical to the point that whenever I hear him, I think, what is Jeff doing on this show?

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:34.000
That's weird.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:38.000
I have my own plane, so I fly back and forth.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
It's like Scooby Doo.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:41.000
He teleports.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:44.000
He's going to pull off his mask, and it was Jeff the whole time.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Well, who's your friend that told you to listen? Because I want to give them an OLR Gold Star.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.000
There's my friend Marissa. I don't know if she's in the chat right now.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Marissa!

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Oh, shit. Marissa's got an entire collection of Gold Stars. She's got a bucket.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
She's got too many. Too many, I think.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
She can take the Gold Star challenge and dump it.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Marissa's ample bosoms are covered in Gold Stars.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Marissa's the best ever. She already knew that. There's literally nothing else I can give her.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Well, thanks, Marissa.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:13.000
But thank you for listening and tuning in. How can we help you tonight? What do you want to talk about?

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Well, actually, I recently did an episode of my show. I'm not going to plug my thing. That's crass.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:24.000
But I did an episode about the Addams Family video game that was based on the movie that came out in 1991.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:28.000
There was a game for the Sega Genesis and the Amiga and the Super Nintendo.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:32.000
It was a really solid kind of Mario-style platform game.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:39.000
And I've been thinking over the last couple of days about how there's this idea that a lot of people who play games have

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:42.000
where if it's a licensed game, it's going to be terrible.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:49.000
And I think that's not really... I don't think that's a fair kind of generalization to make about what is...

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:52.000
It's not really a subgenre, but it's a kind of a category of game is the licensed game.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
There's a lot of really solid stuff out there.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:01.000
So I thought maybe I'd ask you guys if you guys had any recommendations for licensed games or any games that were

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:06.000
licensed that you were expecting to basically be terrible. But it turns out, actually, they're not bad.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Well, since you brought up the Addams Family, I can't help but go here.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:16.000
If you're a fan of the Addams Family, I will say it produced easily one of the top three pinball tables of all time.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:19.000
I love the Addams Family pinball machine. Spectacular.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.000
The existence of the Addams Family pinball led to Twilight Zone. Directly led to Twilight Zone.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:27.000
It was Lawler did it.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.000
And in naming off the various ports of the Addams Family game,

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:35.000
regretfully, you missed the one on the NES that I enjoyed, which was Fester's Quest.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Now, a lot of people really kind of hammed on that game because it was basically Blaster Master, but without the 2D stuff.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:46.000
It was only kind of the overhead stuff, but they did it. They made like a Fester game out of it.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:51.000
So it really wasn't bad, especially now that it's so easy to go back and revisit some of those NES classics.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:56.000
But getting away from the Addams Family a little bit, as much as I freaking love those movies, by the way,

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
those are like the best movies. Some of the best movies came out of the 90s.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:06.000
I would say I think some of the all-time classics that are based on license have to do with Star Wars.

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:11.000
I think just last night, I was talking to a friend about the vector-based Star Wars game.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:15.000
That was the Atari. That game was incredible.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:21.000
I know I've brought this up before on the show, and some people kind of controversially, Super Star Wars.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Some people don't agree with me. I think it was Jason, wasn't it? Was not a fan of it.

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:28.000
But we kind of reached an understanding there. Are you thinking of something, Shane?

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Jeff has a suggestion here.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Yes, Jeff. What's your suggestion?

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:36.000
So, Gremlins 2 on regular Nintendo. So good.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
I remember that.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:43.000
That was a genuine, just a wonderful little top-down adventure game.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Yeah, and you threw tomatoes.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
And it had the lady gremlin in it.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:54.000
I'd actually say just things based off of anime series, because I was a big importer,

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:59.000
is I actually super liked the Rurouni Kenshin RPG that came out.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:03.000
I have the Blue Seed RPG, which is also really good.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:10.000
And the Macross Do You Remember Love? and VFX2 was really good.

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
So the Macross games were really good.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:17.000
I do want to say, though, I think the reason why a lot of licensed games get a lot of crap

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:23.000
is because they're trying to get out in time for the release of said movie or said TV show or what have you,

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:30.000
they're rushed. And if it's not able to sit in the oven long enough to cook properly, it's going to come out a little raw.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:34.000
It's just like that story we had earlier about the Super Smash Brothers,

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:37.000
where they're talking about the bugs and having to test every single possible combination.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.000
When you rush something, it's going to not have that quality process.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:47.000
The most classic example of all time is the E.T. game on the Atari 2600.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Howard Scott Warshaw, who was a magnificent programmer for Atari 2600,

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:56.000
created one of the best experiences on the console, the Yars Revenge.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:59.000
He had to turn that shit out in six weeks, and that's what you got. Shit.

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Because if somebody had bug processed that game and said,

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:06.000
you know, you really do fall down these holes one too many times,

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:10.000
you know, it could have been fixed, but it couldn't because of the aggressive schedule.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
I have another one. Jeff, do you have another one?

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:13.000
I have like a hundred actually.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Okay, yeah, I have a few more too. Go ahead.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Power Rangers the movie on Super Nintendo.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Of course.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:23.000
Great. Any Capcom Disney game on the NES for the most part?

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Oh, absolutely.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
All those were great.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:31.000
The X-Men game on Genesis, I don't remember what it was called, but it was really good.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:35.000
So just, I don't know, I can't actually help with that one.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:39.000
I would say Jurassic Park on both the Super Nintendo and the Genesis,

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:42.000
even though they were very different games, were both really not bad.

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Indiana Jones had an amazing arcade game that was so good.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:48.000
It was on the same engine.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Simpsons arcade game?

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Oh, yeah.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Oh, Simpsons arcade game. Spectacular.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:53.000
Ninja Turtles beat up.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
That's a classic.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
So, Ben, I mean, that's a lot.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:58.000
What about a newer game?

02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Can you think of a newer game?

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
No, because they're all awful.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:04.000
I think kind of a go-to, I mean, in terms of,

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:08.000
you mentioned before that sometimes it's because of release dates that these games have to be rushed out.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:12.000
An example of an awful licensed game where that wasn't the case is actually Deadpool,

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:15.000
because Activision told the developers during development,

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
we're not aiming for high review scores.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:18.000
We're looking for about a six out of ten.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:21.000
So that's one of the reasons why that game wasn't that good.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:25.000
But in terms of games, licensed games that are really solid,

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:30.000
I still kind of go to the gold standard for me for the last generation is Batman Arkham Asylum.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:33.000
It is such an enjoyable experience from start to finish.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Good choice. Very good choice. I would agree with that.

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:41.000
All those games, I mean, I'm looking forward to the next one that's coming out.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:44.000
They got pushed back to next year, but that's going to be great, too.

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:48.000
So, alright, Ben, I have to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:51.000
But, Ben, I'm a big supporter of indie broadcasters, indie podcasts.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:54.000
Go ahead. It's not crass. Plug your stuff. Come on.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Oh, thank you very much.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
It's a web series about change in video games.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:00.000
It's about interesting and unique ports and conversions of video games.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:03.000
You can find it online at portcenter.tv.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:07.000
It's portcenter, like SportsCenter, but without the S at the front, .tv.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.000
Alright, I love it. That's a cute little play on words you got there.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:13.000
Thanks so much for listening, Ben, and participating in calling in on your first night.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:16.000
See you this week, Ben. This is Jeff.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:19.000
I'll see you at D&D.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
Oh, maybe not.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
I knew it. You were a D&D player the whole time.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Now, if it's second edition, count me in.

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Alright. Alright, take care, Ben.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000
Bye.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Give Marissa a big hug, because you'll probably see her before we do, sadly.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
I might be seeing her on Monday. Maybe.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Lucky brat.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:37.000
Do my squeeze.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:38.000
Alright, take care, my friend.

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:39.000
See ya.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
Rob, I just saved your life.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:42.000
What? How? What'd you do?

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:43.000
I killed a Black Widow.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
Oh, are they in the house?

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:46.000
There was one in the bathroom.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
That's scary. So you saved Shane's life.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:49.000
I saved Shane's life.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
And Sanrio.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:55.000
That's scary. Alright, I'm going to make this call really quick, but I do want to fit in one more call before we go.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Hi, you're on Orange Falls Radio. Who's this?

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
It's the resident whore of anime conventions, Rama.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
Rama, you almost didn't get in tonight.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.000
We've had a lot of, like, returning and new callers tonight.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
It's kind of awesome.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:07.000
But we love you too, Rama.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
You'd be the whore if they paid you.

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:12.000
You're like the slut of anime cons.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
You pay your cover to get in.

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:15.000
I am an anime consul.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.000
So what Jamie is saying is, you are a whore, darlin'.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
And then how?

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
If he gets paid, he's the whore.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Alright, we're going to make this quick. Rama, what's on your mind? Quick.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:36.000
Look, I just got to say that the ALS Ice Water Challenge, originally, the challenge was happening, but people were picking whatever charity you wanted to go to.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:41.000
And then this. I've also been called out five times to do the challenge.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:49.000
Yeah, you need some sort of, like, achievement unlocked where people can see the trophy on your Facebook page where it's like,

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:53.000
or if somebody chooses not to participate, I think that's okay too.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Like, I kind of said, you know, I would choose to help charities in my own ways that I come up with.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:02.000
So, and that's what I do.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:06.000
But I'm not going to sit there and say, you guys do the ice bucket challenge, you're stupid.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
No, that's stupid. It's great.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
That's a story for another time.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:14.000
Because honestly, money is coming out. I think it's a good thing.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Now, last thing I want to get off my chest before I get out of here.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:21.000
I found your DragonCon solution. This is what you do.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:22.000
Alright.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:26.000
About a good forty, about a good fifteen, half hour before the panels.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:29.000
Get your drink on, okay? Seriously, get your drink on.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Well, that will be the entire weekend, but yes.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:35.000
Go down to that dance party, okay?

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Go up for about ten, fifteen minutes.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Leave. Go to the Twin Peaks one.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Leave. Go back to the dance party.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:47.000
It'll become a sausage fest and you can just sit there and laugh your ass off.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:51.000
No, in reality, Rama, they are at the same time.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:55.000
But the Twin Peaks panel is an hour and the LGBT thing is 5.5 hours.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:59.000
And let's be real, that community tends to run late to everything.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:02.000
So, I'm going to just go to the Twin Peaks thing and then go to the party,

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.000
which will probably just be starting at that time, to be real.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:06.000
So, that's my plan.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
That's all. There you go.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:13.000
But I appreciate the advice of a seasoned pro as well.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:16.000
I am no seasoned pro, good sir.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Rama, what do you think about Tokujir maybe getting skipped?

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:25.000
The fact, I can kind of understand because of the color of the outfits,

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
but this is Saban here.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:32.000
He's going to skip it because you got Dino Charge and Super Dino Charge,

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:36.000
AKA 52 episodes, which will be edited down to about...

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Forty.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
No, thirty. Fifteen per season.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:44.000
I'm still sitting here waiting for them to finish up with whatever the hell,

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
whatever the hell they want to call this crap.

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:49.000
So, I can sit here and rent and flip my table and call it a day.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:52.000
Why do you think I only stick to the Japanese ones?

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
I just like to sit and compare and be like, really?

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:59.000
But do I have to realize it's the same thing when it comes to Ninja Turtles,

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
all these other franchises.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Yeah, these producers may wreck it for us, but it ain't for us.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:08.000
It's for the average person that's going to sit there and watch it anyway.

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:12.000
So, no matter how much we bitch mode complain about how it's not like the source material.

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
They do not care about us.

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:18.000
They more care about the average user who's going to spend more money on it than what we will.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Because fifteen minutes in, we're going to be like, fuck this, I'm out.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Hey, at least they changed the pink Zord back to pink for Dino Charge instead of purple.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
So, that's nice of them.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:33.000
Point taken. So, are you picking up the Zoo Ranger box set?

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:38.000
No, I watched a little bit of that. I didn't really find it that interesting.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
I thought Die Ranger was better than Zoo Ranger.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
And if you want to hear this conversation continue,

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:47.000
tune into Anime Jam Session on Tuesday nights at the Boise Geese Network.

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:50.000
I get the hit, Rob.

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
I really need to go, so bye, Rajan.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Stop taking over this show with your Power Rangers chat.

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Bye, Rob. Bye, Jeff.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
Bye, Rama. Take care, buddy.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Nice meeting you.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:01.000
I will, as always.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:02.000
Bye.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:03.000
Alright, bye.

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:06.000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skyline. It was on fire tonight.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
I'm really sorry to those of you that didn't get through.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
Please consider sending us an email.

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:13.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send us an email.

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:17.000
Or you can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
You can even post on our Facebook page as well.

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
Send a carrier pigeon for all I care.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Just, you know, let us know you care.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
And that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:29.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and participating with the program.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
just tell a friend or five about the show.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Just like Marissa did, who got our gold star tonight for following,

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:41.000
I guess, not really following because it's not a demand.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
It's more of a request for granting.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
It's granting our request. No, you talking about Power Rangers.

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
That's a demand.

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
That didn't even make sense.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:53.000
Granting our request to tell a few people about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
It helps spread the word because we don't have a magazine

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
or a big publishing arm behind us.

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
We just have word of mouth.

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
Thanks for keeping it positive, too, you guys.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
You know, it's been a rough week.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:06.000
And I hope you guys got some positivity and some laughs out of tonight's show.

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:09.000
And we could bring some more positive things.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:12.000
So even if you don't feel like telling people you listen to OLR,

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:15.000
at least try to spread some positivity out there

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:18.000
because it's a really, it can be a really shitty world sometimes.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
And, you know, just don't be a part of it.

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:23.000
So before I close up shop tonight, though,

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
I got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
Shane, despite all the shit I give you on the show,

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:30.000
you know, you're kind of awesome sometimes.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
All the time. And I'm always right.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
And I really appreciate you filling in tonight in a pinch.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
Especially since it's way past my bedtime.

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Do you have anything you want to plug before you go to bed?

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Power Rangers.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
All right. And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:42.000
Power Rangers.

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
Power Rangers. All right.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:48.000
And my final thought tonight is, oh, my gosh,

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:51.000
I'm leaving in, like, less than 72 hours.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:54.000
I might be freaking out just a little bit.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:58.000
Anyway, I can't wait to see many of you at Dragon Con.

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
And for those of you guys that are going to other conventions this weekend,

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
or even if you're just staying at home and having a barbecue,

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
I hope you have a fantastic, long weekend.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:07.000
And we'll be back in two weeks to do it all again

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
Have a wonderful night, everybody. Good night.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:14.000
