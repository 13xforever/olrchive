7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Chills abound as the PT demo brought scares to those of the PS4 and to your favorite streaming sites to those without.
19000	23000	And that was only a single reveal in another busy week of news following an overseas gaming convention.
23000	27000	We have the full report as well as your calls, tweets, and emails on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live on this August the 17th of 2014 with the 564th episode of our show.
44000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts joining you here at the Voice of the Geek's Network, vognetwork.com
49000	55000	where we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
55000	59000	If you are listening live, join us and chat. Live.vognetwork.com
59000	66000	But meanwhile, we have our other hosts here in studio and it would be pretty boring if we didn't have an eclectic amount of voices here in studio.
66000	73000	And we've got quite the panel tonight you guys, starting off with the one and only, the happiest bunny on the farm as I used to say years and years ago.
73000	75000	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
75000	77000	I'm a little shrieky today.
77000	81000	Yes, you're the scariest bunny on the farm today, or the most scared I guess.
81000	83000	Surprised, surprised. I was surprised.
84000	86000	Having my flesh eaten was surprising.
86000	92000	So obviously you're talking about the PT demo, which we're going to talk about a little more in depth in just a moment here.
92000	94000	But I have to introduce as well, Techmaster Loki.
94000	95000	Hi.
95000	96000	Hi Loki, how are you?
96000	97000	I'm fine.
97000	98000	Yeah?
98000	99000	Yeah.
99000	103000	Good deal. What did you bring to eat tonight? I heard you complaining as you walked in that you didn't get what you wanted.
103000	108000	No, I wanted to go to gym boys, but the family didn't leave in time and they left.
109000	113000	I normally would have left earlier, so I'd be able to get over there early enough.
113000	117000	But they ended up leaving five minutes before I normally leave.
117000	121000	And I had a list of chores I had to do before I left.
121000	123000	You're how old and you have chores?
123000	124000	Clean your room!
124000	129000	Well, I had to make a lunch for my son for school and then I had to bring in the laundry.
129000	133000	And then, oh by the way, the car's out of gas.
133000	139000	So I ended up stopping at Jack in the Box because it's attached to the gas station.
139000	143000	But I wanted to get gym boys. That's where I was going to go.
143000	144000	I'm sorry.
144000	145000	I was going to bring you tacos.
145000	147000	I'm sorry you were robbed of tacos.
147000	154000	For what it's worth, I had tacos on Friday because my friend Monet, she loves tacos, so we went over there and had tacos.
154000	157000	And then she was performing in the Showgirls live.
157000	161000	Yes, the hideous movie from the 90s that's so bad it's good.
161000	164000	They were doing a midnight screening and she was part one of the dancers.
164000	165000	Nasty fuck music.
165000	167000	It was so funny though. I loved it. It was great.
167000	171000	Had a great time at the Trash Filmorgy as they call it in downtown Sacramento.
171000	173000	Sounds dirty, doesn't it? But we had a good time.
173000	176000	Is that like the Spike and Mike thing that they used to do?
176000	178000	No, well, I mean Spike and Mike's another thing they do there.
178000	181000	It's probably a very similar crowd, but Spike and Mike I think travels around.
181000	185000	Spike and Mike, I haven't been to that in a long time, but I don't know if they do it anymore.
185000	190000	I went a few years in a row and it's like, wow, this is almost the same shit that was here last year.
190000	192000	Yeah, I haven't heard it advertised in a while. I don't know if it's still a thing.
192000	194000	Maybe somebody in chat knows. I don't know.
194000	197000	But we have more people in studio here to say hello to.
197000	202000	And I want to introduce this guy first because he's what you'd call a fan favorite.
202000	206000	He isn't on the show all the time, but when he's here it's always a lovely surprise.
206000	211000	Say hello everybody to Jamie's husband. Dan is here tonight.
211000	212000	Sup?
212000	213000	Hey Dan, how you doing?
213000	214000	Good.
214000	218000	Yeah. What's new? Gosh, you haven't been on the show in a while.
218000	221000	You haven't been here since we moved to this place. I know that for sure.
221000	222000	Kind of was.
222000	225000	Did you? Well, yeah, you poked your head in for two seconds one episode.
225000	228000	But were you ever at the old apartment that we had?
228000	229000	Yes.
229000	230000	One time?
230000	231000	Couple times.
231000	232000	He was on the floor.
232000	234000	It was lame. It scared me out of being on the show.
234000	237000	I know, right? But here isn't this much nicer? Sort of?
237000	238000	Yeah.
238000	240000	It's all right. It's all right. How you been?
240000	241000	Good.
241000	243000	Yeah? What games you been playing lately?
244000	249000	A lot of great Autosport. I played that Kingdom Hearts high def remake.
249000	251000	And that game is still bad.
251000	253000	Wait, wait, wait. You don't like Kingdom Hearts?
253000	254000	The camera is still bad.
254000	256000	No, I don't like Kingdom Hearts.
256000	259000	You know, that could get you beat up in some circles.
259000	261000	Oh, I'm so worried.
262000	265000	I liked Kingdom Hearts 2, what I played of it.
265000	268000	That game was a lot more fun. It was basically a lot more streamlined.
268000	271000	I was hoping with this remake they had cleaned it up a little bit.
271000	275000	And they did. It looks like a really good PS2 game.
275000	277000	And the thing about Kingdom Hearts 2? Tron.
277000	278000	Yeah.
278000	282000	Are you going to be picking up the HD remix in December, I think it is?
282000	283000	Yeah, we already ordered it.
283000	284000	Gotcha.
285000	288000	So, are you going to give in to Jamie's demands for a PlayStation 4?
288000	290000	Or what's happening on that front?
292000	296000	PlayStation 4 is doable. Wii U is still kind of like, eh.
296000	300000	Yeah, what's up with Wii U? What's your love-hate relationship with Wii U like?
302000	309000	It's a Nintendo system. There's about six games on it that look pretty decent.
309000	314000	And it's like 300 bucks, which I think is too much for it.
314000	319000	But, you know, a lot of people love it. It's got a couple cool things going on.
319000	322000	What is the retro remix? The NES remix?
322000	323000	The NES remix, yeah.
323000	325000	That pretty much tries to sell me one.
325000	328000	Just, eh, there's just not much consoling me.
328000	331000	You know, I'm not like, oh my god, the new systems look so great.
331000	336000	Now that I don't work at game stores, I don't feel compelled to go out there and be like,
336000	342000	okay, here's my $500 for this, and here's my $400 for that, and here's my $400 for this.
342000	345000	Let's be real, Danny. You used to get some of that shit for free.
346000	348000	I never got consoles for free.
348000	349000	Oh, really?
349000	351000	No, it's the motherfuckers who work at those stores now get them for free.
351000	352000	Oh.
352000	357000	I quit, and then like a year later, like, here's a PlayStation 4 and an Xbox 3 server.
357000	362000	Xbox, whatever the fuck it is now, won, and ten games for each! Yay!
362000	366000	And I was just like, I had to win my Xbox 360, which I did.
366000	369000	By fucking some guys up in video game trivia.
369000	370000	Awesome.
370000	371000	It was unholy.
371000	372000	Awesome.
372000	374000	Going to our chat room over at live.vodnetwork.com.
374000	378000	We have many regulars in chat who remember Dan, who are saying hello.
378000	379000	Lots of greetings there.
379000	382000	We have Bobby Blackwolf who says, Dan, coffee.
382000	385000	Coffee. Dan, coffee.
385000	386000	Yeah, Rob, where's my coffee?
386000	388000	What's the, what's, go make it yourself.
388000	389000	What's the-
389000	390000	Get in the kitchen, wench.
390000	395000	What's the most annoying food request that Dark Sakura has?
398000	399000	Coffee.
399000	400000	Coffee, alright.
400000	403000	Now, believe it or not, Dan, I know you've been-
403000	404000	I don't believe it.
404000	408000	I know you've been following this show on and off for the 12 years we've been doing it, because, well, you kind of have to.
408000	409000	No.
409000	412000	But we actually have new listeners.
412000	416000	You know, we get a few new ones every week, so some people don't know who you are.
416000	418000	Up to 15 steady listeners.
418000	419000	That's right.
419000	420000	Orange Lounge Radio.
420000	421000	One a year.
421000	422000	Love it or not.
422000	423000	We started with three.
423000	427000	On the air for a dozen years with dozens and dozens of fans.
427000	430000	Hundreds and hundreds of people who have listened at one time or the other.
430000	431000	Yeah.
431000	436000	So, Dan, what would you say, what kind of gamer are you?
436000	438000	What are your favorite video games?
438000	439000	What do you like to play the most?
439000	443000	At this point in my life, I'm definitely a retro gamer.
443000	445000	I don't really play a lot of new stuff.
445000	447000	When I do play a lot of new stuff, it's mostly racing.
447000	449000	You know, I've got Grid Autosport.
449000	451000	I've got a set of Corsa.
451000	452000	I'll probably get Project Cars.
452000	454000	Yeah, I was going to say, what do you think about Project Cars?
454000	455000	Looks great.
455000	457000	Has a lot of possibility.
457000	462000	I won't be getting it on a console, because new steering wheels are like $400 apiece.
462000	464000	I've already got a $600 steering wheel.
464000	467000	That should work on PlayStation 4 if I go that way.
467000	472000	But since I have a triple screen set up for my PC, fuck the PS4.
472000	475000	Well, looking in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com,
475000	478000	SSG100Matt says, Dan will get the system with the best racing games.
478000	482000	I was going to allude to Xbox One for Forza Horizon 2.
482000	483000	Well, Horizon sucks.
483000	485000	I love Horizon.
485000	487000	Okay, Horizon's fine.
487000	494000	If you're into the more sort of like Project Othomy, Casual Racer.
494000	495000	I can't play the real shit.
495000	496000	Oh no, I'm with you.
496000	499000	I don't play the sim games as sims.
499000	502000	You know, when I play Gran Turismo, I kind of dummy it down.
502000	504000	But it's the amount of content.
504000	512000	It's the, you know, 10 different racing disciplines and 12,000 cars and 600 tracks,
512000	513000	and you can race through your neighborhood.
513000	516000	Horizon is a cool game, it's just not as good as Forza.
516000	518000	I love Forza 5 in theory.
518000	519000	It looks great.
519000	521000	I just don't own an Xbox One.
521000	527000	And if it turned out that, oh yeah, you can use your T500RS on the Xbox One,
527000	529000	they might have suckered me in.
529000	530000	But no.
530000	534000	Now, here's the thing, Dan, and I don't know if this would change your mind on the Wii U,
534000	542000	but I know for me this is the thing I just, I don't know what has to be sacrificed to the devil to make this happen,
542000	545000	but F-Zero Wii U, yes or no?
545000	547000	I wouldn't buy a system for it.
547000	548000	Really?
548000	552000	If I was going to buy a system for a Nintendo racing title, I probably would have bought it for Mario Kart.
552000	557000	And if I had more of a steady local multiplayer community, I might have anyway.
557000	558000	Eh, it's Mario Kart.
558000	559000	I played it. I liked it.
559000	560000	It was fun.
560000	561000	It has a lot of personality.
561000	563000	It's Mario Kart.
563000	564000	It's good.
564000	565000	You can't go wrong.
565000	570000	I'll play it on my GameCube or my Wii or my SNES or my Game Boy Brands or my DS.
571000	576000	By the time the Wii U version of F-Zero ever comes out, you'd probably pick up one of those GX cabinets,
576000	579000	or I'm sorry, the AX cabinets for a decent cost.
579000	580000	I don't know about that.
580000	581000	No.
581000	582000	They didn't make a lot of those.
582000	583000	All six of them.
583000	584000	Yeah.
584000	585000	Alright, let's see.
585000	587000	Tiger Claw says, Dan has a $600 racing wheel.
587000	592000	Has he tried playing those driving sims on the PC with it, like Euro Truck Simulator?
592000	593000	I have.
593000	594000	Have you?
594000	601000	I picked up Euro Truck Simulator on a Humble Bundle, and it's insanely bad.
601000	608000	And actually, the Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is a vast improvement, was also on a Humble Bundle recently,
608000	610000	and I didn't get it.
610000	614000	But I should have, because the problem was, it was the bonus game.
614000	617000	So it's like, donate this much or more.
617000	619000	And I'm like, fuck charity.
619000	622000	They have, what is it, spinning tires is supposed to be pretty good too,
622000	628000	like if you're really into hill climbing and stuff like that, it's supposed to be really realistic.
628000	630000	Dan, I can't believe you'd say that about charity.
630000	632000	I had this bucket of ice water ready to go for you.
632000	633000	Woo.
633000	634000	Alright.
634000	639000	Dan will be commenting throughout the night, of course, as he tends to do, on whatever is going on in the news.
639000	642000	But I also want to say hello to a familiar face here.
642000	644000	I'm sure many of you guys have heard this guy pop in week after week.
644000	646000	Say hello, everybody, to Shane.
646000	647000	Hello.
647000	648000	Hi, Shane, how are you?
648000	649000	I'm fine.
649000	650000	You don't want me to finish your intro, huh?
650000	651000	Nope.
651000	652000	Alright, what's new with you?
652000	653000	How have you been in the past couple weeks?
653000	657000	I just got a shiny, like, 30 minutes ago in Pokemon, so I'm pretty pumped up.
657000	659000	Pokemon's still not old for you.
659000	660000	It never will be.
660000	661000	Why not?
661000	662000	Because it's Pokemon.
662000	665000	It's like, are you going to get tired of breathing air?
665000	667000	He hasn't caught them all.
667000	668000	No, I have, actually.
668000	669000	I do have them all.
669000	670000	I don't have them all shiny.
670000	672000	He hasn't caught them all shiny.
672000	673000	I do not have them all shiny.
673000	674000	Is that your mission?
674000	675000	No.
675000	679400	I only want the ones I like shiny, and then every other shiny I get's just, I guess a
679400	683000	bonus unless it's a crappy one, then it's, like, not as good a bonus.
683000	684000	Trading fodder?
684000	687000	No, I'll still keep it, because it's shiny.
687000	692540	Um, are you looking forward to the new, I don't know, the new old Pokemon games that
692540	693540	are coming out?
693540	698540	I wasn't, and then they started releasing more stuff, like new mega evolutions or whatever,
698540	699540	and it got me excited.
699540	706780	So yes, I'm already, like, I'm ready to go with a Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
706780	712340	In our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, act-dev says, Shane, if you find a shiny Hawlucha,
712340	713340	let me know.
713340	714340	Did I say that right?
714340	717820	Yes, you did, and I'm actually in that area right now looking for a different shiny, so
717820	722100	I'll let you know, and then I will keep it.
722100	723100	You'll just rub it in.
723100	724100	You'll be like, I got one.
724100	728660	Well, not to rub it in, but, like, if I got two shinies, then yeah, I could trade one.
729060	734260	I just got a shiny Bunnelby, which is adorable, and doesn't look like he's been playing in
734260	735260	poop.
735260	740260	And SSG100ManChat says, every other shiny Shane doesn't want becomes a coat.
740260	742740	How many Osh-Watts have you bred trying to get a shiny one?
742740	744260	I am nearing 1,000.
744260	746620	Oh my gosh.
746620	749460	So you've made Osh-Watt coats for all the poor kids in the neighborhood?
749460	755660	Well, the rich kids first, and then the ones that aren't quite as well made go to the poor
755660	756660	kids.
756660	757660	All right, fair enough.
757660	760460	I think all the kids in Pokemon are in the same income bracket.
760460	764660	They can all afford just to wander the countryside waiting to fight each other.
764660	769660	All right, now Shane is here in studio because I know he's dying to, because he's not going
769660	770660	to stay for the whole show.
770660	771660	No, no.
771660	775100	But I know he's dying to talk about our kickoff topic tonight, and the kickoff topic I want
775100	779340	to talk about tonight before we get into our gaming weeks is a interactive demo that was
779340	786340	released a little bit stealthily on the PlayStation 4 marketplace this week, but as people figured
786340	790980	out what it really was, this game gained more and more steam, and I'm talking about
790980	792980	a lot, a lot, a lot of steam.
792980	799700	And I don't know about you guys, but I have friends, especially the extended OLR family,
799700	803660	people like Shane, maybe not the host directly on this show, but people like Shane, people
803660	809520	like Extrovert over on Hoard House, people like our number one fan Flaco Jones, all those
809520	812860	folks have been obsessed with PT.
812860	814100	Would that be a fair statement, Shane?
814100	815100	You're obsessed with PT.
815100	817860	I was texting about PT, but yes.
817860	820780	Who were you texting just now about PT?
820780	821780	Christopher.
821780	827620	So, okay, so PT, and this is a slight spoiler, but honestly, if you guys have followed video
827620	830940	game news, I don't see how you guys have avoided this news at this point, but I apologize if
830940	832380	I'm ruining anything for you.
832380	836420	PT is a interactive demo for the new Silent Hill game in disguise.
836420	837420	What?
837420	838420	I know, right?
838420	840980	You didn't just see the trailer 30 minutes ago in the other room.
840980	842300	I read about it online.
842460	849140	They're calling Silent Hills, which is being presented by Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro,
849140	852860	and Norman Reedus, who a lot of people know from The Walking Dead, he's going to be the
852860	860180	face model of the guy who Dan said should be just playing Solid Snake.
860180	863420	When they show him in the game and he kind of turns his head, I was like, you know, he
863420	866900	could play a live action Solid Snake fairly convincingly.
866900	871100	What if it was Solid Snake that turned his head at the very end?
871100	873900	That would be terrible.
873900	874900	Silent Hill.
876900	880060	Silent Hill, the S stands for snake.
880060	881060	You never know.
881060	882060	Okay.
882060	883580	So Shane, what is it about that?
883580	888540	Because seriously, I'm seeing on Twitter people like Xtavor and other people, I think Captain
888540	891340	Spike from Gamebooyah.org has been talking favorably about this too, and some other people
891340	896060	I follow on Twitter, some are calling it the game of the year, which is a weird thing to
896060	899140	see because it's like a free demo.
899140	901700	But on the other hand, I also kind of get it.
901700	903280	I'm in that camp.
903280	904620	Right now it's my game of the year.
904620	911140	It has surpassed the entirety of Infamous Second Son and is now right now my game of
911140	912140	the year.
912140	913860	So why?
913860	921700	Because I think just the way they, it's everything about the way they introduced it, the feelings
921700	924100	it evoked while I was playing it.
924140	926620	I was legitimately scared the first time I was playing it.
926620	932220	And even when we were just playing it 30 minutes ago, I was still like kind of on my, on the
932220	937020	edge of my seat, even though I knew what was coming, except some things that happened were
937020	938660	not things I realized that were going to happen.
938660	939660	There was a surprise.
939660	940660	Yeah.
940660	941660	Yeah.
941660	942660	We had some surprises.
942660	943660	And that's the thing.
943660	945500	Nobody has figured out the pattern to the game.
945500	947700	I personally haven't even beaten it yet.
947700	952060	So like, you can't, you have to do a series of events at the end too.
952060	954900	I don't want to get too much into the weeds on that for people who haven't experienced
954900	959180	yet, but you have to get a certain, there are triggers, let's say on fifth dream already
959180	963620	spoiled it for everyone in the chat room, fifth dream, spank, spank, spank, spank.
963620	964620	It's online.
964620	965620	Yeah.
965620	966620	He's not accurate.
966620	967620	If you really want to know it's out there.
967620	968620	Well, so that's the thing.
968620	969620	Yeah.
969620	970620	Nobody's definitively solved it.
970620	971620	Even though we might've had that posted.
971620	977500	There are, there are three things in on the very last part of the game that have to happen.
977500	981100	The first one, everybody knows how to get that to happen.
981100	982100	That's easy.
982100	983620	We, we, we've all figured that out.
983620	986580	It's 100% confirmed proven.
986580	989340	The second one, no clue.
989340	991120	The second one can lead into the third one.
991120	994740	If it does, then we know how to beat it, but you have to get that second thing to happen.
994740	999100	And if you can't get it to happen the right way, then you're just stuck.
999100	1002420	I still have no idea how I remotely did it.
1002420	1003420	So yeah.
1003420	1006780	Uh, dark soccer, you experienced this demo for the first time just earlier this evening.
1007660	1011700	And you are the first person in this household to beat it.
1011700	1014220	So which we don't know by accident.
1014220	1020060	She stood on Shane's shoulders, Shane did all the first parts of it.
1020060	1021060	Shane beat the demo.
1021060	1024820	Jamie was holding the controller and then he's like, I don't want to play this part
1024820	1025820	anymore here.
1025820	1026820	I'm like, okay.
1026820	1028580	So what did you think?
1028580	1034340	I think that I'm going to punch eyeless bitch in the face next time.
1034340	1037140	You know what's interesting about it?
1037140	1040440	It doesn't prompt you at all.
1040440	1041620	It doesn't tell you how to do anything.
1041620	1043220	It doesn't say press X to do this.
1043220	1045700	It doesn't say press up or down.
1045700	1048420	It kind of says press X to do this at one point.
1048420	1049420	I don't know.
1049420	1050420	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1050420	1057420	It lets you dive in and wander around and discover things in a finite world.
1057420	1059620	Finding the picture piece scared me the first time.
1059620	1061420	That was the first thing that scared me.
1061420	1062940	That scared the piss out of her.
1062940	1064180	She peed a little bit.
1065020	1068020	Are you in my pants right now?
1068020	1070740	And if so, why?
1070740	1075500	Well since I'm not wearing any, I'll leave you two to be a little later.
1075500	1076500	I'm not wearing pants, Rob.
1076500	1077500	Yeah, I can see that.
1077500	1078500	No pants.
1078500	1079500	I'm wearing a skirt.
1079500	1080500	I know.
1080500	1081500	Okay.
1081500	1083900	So this demo comes out and after about six hours, even less, people have figured out
1083900	1084900	what it is.
1084900	1087740	And Shane texts me, calls me and is like, Rob, you have to do live stream.
1087740	1088740	Rob, you have to do live stream.
1088740	1089740	Rob, what are you going to live stream?
1089740	1090740	Rob, what time are you coming out?
1090740	1091980	Cause you're going to freak out.
1091980	1093280	So everybody wants to see that.
1093280	1097440	So sure enough, I go on Twitch and I do a live stream and yes, there were parts of the
1097440	1102160	demo that scared the crap out of me, but then we weren't able to beat it.
1102160	1105280	Like we could, and I was on a timer cause we had a whorehouse, huh?
1105280	1106280	We didn't beat it.
1106280	1107280	No.
1107280	1108280	Oh, you said we weren't able.
1108280	1109280	We weren't able to beat it.
1109280	1113400	There's also seeing her in the bathroom and I actually was going to laugh.
1113400	1116840	I wanted to laugh my ass off when the baby started talking.
1116840	1119320	Yeah, that's a pretty funny part.
1119320	1120320	Let's see.
1120320	1122400	We're going to live.vognetwork.com.
1122400	1124280	Lots of comments on this in our chat room.
1124280	1128280	Act Def says Guillermo del Toro participating in this project has me sold on it.
1128280	1133120	You know, very interesting how much hype this, I mean, this is getting a lot of hype.
1133120	1135680	I have not seen this much hype for a demo in a long time.
1135680	1138440	It took over all the news at Gamescom.
1138440	1141800	Once this came out, nobody cared anymore about Gamescom, I think.
1141800	1143800	Well behold that thought cause we will cover the Gamescom news later.
1143800	1144800	Well, I'm not going to be here first.
1144800	1145800	I'll talk about it if I want.
1145800	1147440	I'll be at Taco Bell.
1147440	1148960	But well, but here's the thing.
1148960	1153240	It's interesting too, because you have Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro, Norman Reedus,
1153240	1155160	which you know, that, that excites a lot of people.
1155160	1158240	And something I need to sacrifice to get a Kiriyamaoka back.
1158240	1159280	And that's, that's the thing.
1159280	1162560	It's making people kind of forget that who's not involved.
1162560	1163560	No it's not.
1163560	1164560	Where do you see that?
1164560	1169300	I see people just praying to everything they can pray to that he's going to show up.
1169300	1174620	And if he doesn't, whoever did the sound for the demo, I have to give a lot of credit to
1174620	1182900	because it sounded like a Silent Hill game that was not downpour.
1182900	1186740	But I see, it seems like the excitement for this is, is higher than any game in the Silent
1186740	1188100	Hill series is like four.
1188100	1192220	So it's like the first game probably where Yamoka is not involved, that people are excited
1192220	1193220	for.
1193220	1194220	Yeah, I can agree.
1194220	1195220	Yeah.
1195220	1198620	We're still sacrificing things to get him to show up somehow.
1198620	1199620	Let's see.
1199620	1202140	Tigerclaw says, I'd be surprised if the game of the year goes to a horror game.
1202140	1203940	When was the last time that happened?
1203940	1204940	The Walking Dead?
1204940	1205940	Yeah.
1205940	1206940	Well, I don't know.
1206940	1208780	The Walking, I don't know if you'd count that horror though.
1208780	1209780	Some would say this is more adventure.
1209780	1210780	And it's The Last of Us.
1210780	1212020	Oh, The Last of Us?
1212020	1213020	Kind of a horror game?
1213020	1214020	Oh, you probably heard it.
1214020	1215020	That's right.
1215020	1218020	Um, I was going to say, we don't need the full game to get game of the year.
1218020	1220260	This demo is going to get game of the year.
1220260	1225940	So I'm just glad that Konami has something that they're actually releasing other than
1225940	1231340	Metal Gear Solid because it seriously, they have that in Pro Evo, I'm like, man, they're
1231340	1235300	going to go out of business if they don't have any good, you know, I mean, yeah, Metal
1235300	1239260	Gear is going to do well for them, but it was literally the only thing on their slate.
1239260	1245420	It's like, okay, Metal Gear and Pro Evo happened to Konami.
1245420	1250700	They're all, um, I know they do a lot of workout equipment and gym stuff and gambling stuff
1250700	1251700	in Japan.
1251700	1256500	If they release, you know, this, if they release Metal Gear in the first part of the year and
1256500	1259580	you know, this at the end, I mean, that's a pretty good year for Konami.
1260100	1264140	So, um, SGA 100 Matt says it's probably the most brilliant way to promote or announce
1264140	1265140	a game.
1265140	1267180	Fifth Dream says it's not even a game.
1267180	1271260	It's a demo at best, but it's effing scary in a way that impresses me.
1271260	1275740	So, uh, Tiger Claw says maybe demo of the year if there is such a category.
1275740	1279980	Um, Bobby Black Wolf reemphasizing Konami does a lot of business in the gambling sector.
1279980	1280980	They're doing fine.
1280980	1282620	Um, let's see.
1282620	1284580	Oh, how is it not a game?
1284580	1285620	I want to know that.
1285620	1287700	What makes it not a game?
1287700	1290500	I don't know if I agree with that comment, but everybody gets a voice.
1290500	1294980	So I wanted to say, say that the wrong, well, maybe we'll get more thoughts on that.
1294980	1295980	It's a game.
1295980	1298180	It's a very short game.
1298180	1302780	And I would also say, yeah, it's a short game, but as they pointed out at the end, it has
1302780	1304340	nothing to do with the main title.
1304340	1307780	So this whole story that's going on is self-contained.
1307780	1312060	And I mean, there's resolution enough as much as you've ever took that hallway and made
1312060	1313580	it a hundred levels long.
1313580	1315780	So would that be a game?
1315780	1316780	Yeah.
1316780	1319940	If it's something different happening every time.
1319940	1322260	How many of, how many of us have played the red room?
1322260	1329220	I mean, don't shit your pants as a game and that's just one screen, maybe two.
1329220	1330220	You played, what was it?
1330220	1331220	The, what was it?
1331220	1332220	The Crimson room.
1332220	1333220	Wasn't that what it was?
1333220	1335500	It's just a little flash game where you're stuck in a room.
1335500	1339500	Well, it could have been, you know, a follow up to, you know, silent Hill four of the room.
1339500	1342620	I mean, it's kind of a room, few rooms in a hallway.
1342620	1346740	This is silent Hill, the hallway, um, silent Hill five.
1346780	1349140	Just a couple other comments I want to get out here.
1349140	1355020	Kaijuto in chat says, uh, I haven't seen this much hype for a demo since destiny.
1355020	1358700	Maybe sort of a hinting there that maybe it hasn't been that long since we've had a huge
1358700	1359700	look at ground zeros.
1359700	1361340	That was a pretty well.
1361340	1364460	And then I thought this was a nice kind of comment here to end on here.
1364460	1370220	Act F says, you know, ground zeros should have been what PT was.
1370220	1371580	Very interesting comment.
1371580	1376660	Could they have released PT as a commercial game the way they did ground zeros or
1376700	1380900	if it was that short, no, I would have felt quite ripped off or would rage.
1380900	1382820	They would rage.
1382820	1383940	Maybe if it was like a dollar.
1383940	1384940	Yeah.
1384940	1388540	Or if like, what's the minimum price, five, $10 these days, maybe add a little more to
1388540	1392460	it, but for free, it's a great value for sure.
1392460	1398060	Can't you beat ground zeros, uh, in just a few minutes, I think they said, can you, I
1398060	1399060	don't know.
1399060	1400060	I thought it was a couple hours.
1400060	1404580	Well, and then I was going to say the first day that PT was out and me and Flacco Jones
1404580	1409140	and his wife were playing it, we played it for five hours trying to beat it.
1409140	1412520	And we had, I mean, that was when we didn't look at any spoilers or anything.
1412520	1413740	So we were going through it.
1413740	1415180	So we spent five hours on a game.
1415180	1418060	We didn't our demo, whatever you want to call it that we didn't beat.
1418060	1421220	And I know ground zeros like does not take that long.
1421220	1426420	So why should that be 30 and then PT only be a dollar when we had more, more time spent
1426420	1427420	on it.
1427420	1428420	Interesting.
1428420	1431700	Well, I think the fact that they sold ground zeros anyways is just kind of lame.
1431700	1434140	The fact that it was 30 bucks was also very lame.
1434140	1437020	So I'm kind of glad they didn't go that route.
1437020	1438020	Yeah.
1438020	1443660	I'm I, I kind of wonder if maybe Konami should just release ground zeros for free and if
1443660	1446380	that would have gotten as much hype as PT had, I don't know.
1446380	1447380	Yeah.
1447380	1448380	So Konami must have been awesome.
1448380	1451600	Konami must be a screwed around with some different ideas there.
1451600	1454600	But anyway, I do want to move into how was your gaming week, but just quickly, some kind
1454600	1458180	of final thoughts on a PT Loki, you haven't really played it yet, huh?
1458180	1459180	I just watched the video.
1459180	1461460	What'd you think of the whole thing and kind of how it was done there?
1461460	1462460	I don't know.
1462460	1465380	All I saw in the video was just the end.
1465380	1468720	So it looks neat.
1468720	1472940	I am, I gotta say for me personally, I'm really excited for the next silent Hill game and
1472940	1477520	I kind of, I've loved the silent Hill series, but I've always just kind of been, Oh yeah,
1477520	1478520	that game.
1478520	1479520	Oh yeah.
1479520	1481780	And I haven't kind of been detached from it for the past few games.
1481780	1484540	So this is a really good way to like attention.
1484540	1485540	Get back over here.
1485540	1487540	You're a fan of silent Hill.
1487540	1491500	I'm curious to see what the trailers are going to be like, because you know, Kojima, he likes
1491540	1495420	doing his like vignettes for the fucking trailers.
1495420	1496420	Yeah.
1496420	1501380	I'm hoping this will be a big E3 presence next year, but who knows?
1501380	1504300	Dan, quick thoughts on the final thoughts on that.
1504300	1505300	It was awesome.
1505300	1506300	You know, I'd only read about it.
1506300	1508300	So today was the first time I saw it.
1508300	1509420	Really, really.
1509420	1512900	I mean, I could see that being a whole game.
1512900	1516700	You know, where you walk around an area, you have to do different things.
1516700	1520580	I mean, there was a lot of, there are a lot of things you could look at that demo.
1520580	1523780	There were a lot of touches that you're not going to catch your first, your second, your
1523780	1524780	10th time through.
1524780	1529540	Um, and like I was saying, if that thing was, if that hallway had a hundred repetitions,
1529540	1533420	but you managed to work enough different content into it, I think it'd be awesome.
1533420	1538100	I don't have as much confidence that the next silent Hill game will be like that.
1538100	1546220	Uh, cause that would be a radical departure, but I think that the PT was, it was pretty
1546220	1547220	good.
1547220	1550380	What was interesting is that even though, yes, it would be a radical departure, you
1550380	1554020	know, a lot of people have been noticing that it probably that demos in particular
1554020	1558420	has more in common with silent Hill, the room than anything else, which is weird because
1558420	1561620	the room was sort of that disconnected silent Hill game.
1561620	1567020	But you know, like I really, I still really like disconnected game that God slapped into
1567020	1568020	it.
1568020	1569020	Yeah, it was.
1569020	1570020	I'm just worried.
1570020	1571020	This is going to try.
1571020	1574480	They're trying to pull like a Bioshock infinite with this where it's just like, Oh, it's infinite
1574480	1576900	universes and then we're going to tie them all together.
1576900	1579020	It's like, okay, I don't know.
1579020	1581900	Uh, Jamie, last thoughts on the teaser.
1581900	1586460	Uh, it just, it made me shriek.
1586460	1591540	So not like loudly, not like, you know, yeah, it wasn't enough where I could hear it over
1591540	1592540	here.
1592540	1593540	I didn't see it.
1593540	1594540	It was loud.
1594540	1595540	It was just high pitched.
1595540	1600740	I know even though bringing him back is going to be very like kind of cliche and doesn't
1600740	1602020	really fit in the story.
1602020	1609260	I do fully anticipate and hope that they bring back a full HD pyramid head for, uh,
1609260	1612820	some people like Shane's over there going, no, no, no, I don't want that.
1612820	1613820	So people really don't want that.
1613820	1616140	It'd just be out of character with what they just showed.
1616140	1621340	Like a realistic, they've already said that they want this game to be truly horrifying.
1621340	1626520	Uh, even to the point where the product is not commercially viable, this would be a really
1626520	1627520	cool sort of thing.
1627520	1630740	Now, if they do what I think they're going to do, I will have pyramid head and zombie
1630740	1635900	nurses and I think it's going to have all this stuff from like all the other games kind
1635900	1636900	of thrown in there.
1636900	1640700	Maybe like it's going to cross universes and so you can get stuff from silent Hill two
1640700	1645700	and with Kojima at the home now, I'm not so sure he might want to just, he might be eager
1645700	1649300	to put his own nurses will have time.
1649300	1651280	All right.
1651280	1655900	And last but not least, uh, Shane, the big, the big fan boy in the room for this, uh,
1655900	1657140	what are your thoughts closing out here?
1657140	1659320	I think it's amazing.
1659320	1665040	And right now I'm saying Dragon Age Inquisition is either going to tie it or probably not
1665040	1667640	beat it for my game of the year.
1667640	1668640	That's silly.
1668640	1669640	Demo is my game of the year.
1669640	1670640	All right.
1670640	1673440	Well, but of course you never know what else might stealthily release between now and the
1673440	1674440	end of the year.
1674440	1676920	No, it's going to be Dragon Age or this.
1676920	1677920	All right.
1677920	1679440	Well, we'll check in with you at the end of the year.
1679440	1680440	All right.
1680440	1681440	Okay.
1681440	1682440	Whatever.
1682440	1683440	All right.
1683440	1685200	Uh, anyhow, we're going to move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video
1685200	1687400	games that we've been playing this week.
1687480	1689400	Uh, Dark Sakura, ladies first.
1689400	1691960	What have you been playing this week besides PTU?
1691960	1692960	We've all been playing that.
1692960	1693960	Other stuff.
1693960	1694960	Bejeweled.
1694960	1695960	A lot of Bejeweled on my phone.
1695960	1700520	I've been playing some, uh, Best Move, AKA Puzzle Bobble.
1700520	1703360	I played some Battle Fantasy 14.
1703360	1708600	Um, Dan, why are you looking like that?
1708600	1716160	Um, we were, I was, uh, strategy guiding Dan through Kingdom Hearts 1.5 remix.
1716160	1721240	Uh, and, uh, really that's about it.
1721240	1726920	I've had a lot going on, so stuff that still seems like a pretty action packed week.
1726920	1731200	I saw you on Twitter posting pictures of Kingdom, Kingdom Hearts, playthroughs on, if you saw
1731200	1732200	that I responded.
1732200	1733200	Not yet.
1733200	1734200	I keep forgetting.
1734200	1739960	I'm trying to make Twitter more of a thing and Facebook less of a thing because, uh,
1739960	1740960	fuck.
1740960	1741960	So.
1741960	1742960	I hear you.
1742960	1743960	I hear you.
1743960	1745520	Uh, let's go to our guests, Dan.
1745520	1746520	How was your gaming week?
1746520	1748240	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1748240	1750240	Uh, what did I do?
1750240	1752920	I played some, uh, I played some Grid today.
1752920	1753920	Had a lot of fun.
1753920	1756000	Basically, Friday night, I don't even know what happened.
1756000	1758480	I got home on, or was it Saturday?
1758480	1759480	When did you go to that game?
1759480	1760920	It was Friday when we went to go see Showgirls.
1760920	1761920	Okay.
1761920	1764360	She was going to be out and I was like, man, I want to do some retro gaming.
1764360	1770640	So I drug out the Genesis and I played a game each of the Revenge of Shinobi, Shadow Dancer,
1770640	1772320	and Shinobi 3.
1772320	1776160	And I know that my skills are quite diminished because I got to the second to last level,
1776160	1778920	the second to last level, and the last level.
1778920	1783480	One game, just not even like no continues, no spamming extra lives.
1783480	1788040	Well, I did spam extra lives a little bit in Revenge of Shinobi, but, uh, I played some
1788040	1789400	Zelda on Saturday.
1789400	1793720	We played pretty much the first six Labyrinths, uh, in just a quick run through because we
1793720	1795960	were showing it to my friends' kids.
1795960	1797360	And today I played some Grid.
1797360	1800000	Besides that, not a lot of gaming.
1800000	1801400	All right.
1801600	1804160	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1804160	1810040	Um, I really only played a couple games and it was actually funny, but not both of them
1810040	1812960	were kind of Kickstarter related, I guess.
1812960	1819120	I played more of Vanguard V, um, and I still like that demo, sadly, that there is no way
1819120	1821320	that Kickstarter is going to make its money.
1821320	1827680	Um, and then I played kind of along the lines with Vanguard V, um, the guy Maximilien Moreau
1827680	1830880	who's actually doing, he does the Cooking with Unity show.
1830880	1837920	They've been running this kind of, uh, series for, I think the last week or two called From
1837920	1839520	Scratch to Publish.
1839520	1843200	And they actually start from scratch and they made a game that's pretty simple and they
1843200	1845680	publish it on pretty much every platform that they could.
1845680	1855800	Um, you know, iOS, uh, Windows, Windows Phone, uh, Android, and, um, even PlayStation Mobile.
1855800	1860880	And so I downloaded the Android version, um, for 99 cents.
1860880	1864440	And so I've been playing their game, uh, Grid Cruiser, which actually it's kind of, um,
1864440	1867800	inspiring because, uh, one, I do get done with my long project.
1867800	1872160	I do kind of want to do something along the lines of that, where it's a lot of short projects
1872160	1877680	that you can get done in like a week or two just to have some stuff to bring in some revenue.
1877680	1884300	So, um, but yeah, it definitely goes support Vanguard V. I mean, although it's probably
1884300	1889140	too late at this point, but hopefully they will decide to relaunch the Kickstarter.
1889140	1891900	I have some other way to do funding later on.
1891900	1893300	All right.
1893300	1897540	Uh, before we get into my gaming week, I'm actually going to do something here real quick.
1897540	1901860	Uh, we're actually going to, we're having a lot of problems live, uh, for our live listeners
1901860	1903640	over a live.vognetware.com.
1903640	1905240	Our internet keeps going up and down.
1905240	1908060	I'm not sure what's up with that, but I think what we're going to do, or I'm going to do
1908060	1911820	an intentional drop here and we're going to cycle our internet in an attempt to try and
1911820	1913940	keep it up here, uh, for the remainder of the show.
1913940	1914940	So I apologize guys.
1914940	1917300	Thanks for sticking with us live for sure.
1917300	1918780	Um, these things happen.
1918780	1921860	Unfortunately, I don't know what's causing our internet to suck tonight.
1921860	1926400	It's been pretty good the past couple of months, but, uh, I am going to do an intentional drop
1926400	1927400	here.
1927400	1928820	Um, but we will be back in just a couple minutes.
1928820	1929820	I appreciate those.
1929820	1933060	You guys that are sticking with us, uh, here at vognetware.com.
1933060	1938560	We'll be right back to register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio
1938560	1939940	at vognetware.com.
1939940	1941660	Use the passphrase party.
1941660	1942660	Okay.
1942660	1943660	Let's try this again.
1943660	1945340	The internet cooperates with us.
1945340	1948340	Uh, of course those listening on the podcast are like, what's going on?
1948340	1949340	Everything's fine to me.
1949340	1952580	Uh, but yeah, we're having some, fortunately some, uh, difficulties sending our signal
1952580	1955880	out to the server that rebroadcast everything live.
1955880	1959380	So we just did a little power cycle here in studio on the router and all that good stuff
1959380	1962060	to hopefully give us some decent uptime tonight.
1962060	1966100	But, uh, you know, uh, despite all the live problems that sometimes occur, although it's
1966100	1970880	been pretty good the past couple of weeks, uh, or months, even, um, we, uh, do always
1970880	1974540	have the show complete and we do try to tape things for our podcast feed, which of course
1974540	1979220	you can check out orange lunch radio.com available in the iTunes store, stitcher radio, all that
1979220	1980220	good stuff.
1980220	1981220	All right.
1981220	1983480	When we left off, I was about ready to get into my gaming week, which, um, I don't have
1983480	1988080	a whole lot of exciting stuff to report because we talked about PT, which was the big bulk
1988080	1991560	of it, but I have also been playing Final Fantasy 14 here and there, which, uh, you
1991560	1994960	know, you know, you know, I love my MMO, so I'm playing that, um, another MMO I've been
1994960	1999360	playing an awful lot of, which I think I talked about last week, but, uh, never winner was
1999360	2000360	one I've been spending time with.
2000840	2002960	I don't, I think I got into it on a whorehouse, but not OLR.
2002960	2007760	So, um, I've been playing a free to play MMO called never winner that's available out there.
2007760	2010800	And, um, I like what I've been experiencing so far.
2010800	2014280	Um, even though it is free to play, I haven't really felt nickeled and dime now, granted
2014280	2016800	I'm only about what, 10 levels into it.
2016800	2020200	So I haven't really experienced the whole thing, but, uh, I like it because it's kind
2020200	2025440	of like that, you know, like a Warcraft MMO type of feel, but, um, you have, it's a little
2025440	2030400	more actiony, like, because you, you dodge things by double tapping and so you, you move
2030400	2031680	around a little faster.
2031680	2035720	So everything feels a little more fast paced, uh, like almost like, uh, the combat feels
2035720	2040600	almost more like Diablo esque in a way, but yet in that kind of wow environment.
2040600	2042120	So, uh, yeah, I like that.
2042120	2045280	And of course, since it's never winter, you have a lot of like user generated things to
2045280	2048640	explore and I've barely scratched the surface on any of that stuff.
2048640	2052400	But if you like D and D and you like free MMOs, you'll probably get a kick out of never
2052400	2053400	winter.
2053440	2056120	And dungeon Buster and chat says, just wait until you get to the late levels.
2056120	2057120	Yeah.
2057120	2061360	I figured in a free to play MMO type of thing, that's probably where you really start to
2061360	2065880	feel it as towards the end game, but for what it is right now, I'm enjoying it as a nice
2065880	2069580	little diversion because honestly, I like MMOs.
2069580	2074680	I'm not really feeling wow these days, sorry, Warcraft fans, but the drought that has been
2074680	2076400	going on in the game just finally broke me.
2076400	2079600	And I'm just not interested in wow or the entire game.
2079600	2080980	I'm not interested in the new expansion.
2080980	2084220	You know, there was a lot of news about the new expansion and wow this, this week, and
2084220	2087260	I got to admit, I'm not really, I'm not buying it.
2087260	2088260	Like I know that sounds harsh.
2088260	2091260	I have a lot of great, a lot of friends that really love world of Warcraft and have stood
2091260	2095040	by it, but I don't know, maybe the people will ultimately bring me back.
2095040	2098940	If I do come back to an MMO, it's usually the people is why, but the game itself, I
2098940	2099940	don't know.
2099940	2101460	I'm just kind of, kind of spent on it.
2101460	2104940	Um, so, but it gives me time to play other MMOs and see what else is out there.
2104940	2109060	So that part of it I like, otherwise I'm just waiting till the big holiday rush and a lot
2109060	2110180	of the games to come out there.
2110180	2114860	Speaking of Diablo, I got Diablo three on pre-order for Tuesday, the ultimate evil edition.
2114860	2116980	So I'm excited for that on PlayStation four.
2116980	2119740	So I will be excited to check that out.
2119740	2123260	Um, all right, so that's it for our gaming weeks.
2123260	2126220	Uh, moving into some housekeeping before we get into some gaming news.
2126220	2130020	Um, housekeeping, we will not have a live show Labor Day weekend.
2130020	2131260	That's two weeks away.
2131260	2132860	That is because I will not be here.
2132860	2137660	I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con, which is a huge, huge con, uh, for Southeastern
2137660	2139260	US and, uh, and beyond.
2139340	2140940	Honestly, I mean, I'm going out there for it.
2140940	2143700	Uh, voice geeks network is pretty heavily involved.
2143700	2145460	Uh, we're going to be participating.
2145460	2149820	Uh, we have a panel Monday as a part of the podcasting track, uh, 1130 in the morning.
2149820	2155420	So be sure if you are a dragon Han, I know I said am, and some of you guys might be a
2155420	2157460	little hung over, but that is the day you leaving.
2157460	2161100	So hopefully, uh, hopefully you're able to make it to our panel 1130 in the morning that
2161100	2164900	day, um, will also be appearing on other panels throughout the show.
2164900	2167380	Uh, I know Bobby and I are participating on another one.
2167420	2171180	Uh, our pal Brian over at British invaders has a few things he's on.
2171420	2174780	I want to say John from critical myth might be on a panel or two on some of the different
2174780	2175220	tracks.
2175460	2177460	Uh, but just keep, keep an eye out for that.
2177500	2180740	Uh, uh, all throughout dragon con, we will be there.
2180940	2185460	Um, but I know it's a big convention weekend in general and just in general, a weekend,
2185460	2187980	especially in the US where people kind of go out of town, do other things.
2188220	2190500	So we will not be having a show that week.
2190980	2193340	Um, but, uh, we will be here next week.
2193340	2196860	And then of course, we'll be back on September 7th, I believe the day is.
2197460	2201220	Uh, you can also follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R for all the updates,
2201220	2202820	facebook.com slash orange lingerie.
2202820	2207140	If you want to be our friend on Facebook, let's get into some gaming news.
2207180	2211940	There was quite a bit of it when there's a speaking of big expos, Europe had a huge one
2211980	2217980	gaming related this game's calm and specifically ironically has kind of funny.
2217980	2220780	Like I watched all those conferences live and.
2221420	2225580	Even the one who was a micro, well, all of them makes it for EA because EA was at one in
2225580	2228420	the morning and it's EA and it's one at one in the morning.
2228420	2232780	So no, I'm not watching that, but I actually watched the Microsoft one and Sony one
2232820	2234260	Microsoft was at five in the morning.
2234260	2236820	Thank you kid for waking up that early.
2237220	2240780	Um, so anyways, let's talk a little bit about Sony.
2240780	2243060	So Sony, they had a lot of rumors kind of going into it.
2243060	2248420	One of which was of course, um, HD remasters for journey and the unfinished one,
2248420	2249420	which were confirmed.
2249740	2252980	And the cool thing about those, of course, like a lot of the other games that they
2252980	2255300	have, uh, they are cross by.
2255300	2259500	So if you bought the PlayStation three version, you don't have to buy the
2259500	2260900	PlayStation four version.
2261260	2265260	It will already be there waiting to put, you know, waiting for you to play it.
2265820	2271740	Um, also hustle Kings is still, or is coming to a PlayStation four as well.
2271980	2275220	I am absolutely shocked that that series is still around.
2275220	2277060	Do people really like billiards that much?
2277220	2282380	I mean, I dunno, maybe it's literally the only game that's in that genre
2282380	2284180	that's out on consoles nowadays.
2284780	2286340	Um, all right.
2286340	2289500	And then, uh, they also announced that of course they're doing
2289500	2290780	pretty well with the system.
2291140	2295020	10 million units sold and they made sure to confirm that.
2295020	2299140	Yes, that's sold actually to customers and not just shipped.
2299620	2304740	Cause you know, poking fun at Microsoft and, uh, about, you know, some of
2304740	2306060	their numbers that they share.
2306700	2311220	And apparently the best selling console in North America for the past six months,
2311220	2314660	they said, and I think it's even outselling, uh, the PlayStation
2314660	2316140	three during that same time period.
2316340	2318580	They hit 10 million before the PlayStation three.
2319180	2322380	Um, and then kind of following, you know, some of their announcements,
2322380	2328380	they showed off a bunch of, I guess, unusual trailers, uh, for things
2328380	2333700	like including Q games, new, um, the tomorrow children, which kind of had
2333700	2341340	this, you know, Soviet Russia kind of vibe to it and, uh, very strange
2341340	2345020	looking game, but, uh, that should be coming out to the platform at some point.
2345580	2349820	Um, they announced that daisy is coming to PlayStation four.
2350180	2353180	So I'm guessing probably going to be coming to both consoles at some point.
2353180	2357660	And I don't know if it's going to be, uh, exclusive or anything with
2357660	2362660	at least they announced that, uh, also, um, and some kind of pissing off
2362660	2366580	some of the fans of Vita, uh, tearaway unfolded is going to be
2366580	2368740	coming to the PlayStation four as well.
2368740	2369860	So now they're getting kind of.
2370260	2372620	They own their own version of the Vita game.
2373140	2376500	Uh, well, I also think what pissed off fans, the Vita was an absolute
2376500	2382060	lack of any news for the nothing, uh, which I, I'm going to be honest.
2382060	2387900	It seems to me that Sony is destined to make the Vita a portable PlayStation
2387900	2391980	television is what is what the Vita is destined to be through the PlayStation
2391980	2395380	now and through, you know, the, the streaming with the PS four.
2395380	2400620	And I kind of think they're really not super duper interested in having
2400620	2402700	the Vita be maybe a games platform.
2402900	2404940	They'll still support the indie development for it.
2404940	2407020	Cause it's kind of like a feather in their hat, but I just, I think
2407020	2408860	Sony's kind of done already.
2408900	2413300	If anything, they're supporting the Vita with more independent stuff because
2413500	2417700	they, you know, it is one of the few platforms that actually still supports,
2417700	2423380	you know, was it a PlayStation mobile, which you can publish to, you don't
2423380	2424980	even need like a dev kit or anything.
2424980	2426540	You can just publish straight to it.
2427020	2428380	Um, so there's that.
2428420	2432940	And also a lot of these games that are coming out, um, on console
2432940	2434740	are getting Vita versions as well.
2434740	2439420	So I think, I think you'll see a lot in that sense, but yeah, as far as.
2439780	2442180	Releasing major, major titles on the Vita.
2442220	2445460	I just don't think that's going to happen right away.
2445500	2450300	Um, maybe if the PlayStation TV really takes off and the numbers, you know,
2450300	2456340	justify, you know, more portable versions of these games, the problem is just like
2456340	2460620	the Wii U there's just not a lot of units out there and so they don't want to spend
2460620	2466180	the effort and, you know, cost to develop a game for the Vita even Sony doesn't
2466180	2469740	cause some of their big name franchises that they thought would do really well
2469740	2472740	didn't, but I think that's kind of the blame on some of the devs because they
2472740	2475900	had really shitty ports of like resistance and stuff.
2476460	2478740	A couple of quick comments from chat and I'll let you get back to the news.
2478740	2479020	Wrap up.
2479020	2479220	Sorry.
2479220	2479460	Lucky.
2479500	2482660	Uh, Akuma JP says we had a lot of games in summer though on Vita.
2482700	2486380	Remember Akuma JP is in Japan where it's probably a very different perception
2486380	2486620	over there.
2486620	2490180	I mean, Japan even had that other Vita before we did.
2490180	2492620	And you know, it's a little different over there.
2492620	2494460	There's still third parties are supporting it.
2494460	2497540	I mean like, you know, especially the Japanese companies are really supporting
2497540	2503380	the Vita like, uh, Atlas and, um, even was it like over here, access games.
2503380	2507700	They kind of do a lot of translations of titles and stuff, but you're seeing,
2507700	2513420	you know, uh, Tecmo Koe, um, they've got lots of stuff coming into the Vita.
2513420	2516900	So if you like, you know, your Japanese games, you're in a lot of that stuff
2516900	2518220	localized, which is kind of cool.
2518820	2521420	Um, but really that's it.
2521420	2527300	I mean, you're not going to see a lot of just Vita versions of big titles
2527300	2529900	coming on, you know, no call of duties or anything like that, which is kind
2529900	2530540	of disappointing.
2530700	2534540	Uh, act Efton chat says, make the Vita $150 and make the memory cards
2534540	2534860	cheaper.
2534860	2535820	And I may consider one.
2536060	2537180	Well, the Vita is going to be what?
2537180	2538020	99 bucks.
2538020	2541980	If you can hook it up to a TV that's seems to be where I think they will drop
2541980	2544980	the price of it, especially if the, I mean, cause the thing about it, if it's
2544980	2549420	$200 and you know, PlayStation TV is going to be 99, I don't know if you're
2549420	2550820	going to have to drop the price of that.
2551060	2554900	It's going to come down one way or another, you know, either it's retailers
2554940	2558340	trying to clear out their stock or it's Sony dropping the price of it.
2558620	2560740	But I think the price does need to come down on it.
2561220	2561540	All right.
2561940	2565220	Um, and oh, I was going to say it last, but at least, uh, they announced
2565220	2568620	SharePlay, uh, the feature they're kind of showing off originally with the
2568620	2571740	PlayStation four is now going to be coming in the fall update.
2572020	2576220	Now SharePlay was that feature that they showed off where say I'm having trouble
2576220	2577540	in a game or something like that.
2577540	2581980	I can have my friend take over the game and actually play a part for me, or, you
2581980	2586500	know, um, you can also do couch co-op, you know, over the internet.
2586500	2590500	So if I have, you know, a two player local game, I can have someone join in
2590500	2592060	on player two or something like that.
2592540	2598340	But what people are also seeing is like, Hey, I can use this to loan a game to my
2598340	2601660	friend, you know, across the country or something like that, they'll just take
2601660	2604980	over my game and they can play it up to an hour.
2604980	2607500	So it's going to allow you to play up to 60 minutes at a time.
2607940	2612740	And, uh, you know, after that 60 minutes, it'll disconnect, but you can
2612740	2614340	reconnect as many times as you want.
2614780	2617820	And so that'll be coming in software update 2.0, which is
2617820	2619180	coming in later this fall.
2620780	2624220	And, Oh, and of course, because it is multiplayer PlayStation,
2624220	2627220	plus will be required like everything else.
2629220	2629820	All right.
2629820	2633460	Well, Microsoft also had their big press conference and there was a lot of news
2633460	2636740	coming out of that, including, uh, increased presence for indie games.
2637060	2641500	Uh, on the ID at X-Box platform, which will include goat simulator.
2641660	2642980	No time to explain.
2642980	2647380	And, uh, one of the big ones coming over from PC is smite because smite is a big
2647380	2652060	MOBA, uh, not quite as big as league of legends or dota, or, you know, even
2652060	2654780	heroes, but, uh, smite definitely has its audience.
2654780	2655900	I see it on Twitch all the time.
2655900	2656780	So very interesting.
2656780	2659900	That has made me actually very shocked that goat simulator was allowed on
2659900	2664340	consoles because that came as buggy as hell on purpose, but it's just, I think
2664340	2665660	that, yeah, I think that's the joke.
2665660	2666100	Christ.
2666260	2667020	Yeah, that's the joke.
2667340	2668140	Uh, anyhow.
2668460	2673900	Um, also, um, Dan, you haven't seen goat simulator.
2673900	2675660	Oh, well I'll have to show you during break then.
2675900	2676580	Oh, good.
2677260	2678460	You know, I have this game, right?
2680940	2682260	Uh, apparently not.
2682540	2686300	Imagine if you will, a game like Tony Hawk, where you do tricks, except
2686340	2691060	instead of Tony Hawk on a skateboard, you're goat pissing people off and
2691060	2693740	breaking shit fucking much and going into space.
2694580	2696500	Space space goat.
2696540	2697020	I'm in space.
2697420	2699220	Uh, let's see.
2699260	2703980	Uh, also, uh, the Xbox one preview program, expanding their features for
2703980	2707340	more friends, the ability to view messages, friends, parties, and
2707340	2711180	achievements on a snapped app, uh, and playing media from USB device.
2711420	2714380	Uh, there will be an FIFA 15 bundle in Europe.
2714620	2718060	Uh, turtle rock studios is going to be bringing the beta for evolved
2718060	2721420	to the Xbox one in January, uh, evolved by the way, pushed back.
2721420	2722620	If you hadn't heard the memo on that.
2722780	2726420	But the, uh, a demo or the beta, excuse me, will be on the Xbox one in January.
2726820	2729140	Uh, let's see fable legends.
2729140	2730980	Multiplayer beta will be in October.
2731340	2736900	Um, there will also be a sunset overdrive, uh, package detail,
2736900	2738620	which would be a retail October 28th.
2738620	2740380	I'm not sure if that is specifically for Europe.
2740540	2744020	No, they're going to have a system with it's a white console.
2744020	2744500	Same date.
2744980	2750340	Uh, yeah, the 28th it's, uh, it's, um, same con or white console for three 99.
2750740	2754380	Uh, the beta program for halo five starts December 29th.
2754420	2756420	So just barely in this year.
2756740	2757980	Uh, let's see.
2758020	2760820	Also, uh, there will be a halo channel.
2760980	2765140	Microsoft and three 43 industry is a teaming up for the halo channel.
2765340	2767820	This will broadcast live Twitch game play.
2767980	2771900	There'll also be content based around the halo series available on this.
2771900	2773340	This is kind of interesting, like a whole,
2775340	2777260	you know why I say, yeah, why?
2777260	2780180	Because they tried the same shit with call of duty elite member elite
2780220	2784180	had all this content that was based around call of duty and it was fucking boring.
2784220	2785300	No, I don't remember that actually.
2785300	2785620	Yeah.
2785660	2788380	And then they just continue to leave because no one gave a shit about it.
2788660	2790060	So I, I don't know.
2790060	2792980	It halo tournaments would be kind of cool, but I just.
2793860	2797740	Aside from like, uh, that show from Steve or are they still doing the
2797740	2799020	Steven Spielberg halo thing?
2799020	2802420	Because it, you know, aside from that, I just don't get shit about the rest.
2802420	2803780	Think that is still a thing.
2804220	2807820	I, they said anything that had already started was still going to be a thing.
2807820	2808140	I think.
2808940	2811300	Do you guys talk about bungee firing Martin O'Donnell?
2811660	2812740	A while ago when it happened?
2812740	2812940	Yeah.
2812980	2814500	Has three, four, three hired him yet?
2814780	2816220	Oh, I haven't heard.
2816220	2816940	Don't think seriously.
2816940	2818540	What the fuck are you guys waiting for?
2819420	2821580	That's the guy who makes halo halo, right?
2821620	2822300	Hurry up.
2822420	2822820	Right.
2823340	2827980	Uh, last but not least the big, big, uh, bomb that was dropped, uh, crystal
2827980	2834020	dynamics announcing rise of the tomb Raider will be exclusive to the Xbox one.
2834300	2838580	Uh, in the days that followed that exclusive was, uh, clarified to mean
2838580	2843460	timed exclusive, but I think we all kind of expected that a huge game like tomb
2843460	2847940	Raider, even if it is exclusive on Xbox one or whatever, the game of the year,
2847940	2850980	definitive edition, blah, blah, blah, blah, would have been on all consoles
2850980	2854780	anyway, especially with a big game like that, but a lot of people really
2854780	2859260	unhappy about that news, um, considering that probably a lot of people bought
2859260	2863300	tomb Raider on the PlayStation four for the definitive edition, just because,
2863540	2867220	you know, the number of, uh, PlayStations that were in households at the time and
2867220	2868860	so forth, you had more PS fours households.
2869060	2870740	So I think the game sold better there.
2870740	2873980	So, uh, and then some people saying, oh, if you go all the way back to the O G
2873980	2876820	tomb Raider games, that was always more of a PlayStation thing.
2876820	2881140	So this feels like a, and I'm using my quote, he fingers slap in the face to
2881140	2885060	those of us that have supported tomb Raider all these years, the DLC for
2885060	2889100	like granted out of four was exclusive to Xbox for about six months.
2889820	2890620	I don't know.
2890620	2892740	They paid $50 million for that.
2893140	2898940	So, um, you know, I, in my opinion, it's business and you might not like it, but
2898940	2902820	I sort of think if things had been the other way around where tomb Raider had
2902820	2906180	been announced exclusive for PlayStation four, people would have been like, oh,
2906180	2906660	cool.
2906660	2910820	And you might've had your occasional Xbox Microsoft tomb Raider.
2910820	2913900	So I kind of like, and I'm talking to somebody who doesn't own an Xbox one yet.
2913900	2917940	I own a PlayStation four and not an Xbox one, but I'm looking at this going, well,
2918380	2922300	that's, that's kind of irritating, but at the same time, it's probably a pretty
2922340	2923780	good business decision on Microsoft.
2924100	2926020	It's weird from square's end.
2926380	2931140	Because, you know, we all know that square doesn't do exclusive deals.
2931180	2934260	Well, all except for square does exclusive deals all the time.
2934460	2938700	It's not that Dan it's that they went out on record and said, we were a little
2938700	2942420	disappointed in the sales of tomb Raider, even though they kind of backtracked on
2942420	2947300	that later and crystal dynamics, I believe, I believe came out and said, no,
2947300	2950500	we, we may we're in the black, the games in the black now, you know, cause they,
2950540	2952540	they did sales in the definitive edition, so forth.
2952700	2954300	They made their money on that game and so forth.
2954300	2955740	It's cause square's delusional.
2956060	2959740	Look, I'm offended because tomb Raider was originally a Saturn game.
2959740	2961260	And then the PlayStation stolen.
2961500	2963980	So you know what Sony fans suck it.
2964220	2965660	Now you're getting your own medicine.
2965700	2968780	Well, what about, and some folks to say at fifth dream says
2968780	2970620	tomb Raider is a PC title.
2971180	2974340	I got, isn't it a PC title before it's any of those things.
2974340	2979140	I'm pretty sure that when tomb Raider was being developed, it was a.
2980500	2981580	It was a console game.
2983020	2983420	Interesting.
2983420	2984540	I don't think it started for the PC.
2984540	2989660	I think what happened was there was a PC version and then they made other PC
2989660	2993700	versions, but it was like the lead console for tomb Raider was the Saturn.
2994300	2996500	And here's the thing though, is it's not just Xbox one.
2996500	2998660	It's Xbox one and Xbox three 60.
2999340	3000980	Rise of the tomb Raiders on three 60.
3000980	3001420	Yes.
3001420	3004820	It's it's act it's coming to Xbox first.
3004900	3006260	I didn't re I didn't catch that.
3006260	3010340	I thought the game only had the newer, uh, no, I think it's
3010980	3014340	I think it's just how great the new generation consoles really are.
3014380	3019660	Last, last in, you know, new, last in, um, last gen and current gen.
3019700	3021340	Are you absolutely sure on that?
3021380	3022500	I'm pretty sure.
3023420	3024860	Oh, it in your mouth.
3026260	3029940	Uh, Sony's chain is screening, screaming from the other room.
3029940	3030580	Yes.
3031980	3032780	So interesting.
3032780	3033020	Yeah.
3033060	3033460	Oh yeah.
3033460	3034140	I'm seeing it.
3034180	3035260	I'm looking at Wikipedia.
3035260	3036100	So it must be true.
3036180	3037820	Three 60 and Xbox one.
3037820	3038300	Interesting.
3038380	3038780	Matt.
3038780	3040780	Meanwhile, frantically editing Wikipedia.
3045380	3046180	It's on Wikipedia.
3046180	3047260	So it must be true.
3047300	3047940	Here it is.
3048660	3049100	All right.
3049100	3054220	So, uh, yeah, I, again, I admit I'm trying to look at the silver lining of this.
3054340	3058500	I figured by 2015 holiday, I'd have an Xbox one anyway.
3058820	3062780	So maybe there'll be like a really cool bundle that comes out for two
3062780	3066060	prizes, the tomb Raider, because Microsoft seems invested in wanting
3066060	3066940	their own uncharted.
3067500	3071500	Was the last two Raiders so big, despite being a disappointment that
3071500	3076220	tomb Raider now has some sort of like relevance in the console war.
3076260	3080620	Well, here's yes, because even though when that news came out that the
3080620	3083700	two Raider wasn't selling well, Dan, it took a lot of us by surprise because
3083700	3086460	the new two Raiders really good, great game, great game.
3086460	3088420	And I figured it sold pretty well.
3088540	3090860	I didn't figure that sold system selling.
3090860	3094620	Well, I didn't figure it would be like if Microsoft rolled up and said, And
3094620	3097100	this might date me, cause I haven't really been following new games too
3097100	3099980	much, but if they just ran up and said, Hey, by the way, call of duty,
3099980	3105260	Xbox exclusive bitches, drops mic, you know, it's like, Oh, we got tomb Raider.
3105860	3106780	Good.
3107340	3108700	I mean, it's cool.
3109100	3110820	It's not going to change your fortunes.
3110980	3113060	It's not going to sell Xbox one.
3114420	3119660	If you consider that uncharted might be Sony's big game holiday 2015,
3119660	3122580	it does create a very new tomb Raider.
3123580	3124540	He does have a point.
3124540	3125140	That's the thing.
3125140	3126980	It's like, it's like, Oh, well, damn.
3126980	3127940	I can't play a big yet.
3127940	3128460	Hold on.
3128460	3128940	Okay.
3128940	3129460	Okay.
3129460	3131540	I can't play tomb Raider right now.
3131540	3133940	I'll just play uncharted until tomb Raider comes out.
3133940	3136740	I mean, there's that scenario.
3136740	3140380	I mean, especially now that it's confirmed that yeah, it's time exclusive.
3140740	3142020	So people just like, fuck it.
3142020	3144060	I'll just wait or I'll wait and see what the reviews are.
3144060	3146980	And the reason that great, I'm just not going to buy it at all when it comes out.
3147300	3151140	So it is a double edged sword that, you know, yeah, they get it exclusive,
3151660	3156220	but if it doesn't turn out to be a great, great, great game,
3156220	3159700	then it could hurt them in the end because now people are just not going to wait.
3159700	3161220	They'll wait for it to drop price.
3161220	3165060	We paid a hundred milos for an exclusive for a game that doesn't matter that much.
3165740	3166660	We needed something.
3166660	3168260	We got it Microsoft.
3168260	3172500	We have bullet, which I remain hopeful
3172500	3175180	because the first Tomb Raider was so darn good.
3175180	3176340	I know it'll be a great game.
3176340	3179820	I know I'm just the first Tomb Raider.
3179860	3181860	You guys know what I mean? The first since the reboot.
3181860	3183420	All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
3183420	3185660	We're running really long because of all these stream problems
3185660	3186660	we've been having tonight.
3186660	3188500	Put us back a little bit. So let's move on.
3188500	3191140	Dark Sakura, then I'll be quick.
3191140	3195580	Warner Brothers is apparently interested in buying Xbox Entertainment Studios.
3196740	3200220	There was something put out by a Hollywood reporter saying that Microsoft
3200220	3204580	was actually considering selling Xbox Entertainment Studios
3205540	3208620	to Warner Brothers because of
3210580	3213260	I just lost my place because they wanted to,
3213860	3216420	you know, after the negotiations with
3217260	3220620	the merger of Xbox Entertainment and Machinima,
3221100	3223500	that they thought that it would be a good idea.
3226940	3229180	What? Hmm. You know what this means?
3229980	3232460	But this news only can be one thing.
3232460	3235500	The return of the WB.
3236500	3239900	WBX. Well, you know that, you know, Xbox Entertainment was closed.
3240620	3244620	Yeah, but they still, of course, own what is left of its assets in the division.
3244820	3248820	Right. Well, and didn't the the documentary that they did,
3249300	3252820	the E.T. one, didn't they have to go to Warner to do a whole bunch
3252820	3255220	of the rights and stuff for like E.T. music and whatnot?
3255540	3257100	Maybe that was the point of contact.
3257100	3259300	Well, E.T. though is universal.
3259300	3261620	OK, then fuck it. That's all wrong.
3261620	3263940	God damn it, Dan. God damn it, Dan.
3264140	3267340	I'm like, what? E.T. was a right at Universal Studios.
3268220	3270500	But they licensed shit. I mean, you know, it's true.
3271100	3272580	All right. You have The Simpsons right now.
3272580	3274820	That's definitely not universal.
3274820	3276860	Or I'm sorry. No, it's not even The Simpsons anymore.
3276860	3278060	Fuck, I can't keep track.
3278060	3281140	It's like Simpsons and then it was Terminator and then like.
3281180	3282300	No, it's Simpsons now.
3282300	3283980	No, it's back to the future.
3283980	3287140	It's no, it's it's The Minions right now.
3287140	3289300	They didn't replace Terminator turned into Minions.
3289900	3291860	Simpsons was back to the future. Yeah.
3291860	3293180	Yeah, that's disappointing.
3293180	3294940	It was so cheesy. They had to keep it.
3294940	3298500	I mean, anyhow, anyhow.
3299140	3302300	Does does this affect the closure of Xbox Entertainment affect the whole
3302300	3305380	like possibility of one versus one hundred returning or any of that?
3305900	3307180	Oh, man, that was awesome.
3307180	3310580	Well, if if if you mean the well,
3311140	3313940	no, because, you know, zero percent
3314500	3317980	chance of returning time zero is still zero.
3317980	3321740	I think was the Xbox Entertainment was about like making TV
3321740	3322820	shows and shit.
3322820	3325780	It was about, oh, we're going to have all this original content
3325780	3327820	and we're going to have like a Netflix thing going on.
3328020	3329420	It wasn't about making games.
3329420	3332380	That was like the Xbox community, man.
3332380	3335380	And one versus one hundred was like, that was some cool content
3335380	3337580	that sold Xboxes.
3337580	3340100	I shit you not. We were selling Xboxes.
3340100	3342540	People were like, how do we get this one versus one hundred thing?
3342580	3344900	Oh, buy an Xbox, buy this card.
3344900	3346540	Don't even the game desk.
3346540	3349700	It's all good. Rod Band. Wow.
3350700	3352820	I hope I will know.
3352820	3354380	I hope that will come back in one way or another.
3354380	3355420	Maybe Warner Brothers can do that.
3355420	3359140	Warner Brothers, you joke about the WB, but didn't it become the CW?
3359140	3361220	I don't know who has the controlling stake in CW.
3361220	3362540	I don't know if that's mostly CBS.
3362540	3365060	Who cares? Yes, that's true.
3365060	3369260	Maybe, maybe because I want America's next top model on Xbox
3369260	3372420	one with connect,
3372420	3374540	make my best smize on connect.
3374540	3375860	You're going to get supernatural.
3375860	3377460	You can just do that for fun.
3377460	3378860	I can. I'm doing it right now.
3378860	3381940	The best you can hope for is an adaptation
3381940	3384340	of a possible model and movie.
3384340	3385140	I just saw a game.
3385140	3389380	I just want my Xbox to root for me when I when I die in the exclusive
3389380	3390460	Rise of the Tomb Raider.
3390460	3392180	I want my I want Tyra to come out and go.
3392180	3393540	We were rooting for you.
3393540	3396580	We were all rooting for you.
3396580	3397740	Anyhow, yeah.
3397740	3399460	Loki, new story, please save this.
3399460	3402940	All right. So speaking of comeback, Sierra is back
3403380	3407340	resurrected in shambles, I guess, by Activision
3407340	3411060	and Sierra's new direction is, well, they're going to be
3411780	3414980	releasing some of their old titles, including King's Quest,
3414980	3417860	the brand new King's Quest game and.
3417860	3421180	Geometry Wars, three dimensions, which is like geometry wars,
3421180	3424540	but now it's not quite flat, it's in dimensions.
3424540	3426940	Bizarre Creations is back.
3426940	3429740	Now, when they start doing time dimensions, then
3430580	3432100	we have Tesseract edition.
3432100	3433460	So correct me if I'm wrong.
3433460	3436500	This is your only active.
3436500	3438260	Fuck you. Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
3438260	3442100	Not here. This is only Activision using the name, right?
3442100	3444380	It's no there's no Roberta Williams.
3444380	3446660	Oh, God, no original talent.
3446940	3448860	She washed her hands of Lord gaming.
3448860	3451780	Lord British isn't running back to Activision because
3452380	3454020	more money after launching into space.
3454020	3456220	Lord British tried to shoot himself into space.
3456220	3458140	Right. No, he did shoot himself into space.
3458140	3459820	Yeah, but he's not running back.
3459820	3462660	This is just them saying we're going to release adventure games
3462660	3464860	and we're going to release it under the order of British.
3464860	3467100	He's making Facebook games now.
3467220	3468140	Oh, no, that's what I'm saying.
3468140	3470020	This those guys aren't coming back.
3470020	3471580	So, yeah, it's not coming back.
3471580	3474940	The name Sierra is being used for the King's Quest.
3475300	3478620	Bizarre sequel slash remake slash resurrection.
3478660	3480780	Bizarre, sadly, not coming back either.
3481020	3484260	So even though I'm really no shit, even though I'm really.
3484380	3485860	Fuck you, Activision.
3485860	3487460	Fuck you for that.
3487460	3490060	Fuck you, Microsoft, for even selling them.
3490060	3494500	And even though I'm like really excited about a new Geometry Wars,
3494500	3498140	I'm like super like shifty eyes, like don't fuck this up.
3498860	3499980	Do not follow.
3499980	3503540	OK, so King's Quest, they're saying is being developed by the odd gentlemen
3503540	3507020	who did the misadventures of PB Winterbottom
3507340	3509660	and I guess the wayward manor.
3510580	3513900	And then lucid games are going to be taking over Geometry Wars.
3514580	3517420	I have no idea who lucid games are, but it's Geometry Wars.
3517420	3518700	I can't imagine it'd be that difficult.
3520140	3522220	Famous. That's not true.
3522220	3527100	Geometry Wars is a simple game that's perfectly balanced.
3527380	3530500	It was designed not just like, oh, here you go, play this.
3530660	3532300	Like they put some time into it.
3532300	3534260	Remember the first year of the Xbox?
3534260	3535980	It was the killer app.
3535980	3538500	It was like, well, Project
3538500	3542300	Awesome three is pretty good, but perfect dark zero.
3542500	3544300	Do you have you played Geometry Wars?
3544300	3546620	Oh, and Uno on Xbox Live. There you go.
3546820	3549860	No, for like no lies detected on versus 100.
3550860	3552660	And it's like it's so weird.
3552660	3554140	Yet yet bizarre.
3554140	3557780	Shut down vision camera, not support like what?
3558140	3560660	Anyway, well, it was, you know, what happened was
3560940	3564020	and I mean, I know that because I'm a racing effects, not a bizarre
3564020	3567220	big thing was Gotham Project, Gotham Nine.
3567580	3571820	It took three titles, but eventually for to eclipse Project Gotham.
3572020	3574580	Microsoft didn't see any reason to keep bankrolling them.
3574860	3576740	And so they sold them off to Activision.
3576740	3578500	And then Activision had one release.
3578500	3581140	It was like Splitter Splitter Blur.
3581140	3583660	They had two releases because you remember Activision
3583660	3586060	had them develop that crappy game, the club.
3586100	3588460	Oh, oh, yeah. They did a double of seven games.
3589460	3592220	Anyway, why do you why did you remind me about?
3592260	3593260	I hate you so much, man.
3593260	3597060	Here's the Geometry Wars two was still really good to evolved.
3597140	3601220	Yeah, exactly. Anyway, that was Geometry Wars two was Geometry Wars.
3601380	3602420	Sorry, whatever.
3602420	3605740	Remember, we did have one that got the name Geometry Wars two on Xbox 360.
3605860	3606740	That's really good, too.
3606740	3609300	And we we had was that the guys supported it over the Wii.
3609540	3610180	So that's pretty good.
3610180	3611540	And the way that was still bizarre.
3611540	3612980	And the Wii one was pretty good, too.
3612980	3614620	Was it on 3DS or DS?
3614620	3615980	I think so. It was on DS. Yeah.
3615980	3617220	And that game was awesome.
3617220	3619260	It's a great game. It's just OK.
3619260	3623100	I'm just worried because Activision sucks.
3623340	3626700	I don't know. I wouldn't say they suck, but it's just like there's
3627940	3631260	EA has reclaimed their title, Crown of the Most Evilest.
3631260	3632540	Oh, yes, yes.
3632540	3636060	But I'm worried that the Activision and like even EA
3636100	3640300	has been trying to spin this where or maybe not EA, but there was like,
3640300	3642300	was it that the guy that did
3642300	3646380	or the group that did Devil May Cry, you know, that game sucks.
3646420	3650740	Well, now they're trying to release these games as indie titles.
3650740	3655540	So like, you know, like Geometry Wars three dimensions is an indie title
3655540	3658740	or like, you know, King's Quest is going to be more of an indie title.
3658860	3660860	And they're trying to spin it that way to get people,
3660860	3662820	you know, kind of more on their side for that stuff.
3662820	3664420	Like they have another game coming out.
3664420	3667020	I can't remember, but it looked exactly like Devil May Cry,
3667020	3670980	but it's it's it's an indie title by a triple A studio or something like that.
3670980	3672860	It's like that doesn't make any fucking sense.
3672860	3674460	It's by what they call it.
3674460	3678060	It's by a small market developer, you know, an indie developer.
3679220	3681900	Indie developer, not indie studio.
3681940	3684980	Yeah, because Activision is about the world's biggest or second biggest studio.
3685580	3688540	Well, as much fun as we're having reminiscing evil bastards
3689220	3692300	about the past, let's do some more reminiscing about the past with this story,
3692300	3697020	because believe it or not, this week is the twenty five year anniversary
3697020	3699860	of the Sega Genesis, not the medium, right?
3699860	3703460	Not the not the Mega Drive necessarily, but the Sega Genesis
3703700	3705700	coming to stores in North America.
3705700	3710660	Remember Sonic and Tails and Fantasy Star and Echo
3710660	3714260	the Dolphin and Shadow Run and Toe Jam and Earl.
3714860	3718140	Don't remember those from launch because you remember Altered Beast,
3718660	3721500	which which I went back and played not that long ago
3721500	3724100	because it was on the Sonic Mega collection thing.
3724140	3725660	So I went back to get my trophies.
3725660	3729020	I played Altered Beast on Genesis and I was like Ultimate Genesis collection.
3729020	3729700	That's it. Thank you.
3729700	3731140	I was like Altered Beast on Genesis.
3731140	3733540	This game sucks. That game was terrible.
3733860	3737300	But the whole thing was you came from like Mario three,
3737300	3740700	which is a masterpiece of of gameplay design and whatnot.
3740700	3743060	And you looked at the graphics and then you looked at Altered Beast
3743060	3746140	and you heard the graphics and the voice and you were like, God damn,
3746460	3747380	this is amazing.
3747380	3749700	And there were a lot of great games during the launch of the Genesis.
3749860	3751220	There was Thunder Force Two.
3751220	3752780	There was Herzog Zwei.
3752780	3755180	There was Truxton.
3755580	3757700	There was what else was going to launch?
3757940	3759180	Yeah, that's about it.
3759180	3761580	I had Super Thunder Blade and Altered Beast. I got screwed.
3763700	3766380	Yeah. And the Altered Beast.
3766380	3766900	Bulls and Ghosts.
3766900	3769100	Bulls and Ghosts was the lead launch title.
3769300	3771540	It was the reason to own a Sega Genesis.
3771620	3773820	Altered Beast, everybody remembers from the arcade
3773820	3775940	and not that it was necessarily a much better game in the arcade,
3775940	3779940	but everybody remembers those sequences with like the voice
3779940	3783220	like when they transform in the wise from your wave.
3783260	3785460	The Genesis was a capable trance.
3785660	3789620	The funny thing about the Genesis translations were they were always close.
3789820	3792020	They weren't exact. Golden Axe wasn't exact.
3793020	3794780	You know, what was the other one?
3794780	3796420	Ghouls and Ghosts wasn't exact.
3796420	3797500	Altered Beast wasn't exact.
3797500	3801660	But because they were the closest you could get at home at the moment,
3801660	3802820	they were amazing.
3802820	3805740	I didn't realize Omar Fudd did voice acting in that game.
3805740	3807420	He did. Oh, yes.
3807460	3809940	Dungeon Buster in chat at live.vognetware.com says,
3809940	3811860	everybody poop who's Altered Beast nowadays.
3811860	3814900	But it was like, holy crap, it's almost like the arcade at the time.
3814900	3815420	Yeah, it was.
3815420	3818260	That's what I was saying is it was mind blowingly close.
3818460	3821060	And when you got your Genesis, that was, you know,
3821060	3823620	especially if you bought it in the first year before Sonic released
3823620	3827580	and became the pack-in, that was the game you slammed in and you turned on.
3827580	3829660	And you were like, why didn't I buy a second controller
3829660	3831060	so my buddy could play with me?
3831060	3833660	And you play through the game in like 20 minutes
3834380	3837180	and then you play through the game again in like 20 minutes.
3837740	3841660	And then you put it away and hopefully you'd bought another game.
3842140	3846060	Dan, I know you have many fond memories of the Genesis
3846060	3847860	because I think you're kind of the Sega fanboy.
3847860	3848940	Yeah, Sega is my thing.
3848940	3851620	Which is kind of probably why you're here tonight of all weeks.
3851940	3853740	No, it's just an amazing coincidence.
3853740	3854980	Amazing coincidence.
3854980	3857060	What are your personal favorite memories?
3857060	3860780	Because I didn't own a Genesis and my friends did, but I didn't own one.
3860780	3861780	You didn't own a Genesis?
3861780	3863380	I was a Super Nintendo kid.
3863380	3865180	Fuck you, I'm leaving.
3865340	3868380	Well, what are your favorite memories of the Sega Genesis?
3868380	3872140	Looking back, you know, the great thing about when the Genesis
3872140	3877620	actually launched was that it took the how do you say?
3877780	3880300	It kind of took the vibe that Nintendo was putting out, which was,
3880500	3883420	oh, it's real family friendly and it's good for kids.
3883420	3886940	And the console is wide and the games are all brightly colored.
3887100	3889260	And I mean, the box was black.
3889260	3891180	It had the big silver logo on it.
3891180	3893540	It had the big screenshot from Altered Beast.
3893820	3895540	And it just it looked edgy.
3895540	3896380	It felt edgy.
3896380	3900220	The controllers were were a little too large for little kid hands
3900420	3903660	and had three buttons, which was amazing at the moment.
3904260	3907780	The game cartridges were really cool and sleek,
3907780	3909140	and they didn't have the names on the front.
3909140	3910300	They were only on the top.
3910300	3914540	And it did weird little things like when you had two controllers plugged in,
3914540	3916580	it wouldn't ask you if you wanted to do one or two player
3916580	3919260	and some of the launch games you had to press start of the second controller.
3919420	3922540	But if you only played it, one player would let you swap controllers back
3922540	3925620	and forth, which Nintendo didn't do at the moment.
3925940	3927900	And we were just like, oh, man, that's so cool.
3927900	3929140	What kind of thought went into that?
3929140	3934220	It had almost all arcade games, just really fantastic stuff.
3938060	3939380	I had a Super Nintendo.
3939380	3940860	God, you suck.
3940860	3943700	And that's not what you said when we opened my luggage day one.
3943700	3945660	You're like, you bought a Super Nintendo.
3945660	3947940	I did not. You did. You did, sir.
3947940	3950540	I'm like, wow, your Super Nintendo is ugly and discolored.
3950540	3951980	Mine is beautiful and pristine.
3951980	3953380	Let's throw yours away.
3953380	3955100	I know you still have mine.
3955100	3959060	I think, OK, when we talk about our show, we do like like I throw away
3959060	3961540	a Super Nintendo, not to interrupt the family.
3961540	3964460	So I was looking for you to interrupt because I was like out of breath.
3964500	3968860	But I as a non Genesis owner, I still remember
3968860	3972660	what I think was kind of the big moment for me that made me want to Genesis.
3972940	3975300	And I think was was a big defining moment
3975300	3978100	for the Sega Genesis was the release of Mortal Kombat.
3978660	3982180	And the fact that the Sega Genesis was the only system cool enough
3982500	3988140	to have the blood code, whereas on the Super Nintendo, it was like, no, it's sweat.
3988700	3990260	I had the Super Nintendo version.
3990260	3992540	Did you really? Because the graphics and sounds were better.
3992860	3995860	But the gameplay was broken as shit.
3996140	3997340	Yeah, it really was.
3997340	3999540	You know, that was the big problem with this next version.
3999540	4000540	It just didn't play right.
4000540	4005700	But it looked like like the scale down, but it looked like the arcade.
4005700	4007660	And that was just sort of the weird thing about it was.
4007860	4009940	Yeah, the Genesis version was a big, big seller.
4009940	4012180	But that didn't come out till, what, 94?
4012500	4013940	It was later on. It was.
4013940	4015420	Yeah, it's 93 or 94.
4015420	4017460	So you're talking like three or four years in.
4017460	4018900	And it kind of gave.
4018900	4023260	What was weird was, you know, the SNES came out and the SNES was successful
4023500	4026820	and the Genesis came out with Sonic and the Genesis was holding its own.
4026980	4030620	And then the Mortal Kombat thing, you know, then the SNES got Street Fighter II.
4031020	4034500	And all of a sudden we were all throwing the Genesis aside
4034500	4036660	because it was like we had to play Street Fighter II.
4036900	4039300	Talk about a third party exclusive.
4039300	4041540	That was a huge system seller.
4041860	4044740	And, you know, because the Genesis didn't get Street Fighter II
4044740	4048220	and sell it until Special Champion Edition, they had no analog to it.
4048220	4053780	So they brought out MK, MK gave the Genesis more life
4053780	4057060	because their version had fatalities.
4057300	4060340	It had blood. It played faster. It played better.
4060460	4063220	Yeah, it sounded kind of wonky and it looked a little funky,
4063260	4068220	but it was closer to what people, to what the Mortal Kombat fan wanted.
4068260	4070540	Right. Very good.
4070820	4073020	Very good summary of that there, Loki.
4073020	4075900	I didn't have a Genesis right away, but I did get one.
4075900	4078900	I did get one later on.
4078900	4081540	So I think, you know, one of my favorite games on there.
4081540	4082500	Well, I had two favorite games.
4082500	4085900	One would have been the their version of Jurassic Park,
4086340	4089140	which was the side scroller version where you could play as the dinosaurs.
4089140	4090220	That was pretty cool.
4090220	4092340	And then Vectorman, actually.
4092340	4094180	I kind of like that was late.
4094180	4096860	And Earthworm Jim.
4096860	4097940	That was a good game.
4097940	4100140	You know, Earthworm Jim is a great example of a game
4100380	4102900	that was just hyped as shit, too.
4103140	4106260	Like they pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and pushed it.
4106260	4108940	And then it came out and it was good.
4108940	4112660	Guys, you know, in chat saying the game came out in 92, not 93 or 94.
4112660	4114980	That actually does sound right, because I remember I got in a fight
4114980	4115820	with my ex-girlfriend.
4115820	4117940	I know it was a couple of years in.
4117940	4119420	Because remember, it launched in 89.
4119420	4122060	So we're not talking like first Christmas or second Christmas.
4122060	4124420	It'd be like the third or fourth Christmas for the console.
4124420	4126220	You know, Dan, Dan, I hate to disappoint you,
4126220	4128660	but the first Sega system I ever owned was a Dreamcast.
4128660	4131580	And even then, it was after they had slashed the price like 50 bucks.
4131700	4135380	Well, I'm not surprised by that before the Dreamcast was out here.
4135580	4138180	Oh, yeah, with the Japanese, because there were like six people
4138180	4140820	who owned the master system. Yeah.
4141060	4144620	And so when the Genesis came out, it had it had a big mountain to climb.
4144620	4147300	But the whole thing was they kind of pulled the Sony
4147620	4151940	where they didn't go directly after the Nintendo consumer at first.
4152260	4153860	They went after the older gamer.
4153860	4156020	They said, like I said, everything's a little edgier,
4156020	4158220	a little more expensive, a little bit bigger.
4158500	4162980	But you're going to get the hardcore arcade games that you want.
4163220	4166220	You're not going to get to Mario, but you will get Altered Beast.
4166220	4168220	You will get Golden Axe.
4168220	4170380	You will get Revenge of Shinobi.
4170380	4172900	You know, oh, yeah, that was probably the other really good launch game.
4172900	4173700	Revenge of Shinobi.
4173700	4176300	Oh, Shadow Dancer. That was another great title.
4176500	4180100	Yeah, Shadow Dancer, which is which is a Mega Drive or Genesis exclusive
4180100	4181660	because the arcade version is completely different.
4181660	4183180	And Moonwalker. Come on.
4183180	4184660	How can I forget Moonwalker?
4184660	4186500	Oh, yeah, not a launch, but a great game.
4186500	4188660	First year or maybe second year.
4188980	4190500	It's Strider. Strider.
4190500	4193060	Yeah, it was probably the first, not the first Christmas,
4193060	4195100	but the second Christmas, Christmas 90.
4195140	4198100	And you remember I sat down and beat it on Genesis,
4198380	4199860	one of our first years together.
4199860	4202460	Actually, I think you beat it on the arcade emulator that we had.
4202940	4205860	Now, I beat it on the Genesis.
4205860	4208300	I did. I was sitting on the Genesis version is easier.
4209020	4211460	All right. Well, we could reminisce on Sega Genesis all night.
4211460	4213860	And Dan's going to try, but we can't.
4213860	4215300	I do. I do want to move on.
4215300	4216300	Let me talk about this new title.
4216300	4218460	Hey, did I tell you about something on Genesis?
4218460	4219500	So don't I have a story?
4219500	4222540	Well, that's what Nintendo shut up while I mute Dan's mic.
4222540	4223740	Let's move on to.
4223740	4226100	Hey, Jamie, tell us all about how great the Genesis is.
4226820	4227980	Well, how about Plants vs.
4227980	4231020	Zombie Garden Warfare for people?
4231020	4233900	For people who are interested in this game, it is the fans.
4235260	4236300	OK, I'm done.
4236900	4239540	She dropped the mic, take the mic out of his hand.
4242100	4244540	Give me that. Oh, Dan, now I have two mics.
4246460	4250340	Yes, I am. Oh, hey, leave my coffee alone.
4251660	4255540	Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.
4255540	4258180	I'm going to strangle him with the cord.
4258180	4261300	Do you get to play as the coffee bean in the Garden Warfare?
4262140	4263900	It's free, bitches.
4263900	4266060	It's free for a little while.
4266100	4269140	Seventy two hours worth of free on Loolergens.
4269140	4270420	So go get it.
4270420	4272540	And here's Dan talking about more Sega shit.
4272540	4274540	You know, the plants didn't really have Plants vs.
4274540	4278460	Zombies on Sega, but they did have Zombies Ate My Neighbors,
4278460	4280020	which had a lot of hedges.
4280020	4281420	It didn't have plants in it.
4281420	4285220	Many, many plants and several zombies.
4286540	4289980	I love how Jamie literally read a story about a new game
4289980	4292180	that's free and neither one of you care.
4292900	4294420	Is it on Sega Genesis?
4294420	4295980	No. Then it doesn't matter.
4295980	4297060	Here's why I don't care.
4297060	4298700	Here's why I don't care about that.
4298700	4300260	It's because it's not free forever.
4300260	4301540	It's just a free trial over the weekend.
4301540	4303260	Now, if it was one of those, hey, Origin, I mean,
4303260	4305140	or it's Origin giving me a free game.
4305140	4306700	Yeah, sure. Go download it. That'd be awesome.
4306700	4307900	Wing Commander 3 is still free.
4307900	4309940	Yes, Wing Commander 3. Go download that.
4309940	4312140	But, you know, it's not one of those.
4312140	4313660	Free trial? I don't give a shit.
4313660	4317220	So it's one of those.
4317220	4319300	Isn't it a free weekend when you start it?
4319300	4321260	It's not like Steam weekends where it's between.
4321260	4323780	I thought it was like 72 hours when you download it and start it.
4323780	4325460	Yeah, I still think that's how it works.
4326460	4329460	All right. Anyhow, so let's travel around the world
4329460	4332700	and check out some release dates of some games that are coming out that,
4332700	4334860	sadly, they're probably not free, but you never know.
4334860	4336700	Are they on the Genesis?
4336700	4338900	We'll cover Genesis release dates.
4338900	4339820	No, but guess what?
4339820	4343020	Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare is coming out on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4,
4343020	4345220	but that's because EA said, hey, guess what?
4345220	4350420	Microsoft paid for an awesome exclusive on Xbox One and Xbox 360.
4350420	4354900	So you guys get it six months later. Whoo!
4354900	4358420	So you better believe that whenever Tomb Raider comes out on PlayStation,
4358420	4361500	it's going to be probably six months later because that seems to be all their deals are.
4361500	4364100	Six months comes out on the other systems.
4364100	4366100	So those will be PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4.
4366100	4369780	And then Tales of Zilia 2 on PlayStation 3.
4369780	4376100	And finally, Diablo 3, the Ultimate Evil Edition on PlayStation 3,
4376100	4381100	PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox 360.
4381100	4383380	All right. Traveling over to Japan,
4383380	4386580	taking a look at the Mega Drive releases in Japan.
4386580	4387380	Nothing, Dan.
4387380	4390260	There's nothing coming out on the Mega Drive this week in Japan.
4390260	4392340	And Wii U releases and nothing.
4392340	4395020	The Mega Drive really wasn't the most successful system in Japan.
4395020	4397380	Did you look at the European or the Brazilian?
4397380	4401020	So how about what's coming out on other systems?
4401020	4404500	Well, I was going to say also nothing on the Xbox 360.
4404500	4405540	That actually isn't true.
4405540	4409020	That's usually a running joke, like Xbox 360 in Japan, ha ha ha.
4409020	4411180	But the Xbox 360 is getting World of Tanks,
4411180	4415220	Xbox 360 Edition Starter Pack is out in Japan this week.
4415220	4418460	So more releases than the Mega Drive.
4418460	4419020	Go figure.
4419020	4421260	On the PlayStation 4, a big week over there on the 21st,
4421260	4423180	Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls, Ultimate Evil,
4423180	4427060	and The Last of Us Remastered hitting Japan this week.
4427060	4429180	The Xbox One still not out in Japan,
4429180	4431260	so we don't actually have releases for that yet.
4431260	4436020	On the PlayStation 3, Diablo 3 makes its way out there as well.
4436020	4439900	Nothing on the Wii U this week, because releases are few and far
4439900	4440860	between on the Wii U.
4440860	4443140	But the PlayStation Vita has a few games
4443140	4445100	to kind of follow up what AkumaJP said earlier.
4445100	4448220	Binary Star, Bullet Girls, and Chaos
4448220	4451060	had Duel all coming out this week on the PlayStation Vita.
4451060	4453740	So there are still some releases on the Vita.
4453740	4457620	Just one game on the 3DS this week, Tetsudo Nippon,
4457620	4461580	Rosa no Tabi, Kashima Orinkai Tetsudo Hen
4461580	4462820	comes out this week.
4462820	4464320	I'm trying to see what that game is.
4464320	4467340	It looks like it's a game about public transit,
4467340	4468940	or like transit trains.
4468940	4469740	It's a train game.
4469740	4471860	Some people love their trains in Japan.
4471860	4473660	Some people love their trains in America, too.
4473660	4473980	We don't get cool games like this.
4473980	4475700	Remember they used to have those big awesome controllers
4475700	4476580	for the train games?
4476580	4477500	I think they still do.
4477500	4478500	They probably still do.
4478500	4479140	Awesome.
4479140	4481140	Yeah, and on 3DS, you'd have it on the bottom.
4481140	4482820	Isn't there like a big Shinkansen thing
4482820	4485300	that came out like last year?
4485300	4485800	Probably.
4485800	4486420	I don't know.
4486420	4488340	They don't release the really cool stuff here.
4488340	4491500	We got Railroad Tycoon, and I think I had the A train on.
4491500	4493900	No, they have a train simulator game.
4493900	4497740	I know it's on Steam because they have zombie DLC for it.
4497740	4498820	Don't ask me why.
4498820	4499620	They have that.
4499620	4501380	And then the warehouse simulator game,
4501380	4503900	they also had zombie DLC for us.
4503900	4505580	What if you made like a funny typo?
4505580	4507460	Warrios.
4507460	4509500	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys,
4509500	4510060	and then the classic.
4510060	4510700	No.
4510700	4511420	Oh, I'm sorry.
4511420	4512280	UK dates.
4512280	4512940	My bad.
4512940	4513940	Jeez, Rob.
4513940	4515540	No one cares.
4515540	4516500	You can leave.
4516500	4519620	Is anything coming out on Genesis?
4519620	4521460	In the UK, it would be the Mega Drive, sir.
4521460	4522700	Oh, my bad.
4522700	4526300	On the 19th, we have Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls for PS3, Xbox
4526300	4531660	360, and PS4, and X-Bone, and not Genesis.
4531660	4537380	On the 20th, we have Counter Spy for PS4, Vita, and PS3.
4537380	4539620	Dan?
4539620	4540580	Mega Drive.
4540580	4541460	There, I said it.
4541460	4542500	It's on the Mega Drive.
4542500	4543260	Sweet.
4543260	4546220	I'm importing it.
4546220	4548860	On the 21st of August, we have Plants vs. Zombies,
4548860	4552300	Garden Warfare on Xbox 4, and I'm sorry, not Xbox 4.
4552300	4553700	PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.
4553700	4554980	See what you made me do?
4555020	4556420	Mega Drive.
4556420	4559340	I'll Mega Drive the car over you.
4559340	4562300	I'll run over you with my Mega Fiat.
4562300	4562900	All right.
4562900	4563420	No.
4563420	4565180	Now, just a couple more stories, and then
4565180	4566780	the classic game of the week.
4566780	4570140	It'll be back to Jamie, because it's all about Jamie.
4570140	4572780	The irony is it probably won't be a Genesis game.
4572780	4579180	It is actually not a Genesis game tonight, but that's OK.
4579180	4580860	All right, moving, because she's probably
4580860	4583240	done every Genesis game at one point or another.
4583240	4584580	She's done a lot of Sega games.
4585060	4585580	Oh, shoot.
4585580	4587060	I actually fucked up, because I was
4587060	4591940	going to do my whole Capcom, the Qsound era games.
4591940	4593820	Yeah, you broke your own pattern.
4593820	4595540	I'm going to have to start my pattern again next week.
4595540	4595900	All right.
4595900	4598140	Well, that's OK, because the show is broke in itself
4598140	4600660	when it keeps disconnecting tonight, so it's appropriate.
4600660	4601620	Loki.
4601620	4602500	All right.
4602500	4603340	Mario Kart.
4603340	4607020	So lots of copies have been sold.
4607020	4608940	They've surpassed $1 million in the US,
4608940	4611140	and that's a pretty amazing feat, considering they haven't
4611140	4612460	really sold that many systems.
4612480	4617220	But Mario Kart definitely helped, so good for them.
4617220	4619700	And of course, we'll see some free DLC
4619700	4629780	that's totally not cashing in from sponsors, but whatever.
4629780	4633380	I'm actually excited to see more track DLC.
4633380	4637060	And speaking of tracks, there's actually some cups
4637060	4639180	that were not in the game.
4639180	4647260	They have some unused icons, including, let's see here,
4647260	4657140	looks like a Yoshi egg, a star, a boo, and a blue shell.
4657140	4659060	Oh, god, I can only imagine what a blue shell
4659060	4661060	cup is going to consist of.
4661060	4663540	My understanding is, isn't one of the new DLCs
4663540	4665060	like Mercedes-based?
4665060	4665580	Yeah.
4665580	4667540	Like you get Mercedes carts?
4667580	4669700	It's coming out August 24th, I think.
4669700	4671820	Where does that come from?
4671820	4673420	Just some weird type of deal.
4673420	4674700	It was in Japan first.
4674700	4675980	They've had it for a while.
4675980	4678300	It was just some weird licensing deal they had.
4678300	4679740	But I mean, who's going to be sitting there,
4679740	4681180	and they're going to be playing their Wii U,
4681180	4684420	and they're going to be going, because I could choose
4684420	4686900	a Mercedes and Mario Kart, I think
4686900	4688940	I'm going to head on down to my local Mercedes dealer
4688940	4691620	and take a test drive.
4691620	4693740	It just doesn't seem to have a lot of synergy.
4693740	4695300	Not everyone is like you, Dan.
4695300	4696100	Brand awareness.
4696140	4698420	It might work on me, but I mean, that's like, fuck it.
4698420	4699700	I'll definitely, I mean, yeah.
4699700	4702420	Dan gets out of bed going, I want to test drive a car today.
4702420	4704260	Mercedes is trying to hook them early.
4704260	4706540	They're all like, you know, when I was 10 years old,
4706540	4708780	I drove a Mercedes and Mario Kart,
4708780	4710700	and I'm semi-successful now.
4710700	4712780	If I actually took this seriously,
4712780	4714980	which I'm going to humor Dan and take this seriously,
4714980	4717020	I think it is a part of brand awareness.
4717020	4719260	And it may not be so much about trying to get the person
4719260	4721260	to go out and test drive a Mercedes
4721260	4723580	as it is trying to reach the person that's already
4723580	4726020	thinking about driving a car who may have thought,
4726900	4727740	I didn't think about a Mercedes,
4727740	4730100	but now I'm seeing it on these YouTubes
4730100	4731460	of people playing Mario Kart,
4731460	4733060	and it's just creating the awareness.
4733060	4733900	And-
4733900	4734740	You're a fucking idiot.
4734740	4737700	Fuck you, get off the channel.
4737700	4739100	Fuck you.
4739100	4740140	No, no, no.
4740140	4741340	I just don't buy that.
4741340	4743980	I just, I see the user base for the Wii U
4743980	4747580	and the user base for the Mercedes Benz automobile
4747580	4751140	as so different that I just can't see them working together.
4751140	4754780	It's just, it's just two great tastes that don't go together.
4754820	4757220	It's just that they paid them money
4757220	4758540	to put it in their game.
4758540	4759460	I know.
4759460	4761980	That's all it was because they're like, we need money.
4761980	4763220	Right, no, no, no, I'm not saying Nintendo,
4763220	4765180	yeah, that's why, that's exactly what I'm getting at.
4765180	4766020	How did this go?
4766020	4766860	You know what?
4766860	4767900	Nintendo doesn't do anything for free.
4767900	4768740	I want to see Trojan-
4768740	4769820	Oh my God, Rob.
4769820	4771660	I didn't, I don't, you're not really an idiot.
4771660	4773380	I want to see Trojan condoms,
4773380	4775420	pay them a lot of money to put some DLC in,
4775420	4777300	like, I don't know, Mario Kart, why not?
4777300	4778140	Let's do that.
4778140	4779100	Dude, that would be awesome.
4779100	4780460	There could be a condom power up.
4780460	4782980	It covers you up and you're protected from everything
4782980	4784340	until it wears off.
4784340	4787620	Dan, you could have the Mercedes and Mario Kart,
4787620	4789020	or you can have Yaris.
4790620	4792860	Yaris probably made more sense.
4794020	4794860	Because it's a cheap-
4794860	4796380	Are you really right now?
4796380	4797500	Yes, yes, and I'll tell you why.
4797500	4799060	First of all, Yaris is a bootsy game,
4799060	4801260	so I'm not trying to endorse that you,
4801260	4804340	well, you can't download it, but okay.
4804340	4807060	Yaris was a cheapy little car
4807060	4809460	that's going to be geared towards 20-somethings
4809460	4811380	who are probably sitting on their fucking couch
4811380	4812900	playing Xbox 360.
4812900	4816460	Do I think for a second that Yaris sold Toyota any cars?
4816460	4817860	No.
4817860	4819420	But I'm sure, you know,
4819420	4821420	it's not as if Mercedes came out and said,
4821420	4822980	you know who we're going after?
4822980	4825020	We're going after Gran Turismo players.
4825020	4826220	Well, here's the thing, too, though.
4826220	4828220	When, like, I was looking for a car
4828220	4830700	and I was looking for some affordable cars and stuff,
4830700	4833260	I was like, oh, hey, cheap car, it's a Yaris.
4833260	4834780	Let me see what that's about, you know?
4834780	4835780	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4835780	4837300	Not saying that I was going to buy it,
4837300	4839780	but it's like, it's made it stand out
4839780	4842860	like a fraction of a percent more than, like, say,
4842860	4844700	you know, I don't know.
4844700	4847300	Well, and unless I'm completely off base
4847300	4852140	onto what the common user of the Wii U is,
4852140	4856420	apparently it's an affluent, you know, 40 to 50-something
4856420	4858180	that's making six figures.
4858180	4859380	Because that's, well, no,
4859380	4862820	because I guess there is a $40,000 Mercedes out there now.
4862820	4864260	Maybe that's the whole idea.
4864260	4865420	Maybe they're trying to say,
4865420	4868420	hey, you're 23 years old and you're sitting at home
4868420	4872220	playing a game for 12-year-olds, come buy a Mercedes.
4872260	4874060	You get a used Mercedes?
4874060	4876820	No, I'm sure, yeah, I'm sure it's got like an 83,
4876820	4880140	you know, diesel piece of shit Mercedes
4880140	4881620	that you can drive in the game.
4881620	4883060	They do have the old class.
4883060	4885940	Mario's like sticking out of the hood, you know, fuck.
4885940	4886980	They do have, like,
4886980	4888860	was it some of the classic Mercedes in there?
4888860	4890860	Like, they have the classic, I forget,
4890860	4893580	the one that's like the monopoly car in the game.
4893580	4894420	Right.
4894420	4895260	And...
4895260	4896620	Yeah, it's only like, yeah.
4896620	4899300	And it's more expensive than any new Mercedes.
4899300	4900580	Yeah.
4900580	4902740	The SLR McLaren, you know.
4904580	4905900	Let's see, I was gonna see exactly
4905900	4908060	which cars were in there.
4908060	4908900	It would all make more sense to me
4908900	4912940	if it was like Mercedes free download pack for Forza 5.
4914500	4917100	Let's see, it was...
4918820	4921820	The 1957 300 SL Roadster,
4921820	4925060	the 1934 W25 Silver Arrow,
4925060	4930060	and let's see, the new compact SUV.
4931500	4932340	The GLA.
4932340	4934420	I was thinking, hey, maybe it's not such a cash-in.
4934420	4936340	Maybe they're just gonna put some cute cars in there
4936340	4937180	as some sort of freebie.
4937180	4938020	Then it's like, oh yeah,
4938020	4941420	and the new compact Mercedes SUV.
4941420	4943020	All right.
4943020	4944060	For time, I gotta move on.
4944060	4945300	I wanna hit one more story here
4945300	4946820	before we get to the classic game of the week,
4946820	4950580	which has no add-on car DLC that I know of, but we'll see.
4950580	4952980	You guys all know about what went down on Twitch last week.
4952980	4953940	We talked about that,
4953940	4955300	and I'm sure a lot of your favorite podcasts
4955300	4957420	have been talking about the controversy happening at Twitch.
4957420	4959820	Well, a little bit of irony on this story.
4959900	4961180	Twitch seems to have expanded
4961180	4965180	into more live streaming demonstrations,
4965180	4968500	I suppose, for lack of a better term, for electronic music.
4968500	4972020	Porter Robinson released a new album this past week, Worlds,
4972020	4975900	and he had a Twitch stream that ran this thing
4975900	4977180	where he hung out with fans
4977180	4979260	and talked about the video games that inspired the tracks
4979260	4981140	and showed the recording studio and so forth.
4981140	4983140	So it was a little weird because I guess it was about games
4983140	4984420	because he talked about video games,
4984420	4989420	but yet it was this album promotion for copyrighted music.
4990220	4995140	So I don't know if the archives got bleeped or whatever.
4995140	4995980	I don't know.
4995980	4997820	But this isn't the first time this has happened either.
4997820	4999580	There's, let's see, Mad Descent,
4999580	5003380	who is the label behind Diplo, Dylan Francis.
5003380	5004460	They did a Twitch channel.
5004460	5005300	Diplo.
5005300	5006140	Is it Diplo?
5006140	5008900	Sorry, you can tell how much I listen to these artists.
5008900	5010540	They did a Twitch channel
5010540	5012500	where the folks are talking with fans.
5012500	5015500	And Darude, I know Darude, they did the after party.
5015500	5016860	Remember Sandstorm?
5016860	5019340	That's my excuse to play Darude right now.
5019380	5023260	So anyway, interesting that this is some territory
5023260	5024100	that they're getting into
5024100	5027620	because it's not really directly about video games
5027620	5029700	and it's barking up the tree
5029700	5032180	of something that they really cut back on last week.
5032180	5035260	So, I don't know.
5035260	5036980	It's a little hypocritical actually.
5036980	5037820	A little bit?
5037820	5038660	A little bit.
5038660	5039500	Why do you think?
5039500	5040340	Because they're like,
5040340	5042020	no, you can't play copyright music.
5042020	5043100	We're gonna play copyright music.
5043100	5043940	That's right.
5043940	5044940	That's our job to play copyright music.
5044940	5046300	But is it the copyright holder
5046300	5047500	playing the copyrighted music?
5047500	5048580	I would assume so in this case
5048660	5050060	because it's the record label doing it.
5050060	5050900	But-
5050900	5051740	Then it's a little different.
5051740	5053940	But when you're using an all automated system
5053940	5056060	to bleep things, I wonder if that matters.
5056060	5058460	Because we've seen cases on YouTube anyway.
5058460	5060300	I mean, I guess I am doing apples to oranges,
5060300	5062940	but if it's to be believed that YouTube's gonna buy Twitch,
5062940	5064460	I think it's a fair comparison.
5064460	5068660	YouTube has dropped video and copyright striked
5068660	5070340	like people that hold the IP.
5070340	5074940	Like game creators whose soundtracks get flagged
5074940	5076660	from whoever owns that.
5076700	5078980	It gets their whole damn movie flagged.
5078980	5079820	Right.
5079820	5081700	Well, they kind of backed off on that a little bit.
5081700	5085220	It was really bad about a year back.
5085220	5087180	I think that Twitch is fantastic.
5087180	5088620	And I mean, I haven't really followed
5088620	5090340	their recent troubles.
5090340	5093260	I know that they just dropped the whole Justin TV label.
5093260	5094980	But I think that for gamers,
5094980	5099980	Twitch is literally the validation of the hobby.
5100220	5101560	It's an entire network.
5101560	5104140	You can watch pretty much any game that you'd wanna watch.
5104180	5107300	You can stream any game that you'd like to stream
5107300	5108900	and try to get watchers.
5108900	5113060	But I can also see how if it's not already
5113060	5114900	being perverted terribly,
5114900	5118340	how it can be just perverted terribly and ruined in a second
5118340	5121240	as any good idea does when you involve humanity.
5122980	5123800	All right.
5123800	5125820	On that note, let's talk about
5125820	5128160	other of humanity's perverted ideas
5128160	5130660	in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
5131660	5133460	Dark Soccer's gonna take a step into the vault
5133460	5134300	and find a game that she thinks,
5134300	5136780	hey, you kids should be playing this game.
5136780	5138580	I don't know why you're not playing this game.
5138580	5140820	Actually, a lot of you have probably played this game.
5140820	5141940	But remember this game?
5141940	5142760	Yep.
5142760	5143600	It's cool.
5143600	5144440	Dark Soccer.
5144440	5145420	And it actually is old.
5145420	5146260	It is old.
5146260	5147620	And I kind of looked at this going,
5147620	5149060	oh my God, this game is that old?
5149060	5150140	And yes it is.
5150140	5152340	Dark Soccer, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5152340	5153260	It's Bejeweled.
5154260	5155080	Bejeweled.
5155080	5155920	Because it's old.
5155920	5156740	It is.
5156740	5158620	Came out in 2001 and it was,
5158620	5161980	I think this is the first solely browser game
5161980	5164380	I've ever done as well.
5164380	5166780	So we're definitely getting into the internet age with this.
5166780	5167620	Possibly.
5167620	5170460	But basically it's a puzzle game created by PopCap.
5170460	5175460	It started off as a web-based flash game called Diamond Mine
5176640	5179420	that was inspired by a game called Shariki.
5180500	5185380	Basically, you just have to match up three gems in a row
5185380	5187820	and you can get more than that.
5187860	5190700	It's kind of like the Columns thing too, right Dan?
5190700	5192500	Columns, Sega.
5192500	5193820	All I'm going to say is for the record,
5193820	5196060	I would be shocked if there's not a Sega Genesis version
5196060	5196960	of this out there.
5197960	5199580	Columns.
5199580	5200940	Columns is not the same.
5200940	5202220	I know, but still.
5202220	5207100	But anyway, the game, it's basically just so simple
5207100	5209260	and kind of stupid and addicting,
5209260	5213060	but we now have so many different versions of Bejeweled
5213060	5216180	and it's been on fucking everything.
5216220	5220140	So basically, Bejeweled was actually created by,
5220140	5223140	the name came up by Microsoft who thought
5223140	5225420	that Diamond Mine was too similar to another game
5225420	5228140	called Diamond Mines as far as the name.
5228140	5230140	So basically it's been everywhere.
5230140	5233280	It's been on Windows where it was Bejeweled Deluxe
5233280	5234300	and it was on iOS.
5234300	5237880	It's been on old PDAs like the Blackberry, the iPhone,
5237880	5241740	Palm OS, Windows Mobile Smartphone Platforms.
5241740	5243560	It's been on Xbox Live Arcade.
5244440	5246240	It was one of the first downloadable games
5246240	5248180	for the iTunes store on the iPod.
5249320	5251380	I had it on my old flip phone.
5253140	5255640	I won't say anything about how often I played that game,
5255640	5256760	but I had it.
5256760	5258980	It's been on the Chrome Web Store for free.
5258980	5261680	There's an HD iPad version.
5261680	5266400	And basically it's also, I think,
5266400	5269680	what has led up to the popularity of such games
5269680	5271340	such as Candy Crush Saga.
5272340	5275300	And other similar type of puzzle games.
5275300	5278740	Although, you know, this game probably wouldn't exist
5278740	5283740	if it wasn't for its precursors like Columns, Puyo Puyo.
5285900	5289140	What was that one that Julie liked, Dan?
5289140	5290180	Magical Drop.
5290180	5291340	I have no idea what you're talking about.
5291340	5292340	I like Magical Drop.
5292340	5295320	All kinds of just the little puzzle games like this
5295320	5297020	that are, and the thing is,
5297340	5301860	the concept behind the game is really easy.
5303300	5307100	However, it just gets complicated,
5307100	5308980	especially now that they've got these multiple versions of it
5308980	5311180	because I've been playing a whole crap ton
5311180	5312460	of Bejeweled 3 lately,
5312460	5316060	which is just Bejeweled on iOS right now.
5316060	5319500	Like the butterfly mode I'm addicted to, diamond.
5319500	5322700	There's actually a mode called Diamond Mine
5322700	5326100	that's like groundbreaking using the gems and everything.
5326100	5327180	It's pretty interesting.
5327180	5329180	But basically you just have to swap one gem
5329180	5332180	with one adjacent to form a horizontal
5332180	5334700	or vertical chain of three or more.
5334700	5336820	And then you can cause chain reactions,
5336820	5339060	basically where they will cascade effect
5339060	5342780	and break many more and you get more points and stuff.
5342780	5345740	So you've got in the original, there were two versions.
5345740	5349340	There was normal where every match would fill a bar
5349340	5350580	and then a level would be complete.
5350580	5353540	And that's classic mode in some of the newer versions.
5354340	5356700	When you were out of moves, it was game over.
5356700	5358380	Matching four or five or six
5359980	5361740	was just still a regular thing.
5361740	5364820	You didn't get the special gems until Bejeweled 2 forward.
5364820	5367740	There was time trial where the bar would start
5367740	5369060	halfway through the middle
5369060	5371100	and the level would complete when the bar is full
5371100	5373220	and over time the bar would decrease.
5373220	5375180	So basically you're fighting the bar
5375180	5377660	to see how well you're gonna do.
5377660	5378780	And that's really it.
5378900	5382140	You know, you can actually still visit
5382140	5386940	the original Bejeweled Flash version and play it online.
5386940	5387820	So.
5388820	5391820	I used to play the crap out of Bejeweled on MSN zone.
5393580	5394660	How old is that?
5395700	5398060	Let's see, 2001, you know,
5398060	5402420	I had barely been living out here only two years.
5402420	5404660	Been out here for like two or three years.
5404660	5407540	About two years, so yeah.
5408500	5410500	I'm just gonna go ahead and put a caveat out there.
5410500	5412260	Bejeweled is not in the vault.
5412260	5414620	Bejeweled will never be in the vault.
5414620	5415460	Bejeweled is not a game.
5415460	5417460	It technically is, because I have a box for Bejeweled 2.
5417460	5419380	Technically we don't have a vault.
5420260	5423340	By the way, the vault's been disassembled for years.
5424180	5425900	But it lives on in-
5425900	5426740	In my mind.
5426740	5427740	Yes, exactly.
5427740	5429580	All right, there it is, a classic game of the week.
5429580	5430620	It's very small.
5430620	5432580	But jeweled.
5432580	5434700	And some folks in chat asking like,
5434700	5436860	what up G says, how old is considered classic?
5437020	5440020	And the rule here at OLR is 10 or more years old.
5440020	5441420	Which is, that's a decade old.
5441420	5443900	And yep, 13 years for Bejeweled, so.
5443900	5446060	I think classic should be pre-2000.
5447620	5449860	Well, what's funny is that when we changed the rule
5449860	5453100	to be 10 or more years, it was about 2001, 2002
5453100	5454860	for how far back we were going.
5454860	5456460	So it's just like, we're still moving forward.
5456460	5459500	Not that I would say that Bejeweled is not a classic game.
5459500	5462260	I mean, it's been played by 11 gajillion people.
5462260	5463100	Right.
5463100	5465260	Just, you know, because there's no-
5465260	5467340	You're just pissed it wasn't a Genesis game.
5467340	5468300	Oh, fuck you.
5468300	5472180	You know, you know there's a homebrew of Bejeweled
5472180	5473260	on the Genesis.
5473260	5474940	You know it exists.
5474940	5476740	And Bobby still keeps wanting me to do Halo
5476740	5478340	for classic game and I'm not gonna.
5478340	5479180	All right.
5479180	5480020	Ooh.
5481620	5483820	We, part of the reason we changed the rules
5483820	5485860	so that we could throw in Dreamcast games and-
5485860	5486700	Yes.
5486700	5487540	And GameCube.
5487540	5488360	Yes.
5488360	5489200	All right.
5489200	5490540	Dreamcast shit came out in 99.
5490540	5491380	Right.
5491380	5492220	Right.
5492220	5493620	But some of the other games I've covered
5493620	5496180	have been out in the 2000s.
5496180	5498100	Maybe classic is everything older
5498100	5499180	than the current generation.
5499180	5500020	Maybe classic is-
5500020	5504020	Maybe classic is two generations old.
5504020	5504860	All right.
5504860	5505680	Well, anyway.
5505680	5506520	So it can't be PS2, but it can be PS1.
5506520	5508580	When you come to the show regularly you'll have-
5508580	5511260	I guess it could be PS2, but it can't be PS3.
5511260	5512100	Dan, let it go.
5512100	5512920	All right.
5512920	5513760	Moving on.
5513760	5514580	Right, Dan, you're right.
5514580	5515420	Well, no, you asked.
5515420	5517900	Somebody asked and I was answering the fucking question.
5517900	5519720	You're screwing up your own show.
5520860	5521820	How dare you?
5521820	5523860	Every gamer gets a voice.
5523860	5525700	Well, I was answering the question.
5525700	5526900	I was answering the question.
5526900	5529020	Besides you guys' wishy washy.
5529020	5530340	Besides you guys' wishy washy.
5530340	5532060	Oh, maybe 10 years.
5532060	5534020	Maybe as old as Jamie says it is.
5534940	5535760	All right.
5535760	5537540	Look, we're going to take a break.
5537540	5538940	Calm down a little bit here.
5538940	5540660	We'll be back with more of Orange Lawn's Radio
5540660	5542100	after a quick break here.
5542100	5544140	Your emails, Frugal Question of the Week,
5544140	5545420	Rapid Fire News, and much more.
5545420	5547300	We come back with more of Orange Lawn's Radio
5547300	5548140	right after this.
5548140	5549220	And more Sega Genesis.
5549220	5554220	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live
5559860	5564860	on this, let's see, it is August the 17th of 2014.
5564880	5568260	564 episodes down of Orange Lawn Show.
5568260	5570340	Actually, this is 564 in progress.
5572220	5574820	So anyhow, over there, I noticed in the corner,
5574820	5577680	Loki is showing Dan Goat Simulator for the first time.
5577680	5578700	Is that what's happening over there?
5579140	5579980	Because I hear Dan going over there.
5579980	5581140	Yeah, showing him Goat Simulator.
5581140	5583740	That goat just got so goddamn simulated by that car.
5585100	5586320	Good times.
5586320	5587160	Good times.
5587160	5588060	All right, well, we are going to go over
5588060	5589020	some rapid fire news.
5589020	5590620	I hate to break into the Goat Simulator,
5590620	5591860	but we still have a lot of show to cover,
5591860	5593580	and we're running behind tonight a little bit
5593580	5595700	thanks to live difficulties.
5595700	5598140	But I appreciate you guys sticking with us here live.
5598140	5599780	Again, we do tape live at The Voice of the East Network,

5609900	5613760	which is available on your favorite podcast app.
5613760	5614600	Loki.
5614600	5617340	Hold on, Goat Simulator's being glitchy like,
5617340	5619720	I know, shocking, Goat Simulator glitchy?
5619720	5621000	What?
5621000	5622540	Had to force quit this thing,
5622540	5624460	because it's all main menu.
5624460	5626340	Nope, main menu.
5626340	5628340	Nope, main menu.
5628340	5630180	Nope.
5630180	5631920	So anyways, okay.
5633220	5634260	All right, let's do this.
5634260	5637060	Okay, so hey, this is pretty cool.
5637340	5639780	If you're a fan of shmup games,
5639780	5642220	the creator of Ikaruga has a brand new game
5642220	5645380	coming to PlayStation 4 called Ubusana,
5645380	5648980	and that is literally all we know about it.
5648980	5651460	He apparently talked about it on his blog,
5651460	5653820	and mentioned that it's gonna be a downloadable title
5653820	5655300	on PlayStation 4.
5655300	5656500	You know where the creator of Ikaruga
5656500	5657940	got their start, by the way?
5658940	5659880	Genesis.
5660860	5661700	Of course.
5661700	5662540	Okay.
5664180	5667200	So that's all we know so far, unfortunately.
5668100	5671980	And then, during the Microsoft conference,
5671980	5674420	they actually announced that they're gonna be doing
5674420	5678520	an exclusive Xbox One bundle with Call of Duty,
5678520	5682240	and it's gonna have kind of a skin system, skin controller,
5682240	5685500	a digital download of Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare,
5685500	5688480	and a one terabyte hard drive,
5688480	5690980	and it's also gonna be $499,
5690980	5693740	to which I say, why the fuck would I buy that
5693740	5697420	when I can buy the Sunset Overdrive one for $399,
5697420	5700060	and hell, if I really wanted to add some additional space,
5700060	5702580	it would cost a hell lot less than $100.
5703740	5706540	But I guess then I would get Call of Duty 2.
5706540	5707380	Whatever.
5708540	5709780	But yeah, if you're interested,
5709780	5711660	that'll be coming out launch for,
5712580	5714220	well, it'd be now on the third,
5714220	5716820	because they're doing that Day Zero edition.
5716820	5718060	Whoopty shit.
5718060	5720780	And then, last but not least,
5721420	5724820	Meta Knight is confirmed now for the new Smash Bros. game.
5724820	5726260	Did you say Meta Knight?
5726260	5727780	Meta Knight.
5727780	5729860	Okay, because I didn't think they had
5729860	5731560	much to do with video games.
5731560	5734200	You know, it's not part of their lifestyle,
5734200	5737740	and they are not the Amish, hello, they're different.
5737740	5739700	Yeah, so Meta Knight, he will be coming,
5739700	5744700	and I wish they just would talk about new characters,
5744880	5748380	not old characters coming back, to be honest.
5748380	5749740	And just do it all at once,
5749740	5753100	instead of like, one character now,
5753100	5755060	another character now, another character,
5755060	5756660	I mean, we're only like,
5756660	5758940	about six weeks away from the launch, just.
5760020	5762560	I kinda like when there's some surprises still in the game,
5762560	5763940	although I guess in this internet age,
5763940	5765560	the surprises never last long, but.
5765560	5768380	True, but hopefully there'll be some unlockable characters,
5768380	5772500	like Rob was last time, I mean, I thought that was cool.
5772500	5774780	What's so cool on Melee, when you unlock characters,
5774780	5776620	and you have no fucking idea who they were.
5776620	5780020	You're all like, who the hell is this guy?
5780020	5781460	Oh, he's kinda awesome.
5781460	5783500	Are they ever gonna confirm Ness?
5783500	5784340	That's the one.
5784340	5786900	Let's go buy all of the Fire Emblem games.
5786900	5788420	It's been in every single game,
5788420	5789800	I don't think they're gonna take him out.
5789800	5790640	You never know.
5790640	5791780	It'd be funny though, like, they have, you know,
5791780	5793900	they do it like Melee, where they show the, you know,
5793900	5797180	silhouette, and it's like, your sweetest Ness is like,
5797180	5798980	haha, fuck you, you ain't getting Ness,
5798980	5801540	and there's mother is never gonna fucking come
5801540	5803340	to this console ever again, so.
5804220	5806160	All right, well, I have a few stories for you guys here,
5806560	5808360	starting off with a game I'm sure y'all are very excited
5808360	5810920	about, Just Dance 2015, right Dan?
5810920	5812240	Big fan of this series, right?
5812240	5814640	Not on Sega Genesis.
5814640	5818160	Just Dance 2015 will be out on the Wii and the Wii U,
5818160	5820280	that's right, the original Wii is still there.
5820280	5824160	Let's see, it's also on, it's on everything, honestly.
5824160	5825880	And it has some new songs that were announced
5825880	5827680	at Gamescom this week, including,
5827680	5830080	and I know Dan is a big fan of all these artists,
5830080	5834320	4x4 by Miley Cyrus, Ain't No Mountain High Enough
5834320	5836560	by Marvin Gaye, that's actually kinda cool.
5836560	5837640	That's cool.
5837640	5840160	Let's see, Macarena by The Girly Team,
5840160	5841320	so it's not just the Macarena,
5841320	5843760	it's a girly team cover of the Macarena.
5843760	5846080	Yeah, it's not by the original couple Macarena guys,
5846080	5847840	it just ain't the Macarena.
5847840	5850800	You Spin Me Round, like a record by Dead or Alive, which.
5850800	5851640	You're damn right.
5851640	5853220	That song's pretty fucking rad.
5853220	5857400	And last but not least, Best Song Ever by One Direction,
5857400	5860720	which I do not actually believe is the best song ever,
5860720	5861600	that is a lie.
5862600	5866120	The test revealed, that is a lie.
5866120	5866960	Moving on.
5866960	5868040	Wait, it says something about Shenmue up there.
5868040	5870120	That's right, because this next thing is about Shenmue.
5870120	5871780	Oh my God, that's why Sega.
5871780	5875280	How about an HD remake of Shenmue?
5875280	5879180	That's right, an HD remake of Shenmue is happening.
5880360	5883320	But here's the catch, it's happening by fans.
5883320	5885880	It is not actually something that is Sega endorsed,
5885880	5889440	which makes me question if it will actually happen at all.
5889440	5891160	Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and put a no on that.
5891880	5893600	See how fast this gets shut down.
5893600	5897120	But anyway, there's some YouTubes up there.
5897120	5899920	The creator, Nkun Kid, is using the original
5899920	5903400	background modeling that was in Shenmue, but new textures.
5903400	5907920	And the model for Ryo Hazuki is taken from
5907920	5910240	the Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.
5910240	5912200	So, kinda interesting how they're doing that.
5912200	5914440	So if you wanna see more, you can go to YouTube for that
5914440	5919080	for the fan-made HD Shenmue remake.
5919080	5921560	Which in our chat room, we have Fifth Dream saying,
5921560	5924720	fuck yes, fuck yes, fuck no, God damn it.
5924720	5927640	No, that was like awesome for like 20 seconds.
5927640	5929960	I was like, this is the best day, no.
5929960	5932520	Yu Suzuki is gonna find that guy and kick him in the head.
5932520	5934880	Yu Suzuki, by the way, still has every intention
5934880	5937980	of finishing Shenmue, he just needs fat cash.
5938960	5941480	Black Wolf in chat says, the fans are going to Sega
5941480	5943040	saying, hey mister, wanna wrestle?
5943040	5945800	And Sega will be like, yes, okay, you're dead.
5945800	5949560	Fifth Dream in chat says,
5949560	5952040	know where I can find a lawsuit around here?
5953400	5954240	All right.
5954240	5956960	Why doesn't Sega like Kickstarter, Shenmue 3?
5956960	5958800	Because if they don't wanna spend...
5958800	5960420	When Sega goes to Kickstarter, they're gonna be like,
5960420	5962000	you're fucking Sega, you don't eat Kickstarter.
5962000	5963400	But they make the money on it.
5963400	5965280	Well, cause the problem is that Sega can't afford
5965280	5969440	to bankroll a game that's gonna cost like $40 million.
5969440	5973000	Maybe if they stretched out his legs a little longer,
5973000	5976960	he might be viable as a character for these new consoles.
5976960	5980080	Like if Sega were to launch a Kickstarter like that though,
5980080	5981440	I'd be like, seriously?
5981440	5983400	Maybe Yu Suzuki should just do it himself.
5983400	5985360	How about where the fuck is Phantasy Star Online 2
5985360	5986680	in the US already?
5986680	5988040	Oh yeah, well fuck that.
5988040	5988920	Yeah, fuck that.
5988920	5991680	All right, well, I guess I could always play this MMO.
5991680	5992880	As I mentioned earlier in the show,
5992880	5994620	World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor
5994620	5996080	had its release date revealed,
5996080	5999640	which is November 13th, 2014 is the day it's coming out.
5999640	6002160	And if you're interested in getting the collector's edition,
6002200	6004040	you can pick that up for,
6004040	6005600	now the official price hasn't been announced,
6005600	6007920	but Amazon and GameStop are showing it at $90,
6007920	6009440	which seems to be accurate.
6009440	6010720	And-
6010720	6013120	Survey says ding, ding, ding, ding.
6013120	6014420	This is, I believe,
6014420	6015540	I don't know about the collector's edition,
6015540	6017720	but I know the retail was supposed to be $10 more
6017720	6018880	than it has been in the past.
6018880	6021800	And I'm kind of sitting here going, for what?
6021800	6024860	But anyhow, some of the things that you can get
6024860	6025960	in the collector's edition,
6025960	6028640	you get the physical DVD version of the expansion.
6028640	6030400	Those are collector's items these days.
6030400	6033480	A behind the scenes DVD and Blu-ray two disc set
6033480	6035680	that gives you some commentary and interviews
6035680	6037580	that you'll never watch.
6037580	6039600	The soundtrack, you get the soundtrack on CD.
6039600	6040700	That's pretty cool.
6040700	6042920	You get an art book for your coffee table
6042920	6045280	with 160 page art book.
6045280	6046560	It's something that you put in the computer
6046560	6048000	and then rip to your iTunes
6048000	6050280	or whatever your music thing of choice.
6050280	6052960	You get a mouse pad because every collector's edition
6052960	6054380	has had a stinking mouse pad with it.
6054380	6056640	This one featuring the Warlord Blackhand.
6056640	6058680	And some things you get in the game itself,
6058680	6061840	a Dread Raven Mount and a Dread Hatchling pet,
6061840	6062680	excuse me.
6062680	6065280	And you get portraits for Starcraft two,
6065280	6067160	Warsong Pennant for Diablo three
6067160	6068640	and a card back for Hearthstone
6068640	6071780	because we love that Blizzard synergy.
6072960	6074740	How about give us a good game?
6076000	6077840	I, well, it's not that I-
6077840	6079960	And it all comes in an oversized box.
6079960	6082080	That'll take up a lot of room on your shelf.
6082080	6082900	That's right.
6082900	6083740	I don't know.
6083740	6085280	I don't want to say that World of Warcraft is a bad game
6085280	6087240	because I've spent years of my life playing it
6087240	6088080	and having a good time.
6088320	6091640	The right people will always make a game fun, I think.
6091640	6093800	But it's just one of those things where it's like,
6093800	6095680	I just really disagree with the direction
6095680	6096860	the game's been going in lately
6096860	6098540	and the way they've been pacing content,
6098540	6099760	which is not at all.
6099760	6104400	But anyway, I can do a whole nother rant on this
6104400	6106260	and I probably will on this week's courthouse.
6106260	6107760	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
6108740	6110400	Well, for people who have been paying attention
6110400	6114960	to Mortal Kombat X, Kano has been teased now.
6114960	6118160	There was a trailer acquired by Eurogamer Portugal
6119600	6122080	who said that there were three different versions
6122080	6124280	of Kano to be seen.
6124280	6125640	One is a cutthroat version
6125640	6128000	that allows him to power up his knife attacks
6128000	6130140	with his cybernetic heart.
6130140	6132820	Then there's a full cybernetic version
6132820	6134360	that gives him a bunch of weaponry
6134360	6138120	and then the commando variation where he becomes a grappler.
6138120	6140340	So I don't know how I feel about that.
6140340	6141520	There's also a jungle stage
6141520	6144480	because every Mortal Kombat has a stage with trees.
6144920	6145920	They're probably evil.
6147280	6152120	And then there is going to be a Super Smash Brothers,
6152120	6155640	a 3DS bundle that will be out October 3rd.
6155640	6158160	It is red with all the characters on the cover
6158160	6162240	and black and white or very, very grayscale,
6162240	6164960	you know, pick renditions of the characters
6164960	6169320	over a red background with red and black lettering.
6169320	6172840	And it's a limited edition as they all are.
6172840	6177520	And it comes with it installed on a 3DS XL
6177520	6182160	so that you won't actually have a physical copy of it at all.
6183480	6186720	Also, last but not least,
6186720	6188760	Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain
6188760	6191360	and Ground Zeroes are coming to Steam.
6191360	6193680	So, good.
6193680	6195240	Oh, nice.
6195240	6196240	That's kind of cool.
6197480	6199360	We get to play the Phantom trailer.
6199880	6202720	Nice.
6202720	6205800	All right, let's do the FUGL question of the week.
6205800	6206640	Every week here on the show,
6206640	6208080	you take Facebook and Google Plus
6208080	6210160	and slam them together and you get FUGL.
6217720	6220240	This week, our question had to do with demos,
6220240	6221960	since I know PT was on our minds,
6221960	6224160	which we talked about earlier in the show.
6224160	6225760	So we asked our communities,
6225760	6229040	when was the last time you got really hyped for a game demo?
6229040	6232520	Did you ever buy something else just to get a demo
6232520	6235240	of a game you were really looking forward to?
6235240	6237440	So let's start on Facebook tonight with Tech 2030,
6237440	6239040	who says, back in 07,
6239040	6241840	I bought Crackdown just to play the Halo 3 beta
6241840	6244960	and I ended up liking Crackdown better than Halo 3.
6244960	6247040	I don't think you were the only one in that case.
6247040	6250000	Alan Alchemy said, let's get this one out of the way.
6250000	6253000	The Omega hyped Final Fantasy 7 demo
6253000	6255640	that came with Square Fighter Tow Ball number one.
6255640	6256480	Yes.
6256480	6258640	And yes, I did buy it for that reason.
6258640	6260760	Though, to be fair, Tow Ball number one and Einhander
6260760	6262840	are the two top abandoned Square franchises
6262840	6263680	I'd wish to come back to.
6263680	6264920	Aw, Einhander.
6264920	6266440	Tow Ball number two wasn't that bad.
6266440	6267760	They came with a demo as well.
6267760	6270960	I thought the Tow Ball games were actually really cool.
6270960	6275800	DJ Rama S kind of chimed in there with a nice hearty yass
6275800	6277720	to agree with that comment saying,
6277720	6279040	I bought Tow Ball number one
6279040	6280680	just to get the Final Fantasy 7 demo.
6280680	6281880	Worth it.
6281880	6283200	DarkTetsuya said three
6283200	6285000	for the Tow Ball and Final Fantasy 7 demo.
6285000	6287280	Also want to add the official PlayStation magazine's
6287360	6291440	Metal Gear Solid 1 demo blew my mind back in 1998.
6291440	6292720	Ah, he stole my answer.
6292720	6295400	That was, I remember when that was PlayStation magazine.
6295400	6297840	That demo blew my fucking mind when I was younger.
6297840	6299720	What about Zone of the Enders?
6299720	6301720	I don't remember that playing that demo.
6301720	6303560	That came with the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo.
6303560	6304720	Do you remember what the demo
6304720	6306920	that came with Final Fantasy 7 was?
6306920	6308360	That came with Final Fantasy 7?
6308360	6309200	No demo came with Final Fantasy 7.
6309200	6310840	There was Musashi Den.
6310840	6311680	No.
6311680	6312520	Didn't it come with?
6312520	6313360	That had the demo for eight.
6313360	6316360	That was it, that was the reverse.
6316680	6318520	It was already like three or four discs.
6318520	6320280	Where were they going to put the demo?
6320280	6321280	Up your butt.
6321280	6322120	Robert K. said-
6322120	6324280	I don't think that would have had the proper effect.
6324280	6325800	Robert K. starts his answer with,
6325800	6328880	after being a staunch Sega fan boy,
6328880	6330800	does he have your attention, Dan?
6330800	6333680	The Tomb Raider 2 demo that came with PlayStation magazine
6333680	6336120	made me buy a PlayStation just to play it.
6336120	6337400	Yeah, see, see what happened?
6337400	6338240	See what happened?
6338240	6339480	Sony stole that shit.
6339480	6341400	Bonus Sega answer,
6341400	6343680	reserving a copy of the Sega magazine
6343680	6344880	just for Christmas nights.
6344920	6346680	I miss magazine demos.
6346680	6349080	Christmas nights came with like every magazine too.
6349080	6351280	I think I probably had like three copies.
6351280	6352120	Although-
6352120	6352960	We only got one left.
6352960	6355160	Keep in mind, Robert K.'s overseas.
6355160	6356480	Robert K., you the man.
6356480	6357760	We have a Japanese one too.
6357760	6359840	Overseas, they appreciate Sega.
6359840	6361840	In Europe, they fucking love Sega.
6361840	6362680	They love it.
6362680	6364520	Nintendo was an afterthought in Europe.
6364520	6365720	You know what else they love in Europe?
6365720	6367040	Commodore 64.
6367040	6368880	Commodore 64 is really neato.
6368880	6371400	You know what else they love in Europe?
6371400	6372240	What?
6372240	6373200	Marmite.
6373200	6374160	No, no, no.
6374160	6375240	That's in Australia.
6375240	6376080	Moving on.
6376080	6376920	That's Vegemite.
6376920	6377760	You think Vegemite.
6377760	6378600	All right.
6378600	6380000	Fuck you.
6380000	6381720	Degenerate Johnny says,
6381720	6383840	back in the mid-90s, I subscribed to PC Gamer,
6383840	6386040	which came with PC demos almost every issue.
6386040	6387400	Although some demos were quite good,
6387400	6388240	none of them excited me
6388240	6391000	more than the Aliens vs. Predator PC demo.
6391000	6392600	As the player, you were offered the option
6392600	6393480	to play through the demo
6393480	6395480	as either the Marine, Alien, or Predator.
6395480	6396560	It came out during the time
6396560	6398640	in which AVP hype was at its highest.
6398640	6400520	To this day, the demo and the game
6400520	6403480	rank quite high amongst my favorite FPSs.
6403520	6404440	Andy R said,
6404440	6405880	I bought the Dragon Quest game
6405880	6408320	that came with the Final Fantasy 12 demo on it.
6408320	6409240	It was eight, wasn't it?
6409240	6410080	It came with the 12 demo.
6410080	6410920	I think it was.
6412080	6415400	Now, Alan decided to throw in two more answers here.
6415400	6416640	He's hogging the segment tonight,
6416640	6417480	but I will mention this
6417480	6418320	because he says,
6418320	6420320	Brave Fencer Musashi for Final Fantasy 8.
6420320	6422520	So that was the other one there.
6422520	6426040	So, and Jason, our buddy VXJ6V,
6426040	6427880	replied to that with a little up arrow saying,
6427880	6429160	yep, Final Fantasy 8.
6429160	6430600	I also remember being hyped
6430600	6431920	to play the Final Fantasy 8 demo,
6431920	6433840	though not owning a PlayStation at the time
6433840	6435680	meant I had to play it at a friend's house.
6435680	6437640	The Halo 3 demo included with Crackdown
6437640	6438960	is the only other one that comes to mind.
6438960	6442360	Plus, Crackdown was an amazing game on its own.
6442360	6444200	Let's check out some of the answers from Google Plus,
6444200	6445120	because believe it or not,
6445120	6445960	there's people on Google Plus.
6445960	6446880	Actually, we have quite a few answers
6446880	6448680	on Google Plus tonight.
6448680	6450880	Now, as part of the article,
6450880	6452600	I linked my YouTube,
6452600	6454760	where I did my playthrough of the PT demo,
6454760	6456240	which also got some response,
6456240	6457720	as Renee from Google Plus,
6457720	6459240	Renee Y.
6459240	6460080	We love her.
6460160	6463120	DNL from the DDR Freak days, if I remember right.
6463120	6463960	Renee said,
6463960	6466720	loved watching Sky get scared witless during the stream.
6466720	6469240	I haven't been so hyped since Silent Hill 3, honestly,
6469240	6471520	but did anyone else feel like PT was a scarier
6471520	6473560	but less thought out Stanley parable?
6473560	6475120	Like some puzzles were too hard
6475120	6476980	while others were really obvious.
6479080	6480480	ActDeft replied and said,
6480480	6482800	I remember buying the official PlayStation magazine
6482800	6486600	just to get a demo disc with the DDR Max 1 US demo.
6486600	6488480	I played that demo disc a lot.
6488480	6489320	Curiously enough,
6489320	6491400	the featured game in the demo disc was Sly Cooper,
6491400	6492840	which I didn't know about back then.
6492840	6494000	And when I played it,
6494000	6495200	got really hyped for the game
6495200	6497840	and a bit of a fan of the series since.
6497840	6499320	Flaco Jones replies,
6499320	6502060	my mind goes to the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo
6502060	6503680	that was bundled in with Zone of the Enders
6503680	6504520	on PlayStation 2.
6504520	6505360	You're damn right.
6505360	6507060	It was fantastic and better yet,
6507060	6509080	it was based on the Japanese version,
6509080	6510600	which ended up being a little racier
6510600	6512640	and more fun than the eventual opening level
6512640	6514320	in the finalized American version.
6514320	6516720	We drove all the way down to San Francisco
6516760	6519660	to buy the import of Zone of the Enders
6519660	6521920	so we can get the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo.
6521920	6523920	That's pretty hot.
6523920	6524920	Redertainment says,
6524920	6526240	the only time I've bought a game
6526240	6527400	to get a demo for another game
6527400	6528740	is when I bought Dragon Quest 8
6528740	6530640	to get the demo for Final Fantasy 12.
6530640	6532480	This is the only time I've done something like this,
6532480	6535320	including things like seeing movies to see a trailer,
6535320	6538000	watching a TV show to see something for another show,
6538000	6540640	or paying for a concert to see an opening act.
6540640	6541760	Last but not least,
6541760	6544080	I think this is Brozime,
6544080	6545800	but it could be Brozime,
6545840	6548660	but I'm gonna guess Brozime replies and says,
6548660	6551260	I've never purposely bought a game for a demo,
6551260	6553120	but I do remember being quite happy
6553120	6555440	when I was told by a friend my copy of Crackdown
6555440	6556960	had the Halo 3 demo with it.
6556960	6558680	So it seems like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing
6558680	6560280	seems to be the most popular answer.
6560280	6564000	Anybody in studio, open forum on this answer,
6564000	6566760	especially if you can think of one that hasn't been named yet
6566760	6568800	demo and game combo.
6568800	6571320	There was one that,
6571320	6573620	a demo that got me excited for the game,
6573620	6576460	even though I didn't go out of my way to get the demo.
6576460	6578560	And that was for Jumping Flash,
6578560	6581420	right when the PlayStation was new.
6581420	6584460	And I just remember playing that one level of Jumping Flash
6584460	6587460	on the demo over and over and over and over.
6587460	6590380	And then I actually went on purpose and got,
6590380	6593220	I paid like a buck because I could,
6593220	6596340	to get the demo version for Um Jammer Lamy.
6596340	6597180	Before.
6597180	6598180	Oh yeah, that's an awesome demo.
6598180	6600300	Cause it's got a lot of like weird content on it.
6600300	6602220	Yeah, and it basically has all of the music
6602220	6603060	in the game on it.
6603340	6604580	And it's just sort of locked out.
6604580	6605740	So it's weird.
6605740	6607180	So I ripped all the music from the game.
6607180	6611140	Well didn't it have like the change stuff
6611140	6612820	from when she dies?
6612820	6615700	Yeah, it had like the rap about being in hell
6615700	6618940	and everything for the Chop Chop Master Onion.
6618940	6620260	The Zoe,
6620260	6622980	the Zoe Metal Gear Solid 2 demo is the ultimate expression.
6622980	6625340	I did do the Tobaal number one
6625340	6627580	and Final Fantasy 7 thing too.
6627580	6629580	I mean, I bought both of those games for retail release
6629580	6631380	because of the demo discs they came with.
6631380	6633180	Both decent games.
6633180	6634020	Zoe.
6635060	6637740	Oh, what was, what game came with the,
6637740	6639700	the first Devil May Cry demo disc?
6639700	6641020	That was a really good one too.
6641020	6642500	Oh hell, I don't remember.
6642500	6645700	But yeah, the one where it's all like strange and ironic
6645700	6647620	that it should end the same way.
6647620	6649540	Oh man, that was such a good demo.
6649540	6650740	Loki, anything?
6650740	6652460	I do have one that hasn't been mentioned yet.
6652460	6657340	I imported the Japanese Blu-ray for Advent Children
6657340	6658580	for Final Fantasy 13.
6658580	6659420	I remember that.
6659420	6660260	I remember that.
6660580	6661900	That was a good one.
6661900	6663540	This might be a little bit outside the scope
6663540	6665300	but since my Metal Gear Solid answer got taken,
6665300	6666300	I have to go this direction.
6666300	6668060	But I remember it wasn't so much necessarily
6668060	6669940	about buying a game to get the demo,
6669940	6672660	but I remember calling into the BBS
6672660	6677340	and sitting there watching my modem download for an hour
6677340	6679820	so I could play the Wolfenstein 3D demo.
6679820	6681220	Fuck yeah, nice.
6681220	6682380	Episode one.
6682380	6683780	And then what was after that?
6683780	6685740	Like there was, you used to get the episode one stuff
6685740	6687380	all the time, it was Commander Keen,
6687380	6689100	but there were some huge ones like Doom.
6689100	6691780	The original Doom had like the first couple levels
6691780	6692620	were playable in Doom.
6692620	6696140	Yeah, I always have the fucking config sys
6696140	6699060	and my goddamn auto zet bat.
6699060	6701380	The right memory allocated in the right spot.
6701380	6702820	Yeah, so even though it wasn't necessarily
6702820	6704020	buying a game to get another game,
6704020	6706380	you still had to invest something just to play the demo
6706380	6707220	just to get a taste.
6707220	6708900	Yeah, it was the distribution.
6708900	6712220	It was like that 3D Realms Apogee distribution method.
6712220	6713060	Exactly.
6713060	6713880	Hey, it worked.
6713880	6715380	Everybody had the first couple levels of Doom.
6715380	6716220	It was awesome though,
6716540	6719420	when PC gamers start putting full games in there.
6719420	6721220	So they have like total annihilation
6721220	6723300	was one of the ones that they had in there at one time.
6723300	6725600	And it's just, I always love just like,
6725600	6726980	I just buy a PC gamer all the time
6726980	6729220	just for whatever free shit they had on their disc.
6729220	6730780	I remember when magazine started giving,
6730780	6733920	like there was a weird thing with Sega specifically
6733920	6738920	where they gave away disc one of Shining Force 3
6738920	6740220	and it's like a four disc game.
6740220	6741900	They just threw the first disc in the,
6741900	6743220	and like with the magazine.
6743220	6744040	Wow.
6744040	6745440	So that you would have that first,
6745440	6747700	like third or quarter of the game.
6747700	6748540	Wow.
6748540	6749360	And then want to invest in it.
6749360	6751320	I think they did the same for Panzer Saga,
6751320	6752520	Panzer Dragoon Saga,
6752520	6755120	which is amazing because the game's got a production run
6755120	6757520	of like seven units.
6757520	6758620	Right.
6758620	6759680	But not the first disc,
6759680	6761240	cause there's plenty more out there.
6761240	6762680	There's at least 12 more.
6762680	6763560	Good answers tonight.
6763560	6764720	Good answers tonight you guys.
6764720	6765540	Thanks for participating.
6765540	6767160	If you want to answer a future FUGL question,
6767160	6769880	they go up on Sunday morning afternoon-ish.

6774820	6777220	Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.
6777220	6779260	We should bring back Jumping Flash.
6779260	6780300	Props by the way,
6780300	6781700	to the Google Plusters this week.
6781700	6784980	You guys, there was quite a few of you this week.
6784980	6786200	You're showing the Google Plus love.
6786200	6787260	All right.
6787260	6789180	Let's move on with some more stories.
6789180	6790020	We have a few.
6790020	6790980	There's actually one last thing.
6790980	6791820	Yeah.
6791820	6792820	SSJ100 Matt says,
6792820	6794820	I'd subscribe to the Dreamcast magazine
6794820	6796660	just for their demo discs.
6796660	6797780	So did.
6797780	6800620	I mean the CD era really ushered in those demo,
6800620	6801460	cause I mean,
6801460	6802980	it's not like you were going to have demo cartridges.
6802980	6804260	I mean.
6804260	6805100	Well, you know,
6805100	6806300	there was one month in the place,
6806300	6807580	the official PlayStation magazine,
6807580	6809460	where there was like one demo disc
6809460	6813780	that had the warehouse level of Tony Hawk Pro Skater.
6813780	6816220	I think it had a track on Gran Turismo.
6816220	6817060	It had that Metal Trip demo.
6817060	6818340	I remember that one.
6818340	6822000	And that demo disc had so much gameplay in it.
6822000	6824300	Like I probably played that disc
6824300	6827620	more than I played any retail release for years.
6827620	6828540	I played the demo,
6828540	6829760	it was for Cool Borders.
6829760	6831260	I think the very first Cool Borders,
6831260	6832820	I played that demo like,
6833500	6834340	I don't even know how many times.
6834340	6835180	It would be just after school,
6835180	6837340	just be playing that damn thing over and over,
6837340	6838660	the same level over and over.
6838660	6839860	Oh yeah, and you could master it.
6839860	6841380	I mean, because there was so much you could do.
6841380	6844340	I remember the demo for Spy Hunter for PS2.
6844340	6845780	I could beat the first level.
6845780	6848100	I could beat every single possibility on it.
6848100	6849980	But there was like just a couple of those demos
6849980	6852340	from that glory time of the PlayStation one,
6852340	6853560	where it's like,
6853560	6857260	that demo disc had three or four AAA hall of fame games
6857260	6858100	on it.
6858100	6860940	And you could play those levels for hours.
6860940	6862020	Yeah, it was awesome.
6862060	6865420	If you were broke and bored, which it was.
6865420	6866260	All right.
6866260	6867100	So,
6867100	6868300	Not on Sega, but still good.
6868300	6871580	Kickstarter, you see a lot of, you know,
6871580	6874180	games being backed and funded on their wall.
6874180	6875540	Not Shenmue.
6875540	6878260	Well, not Shenmue, but the,
6878260	6880820	I guess the original creators of Night Trap
6880820	6885820	are trying to bring out an HD remake of the game,
6886740	6889780	or not remake, but HD remaster of the game.
6889780	6891700	And they're seeking, what was it?
6892260	6895980	$330,000 or some arbitrary amount.
6895980	6897620	Yeah, $330,000.
6897620	6898860	Ridiculously too low.
6898860	6899700	I mean,
6899700	6900520	Exactly.
6900520	6902540	Oh man, this is hilarious.
6902540	6906780	So they want $330,000 and they're seeing,
6906780	6909540	I mean, they're promising the world here.
6909540	6911860	They're saying that they're going to actually print discs
6911860	6913980	and they're going to put them out in cardboard sleeves
6913980	6915620	and, you know, for game consoles,
6915620	6917460	which I don't even know if the game publishers
6917460	6918420	will let them,
6918420	6920540	like the manufacturers will let them do that.
6920540	6921380	Here's the thing.
6921380	6925980	It's not a high def version of Night Trap.
6925980	6928060	They're basically saying that they want to
6928060	6930180	re-shoot the movie.
6930180	6931020	I don't think they're re-shooting.
6931020	6934060	They're taking the 35 millimeter footage.
6934060	6936980	Apparently they say it's like 4K or even like,
6936980	6937820	they can re-
6937820	6939600	Oh, so they're just going to reuse.
6939600	6940700	Yeah, they're going to reuse the footage
6940700	6942540	because apparently the footage that was in,
6942540	6944700	the footage that they shot was at a much,
6944700	6947340	much higher quality than was actually available
6947340	6948700	to be displayed in the game.
6948700	6950380	I mean, if it's 35 millimeter, it's good,
6951100	6953780	but my understanding was they wanted to re-shoot the game,
6953780	6954660	rebuild the game,
6954660	6957660	rebuild a game engine and publish it for consoles.
6957660	6959900	And they wanted to do this for 300K.
6959900	6962980	And then they still needed to buy the rights
6962980	6964940	to use the Night Trap franchise.
6964940	6966820	No, they already bought the rights.
6966820	6969020	They spent a quarter million dollars on that.
6969020	6973700	So that $300,000, 250,000 of it is repaying them back.
6973700	6976800	Yeah, see that's why, okay, that's right.
6976800	6977640	So that's what I was saying is that
6977640	6978740	that is scammy as hell.
6978780	6981580	Because you know, they paid like 16 bucks for those rights
6981580	6984500	and managed to somehow get a $200,000 receipt.
6984500	6985940	With all due respect,
6985940	6988300	as I realized the original creators of Night Trap
6988300	6989120	are involved with this Kickstarter.
6989120	6992980	Which was by the way, Rob, on Genesis.
6992980	6993900	Yeah, yes.
6993900	6995280	But with all due respect,
6995280	6999060	I have no interest in seeing this Kickstarter succeed.
6999060	7001380	And I don't actually think it's a good thing at all
7001380	7004140	because let's be real and having come off just,
7004140	7006800	taking your wife out on a quote unquote friend date
7006840	7010440	to see Showgirls at the movie theater.
7010440	7013840	Night Trap is kind of the Showgirls of the video game world.
7013840	7015240	It is, it's definitely.
7015240	7016800	It's something that's so bad.
7016800	7018200	It's kind of good,
7018200	7022880	but that means you leave it in its original badness.
7022880	7024320	It doesn't need to be redone.
7024320	7025480	It's gonna lose something.
7025480	7026520	Let's stop for a second.
7026520	7029440	Has anyone in this room ever actually sat down,
7029440	7032540	owned and or played Night Trap besides me?
7032540	7034440	Not owned, but a friend of mine had it.
7034440	7035720	So I played it at my friend's house.
7035720	7037080	I mean, have you seriously sat down
7037080	7040400	to try to play Night Trap with any degree of proficiency?
7040400	7042560	I don't know on what scale of, but I mean, yeah,
7042560	7043400	we sat down and tried to play a little bit.
7043400	7045320	Did you try to beat Night Trap?
7045320	7047840	Night Trap is kind of a cool game.
7047840	7049600	The idea behind Night Trap is that literally
7049600	7051600	you're monitoring the house and you're triggering traps
7051600	7054400	to take out monsters before they kill people.
7054400	7056000	It's a great idea.
7056000	7060520	It was definitely ahead of its time.
7060520	7062780	And it wasn't going to be good
7062780	7067780	because it was shot as a super, super B movie,
7069220	7071600	starring a B movie actress who killed herself
7071600	7073720	and a bunch of B movie actors and actresses.
7073720	7078720	But Night Trap isn't a bad game for what it is,
7079380	7080900	which is a bad game.
7080900	7081740	Exactly.
7081740	7083420	But the thing with this is it's not even about
7083420	7085780	the quality of Night Trap or not because I would love
7085780	7090780	somehow to see Night Trap released as a DLC
7091620	7094700	or as a downloadable game, even put on a disc,
7094700	7097720	maybe even as a budget title, maybe even as a full release,
7097720	7100660	but, and maybe even reshot, but these guys aren't doing it.
7100660	7103880	These guys are trying to get people to give them money
7103880	7105260	and they have absolutely no,
7105260	7107100	like they bought the Night Trap rights and they're like,
7107100	7109620	how the fuck do we get some money back out of this?
7109620	7111760	Oh, well, yeah, we'll make a game.
7111760	7113580	Yeah, we'll make a game out of it.
7113580	7115520	And we're going to charge you for the rights.
7115520	7118620	And I just, if somebody paid $250,000 for the rights
7118620	7121020	of Night Trap, man, they ought to be kicked in the balls
7121020	7122060	until they explode.
7124220	7126980	I mean, I'm sure it's the guy from Digital Pictures
7126980	7129540	who is just, you know, his glory days.
7129540	7130500	It was a bunch of old people.
7130500	7132340	Like I seriously don't know who these guys are.
7132340	7134180	His glory days are 30 years behind them.
7134180	7136260	I don't even know if they have like any programmers
7136260	7137900	or anything, it's just a bunch of like these.
7137900	7140180	Yeah, no, it's just, it is.
7140180	7141540	Let me get to some comments from our chat room
7141540	7142820	over at live.vognetwork.com.
7142820	7144660	Ragenator says, the closest thing to Night Trap
7144660	7146780	that I've played was Wing Commander 3 and 4.
7146780	7148220	The only thing those games have in common
7148660	7151180	is it's part of the full motion video PC craze
7151180	7153980	and CD system craze at the time.
7153980	7156380	There's really otherwise not a lot of similarities
7156380	7157200	I can think of.
7157200	7159340	Wing Commander 3 had kind of an awesome flight game
7159340	7161340	to go with the cheesy CGI.
7161340	7164180	SSJ100Matt says, I beat Night Trap at a party
7164180	7166100	a few years ago with friends, eventually.
7166100	7167920	I never owned it because my parents caught wind
7167920	7170940	of the original scandal and wouldn't let me get it.
7170940	7173280	Tigerclaw says, double switch was the closest
7173280	7174820	to Night Trap actually.
7174820	7176700	So there's some comments from our chat room over at live.
7176700	7179620	Double switch, that game's also insanely awesomely bad.
7179620	7180980	I had so many of those Sega C,
7180980	7182200	I mean, I probably still have a bunch of them,
7182200	7185700	but I had Night Trap, I had Tomcat Alley,
7185700	7187380	I had double switch.
7187380	7190500	You know, I loved the FMV games for what they were.
7190500	7191340	I didn't walk into it going,
7191340	7193460	this is gonna be the next generation in gaming.
7193460	7194560	It was just something different.
7194560	7196620	Sewer Shark, you know.
7196620	7197980	I remember Sewer Shark.
7197980	7199740	Welcome to the sewers, punk.
7201400	7203820	I can still do that entire opening monologue from that game.
7203820	7205160	Well, maybe not, but I could.
7205600	7207000	I'd walk around Taco Bell doing it
7207000	7209560	and all my coworkers would just be like, fucking Dan.
7210520	7212320	All right, let me move on.
7212320	7214840	I want to talk quickly about a new BioWare game,
7214840	7217080	which should have Jamie's ears perking up a little bit,
7217080	7219160	except this has nothing to do with Mass Effect or Dragon Age.
7219160	7220000	Sorry.
7220000	7221160	I heard the Mass Effect guy.
7221160	7221980	Yes he did.
7221980	7223720	He was like, fuck you.
7223720	7225240	That was last week's news, Dan.
7225240	7226080	Yeah.
7226960	7227800	I just wanted to say it
7227800	7229040	because I know my wife loves Mass Effect
7229040	7231000	and this probably fucks up her good time.
7231000	7232480	Ah, take that.
7232480	7233680	I'd probably think he contributed to the-
7233680	7235120	Mass Effect can eat me.
7235120	7236840	It's not on Sega Genesis.
7236840	7237840	Watch your volume, Dan.
7237840	7238680	All right.
7239860	7242120	Shadow Realms is the name of the game from BioWare.
7242120	7244160	It is a 4v1 game.
7244160	7246120	Another one between Evolve-
7246120	7247040	Four versus one?
7247040	7250200	Yeah, between Evolve and the new Fable game
7250200	7251680	and what Pac-Man Versus.
7251680	7252520	Throwing it way back.
7252520	7253440	Pac-Man Versus is incredible.
7253440	7254920	I know, right?
7254920	7256220	All of a sudden everybody's like,
7256220	7259040	I want to make Pac-Man Versus in my franchise.
7259040	7260380	That's a good idea.
7260380	7263440	I want to have a fighting game that's 4v1,
7264040	7265280	but just it's like completely unfair.
7265280	7266640	Just like, you know, the one person-
7266640	7268160	It already is completely unfair.
7268160	7269480	It's four versus one.
7269480	7271060	Pac-Man Versus is an awesome game.
7271060	7272600	We should hook that up and play.
7272600	7273440	We should.
7273440	7274260	Right now.
7274260	7275100	We should do a Twitch stream of that.
7275100	7275940	It'd be so much fun.
7275940	7276760	Fuck yes.
7276760	7277600	Yes.
7277600	7279240	I have his Elgato capture card.
7279240	7280500	I just never use it.
7280500	7281340	All right.
7281340	7282540	Elgato es en fuego.
7282540	7283640	Moving on, Shadow Realms.
7283640	7287260	A 4v1 story-driven online action RPG
7287260	7291680	with dynamic co-op missions in a evolving BioWare world.
7291680	7292760	There's supposed to be new episodes
7292920	7294280	that'll be released through this as well.
7294280	7295800	So it's a new IP for BioWare.
7295800	7299080	So that's pretty cool that it's a new IP.
7299080	7300400	That did come out of Gamescom.
7300400	7305400	You can register for the alpha at shadowrealms.com slash alpha
7305440	7306620	and I'm sure a lot of you guys
7306620	7308060	are going to be signing up for that.
7308060	7309720	So pretty cool.
7309720	7310560	Sounds like it could be,
7310560	7311800	especially if it's like story-driven.
7311800	7315240	I'm curious how the 4v1 aspect of that works with that,
7315240	7317360	but check it out.
7317360	7318640	Be cool.
7318640	7319480	Dark Sakura.
7320400	7321520	Well, we've been keeping up
7321520	7323080	with the whole net neutrality bullshit
7323080	7324460	that's been going on.
7324460	7326620	This one's a really interesting one.
7326620	7331620	Basically Comcast and Time Warner had $132,000 in donations
7332940	7336080	for an event that honored the current FCC commissioner
7336080	7340280	and then pulled it when said commissioner,
7340280	7341440	Min Young Clyburn,
7342400	7344500	basically made a bunch of accusations
7344500	7346680	against the companies that were trying to become one giant
7346680	7351540	ISP and buy his vote on the merger.
7351540	7353600	So pretty much, yeah, that's what they were trying to do
7353600	7355920	and they just pretty much made themselves look shittier.
7355920	7358580	People from Comcast and Time Warner, by the way,
7358580	7361000	donating 132,000 to anything,
7361000	7363020	that's like their pocket change.
7364200	7369120	But still the fact that they pulled said pocket change.
7370020	7372800	And you know, it's Comcast really getting dogged on a lot
7372800	7374080	in the news lately with all these people
7374080	7375720	recording the customer service calls.
7376160	7378400	I just saw one today on the front page like Yahoo
7378400	7380760	or news.google or something where it was like,
7380760	7382960	the dude was on hold for three hours
7382960	7384920	until the customer service center closed
7384920	7386720	and he had like the little timer running on his phone
7386720	7387560	to prove it like just-
7387560	7389620	It's a giant company of dicks.
7390720	7391560	Comcast-
7391560	7394120	To be fair, also the internet service provider
7394120	7396040	powering our show tonight that keeps dropping.
7396040	7398360	They are the best internet service provider
7398360	7399660	in our part of the world
7399660	7402920	because we can't get Verizon, Fios and shit like that.
7403320	7406400	God, like if you have to call Comcast customer service,
7406400	7408820	they will happily fuck up your account
7408820	7410120	for months and months and months.
7410120	7411720	And every month you call up and you're just like,
7411720	7414240	God damn it, reverse the late charge, it's your fault.
7414240	7416000	I will kill your faith.
7416000	7417440	This is basically though,
7417440	7422440	what the official Comcast VP of Community Investment said.
7422800	7423640	We have-
7423640	7424480	It's a bribe.
7424480	7425720	You know it, I know it.
7425720	7427580	Let's just get it out in the open.
7427580	7428960	We have great respect and admiration
7428960	7432000	for FCC Commissioner, Min Young Clyburn,
7432000	7435120	and for the Kites Foundation and its work.
7435120	7437480	We do not want either the Commissioner or Kites
7437480	7440560	to fall under a shadow as a result of our support
7440560	7442440	for the diversity in cable industry,
7442440	7445040	which is why we are withdrawing our support for the donor.
7445040	7445880	Pay off.
7446880	7449200	They just figured out a way to do it under the table.
7450800	7453760	I, yeah, well, I'm kind of done, so.
7453760	7456760	Jamie's just sitting over there going dot, dot, dot.
7456760	7458480	Can I tell my funny Comcast story here?
7458480	7459320	Cause this is hilarious.
7459320	7460160	Fuck yeah.
7460160	7461760	So, you know, I just moved from the apartment
7462400	7463600	to this house not that long ago, right?
7463600	7466900	So, I had my service moved, my Comcast service,
7466900	7469000	but I don't know why they did it this way.
7469000	7472280	They set up a new account for me completely,
7472280	7474180	closed it, then did another one.
7474180	7476120	So I've had like three accounts with Comcast.
7476120	7479280	I ended up getting a check in the mail from them
7479280	7481800	for money that I guess somehow was not spent
7481800	7482820	or like a refund.
7482820	7484400	And I actually had to call them to be like,
7484400	7485600	can I cash this check?
7485600	7487720	Cause like you just moved my service
7487720	7488560	from one place to another.
7488560	7491400	Then I got a bill for the device.
7492360	7494160	No, that was never returned.
7494160	7495720	The device that they said was never returned
7495720	7497360	because I moved it from one place to the other.
7497360	7499080	So I called them and got that worked out.
7499080	7500040	And finally they figured that out.
7500040	7501760	I mean, to their credit, they fixed it.
7501760	7505040	But to this day, I still get mail forwarded
7505040	7506000	from my old address.
7506000	7508600	That's like, you should sign up for Comcast again.
7508600	7509920	We miss you and dah, dah, dah.
7509920	7514520	And I'm like, you guys, I moved my service.
7514520	7516240	It shouldn't be that complicated.
7516240	7518060	I've got two awesome Comcast stories.
7518060	7518900	All right, quickly, quickly.
7518900	7520360	Number one is like yours.
7520360	7521200	All right.
7521840	7522920	When we were in the old house
7522920	7525000	where you guys used to do the show
7525000	7526160	and we had terrible service
7526160	7527120	cause I didn't own my own modem
7527120	7528720	or deal five or pay the big money.
7528720	7530360	Yeah.
7530360	7532400	When we moved to the house that we're in now,
7532400	7535560	Comcast fucked up my billing for like six months.
7535560	7537120	And this is like every month I had to call in.
7537120	7539360	The other one was just like your second story.
7539360	7541660	Comcast calls me one day we're living in a house
7541660	7544260	and some lady in terrible broken English.
7544260	7546200	And I'm sure she was just doing her best.
7546200	7550240	Was just like, hello, is Danielle Devrina there?
7550280	7554200	And I'm like, this is Dan Devrend.
7554200	7556280	Oh, hello, Mrs. Devrena.
7556280	7559880	We understand that you don't have Comcast service.
7559880	7563800	I'm like, my name is Dan Devrend and I do have Comcast.
7565600	7566440	Okay, thank you.
7566440	7567920	Click.
7567920	7568760	Awesome.
7572440	7574400	To be fair, and even though I dog on them,
7574400	7576320	I did actually call them this week to try to camp.
7576320	7580160	Well, we got AT&T, AT&T came up to our door
7581040	7583120	and they're like, okay, here, we can give you internet
7583120	7587600	and TV for basically $1 less than you paid right now.
7587600	7588420	You didn't say yes, did you?
7588420	7589260	No, I didn't say yes.
7589260	7590100	Oh, thank God.
7590100	7593800	Because their TV package was like their family package.
7593800	7595440	So it's all these family channels.
7595440	7597040	Their internet is so, well, you do have a family.
7597040	7600420	Their internet is so bad that it'll give you cancer.
7600420	7602480	Well, it's the fiber internet now
7602480	7603720	that they have running through.
7603720	7605560	It's 35.
7605560	7607260	Remember when someone cooked a fiber optic cable
7607260	7610080	in our neighborhood, sweetie?
7610920	7612400	Remember when someone cut the fiber optic cable
7612400	7613240	in our neighborhood?
7613240	7614720	Yeah, we got like two months of service out of that.
7614720	7616200	I mean, service.
7616200	7617600	They were trying to stop this show.
7617600	7619600	But anyways, they crashed into it.
7619600	7621720	They did offer like, they're all, hey,
7621720	7625960	we'll give you a TV package and double your internet speed
7625960	7629560	and give you HBO free for a year for like $4 more.
7629560	7630960	Tell them you want an iPad.
7631920	7633120	I don't want an iPad.
7633120	7635140	It sounds like people will give you a fucking iPad.
7635140	7635980	Yeah, they will.
7635980	7636800	The AT&T TV.
7636800	7638980	No, the AT&T, they wanted to give me a,
7638980	7641820	like it was a Google Nexus tablet or something.
7641820	7642940	It'll be an iPad second gen.
7642940	7643780	Fuck no.
7643780	7644600	It is an Xbox.
7644600	7645980	No, no, they give you the mini.
7645980	7647740	What, you mean the one that's in my hand?
7647740	7650860	Like an Xbox 360, a 32 inch TV
7650860	7653540	or like a Google Nexus 3 or something like that.
7653540	7654380	And I was like, man.
7654380	7656860	You and I both know that's on your list to upgrade.
7656860	7659780	You should give me a Mercedes, yes, it definitely is.
7659780	7661140	All right.
7661140	7661980	Nintendo's got some.
7661980	7664380	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7664380	7666660	SSJ100 Matt says, poor Danielle.
7666660	7669940	I know, I feel real bad for her
7669940	7672180	because she apparently does not have Comcast.
7672180	7673580	And that was back when they had just started
7673580	7676180	the cable modem and I mean, it was so good.
7676180	7677900	Like I called Comcast as soon as I found out
7677900	7680180	that that exists and was like, can I get that at my house?
7680180	7681020	And they're like, yes.
7681020	7683220	And I'm like, come and take my money right now.
7683220	7684460	Then the guy was going to try to give me
7684460	7686340	some extra network cards and a supervisor
7686340	7687900	because it was like one of his first installs.
7687900	7690140	Like just cock slapped him.
7690140	7690960	It was brutal.
7690960	7692220	He's like, dude, I just got in trouble
7692220	7693860	for trying to hook you up with free shit.
7693860	7695940	I'm like, dude, tell your supervisor he's a dick.
7696620	7697820	The guy just busted up laughing.
7697820	7699660	That's when we lived in the hood.
7699660	7700900	But when we got our cable modem,
7700900	7702660	that like revolutionized our life.
7702660	7703500	It was so good.
7703500	7707380	Because before that, we paid for two phone lines.
7707380	7708900	We had two AOL accounts.
7708900	7710980	When OLR first started, it was on DSL.
7710980	7713140	Oh man, well, this is pre-OLR.
7713140	7714460	This is when we still lived like,
7714460	7716340	this is before we even knew you guys, right?
7716340	7717180	Probably right around the time we met you guys.
7717180	7719580	This is when we still were at the tail end of dial-up, right?
7719580	7721420	I remember the house she lived in.
7721420	7722820	The first time I ever met you, Dan,
7722820	7724620	you and your friends were over playing,
7724620	7727660	having a LAN party, a local area Nintendo party.
7727660	7729700	And you had like eight TVs hooked up,
7729700	7731060	all playing The Legend of Zelda.
7731060	7732260	And you were doing like a speed run.
7732260	7734620	Oh, I dominated that night too.
7734620	7736060	It was so good.
7736060	7738220	That was where I lived in the hood house.
7738220	7740220	Yeah, we lived in the fucking get-to.
7740220	7741700	You gotta do that again, because I want in.
7741700	7744020	We should do that like tonight.
7744020	7745540	I gotta work tomorrow, fool.
7745540	7747380	Fuck, Colin.
7747380	7749740	I'm doing an admin day tomorrow, so y'all can suck it.
7749740	7750780	How about you suck?
7750780	7751700	Nevermind.
7751700	7755220	All right, as much as I love the Comcast Bitch Hour,
7755220	7757220	we do have more games to discuss, which is just-
7757220	7759420	Comcast Bitch Radio!
7759420	7760420	Loki.
7760420	7763780	All right, so this is pretty sweet.
7763780	7765780	No Man's Sky's gonna be a pretty ambitious game.
7765780	7767180	And this is one of those stories that like,
7767180	7770300	hey, let's throw a cool statistic and talk about it.
7770300	7772580	So here's the statistic.
7772580	7775220	You would need five billion years
7775220	7778780	to explore every planet in the game for one second.
7778780	7779620	So that's how much procedural-
7779620	7781100	That's probably bullshit.
7781140	7782940	But if that game is even half as good
7782940	7785460	as they're trying to say it's gonna be,
7785460	7787380	it might sell me a PS4.
7787380	7788220	Yeah.
7788220	7790340	That sounds fucking cool as shit.
7790340	7792420	I really do want this game.
7792420	7793780	It does sound pretty awesome.
7793780	7795140	And I already own a PS4, so I just-
7795140	7797940	And my PC's not gonna be good enough to run that.
7797940	7798780	You know, I need a PC.
7798780	7799620	Is it gonna be on PC?
7799620	7801260	I thought it was gonna be on PC.
7801260	7802900	Fuck the PlayStation 4.
7802900	7806460	Is it cross-play where PS4 people can play with PC people?
7806460	7807300	I have no idea.
7807300	7808740	Probably not.
7808740	7809580	Oh, Final Fantasy XIV doesn't.
7809580	7810420	It might be.
7810460	7811500	It might be because it's-
7811500	7813380	Microsoft's the one that doesn't play that game,
7813380	7814900	but you know, fuck them if they don't want to.
7814900	7817340	I think that's more like a square thing.
7817340	7819060	No, because, no, no, no.
7819060	7819900	Square's come out and said,
7819900	7822060	we would put Final Fantasy XIV on the Xbox One,
7822060	7823580	but Microsoft won't do the cross-server
7823580	7825420	and we're not having separate servers for Xbox One.
7825420	7827660	Right, Square is like, we're having one server.
7827660	7828780	And Sony's like, yes.
7828780	7830740	And Microsoft's like, no.
7830740	7831580	Exactly.
7831580	7832420	But I think that was-
7832420	7833420	But yet they did it for 11.
7833420	7836420	But I think this No Man's Sky thing is probably more like,
7837740	7838580	I don't know who's making it.
7838580	7839420	Is it Square?
7839420	7840260	Fuck, if it's Square,
7841100	7843580	it's strangely enough, it's actually, it's Hello Games.
7843580	7845060	They're the ones that did the,
7846300	7847660	was it that Motorcycle game?
7847660	7849500	The Joe Danger game.
7849500	7850660	Well, their office is flooded
7850660	7851860	during the production of this, right?
7851860	7853780	We're all familiar though with like what this is, right?
7853780	7855100	Like all your listeners are.
7855100	7856380	It's like an open space game.
7856380	7857220	It's awesome.
7857220	7858180	Yeah, sounds awesome.
7858180	7860020	Fucking sweet.
7860020	7860860	Let's see.
7860860	7861700	ActDeft in our chat says,
7861700	7864780	Dan sounds like the guy from Jet Set Radio.
7864780	7865620	Do you?
7865620	7868500	DJ Professor K, Jet Set Radio!
7869500	7870940	Ow, my ears.
7870940	7872300	Ow, ow, ow.
7872300	7873500	All right, a quick follow up
7873500	7875620	to something we had talked about last week.
7875620	7877980	This is GameStop announcing
7877980	7879580	their simplified trade-in pricing.
7879580	7880420	It is real.
7880420	7882060	That whole thing did happen.
7882060	7886740	So GameStop has 100 games worth $20 or more, they say.
7886740	7887580	So, I mean, I'm assuming that means-
7887580	7889180	Is that the press release?
7889180	7890020	Oh, sorry about that.
7890020	7890840	Yes, it is.
7890840	7891680	Is the press release through-
7891680	7893180	From a guy named Jason Cochran?
7895620	7897860	Jackie Smith says in contact.
7897860	7898700	I read one.
7898700	7900260	I threw that guy out of my store.
7901780	7903380	When he was my boss's boss,
7903380	7904500	he came in and was bitching at me.
7904500	7905340	I was just like,
7905340	7906900	if you got nothing better for me,
7906900	7908620	you just need to go.
7908620	7909660	And he just turned around and left.
7909660	7910500	My boss was like,
7910500	7911740	what the fuck did you just do?
7911740	7913340	I'm just like, I ain't got time for this.
7913340	7914740	That is awesome as hell.
7914740	7915580	You're hardcore.
7915580	7916400	It was amazing.
7916400	7917240	You're hardcore.
7917240	7918080	I love it.
7918080	7918900	All right.
7918900	7919740	So yeah, so-
7920740	7921580	What's that?
7921580	7922900	I said, hi, Mr. Vrena.
7922900	7923740	Mr. Vrena.
7923740	7924560	Oh, Alan just walked in and said,
7924560	7925400	hi, Mr. Vrena.
7926740	7927580	All right.
7928180	7929660	I do have Comcast, damn it.
7930580	7933300	So yeah, if you sell-
7933300	7934720	Anyway, you get a little more money
7934720	7936940	if you're a Powered Up Rewards pro member
7936940	7938420	and blah, de blah, de blah.
7938420	7940300	I still say sell them direct on eBay,
7940300	7942380	but if you want to take the easy way out,
7942380	7943220	you can.
7944320	7945160	All right.
7945160	7946000	Let's-
7946000	7946820	What?
7946820	7947660	I was saying, yeah.
7947660	7948480	Yeah, all right.
7948480	7949500	Yeah.
7949500	7951180	Let's get to the mailbag
7951180	7952980	because every week you guys send us emails.
7952980	7955940	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7955980	7958820	And we read those emails live on air.
7958820	7961300	Now, by the way, so our podcast listeners know
7961300	7962660	because I threatened this last week.
7962660	7964100	I said, if we don't get four emails,
7964100	7966380	I'm going to play music from Kim Kardashian Hollywood
7966380	7967860	during the break.
7967860	7969440	Kim Kardashian Hollywood music
7969440	7971040	was played during the break tonight
7971040	7972740	because when I looked before the show,
7972740	7974340	we had three emails.
7974340	7975820	One came in during the show
7975820	7979220	and I decided because people like Bobby and Act F
7979220	7980220	were like, he won't do it.
7980220	7981060	He won't do it.
7981060	7981940	You know, don't send an email.
7981940	7983540	I decided to torture everybody anyway.
7983540	7985620	So just so you podcasties know,
7985620	7987220	the live listeners got tortured tonight.
7987220	7989980	I'm still thinking of a way to torture the rest of you.
7992100	7993560	Besides having Dan on the show.
7993560	7996420	Then again, Dan was on the show this week.
7996420	7997240	Yeah, yeah.
7997240	7998780	I self burned before you could burn me.
7998780	8000140	All right, fair enough.
8000140	8001040	Burn shield.
8003780	8004620	Burn heal.
8004620	8006980	Plus one resistance to burning.
8006980	8008340	You guys have been taking so long
8008340	8010780	that I actually had to refresh all the emails.
8010780	8011780	I'm trying to kill time
8011780	8014340	until her iPad's battery dies.
8014340	8015660	Dan uses burn heal.
8015660	8016500	It's super effective.
8016500	8017320	I'm gonna kill something other than time.
8017320	8018160	It's super effective.
8018160	8019420	All right, Jamie, do it.
8019420	8021620	Well, I actually have to load the emails now.
8022740	8026240	So we could fill more time talking about Sega Genesis.
8027740	8029940	Have we talked about blast processing?
8029940	8031500	Blast processing is great.
8031500	8033340	That iPad needs blast processing.
8033340	8034860	That iPad needs to be blasted.
8034860	8036100	What's up, Orange Lounge?
8036100	8038420	I attached another song for Loki to sample.
8038420	8041180	I actually like Jamie's opinion on the song the most.
8041740	8044060	Which I still haven't gotten the original email.
8044060	8047300	That first email that he attached never got forwarded to me.
8047300	8049060	So I need that or either that
8049060	8051380	or got lost in spam filter hell.
8051380	8052620	Is this from Ranma?
8052620	8054860	No, let me finish reading the damn email.
8056220	8057820	So I apologize.
8057820	8060220	I apologize for not getting back
8060220	8063400	because I have not actually heard the song yet.
8063400	8064420	Sorry, Robin Loki.
8064420	8066200	She's your show star.
8066200	8067780	What?
8067780	8069140	My question is pretty simple.
8069140	8071220	Why isn't Destiny going to be on PC?
8071220	8073740	Do you think it eventually will be?
8073740	8075140	Probably, maybe?
8075140	8076820	Yes, I think it will be on PC
8076820	8078100	just because it's so easy.
8078100	8081580	The port, you know, the PlayStation 4, Xbox One games
8081580	8083340	because they're x86 anyways.
8083340	8086060	So yes, it probably will eventually go on PC.
8086060	8089380	Especially if, well, yeah, why not?
8089380	8090220	The funny thing is,
8090220	8092460	Bungie really hadn't done any PC work
8092460	8095340	since they went over to the console side,
8095340	8097460	except for the PC version of what, Halo 2,
8097460	8098300	Halo 1?
8098300	8099820	Halo 1.
8099820	8101100	Thanks, Smile.
8101100	8102620	Hope you guys had a wonderful weekend
8102620	8104660	and I hope you have an amazing upcoming week.
8104660	8107060	Much love, EA Skeezy from Milwaukee.
8107060	8109140	PS, Jamie, I would love to someday
8109140	8110660	spend a weekend on your couch.
8110660	8112060	We'll rock some games and eat tacos
8112060	8113300	till our poop turns to salsa.
8113300	8114140	Ew, LOL.
8115620	8117460	Yeah, you ain't coming to my fucking house.
8117460	8121100	All right, thank you for forwarding that to me.
8121100	8122820	Just forwarded two emails to you.
8122820	8123660	Sweet, I appreciate it.
8123660	8124820	You can come stay on the couch
8124820	8127420	if you bring us some of that fine Wisconsin cheese.
8129540	8131020	Hello, OLR crew.
8131020	8133260	13x forever here.
8133260	8134580	Third time's a charm, I suppose.
8134580	8137740	I also apologize for a long email with the Lord.
8137740	8140100	So Trails, what?
8144820	8145660	Whatever, Dan.
8145660	8149460	So Trails in the Sky, AKA Sora No Kisuke,
8149460	8152740	is the first game in the Kiseki sub-series
8152740	8154460	of Legend of Heroes JRPG
8154460	8157700	from Falcom, Dragon Slayer, Ys, many other games.
8157700	8160300	Kiseki series is one of the biggest,
8160300	8162940	most popular JRPG series in Japan right now.
8162940	8165900	Trails in the Sky first came out in 2004 on PC in Japan.
8165900	8168380	It was so large that the developer split it into two games,
8168380	8170580	first chapter and second chapter respectively.
8170580	8173180	Later, it was ported to PSP and PS3.
8173180	8174460	So what makes this game series
8174460	8176660	to stand apart from other JRPGs?
8176660	8179300	First of all, it is more story-oriented
8179300	8181260	than the vast majority of JRPGs.
8181260	8183140	The story and world building is bread and butter
8183140	8183980	of this series,
8183980	8186780	which resulted in one of the most detail, alive,
8186780	8189260	and consistent world in any JRPG out there.
8189260	8190620	Scripts for these games are really,
8190620	8192580	really huge example script shots.
8195100	8198420	Flat characters, existential plot twists,
8198420	8200940	mute town crowd, not in these games.
8200940	8204420	You get your in-depth character.
8204420	8205540	Stop it, Dan.
8206420	8207980	I'm talking to Rob.
8207980	8209780	Stay focused on your story.
8209780	8211700	This is like an hour long.
8212100	8214580	This is actually the guy that tried to call in last week
8214580	8215820	and the internet sucked.
8215820	8216660	And yeah, we said email.
8216660	8219620	Yes, so that's why I'm happily reading this.
8219620	8221180	You get your in-game character development
8221180	8222380	from your main party members,
8222380	8225340	and then for half the NPCs in the world,
8225340	8226940	albeit a lot less detailed.
8226940	8229020	That's right, you can see how things are going
8229020	8232380	for a lot of town people after each main story advancement.
8232380	8234420	What's more, stories in each individual game
8234420	8237220	are intertwined not only with previous titles,
8237220	8238460	but with future ones as well.
8238460	8240060	You'd be surprised at how many instances
8240060	8242220	of foreshadowing were there in the beginning,
8242220	8244980	even for the latest games.
8244980	8247060	First game is relatively slow paced
8247060	8249020	and light on the battle system in many games.
8249020	8251220	There's a lot of introductory stuff for everything,
8251220	8254060	but it picks up speed fast right before the second chapter
8254060	8255660	and other aspects are greatly improved
8255660	8257220	in later games on the series.
8257220	8258820	Oh, did I mention background music?
8258820	8260220	It was great from the get-go
8260220	8262060	and it only got better ever since.
8262060	8263820	Now, why is all the hype?
8263820	8268220	Sadly, only Trails in the Sky FC for PSP
8268220	8269660	came out in the West.
8269660	8271220	That's it until just recently
8271220	8273420	when XSEED finally released
8273420	8275940	a greatly improved original PC version on Steam
8275940	8278020	with lots of enhancements and ported features
8278020	8280020	from handheld and console releases.
8281300	8283940	What is more important, they're localizing second chapter
8283940	8285860	and plan to release it at the end of the year,
8285860	8288540	maybe early 2015 on PC first,
8288540	8290460	and then the PSP version as well.
8290460	8295460	And if FC and SC of Trials in the Sky will sell well,
8295780	8297340	they're going to get the third chapter,
8297340	8299740	which is a new game that bridges Trails in the Sky
8299740	8304740	with the next installment, Zero slash Aonokisuki,
8305700	8309460	and GASP probably may be somehow the rest of the series.
8309460	8311740	In other words, every sold copy of Trails in the Sky,
8311740	8314220	first chapter, and more importantly, second chapter,
8314220	8316220	will have measurable impact on the probability
8316220	8318760	to see the whole series being localized in the West
8318760	8320140	for the first time ever.
8320140	8323060	In conclusion, these are really great game.
8323060	8324900	These are really great games
8324900	8328300	for a really low price of $19.99 on PC or PSP.
8328300	8329900	If you're interested in JRPGs at all,
8329900	8331280	you should try this game.
8331280	8333700	Your friendly neighborhood bracelet, 13X forever.
8333700	8335880	PS, sorry for the messed up email.
8337220	8339260	You can't go wrong with anything by Falcom.
8339260	8341460	I just downloaded Ease Origin, it's awesome.
8342600	8344660	I'm glad we got to give the game a proper shout out
8344660	8347480	cause he was denied that shout out last week, so hooray.
8347480	8348740	Yeah.
8348740	8351580	Hey, OLR, I've heard emails run to high demand,
8351580	8353420	so I decided to finally write in about something
8353420	8355820	I've been thinking about since the whole Ubisoft
8355820	8357720	no fem assassin debacle.
8358700	8361260	There are all kinds of ways that games implement the player
8361260	8363220	in deciding what goes on with the main character
8363220	8365140	ranging from almost none, Dead Space,
8365140	8367300	Rise of Evil, Strider, et cetera,
8367300	8369980	up to complete control over nearly everything,
8369980	8371060	including how the player looks
8371060	8373020	and often story related choices,
8373020	8376420	Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect, Dark Souls, Saints Row, et cetera.
8376420	8379700	My main question would be which type of,
8379700	8382260	which of the types do you generally enjoy more?
8382300	8384580	For those of you who answer complete control,
8384580	8387340	do you think it takes away from the narrative of the game
8387340	8389340	in some way since the events have to be planned out
8389340	8391100	in such a way as to allow so many
8391100	8392740	different types of characters?
8392740	8394740	Or do you think it's sort of irrelevant
8394740	8398780	and that we should always be able to create a character?
8398780	8401620	Then for the second part of this question in games
8401620	8404240	that have you create your own characters from scratch,
8404240	8407140	do any of you have a character already in mind
8407140	8409380	when you begin playing that you will use
8409380	8410740	across different game series?
8410740	8413580	Personally, I have a short roster of characters I'll create
8413580	8415220	that I've been using since I was about 18
8415220	8417080	with some new characters occasionally branching out.
8417080	8417920	Pause.
8419580	8421540	I really don't care as long as the story's good,
8421540	8423420	although I really do love putting a lot of time
8423420	8425220	into character creation.
8425220	8427820	There really are pros and cons to both formats.
8427820	8430100	I think it's so hard to pick one or the other
8430100	8432940	because if I were to say that I only like it
8432940	8434800	when I can create my own character and do my own things,
8434800	8436540	I'd be saying I don't like Mario
8436540	8437500	or things like that as much.
8438020	8440860	There's great value in games like that.
8440860	8442620	But of course, I love the ones
8442620	8444940	where you can make your own character too.
8444940	8447940	Especially in a genre like role-playing,
8447940	8450380	I think it works very well there.
8450380	8453180	I mean, I wouldn't expect necessarily in an action game
8453180	8454780	I can do that.
8454780	8457540	Although I would think that in a multiplayer action,
8457540	8459980	which is why the Ubisoft thing got a lot of crap,
8459980	8462420	you would have a variety of characters to choose from,
8462420	8463780	but I digress.
8464780	8468500	I don't mind the lack of openness
8468500	8472220	in certain genres of games.
8472220	8475820	But at the end of the day, is the game good?
8475820	8476660	Yes or no?
8476660	8478480	That's the most important thing.
8478480	8479700	I do like to make characters though.
8479700	8480540	I'm gonna be honest.
8480540	8483100	I make characters usually that look like me.
8483100	8486540	The characters I usually make, not always.
8486540	8488980	Or I'll do a girl that looks nothing like me.
8488980	8492020	Well, I would like to tell the letter writer
8492020	8493320	because there was a note added,
8494200	8496520	you should read the first part silently before allowed.
8496520	8498760	Please, I don't want to impose on you or the show.
8498760	8501240	You should have put that up at the beginning of the email
8501240	8505240	because I don't read the emails before I read the emails.
8505240	8506840	I think he meant the rest of the email though.
8506840	8508440	There's something else that he put after that.
8508440	8509600	It said the first part.
8510580	8511840	I think he means the second part.
8511840	8513640	If you actually look at it, it says,
8514880	8516120	it's fine, you can read it.
8516120	8518800	I looked at it before the show and it's fine.
8519920	8522840	He was worried about making a cheap plug on there.
8522840	8524080	It's fine.
8524080	8525800	I recently started a YouTube channel,
8525800	8529680	partly inspired by OLR and sometimes my favorite YouTuber.
8529680	8531660	So I'd like to invite anybody that's interested
8531660	8534340	in video game related content to come check it out
8534340	8536840	since I'm trying to figure out what people want to see.
8536840	8539520	And the chat seems to always be reasonable,
8539520	8541400	fun people to interact with.
8541400	8542960	It's Brozime on YouTube.
8542960	8546540	Also, I hope to be in chat tonight, but no promises
8546540	8548240	as I usually work quite late Sundays.
8548240	8550120	Love the show, Brozime.
8550120	8550960	There you go.
8550960	8554080	I think it's reasonable and fun people on YouTube.
8554080	8556440	They're all a bunch of trolling, hacky assholes.
8556440	8557640	Oh, I come on on YouTube a lot.
8557640	8559600	I'm happy to promote your YouTube channel,
8559600	8561320	especially when you kiss up a little bit and be like,
8561320	8563080	you know, it's inspired by OLR.
8563080	8565360	I don't mind plugging people, I'm fine with that.
8565360	8566960	It's not in position.
8566960	8568160	No, in all seriousness,
8568160	8569320	best of luck with your YouTube channel.
8569320	8573280	I love, you know, I support indie broadcasting in all forms.
8573280	8575080	What about walking around your neighborhood
8575080	8576560	with a megaphone?
8576560	8581400	I'm broadcasting right now live from Rob's house
8581400	8583280	where all of his neighbors can hear me.
8583280	8584520	I don't want the police call.
8584520	8586760	That is probably the stupidest thing you've ever said.
8586760	8587880	You know what?
8587880	8590000	I can think of another stupid thing that I said
8590000	8592760	that consisted of two words when we got married.
8592760	8594300	And by the way- No way?
8594300	8596100	By the way, Brozime's in chat saying,
8596100	8598160	I meant the second, sorry, sorry, sorry.
8598160	8599000	So he's beeping up all the time.
8599000	8600560	By the way, I love this guy.
8600560	8602240	We know what you meant.
8602240	8604000	Jamie doesn't know what you meant.
8604000	8605940	I know that you can sit and spin.
8605980	8607620	She's walking home from the show tonight.
8607620	8608460	No, I'm not.
8608460	8609280	Do we have another email?
8609280	8610120	Yes.
8610120	8611220	Last email.
8611220	8613140	This is from Robert M.
8613140	8614540	I wonder what effect the changes
8614540	8618180	in Twitch's terms of service will have to salty bet,
8618180	8619700	even though when Moogan channel
8619700	8621640	is almost entirely focused on live feed
8621640	8623420	rather than archived content.
8623420	8625800	The prospect of betting on games
8625800	8626940	that have already taken place
8626940	8628660	seems even more silly slash dangerous
8628660	8630820	than buying a DVD of world poker jar.
8630820	8633820	People bet on games on Twitch?
8633820	8635420	That's fucking brilliant.
8635420	8636260	It's fake money.
8636260	8637380	It's monopoly money.
8637380	8638220	It's fun.
8638220	8639780	No, but that's amazing.
8639780	8642700	I mean, fake money, real money, that's inspired.
8642700	8643540	You seriously need to watch it
8643540	8646300	because it's all those independently made
8646300	8648300	Moogan characters fighting each other.
8648300	8651180	So they have ridiculous shit all the time.
8651180	8654460	And you sign up and you get like X amount
8654460	8655820	of salty bucks or whatever.
8655820	8657300	And then you bet on it.
8657300	8659620	But it's difficult to win a lot of times.
8659620	8663020	Now is it real players or is it computer versus computer?
8663020	8665020	Holy shit, I've got to check this out.
8665500	8667540	Remember when we did that for WrestleMania 2000?
8667540	8669660	Yeah, we ran the entire card,
8669660	8671540	and in a lot of ways it was accurate.
8671540	8672380	And they do that every year.
8672380	8674340	Like they do the Madden bullshit like that.
8674340	8676060	You know, and I was like, Twitch is all,
8676060	8677460	you know, earlier on I'm like, Twitch is awesome.
8677460	8678700	Twitch legitimizes our hobby.
8678700	8681020	Twitch gives everyone a chance to kind of show off
8681020	8683580	and it gives everyone a chance to see people showing off.
8683580	8685580	I think that's amazing until we fuck it up
8685580	8687640	and fucking it up would be real gambling.
8687640	8690060	However, if somebody has managed to turn it into a game,
8690060	8691580	that's like the best thing ever.
8691580	8693060	They turned a game into another game.
8693060	8694460	I am totally checking this shit.
8694780	8695900	They took parts from games,
8695900	8697540	they turned into a game into another game
8697540	8698700	about betting on games.
8698700	8700180	As far as the email goes though,
8700180	8701540	I think you hit the nail on the head.
8701540	8706540	It doesn't matter because like 98% of it is live based.
8707620	8709060	You know, you're not going to bet on matches
8709060	8711380	that have already taken place.
8711380	8713460	So I think it's okay.
8713460	8715580	Are they going to not let you broadcast live?
8715580	8716940	Is that kind of the trick?
8716940	8717960	No, you can broadcast live.
8717960	8720700	It's the highlights you can only save in two hour chunks.
8720700	8722860	Although I believe they ended up getting rid of those,
8722860	8725260	but they're not going to keep your videos on file
8725260	8728620	for all time, unless you specifically make a highlight.
8728620	8729500	Which is fair.
8729500	8732060	Yeah, which is totally fair.
8732060	8734460	Vast, vast amounts of storage.
8734460	8735300	Yeah.
8735300	8736180	Dungeon Buster says in chat,
8736180	8739600	I bet on Akuma and he was wrecked by a school girl
8739600	8741100	with a magic cat, I think.
8742140	8743620	Yeah, it's very difficult to pick.
8743620	8745140	They're like, there's all the rules in there.
8745140	8747060	It's like always bet on Dragon Ball Z
8747060	8748940	and never bet on Dragon Ball Z.
8748940	8752340	Never bet on Akuma because he takes damage
8752660	8754180	twice as fast as every other character
8754180	8756380	and never bet against a school girl with a magic cat
8756380	8758060	because she will fuck your shit up.
8759860	8761020	All right.
8761020	8763020	That's it for emails tonight, yes?
8763020	8764780	Fifth dream says always bet waifu.
8765740	8767180	Always bet on black.
8768180	8769020	Yeah, that's it.
8769020	8771420	All right, participate at orangelaundry.com.
8771420	8774160	If you want to send us an email in a future week,
8774160	8775360	I would appreciate it.
8776580	8778180	Let's go, Jamie probably won't
8778180	8779480	because then she has to read it,
8779480	8783320	but who says we were here to make Jamie's life easy?
8783320	8786200	I mean, dance here in studio tonight, people.
8786200	8787040	All right.
8787920	8789200	Love you, Jamie.
8789200	8790440	XOXO.
8790440	8791560	Love you, mean it.
8791560	8793480	Damn, you better get me a burrito after the show.
8793480	8795480	Let's go to the FUs of the week.
8795480	8800480	FU to the intensely negative world around us
8822280	8825360	and the fact that I came very close
8825360	8828280	to just wanting to sit back and watch it all burn
8829880	8832120	until I remember that there are truly good people
8832120	8832960	in the world.
8832960	8834600	And me, and me.
8834600	8837480	Yes, except Loki, sorry, Loki, you're kind of okay.
8837480	8838320	That's not good.
8838320	8839160	That's fine.
8839160	8840000	I'll stick with him.
8840000	8841840	FU to Rob for making fun of his,
8841840	8843240	for trying to, you know, rub in my face
8843240	8845880	that he has a signed poster that I don't even want,
8845880	8849320	but I'm going to steal now just to prove that I can.
8849320	8850160	Fine.
8850160	8855160	Also, FU to the ghost bitch in PT that ate me.
8856160	8857880	I made her scream and pee.
8857880	8859040	I did pee.
8860080	8861920	We checked the trousers later.
8861920	8863000	Doesn't like one of the,
8863000	8865240	like doesn't like ghost thing or whatever,
8865240	8866360	like pee on you or something.
8866360	8868240	Cause I remember watching, you know.
8868240	8869240	It sounds like it.
8869240	8870080	It sure sounds like it.
8870080	8871560	Oh, it's they're eating flesh.
8871560	8872400	They're rending.
8872400	8875920	Then I'm like, it sounds like you're getting drained upon.
8875920	8878400	Watch out because if you talk about this game three times,
8878400	8880280	then Shane will instantly be summoned.
8880280	8881280	Like he'll just appear.
8881280	8885520	And then the ghost pissed from her ocular cavity.
8886400	8887240	Okay.
8887240	8890200	Am I the oldest yourself so I married an axe murderer?
8890200	8892240	The only one who liked it.
8892240	8893080	Bullshit.
8894520	8895640	Like three other people did.
8895640	8897800	Anyways, moving on. Bullshit.
8897800	8900000	FU to Jamie for liking the old Michael,
8900000	8901120	Mike Myers movie.
8901120	8903000	So I married an axe murderer.
8903000	8905160	FU because you're being a dick.
8906120	8908400	Me because I'm being a dick.
8908400	8909240	All right.
8909240	8910720	Is that it for your refuse, Dan?
8911120	8911960	Probably.
8911960	8912800	All right, Loki.
8912800	8914560	FU for spilling Genesis wrong.
8914560	8915840	Loki.
8915840	8916680	I guess just.
8916680	8917520	Fuck that guy.
8918880	8921040	I guess just FU to being hot.
8921040	8922440	It's like hot in here.
8922440	8923280	I don't know.
8923280	8924720	Sorry. I have the fan on.
8924720	8926320	Are you pre-menopausal?
8926320	8927320	No, it's just this.
8927320	8930960	This is a wooden chair and it doesn't breathe.
8930960	8932760	He's got himself on this wall.
8932760	8933600	Do what I do.
8933600	8934840	I stand up during the show.
8934840	8935920	I should start doing that.
8935920	8936840	Yeah.
8936840	8937840	All right.
8937840	8940880	My FU of the week goes to the Sega Genesis
8940880	8941720	because I didn't have one.
8941720	8942560	You know what?
8942560	8944240	Sega Genesis F's you back.
8945520	8949000	Also my FU of the week goes to mood swings.
8949000	8950560	Yay.
8950560	8951560	All right.
8951560	8952400	That's it.
8953640	8954560	Just a couple more stories.
8954560	8956920	And then we're going to take your calls here real soon
8956920	8959680	at 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype,
8959680	8960840	Orange Lounge Radio.
8960840	8962640	You can call in and talk to Dark Soccer,
8962640	8965240	Loki, myself or Dan, I guess.
8965240	8966840	All right, Loki.
8966840	8969680	So you may remember such games as,
8969680	8972840	well, actually it is one game, but Remember Me
8974360	8976720	was kind of a game that came out last year
8976720	8979360	and it was okay.
8979360	8983000	It was this sort of memory hacking,
8983960	8985400	I don't know what you would call it,
8985400	8988000	like futuristic brawler.
8988000	8988840	I don't know.
8988840	8989680	It was kind of strange.
8989680	8991520	But anyways, that company Dot Nod,
8991520	8995320	they're back with a brand new game called Life is Strange.
8995320	8997360	And it's kind of like,
8998360	9001400	they're kind of comparing it to like a butterfly effect.
9001400	9005240	You know, every action acts a butterfly effect.
9005240	9007460	But with the power to rewind time,
9007460	9010360	what would you change and what would you,
9010360	9013480	and what would it turn out to be,
9013480	9015760	change for the better or for worse?
9015760	9016920	So I don't know.
9016920	9018520	It sounds interesting.
9018520	9021840	It's scheduled to be out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One,
9021840	9025920	as well as PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
9025920	9028640	And yeah, they only have like a little bit of a teaser
9028640	9031660	for it, but it looks pretty.
9031660	9032600	I just don't know.
9032600	9035240	Speaking of which, I wanted to mention though,
9035240	9037480	totally aside from this,
9037480	9040280	you know, Quantum Break wasn't really on my radar.
9040280	9043400	It kind of looks stupid based off the first trailer
9043400	9044360	that they showed.
9044360	9046480	But man, that gameplay footage that they had
9046480	9050280	during the Microsoft press conference was fucking awesome.
9050280	9051480	That game looks sweet.
9052160	9053520	So looking forward to that.
9055000	9055840	That's it.
9055840	9057320	All right.
9057320	9059440	Lastly tonight, before we get to phone calls,
9059440	9062420	obviously there's been a lot of talk this week
9062420	9065080	when the world lost Robin Williams,
9065080	9068200	the fantastic, fantastic improv comic
9068200	9071160	that a lot of you, of course, I know absolutely adored,
9071160	9072000	as did we.
9072000	9075240	And he was also a gamer, as I'm sure a lot of you guys knew.
9075240	9077600	He had an active World of Warcraft account.
9077600	9079720	He appeared in Nintendo commercials
9079720	9080920	with his daughter, Zelda,
9080920	9084360	which was named after the Legend of Zelda.
9084360	9086260	So in gaming news,
9088000	9089720	how this is relevant to the gaming world,
9089720	9092140	besides the fact that Robin was one of us,
9092140	9094280	is the fact that gamers are sort of rallying
9094280	9098160	for memorializations of Robin Williams in various games.
9098160	9100000	There was a couple different change.org petitions
9100000	9102040	out there, one of them for Blizzard,
9102040	9105240	to memorialize Robin Williams in the game somehow.
9105240	9107440	And it sounds like Blizzard was pretty receptive to that.
9107440	9108680	Pretty quickly they said, you know,
9108760	9110280	we've got something in the works, you know,
9110280	9111120	you'll see it soon.
9111120	9112880	And I would think that Mork the York
9112880	9115200	would make a perfect addition to World of Warcraft,
9115200	9116360	who knows, who knows.
9116360	9119160	Anyhow, Nintendo also responded
9119160	9121760	to a similar change.org petition requesting
9121760	9125080	that Robin Williams be remembered in a future Zelda title.
9125080	9126860	That one might be a little bit harder to pull off,
9126860	9128740	but fans, you know, are asking for it.
9128740	9131440	Nintendo did put out a response which says,
9131440	9133440	Robin Williams was loved at Nintendo.
9133440	9135160	Our hearts go out to his entire family,
9135160	9136960	and especially to Zelda Williams,
9137040	9139520	who we've worked with multiple times.
9139520	9141240	We appreciate the outpouring of support
9141240	9143680	from the gaming community, and hear the request of fans
9143680	9145380	to honor him in a future game.
9145380	9147960	We will not be discussing what might be possible
9147960	9150320	for future games during this difficult time,
9150320	9153120	but we will hold our memories of Robin close.
9153120	9156880	So I actually kind of really liked that response
9156880	9158560	because it's showing that like,
9158560	9162720	we're not gonna make any decision really rash in the moment,
9162720	9165320	but obviously we were big fans of him as well,
9165320	9167880	and we'll do, you know, it's kind of like,
9167880	9169640	we'll assess this at a later time
9169640	9171220	when we're ready to talk more about
9171220	9172680	what's going on with The Legend of Zelda.
9172680	9176640	So that, in that retrospect, it's pretty cool.
9176640	9180160	So, anyhow, let's move on.
9180160	9184120	It's time to go to the Skype line over at 1-877-GAME-OLR,
9184120	9186040	our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio
9186040	9187400	if you'd like to give the show a call,
9187400	9190240	and talk about anything that we've mentioned tonight,
9190240	9193040	or perhaps something else you'd like to bring up.
9193040	9194960	I'm gonna head over to the Twitter real quick,
9195480	9198040	but while I'm loading up our Twitter at twitter.com slash O-L-R,
9198040	9198920	let me check in with Loki
9198920	9200760	to see if there's any last minute stories.
9200760	9202620	And again, the Skype line is open.
9202620	9204440	They have a new Minecraft set coming out,
9204440	9206680	and these new Minecraft sets aren't the like,
9206680	9208920	micro, micro Minecraft stuff.
9208920	9210840	Lego Minecraft, I should say.
9210840	9215360	And they've got one, it's, was it The Farm and The Cave.
9215360	9219240	And they look awesome, because now they're minifig size,
9219240	9221000	or minifig scale, I guess.
9222440	9223760	Let me go to this Twitter topic,
9223760	9226000	because somebody sent one in just for Dan.
9226000	9228320	This comes from SSJ100Matt saying,
9228320	9231680	Genesis and Mega Drive news just for Dan.
9231680	9233920	Unreleased Bill the Tomato port
9233920	9236960	released on reproduction cartridges.
9236960	9238960	And he actually sends this to his story
9238960	9242400	over at retrocollect.com about this,
9242400	9244520	what is it, Bill the Tomato is the game?
9244520	9245680	Yeah, Bill the Tomato, wow,
9245680	9247160	they actually are putting it in like,
9247160	9249000	a little Genesis box and everything.
9249940	9251120	That's pretty cool.
9251120	9252680	Yeah, they do stuff like that.
9253800	9257000	Cool, you know, especially over retrocollect,
9257000	9259800	they're huge, huge into the Sega stuff,
9259800	9262840	and the Genesis lives on.
9262840	9265840	$75 in North America, if you want this.
9265840	9268160	100 copies of this game being made available
9268160	9269620	using all new parts.
9269620	9271680	They've done some like, really incredible stuff.
9271680	9273240	I mean, that's like an unreleased prototype,
9273240	9274920	but they've done like, some homebrew,
9274920	9277500	some brand new stuff, especially for the machine
9277500	9281000	that you would be shocked to see coming out on Genesis.
9281760	9282600	I seem to remember,
9282600	9284120	and I know Bobby's probably listening,
9284120	9285880	and he'll correct me on this,
9285880	9287400	but I seem to remember he had a pretty big interview
9287400	9290680	with somebody who was making like, a Genesis game.
9290680	9293160	Like, he had those people on, and I, fuck,
9293160	9294160	I don't remember the name of the game.
9294160	9295160	He'll jump in there with it.
9295160	9297840	There's this RPG that was like, a huge huge deal,
9297840	9299480	and I always forget the name of it, but.
9299480	9300320	And he had the developers on the show.
9300320	9302460	It just looks cool as hell.
9302460	9304840	And I really do wish that, had I known about it sooner.
9304840	9306320	The Baker Prince, was that what it was called?
9306320	9307360	Ah, fuck, I don't know.
9307360	9308360	Had I been on it sooner,
9308360	9310560	I probably would have ponied up for a copy.
9311520	9312640	There was a Kickstarter, for one.
9312640	9314480	There was actually, there was one that was more recent
9314480	9317740	that was a Kickstarter, that they were using Unity,
9317740	9320520	but I don't know how they would port that to Genesis,
9320520	9324920	but it had, it was sprites with normal maps on them,
9324920	9326920	so they had real-time lighting on the sprites,
9326920	9328060	which is kinda cool.
9329120	9330840	Yeah, just stuff that you wouldn't expect
9330840	9335400	an X60 or a 68000 and a Z80 to be able to do, you know?
9335400	9337400	But advanced programming techniques,
9337400	9340520	they can take old consoles and make them do things
9340920	9341840	that you're just like, holy shit,
9341840	9343400	why couldn't they have done that back in the day?
9343400	9344880	Well, they didn't know how.
9344880	9347240	One of the guys that we see at Atari party every year
9347240	9351360	has this mind-blowing version of Space Harrier
9351360	9353000	that plays on the Atari 800.
9353000	9355600	It must use a huge amount of memory,
9355600	9357540	comparative to what they had available at the time,
9357540	9360400	but it looks like the arcade game.
9360400	9362220	Not like, wow, it's the arcade game,
9362220	9364420	but I mean, it looks more like the arcade game
9364420	9365900	than a Master System version,
9365900	9368120	like a Sega Genesis version, anything like that.
9368120	9369760	And Bobby must have been AFK,
9369900	9370740	because he didn't jump in,
9370740	9372120	but Dartetsuya jumped in and said,
9372120	9373720	Baker Prince, and sure enough,
9373720	9377200	I went to look up the Wiki on it and it was Baker Prince.
9377200	9378220	The thing about Baker Prince,
9378220	9381120	it actually did come out in 96.
9381120	9383320	I think it was in like Chinese originally.
9383320	9387600	So the re-translation of the game happened much later.
9387600	9392600	2006 was, I believe, the tangible release,
9393200	9395440	and then they did Windows and all that in 2013.
9395440	9396280	So there you go.
9396280	9398440	I thought it was more recent, but yeah,
9398440	9400000	that sounds very plausible.
9400000	9402520	Yeah, it's supposed to be just this amazing game.
9402520	9405440	And at 96, I guess it would have been a pretty late life-
9405440	9406280	It would have been, yeah.
9406280	9407640	Mega draft title.
9407640	9410040	Again, I'm gonna throw that out, 1877 Game OLR,
9410040	9411000	our username on Skype,
9411000	9413540	OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give the show a call.
9413540	9416380	Do we have any other last minute stories from Loki?
9416380	9417220	No.
9417220	9418240	I think I saw anything else on Twitter.
9418240	9420220	No, no, we do not.
9422200	9423800	Well, Dan, if nobody's gonna call in,
9423800	9426800	you have plenty of time to reminisce more about the Genesis.
9427720	9431160	My wife showed me a picture of a cat driving a car
9431160	9433440	on like a Logitech wheel.
9433440	9434760	Oh, wait- It's a racing wheel.
9434760	9436160	I do have some more tweets.
9436160	9437200	It is awesome.
9437200	9439040	This is really important.
9439040	9441440	Vizaya925 sent us two tweets.
9441440	9442280	The first one says,
9442280	9443880	I'd love a complete remaster
9443880	9445400	of the original Resident Evil.
9445400	9446460	That game was awesome.
9446460	9448120	That was one of our stories last week, if you remember.
9448120	9451000	And you can have one, it's on the GameCube.
9451000	9454240	And Vizaya also responded and said,
9454240	9457520	Jim Boy's Tacos have the best fish tacos ever.
9457520	9460040	Tell Jamie she's trippin'.
9460040	9460860	Which-
9460860	9462800	No, they have the best vomit tacos.
9462800	9464960	I wanna point out, I wanna point out-
9464960	9466440	See, that's what summoned Shane.
9466440	9467280	No, this is important.
9467280	9468560	It's the badness of Jim Boy's.
9468560	9469560	This is important.
9469560	9472280	That tweet retweeted by the official
9472280	9474160	Jim Boy's Tacos account.
9474160	9479160	So Jim Boy's Tacos has indirectly told Jamie she's trippin'.
9480640	9482040	It is, yeah.
9482080	9485480	Jim Boy's Tacos is this weird acquired taste, I guess.
9485480	9486840	It's a local chain, I feel like.
9486840	9487680	It's a local chain.
9487680	9488920	It's called the International Show.
9488920	9489760	Oh, gross.
9489760	9491360	And people are like, what the hell is this taco place
9491360	9492480	that you're talking about?
9492480	9494160	Okay, dear Jim Boy's Tacos,
9494160	9497120	if you get me free tacos for a year,
9497120	9499040	I might say that one of them is good.
9499040	9501040	Why would you want free tacos that you hate?
9501040	9501880	Take it down to me.
9501880	9504160	The first night that Jamie moved out here,
9504160	9507320	I went and picked up Jim Boy's Tacos
9507320	9509860	and it just destroyed her.
9509900	9512500	I mean, she was just not a happy girl.
9512500	9514060	And it's very unfortunate because-
9514060	9515580	And then we went to the one by your grandmother's house
9515580	9516420	and I was taking her bathroom for two hours.
9516420	9518420	I think that was the one I went to, I think.
9518420	9520580	You know, there's people that live in like New York
9520580	9521740	or something listening to this show going,
9521740	9523140	I don't give a fuck about Jim Boy's Tacos.
9523140	9523980	You know what?
9523980	9526380	We don't give a fuck about you not giving a fuck.
9526380	9528420	You want to see how many fucks I have to give?
9528420	9530900	My fuck's given ratio is extremely low,
9530900	9532020	even compared to yours.
9532020	9534380	So eat a dick, taco.
9534380	9537100	1-877-GAMO-L-R.
9537100	9538900	Are you using him on Skype or in Sondra?
9538940	9539980	No, nobody really felt like that.
9539980	9540940	It was just Rob talking.
9540940	9544540	For what it's worth, Visaya925,
9544540	9547340	I had Jim Boy's Tacos on Friday and they were fine.
9547340	9548740	So just saying.
9548740	9549560	I like them.
9549560	9550880	They're covered with like that weird powdery cheese.
9550880	9551940	That's amazing.
9551940	9552780	It's called Parmesan.
9552780	9553620	All right, we got-
9553620	9554460	It's not Parmesan.
9554460	9555520	Finally, our phones are lighting up.
9555520	9556360	Let's get to it.
9556360	9557180	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
9557180	9558780	Who's this?
9558780	9560100	Holy crap, I'm on the show.
9560100	9560940	Holy crap, who's this?
9560940	9562180	This is EA Skeezy.
9562180	9563220	EA Skeezy?
9563220	9564100	What's up, buddy?
9565380	9567260	Malcolm, how you guys doing?
9567260	9568780	We're doing good.
9569540	9570900	From emailing to live on air,
9570900	9573340	what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9573340	9575580	Well, honestly, the girlfriend had to work
9575580	9577780	third shift tonight and I randomly thought,
9577780	9579420	well, hey, OLR's on.
9579420	9581620	I don't have to wait till Monday.
9581620	9583580	Let's call it and see how the game's doing.
9583580	9584660	God, I'm lonely.
9585900	9587520	Are you lonely, EA Skeezy?
9587520	9588360	Is that what's up?
9588360	9589420	I'll smack my husband.
9589420	9592220	Are you lonely tonight?
9592220	9594060	Do you miss me tonight?
9594060	9595060	I'm just bored.
9595060	9596260	All right, well, EA Skeezy,
9596700	9599620	I'm glad you called to get entertained by us.
9599620	9602540	You don't have any statements or opinions
9602540	9605300	you wish to inflict upon the show tonight?
9606420	9610380	Well, for one, I absolutely hate Time Warner Cable.
9611860	9613820	Yeah, dude, they can suck a dick.
9613820	9616140	Well, since we were talking about cable companies,
9616140	9617980	why not spread the hate?
9617980	9620340	What did Time Warner do to piss you off?
9621780	9625380	They sent just, I was a little late on the bill,
9625380	9628700	owed them about $100 and that's about it.
9628700	9632020	And they sent the guy to the door to come get the modem
9632020	9634260	and take everything away.
9634260	9637020	And I told them, well, I'll just hold on to the modem
9637020	9638300	cause I'll make the payment.
9638300	9639540	It'll turn back on.
9639540	9641180	Everything will be fine.
9641180	9643180	Guy said, yeah, that's exactly how it works.
9643180	9645700	So he left, but he failed to mention
9645700	9648740	that he disconnected me downstairs in the basement.
9648740	9650340	And now I have to go through the process
9650340	9652540	of having a guy come here and put in a new modem
9652540	9654040	and all that crap.
9654040	9655440	And that's, you know, that's weeks
9655440	9658920	and I got to pay service fees and crap like that.
9658920	9659760	So, you know-
9659760	9662040	That's what happens when you don't pay your bills.
9662040	9664280	Well, that sounds like a worst interest system
9664280	9666440	than GameStop's credit card, to be honest.
9666440	9667280	I don't know.
9667280	9668360	GameStop has a credit card?
9668360	9669200	You didn't hear about that?
9669200	9672120	Holy fucking crap, that's like the worst idea ever.
9672120	9672960	You know what?
9672960	9674040	You need to listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
9674040	9676800	We talk about all this shit that you're missing.
9676800	9677640	That's amazing.
9678520	9679720	You know, you think my wife would come home
9679720	9681080	and tell me these things.
9681080	9681920	No, no.
9681920	9683280	No.
9683280	9684240	Anyway, all right.
9684240	9689080	Well, EA Skeezy, to amuse Dan tonight,
9689080	9689920	since he's taunting you
9689920	9691760	for not having you paid your bill on time.
9691760	9693160	What is your favorite Genesis game?
9693160	9695120	Yeah, what is your favorite Genesis game?
9696160	9698600	My favorite Genesis game, honestly,
9698600	9700680	I did not have one as- Five seconds.
9700680	9701840	Okay, hang on. Same rock.
9701840	9703480	I didn't have one.
9703480	9704600	Super Nintendo, man.
9704600	9705960	Yes, he was a Super Nintendo.
9705960	9708160	Okay, what's your favorite Super Nintendo game?
9709480	9710960	Super Metroid, for sure.
9710960	9712120	Dude, dude, fuck yes.
9712120	9713680	All right, correct answer.
9713680	9715440	Correct answer.
9715440	9717720	Honestly, I honestly played it two weeks ago.
9717720	9718960	You are damn right.
9718960	9720720	See, at the very least, I can get behind you.
9720720	9721560	If you didn't have a Genesis,
9721560	9723200	but you were rocking Super Metroid,
9723200	9724560	you made the right choice.
9725680	9726520	Which, every time I try to get you
9726520	9728360	to play Super Metroid, you won't.
9728360	9731360	Because my thumbs are terrible now,
9731360	9734400	and the Super Nintendo controller actually hurts my thumbs.
9734400	9736240	EA Skeezy, will you come over, crash on-
9736240	9737600	If I could use my Genesis 6 button pad,
9737600	9738440	I'm on the Super Nintendo.
9738440	9739360	Will you come crash on our couch
9739360	9740200	and play Super Metroid for us?
9740280	9742240	None of these people are ever touching my sofa.
9742240	9743080	What?
9744080	9745560	Especially this guy, he can't pay his bills,
9745560	9747760	he didn't own a Genesis.
9747760	9749480	I'm gonna punch my husband in the face.
9749480	9751600	His only redeeming quality is that he listens to OLR
9751600	9752600	and he likes Super Metroid.
9752600	9754160	You don't even listen to OLR.
9754160	9755440	I know.
9755440	9756280	This man has no redeeming qualities.
9756280	9758440	That's basically Rob's redeeming qualities, too.
9760120	9760960	All right.
9760960	9764280	If I'm ever in the area, I can cook and clean,
9764280	9766680	and I can maybe stay a night just to hang out.
9766680	9768720	So when changing the cat's litter and you're in.
9768720	9769800	Dear God, no.
9770280	9771880	That's not even a good deal for you.
9771880	9773640	My girlfriend makes me do it all the time.
9773640	9775240	I hate to fucking do the cat's litter,
9775240	9777280	but I'm fucking pro at it now.
9777280	9778120	All right.
9778120	9781960	EA Skeezy, any last thoughts for our listeners tonight
9781960	9783000	before we let you go?
9784280	9786040	No, I just hope everybody enjoyed the show.
9786040	9788080	I look forward to hearing the majority
9788080	9789560	that I missed in the morning.
9789560	9790400	All right, sounds good.
9790400	9791240	We'll try to get it up for you.
9791240	9792080	Keep writing us every week
9792080	9792960	because I like your emails.
9792960	9793800	All right.
9793800	9794640	Yeah.
9794640	9795480	Definitely.
9795480	9796320	Bye, my friend.
9796320	9797160	I'll send you a new one next week.
9797160	9798120	Yep, good to hear you guys.
9798120	9799200	Later.
9799200	9800040	All right.
9800040	9800880	That was EA Skeezy,
9800880	9803080	who I believe is the first time actually on the show,
9803080	9804800	even though we get the emails a lot.
9804800	9806000	Now the phones are lighting up.
9806000	9807160	Let's go back to it again.
9807160	9808040	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9808040	9808880	Who's this?
9808880	9809960	Hey, guys, it's Jason.
9809960	9810800	Hey, Jason.
9810800	9811640	How you doing?
9811640	9812480	Doing pretty good.
9812480	9813720	Good to hear from you.
9813720	9816040	Every show that's a reminiscing show is a good show
9816040	9818160	because after reading,
9818160	9820600	it's funny because I jumped in on Facebook
9820600	9823400	just to correct the fact that Alan said 13 and not eight
9823400	9824800	because he said X and not V.
9824800	9825640	Oh, did he?
9825640	9826480	I didn't even catch it.
9826480	9827300	Yeah.
9827300	9828140	Maybe he edited it since-
9828140	9829900	Did it make you feel better about yourself?
9829900	9834260	I am one of those assholes on the internet, unfortunately.
9834260	9835100	So yes.
9835100	9835920	Good man.
9835920	9836760	So scary.
9836760	9837600	And I meant to read the comments
9837600	9839700	to see if anybody else had the whole Crackdown Halo thing.
9839700	9842540	I'm totally not surprised that they did.
9842540	9845580	But one of the other things that sprang to mind,
9845580	9847980	talking about PlayStation Magazine demos and whatnot,
9847980	9851440	was the disc, the issue, whatever date, whatever issue,
9851440	9853140	that had Jet Moto 2 on it.
9854100	9856200	Everybody else, if I remember correctly,
9856200	9858560	I seem to remember three games on that disc.
9858560	9860000	I love Jet Moto 2.
9860000	9862840	The level, the music for the stage that they picked,
9862840	9865760	I'm fairly sure it was just a one level demo, was amazing.
9865760	9866720	But if I remember correctly,
9866720	9869840	that same disc also had Xenogears
9869840	9872360	and either Tomba 1 or Tomba 2.
9873400	9875480	Oh, Tomba's such a good game.
9875480	9877200	And I've never played either of them.
9877200	9878400	People know about it,
9878400	9881640	but the mainstream audience doesn't know about it.
9881640	9884200	Yes, that game definitely has cult status.
9884200	9886080	Man, I miss Jet Moto.
9886840	9887680	That series is awesome.
9887680	9889600	No, Jet Moto 1 and 2 were awesome.
9889600	9890440	And then what was it?
9890440	9892600	The third one was the 989 one, right?
9892600	9894120	Because the first two were by Singletrack,
9894120	9894960	if I remember correctly.
9894960	9895800	Oh, I never played the third one.
9895800	9897760	The third one went to 989 Studios.
9897760	9899760	And 989 Studios had a way of taking everything
9899760	9902480	that they touched and just making absolute shit out of it.
9902480	9904200	Was that also the case with Cool Borders?
9904200	9906320	That like the first three was somebody with a 989 afterword?
9906320	9907940	Every Sony franchise,
9907940	9909960	when they got rid of that original,
9909960	9911200	when the PlayStation came out,
9911200	9913240	Sony had a literal dream team of developers.
9913240	9914280	It just wasn't pushed as much,
9914320	9917840	but they had guys who were just really good at making games.
9917840	9919640	And then they ended up taking those guys.
9919640	9921720	And after they built these franchises and said,
9921720	9923960	all right, now fucking pay us.
9923960	9925840	Sony said, oh, thank you for your work.
9925840	9928480	We're going to give your franchise over to 989 Studios
9928480	9930040	who made games for, you know,
9930040	9934080	peanuts and toffee and just fucking ruined them.
9934080	9936360	And the game and the fact that they were made
9936360	9937200	at that scale show.
9937200	9938600	Jet Moto, blah.
9938600	9941040	All their sports franchises, blah.
9941040	9943120	Jesus Christ.
9943120	9944080	It's a little unfortunate
9944080	9947800	because I actually bought Jet Moto 2 for original PSP.
9947800	9949280	I don't know if it's going to be better on the Vita.
9949280	9952440	Probably not because like the game just doesn't feel right.
9952440	9954040	And I don't know if that's just because
9954040	9955640	I'm missing the second triggers
9955640	9958000	because the PSPs don't have two sets of triggers
9958000	9958840	on each side.
9958840	9960280	You got to have that PlayStation control.
9960280	9961640	Yeah, you really do.
9961640	9963920	It's I, and I also,
9963920	9966140	I actually don't even have a console PlayStation anymore,
9966140	9967720	but I'm looking forward to,
9968840	9971200	I want to say that the store said that you could play it
9971200	9972040	on a console as well, but I'm sure.
9972040	9973240	PlayStation stuff is still cheap
9973240	9975800	and it's still out there and just get it now
9975800	9977100	because they're mechanical.
9977100	9979160	They're only going to get harder to find
9979160	9981080	and they're going to get more expensive
9981080	9985560	and just, you know, eventually titles like, you know,
9985560	9988860	Warhawk and Jet Moto and ESPN Extreme Games,
9988860	9992440	all those weird early PlayStation games that were so good
9993480	9995040	from that early generation will be gone
9995040	9997960	because they're not going to age like cartridges do
9997960	9999240	where there's no moving parts.
9999240	10000740	There's really nothing to break.
10001460	10004020	Eventually it's going to be damn hard to find a PlayStation.
10004020	10004860	Yup.
10007220	10008800	All right, wow, all right.
10008800	10011420	It's sort of, I just,
10011420	10013620	you guys talking about like the PS1 demos and everything,
10013620	10015420	it really does make me think about how all of that
10015420	10017140	is really like a lost art because, you know,
10017140	10019100	now obviously we do all the download demos,
10019100	10022460	but even it seems like download demos even are less and less
10022460	10023620	depending on the console.
10023620	10025360	Like I think about like Wii U,
10025360	10026700	it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot
10026700	10028720	of downloadable demos on something like Wii U.
10028720	10030340	Want me to tell you why?
10030980	10033700	Because they figured it was a waste of time.
10033700	10036100	The problem was is that they figured out eventually
10036100	10037580	after all these years of doing demos
10037580	10040660	that having a demo out didn't really affect
10040660	10043500	the sales of your title positively
10043500	10047900	and could in fact greatly affect it negatively.
10047900	10050580	And since demos are typically early versions of games
10050580	10052420	that lack polish and whatnot,
10052420	10055220	unless you spent a lot of extra time and development money
10055220	10058840	making a good demo, you probably were going to ruin your game.
10058840	10061440	Plus tons of people would just play that demo and go,
10061440	10062980	eh, it was cool.
10062980	10064560	So companies pretty much decided
10064560	10067120	unless it's something AAA and they need to create hype
10067120	10069320	to buy themselves another six months of development time
10069320	10070880	without losing momentum,
10070880	10072640	then they're not going to give you that free taste.
10072640	10074720	They're just going to let us sit back.
10074720	10076880	At the same time, you know what's kind of weird about that?
10076880	10079000	That was probably always the case for consoles.
10079000	10080960	I know it was always the case for consoles,
10080960	10083600	but like I started playing through Serious Sam
10083600	10087720	and I was reminded of how that and Shadow Warrior
10088720	10091560	and I know at least one or two other games
10091560	10094160	that the demo was the same engine,
10094160	10097380	but had otherwise shorter, unique content.
10097380	10099640	And when you actually bought the full game, it said,
10099640	10102060	hey, here's the extra content from the demo
10102060	10103640	in addition to what you can play with the whole,
10103640	10105380	with the full game, which is,
10105380	10107360	and my idea, really cool way of doing it,
10107360	10109680	especially since demos are more or less,
10109680	10111760	we're more or less always digital,
10111760	10112980	you know, BBSs and whatnot.
10112980	10115060	They can make the game, master it, ship it,
10115060	10117360	get it into stores during that time,
10117840	10119120	whip up new content,
10119120	10121280	be able to put that on digital mechanisms.
10121280	10122880	And there's really no way,
10122880	10124840	no reason why they couldn't be doing that right now.
10124840	10126920	Well, PC demos are kind of a different world.
10126920	10127760	Sure, absolutely.
10127760	10129160	Because usually it's just like,
10129160	10130920	they're going to take a little bit of the code,
10130920	10132280	they're going to polish it up a tiny bit
10132280	10134500	and they're going to make it available for download.
10134500	10135340	With console demos,
10135340	10138280	because they needed to be mastered onto a disc,
10138280	10141400	they needed more lead time.
10141400	10144780	So, I mean, that's a super, super valid point.
10144780	10146320	And it's also not applicable to everything.
10146320	10149520	It's super applicable to those frenzied action games,
10149520	10152400	which you get an RPG or an adventure game or a puzzle.
10152400	10154380	I guess there's room for new puzzles
10154380	10156280	to be made in a puzzle game, but like-
10156280	10157240	Yeah, you know, it's a puzzle game,
10157240	10158080	you want to do the demo-
10158080	10160440	Peggle and other little trash games like that.
10160440	10161760	Trash is the wrong word, but, you know,
10161760	10162880	simple little games,
10162880	10164920	there's not going to be interesting, unique content
10164920	10166880	you're going to be able to do with those sorts of things.
10166880	10167980	All right, well, Jason,
10167980	10170640	I appreciate the walk down memory lane of demos here.
10170640	10172240	Any other quick thoughts before we let you go?
10172240	10173960	Because the phones are lighting up,
10173960	10176300	so I want to try and get one more call in.
10176300	10177640	I'm not witty enough this fast enough.
10177640	10178480	Take another call.
10178480	10180140	All right, take care, buddy.
10180140	10180980	Bye.
10180980	10182740	That guy's my favorite caller.
10182740	10183580	He's a good guy.
10183580	10184400	He's a good guy.
10184400	10185240	All right, yeah, our phones are lighting up,
10185240	10187300	so let's try to take at least one more call here
10187300	10188960	before we wrap up the show tonight.
10188960	10189800	Let's get to it.
10189800	10190620	Hi, you're on Orange Home Radio.
10190620	10191460	Who's this?
10191460	10192300	Hey, can you hear me?
10192300	10194360	Yeah, we can hear you, and we can see you.
10194360	10195420	Hey, hello.
10195420	10196740	Hi, it's Brozime.
10196740	10197740	Brozime!
10197740	10199940	Hey, is this your first time calling the show?
10199940	10200780	Yeah, yes.
10200780	10201620	That is two first time calls?
10201620	10202620	Completely the first time.
10202620	10205340	Actually, I think it's my first time here being live at all.
10205340	10206180	Oh my gosh.
10207300	10208120	The people are coming in the new crowd.
10208120	10208960	The people are coming to see Dan.
10208960	10210460	Were you here just to see Dan?
10211420	10212260	Just say yes.
10212260	10213980	I think the first time I heard Dan,
10213980	10216780	since I've only been listening since like episode 500,
10216780	10220100	was just a voice in the background yelling at you.
10220100	10221420	That is, because I was asking.
10221420	10222260	That's about accurate.
10222260	10223100	I believe the quote was,
10223100	10223940	What's up, bitches?
10223940	10224760	Sup, bitches?
10224760	10225600	Yeah, because...
10225600	10226500	Oh yeah, that sounds about right.
10226500	10228300	Dan had brought over a bed.
10228300	10230140	When Jamie and Dan moved, they had an extra bed,
10230140	10231300	so they brought it over to this house,
10231300	10232380	because we have all this space now.
10232380	10234340	So yeah, that was the episode they brought it over.
10234340	10236180	When we brought Shane something to sleep on.
10237000	10237840	Yeah, you guys definitely don't want to hear
10237840	10238900	about the beds in my house.
10238900	10240860	I want to hear about what you want to say tonight.
10240860	10242220	What's up?
10242220	10243380	Uh, not much.
10243380	10246240	Got off work early and was able to make it home
10246240	10248540	to be in chat whenever you guys are reading emails and stuff.
10248540	10250220	So I missed the first part of the show,
10250220	10253660	but I'm glad I got to hear like the majority, I guess.
10253660	10255580	Yeah, we've been having live stream drops anyway.
10255580	10257380	Wait, so you're like EA Skis.
10257380	10258860	You don't have any comments on what's going on?
10258860	10260580	What's your favorite Genesis game?
10260580	10262420	Ha.
10262420	10263740	Well, please tell us your favorite Genesis game
10263740	10265900	if you don't got nothing better to say.
10266580	10267740	I think it was Sonic 2.
10267740	10269100	Okay, good. That's valid.
10270260	10271420	Sonic 2 is a great game.
10271420	10274280	I think Sonic 2 is the only Sega Genesis game
10274280	10276020	I played though at a friend's house.
10276020	10277740	It is the best selling game,
10277740	10280100	I believe for the Sega Genesis.
10280100	10283500	It is the best selling game of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.
10283500	10286060	And it's also probably one of the most like
10286060	10288600	speculated about games in terms of beta versions
10288600	10289440	in the history of games.
10289440	10291500	And it's also one of the most cursed at versions
10291500	10293460	because of the chemical plant.
10293460	10294420	Chemical plant zone.
10294420	10295740	Yeah, that was pretty cool.
10296460	10297500	And that's like stage two.
10297500	10299380	So you mentioned you had to go to a friend's to play it.
10299380	10300620	Were you a Super Nintendo guy?
10300620	10302060	Or let me guess, you're probably-
10302060	10302900	Oh yeah.
10302900	10304220	Okay, I was gonna say, you're probably young enough
10304220	10307140	where you only had a PlayStation or something.
10307140	10311100	Well, the weird thing is that I had a Super Nintendo
10311100	10314180	like while the N64 was out.
10314180	10315220	Okay.
10315220	10317620	So I was just like late to the party basically
10317620	10322180	because my parents had the, not N64, Super Nintendo.
10322180	10325700	So I was playing that for ages before I got an N64.
10326540	10328260	So what was your favorite Super Nintendo game?
10328260	10330180	Favorite Super Nintendo game was definitely
10330180	10332220	looks like the original Legend of Zelda.
10332220	10333780	Like that was my favorite game.
10333780	10335580	Well, the original Legend of Zelda was NES.
10335580	10337580	But if you're talking about a Link to the Past.
10337580	10339100	The Link to the Past, sorry.
10339100	10341160	That is, to be fair, that's the second best answer
10341160	10342480	you could give next to Super Metroid.
10342480	10343780	That's another game I cussed out a whole lot.
10343780	10345660	I did play a lot of Super Metroid,
10345660	10347860	but when I was little, I had no hope
10347860	10349700	of completing Super Metroid.
10349700	10350840	That's fair.
10350840	10353300	And to the chatters, yes, I am saying
10353300	10354940	those are better answers than Chrono Trigger.
10355060	10355900	Sorry about it.
10355900	10356900	Damn right.
10356900	10357740	Sorry, not sorry.
10357740	10360020	I didn't play Chrono Trigger until like
10360020	10362460	after I was already done with my N64.
10363680	10365120	I like this guy.
10365120	10367720	That was a game I didn't, I had no idea.
10367720	10369620	I had no idea about Chrono Trigger
10369620	10372240	until like I was so much older
10372240	10373580	than whenever I had been playing
10373580	10375780	like my Super Nintendo originally.
10375780	10376760	It was silly.
10377940	10378780	All right.
10380000	10380840	Bobby's in chat saying,
10380840	10383000	I'm gonna take down Rob's internet for reals.
10383360	10386400	Great, I'm gonna get a DLS attack
10386400	10387240	during the show.
10387240	10388720	Chrono Trigger is such a good game.
10388720	10390240	I'm not dissing Chrono Trigger.
10390240	10393400	I like to poke fun at you crazed foamy fanboys.
10393400	10396160	I never, never have purchased Chrono Trigger
10396160	10397660	because my friend left it at my house
10397660	10398940	and then he moved to another town
10398940	10400780	and then I moved out here with it.
10400780	10402920	Then I married her so it became community property
10402920	10406040	and now it's just as much fun as whoever she stole it from.
10406040	10408160	You ever come after it, I will kill you.
10408160	10409820	I have never played Chrono Trigger.
10409820	10412280	However, no prenup.
10412400	10414800	So we have 50% ownership of everything.
10414800	10418480	So that means I also have half the copy of Dracula X
10418480	10421240	and all of those boxed SNES games.
10421240	10423320	I usually need to play half of Dracula X.
10423320	10425580	She has that game with the fricking dish.
10426520	10427360	Yes, I do.
10427360	10429220	The Cardcaptor Sakura game.
10429220	10430060	I love that game.
10430060	10431160	I'm gonna play it.
10431160	10432000	All right.
10432000	10433440	Isn't there a Cardcaptor Sakura anime?
10433440	10434600	Quick, hang up.
10434600	10436480	All right now, Brozime quick,
10436480	10439000	any last thoughts before we let you go?
10439000	10440560	Thanks for reading my email
10440560	10442720	and talking about my channel, I guess.
10442720	10445360	I just started doing it like a while ago.
10445360	10446920	So anyone that wants to go check that out
10446920	10447960	can go check that out.
10447960	10449960	And it's fun, I guess.
10449960	10450800	I don't know.
10450800	10451620	I've been playing Nazgoth recently.
10451620	10452460	I just came out on Steam.
10452460	10453880	Wait, hold up a sign with your address on it.
10453880	10454860	It's not a video show.
10454860	10456360	We see the video, they don't.
10456360	10458200	So we'll have to put it out there.
10458200	10459760	Oh yeah, that's hilarious.
10459760	10461320	Dan, only one plug a show.
10461320	10464320	We used to have a video.
10464320	10465480	Yeah, back in the day we did.
10465480	10466320	That was awesome.
10466320	10467160	Yeah, it was all right.
10467160	10468360	Remember we played Street Fighter on it?
10468360	10469200	Yeah.
10469200	10470020	That's so cool.
10470620	10472660	All right, Brozime, are you still there, Brozime?
10472660	10474340	His video froze up.
10474340	10477020	Is Brozime, uh-oh, there's a problem with this call.
10477020	10479620	Or did our entire internet just crap out again?
10479620	10480460	Is that the problem?
10480460	10481560	It's Bobby gotcha.
10481560	10482500	Yeah, oh yeah.
10482500	10483700	Fucking Bobby.
10484780	10486060	All right, I think he came back,
10486060	10486900	but we were wrapping it up.
10486900	10488220	Sorry about that, don't know what happened.
10488220	10489140	I don't know what happened either.
10489140	10489980	I'll blame the internet.
10489980	10491660	All right, but Brozime, we are gonna let you go
10491660	10493460	so we can wrap up the show, but have a good night.
10493460	10494540	All right, sounds good, you guys too.
10494540	10495420	All right, later.
10496420	10500060	Ah, if it's not the frickin' feed sending
10500060	10503020	to the Shoutcast server, then it's Skype,
10503020	10504500	and if it's not that, then it's this.
10504500	10506580	All right, sorry to those that didn't get through,
10506580	10508500	because nobody called for five minutes,
10508500	10510060	and all of a sudden it was lighting up on fire,
10510060	10511420	so there's a few people that didn't get through.
10511420	10512820	Please consider sending us an email.
10512820	10515640	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
10515640	10517820	Give Dark Soccer some work to do.
10517820	10519180	Anyhow, that is about it.
10519180	10520220	We're gonna wrap up the show.
10520220	10521420	We were done with last minute stories.
10521420	10523180	We got the Twitter stuff.
10523180	10525260	So, actually, wait, no, we didn't finish the Twitter stuff,
10525940	10527940	because I had one other tweet I wanted to read here
10527940	10531180	from our old pal, Pika Uno had sent something to.
10531180	10533320	Oh yes, it was about the whole TV tax,
10533320	10535660	because last week we talked about TV tax overseas,
10535660	10539220	and Pika Uno does live in what I call London land,
10539220	10541620	and Pika Uno says, it's not the TV tax,
10541620	10544060	it's the license fee, and no, you'll still have
10544060	10546200	to pay the license fee to watch any live TV.
10546200	10548460	The important difference is that this is how the BBC
10548460	10550580	is funded, directly by the public,
10550580	10552460	not through the government.
10552460	10555020	So, a minor correction there too.
10555660	10557180	Probably some other Downton Abbey tangent
10557180	10558140	we went on last week.
10558140	10560540	All right, anyway, that is it.
10560540	10562640	We're gonna wrap up here at Orange Laundry Radio.
10562640	10564100	Hey, thanks you guys for listening to the show.
10564100	10565020	Really appreciate it.
10565020	10566980	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio
10566980	10568200	and you stuck with us the whole show,
10568200	10571060	why not tell a friend or two or 17 about our program
10571060	10571960	and help spread the word,
10571960	10574560	because you're all we got is word of mouth.
10574560	10577380	We don't have a major magazine backing us.
10577380	10579300	We don't have demo discs of OLR out there.
10579300	10581660	Actually, 1E3, we did have OLR demo discs,
10581660	10582500	now that I think about it.
10582500	10583540	I still have some.
10583540	10586460	I was gonna say, those will be collector's items someday,
10586460	10588380	Loki, when we're big and famous.
10588380	10591700	All right, anyway, that's about gonna do it,
10591700	10593580	but I wanna say, Dan, thank you for being here.
10593580	10596260	Always fun, even if you're kind of a dick sometimes.
10596260	10597100	No, I'm kidding.
10597100	10600480	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got me, you got me.
10600480	10603420	But I'm glad you could be here for the Sega Genesis
10603420	10604980	and Mega Drive look back episode.
10604980	10606860	It seems oddly appropriate.
10606860	10609420	Any last thoughts for our listeners tonight, Dan?
10609420	10610260	No.
10610260	10611540	And also, actually, this is also very important.
10611580	10613300	Do you have anything you wanna plug?
10613300	10615780	You have like a Twitter or a podcast of your own?
10615780	10616620	Everybody has podcasts these days.
10616620	10618740	You guys should listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
10618740	10621420	My wife is on it and her friends.
10621420	10623420	It's pretty amazing.
10623420	10625200	They do it all the time.
10625200	10628120	And I mean, it's a little pedantic sometimes,
10628120	10630500	but in general, it's worth listening to.
10630500	10631540	In general.
10631540	10632780	All right, thank you, Dan.
10632780	10633740	Come back any time.
10634620	10635860	Anyhow, but not Labor Day weekend,
10635860	10636940	because we will be here.
10636940	10637780	Neither will I.
10637780	10638600	All right.
10638600	10640020	Let's see, Darkstar.
10640020	10640860	You know what?
10640860	10642060	That's our anniversary weekend.
10642060	10643100	Oh, there you go.
10643100	10645180	The spouse and I will have been married for nine years.
10645180	10646700	You going to Disneyland or something?
10646700	10647540	No.
10647540	10648380	All right.
10648380	10649200	You can?
10649200	10650040	Yeah, you can.
10652780	10653620	That's funny.
10653620	10655260	Rob's paying for himself to go to Dragon Con.
10655260	10656900	Yeah, I'm going to Atlanta
10656900	10659180	to get some of the Sue's infamous gummy bears.
10659180	10660500	That's the only reason I go.
10660500	10661420	That's the only reason I go.
10661420	10663260	All right, Darkstar, I had to follow Dan here
10663260	10664780	with your final thought tonight.
10664780	10666700	Even though I was super full when we got here,
10666700	10669260	I'm super hungry now and really want a fish burrito.
10671020	10675020	I'm a good Mexican place like El Forstero.
10676420	10678940	My final thought is, now you mentioned that place,
10678940	10680300	now I'm craving tortilla chips.
10680300	10681600	Damn you.
10681600	10682440	Damn you.
10682440	10683260	All right.
10683260	10685200	And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.
10685200	10689380	My final thought tonight is I should play more games.
10689380	10690220	You should.
10690220	10691060	Word.
10691060	10691900	Because I haven't played any games.
10691900	10692740	How about everybody?
10692740	10693860	It's the OLR challenge.
10693860	10696640	Everybody play one new game this week.
10696640	10698140	Play something new.
10698140	10698980	Yeah.
10699260	10700980	Be jeweled, Jesus Christ.
10700980	10702700	Bonus points if it's indie.
10702700	10703540	All right.
10703540	10704860	That does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10704860	10706180	We will be back next week
10706180	10708420	before our little break for Labor Day.
10708420	10710280	So 565 next week.
10710280	10713300	We're inching closer and closer to episode 573.
10713300	10714140	You know, I gotta be honest.
10714140	10715740	I never thought we'd get that high,
10715740	10717740	but that is something that's gonna be happening in October,
10717740	10718580	believe it or not.
10718580	10719400	All right, that does it.
10719400	10720440	Have a great week, everybody.
10720440	10721820	We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio.
