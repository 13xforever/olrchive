00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Chills abound as the PT demo brought scares to those of the PS4 and to your favorite streaming sites to those without.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
And that was only a single reveal in another busy week of news following an overseas gaming convention.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
We have the full report as well as your calls, tweets, and emails on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live on this August the 17th of 2014 with the 564th episode of our show.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you here at the Voice of the Geek's Network, vognetwork.com

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
where we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
If you are listening live, join us and chat. Live.vognetwork.com

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
But meanwhile, we have our other hosts here in studio and it would be pretty boring if we didn't have an eclectic amount of voices here in studio.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
And we've got quite the panel tonight you guys, starting off with the one and only, the happiest bunny on the farm as I used to say years and years ago.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm a little shrieky today.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes, you're the scariest bunny on the farm today, or the most scared I guess.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Surprised, surprised. I was surprised.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Having my flesh eaten was surprising.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
So obviously you're talking about the PT demo, which we're going to talk about a little more in depth in just a moment here.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
But I have to introduce as well, Techmaster Loki.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Hi.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Hi Loki, how are you?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm fine.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Good deal. What did you bring to eat tonight? I heard you complaining as you walked in that you didn't get what you wanted.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
No, I wanted to go to gym boys, but the family didn't leave in time and they left.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
I normally would have left earlier, so I'd be able to get over there early enough.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
But they ended up leaving five minutes before I normally leave.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
And I had a list of chores I had to do before I left.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
You're how old and you have chores?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Clean your room!

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Well, I had to make a lunch for my son for school and then I had to bring in the laundry.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
And then, oh by the way, the car's out of gas.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
So I ended up stopping at Jack in the Box because it's attached to the gas station.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
But I wanted to get gym boys. That's where I was going to go.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm sorry.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I was going to bring you tacos.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm sorry you were robbed of tacos.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
For what it's worth, I had tacos on Friday because my friend Monet, she loves tacos, so we went over there and had tacos.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
And then she was performing in the Showgirls live.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Yes, the hideous movie from the 90s that's so bad it's good.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
They were doing a midnight screening and she was part one of the dancers.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Nasty fuck music.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
It was so funny though. I loved it. It was great.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Had a great time at the Trash Filmorgy as they call it in downtown Sacramento.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Sounds dirty, doesn't it? But we had a good time.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Is that like the Spike and Mike thing that they used to do?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
No, well, I mean Spike and Mike's another thing they do there.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
It's probably a very similar crowd, but Spike and Mike I think travels around.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Spike and Mike, I haven't been to that in a long time, but I don't know if they do it anymore.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
I went a few years in a row and it's like, wow, this is almost the same shit that was here last year.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah, I haven't heard it advertised in a while. I don't know if it's still a thing.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Maybe somebody in chat knows. I don't know.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
But we have more people in studio here to say hello to.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
And I want to introduce this guy first because he's what you'd call a fan favorite.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
He isn't on the show all the time, but when he's here it's always a lovely surprise.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
Say hello everybody to Jamie's husband. Dan is here tonight.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Sup?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Hey Dan, how you doing?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Good.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah. What's new? Gosh, you haven't been on the show in a while.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
You haven't been here since we moved to this place. I know that for sure.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Kind of was.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Did you? Well, yeah, you poked your head in for two seconds one episode.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
But were you ever at the old apartment that we had?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yes.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
One time?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Couple times.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
He was on the floor.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
It was lame. It scared me out of being on the show.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I know, right? But here isn't this much nicer? Sort of?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
It's all right. It's all right. How you been?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Good.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah? What games you been playing lately?

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
A lot of great Autosport. I played that Kingdom Hearts high def remake.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
And that game is still bad.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Wait, wait, wait. You don't like Kingdom Hearts?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
The camera is still bad.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
No, I don't like Kingdom Hearts.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
You know, that could get you beat up in some circles.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Oh, I'm so worried.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I liked Kingdom Hearts 2, what I played of it.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
That game was a lot more fun. It was basically a lot more streamlined.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I was hoping with this remake they had cleaned it up a little bit.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
And they did. It looks like a really good PS2 game.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And the thing about Kingdom Hearts 2? Tron.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Are you going to be picking up the HD remix in December, I think it is?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah, we already ordered it.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Gotcha.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
So, are you going to give in to Jamie's demands for a PlayStation 4?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Or what's happening on that front?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
PlayStation 4 is doable. Wii U is still kind of like, eh.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah, what's up with Wii U? What's your love-hate relationship with Wii U like?

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
It's a Nintendo system. There's about six games on it that look pretty decent.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
And it's like 300 bucks, which I think is too much for it.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
But, you know, a lot of people love it. It's got a couple cool things going on.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
What is the retro remix? The NES remix?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
The NES remix, yeah.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
That pretty much tries to sell me one.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Just, eh, there's just not much consoling me.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
You know, I'm not like, oh my god, the new systems look so great.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Now that I don't work at game stores, I don't feel compelled to go out there and be like,

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
okay, here's my $500 for this, and here's my $400 for that, and here's my $400 for this.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Let's be real, Danny. You used to get some of that shit for free.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I never got consoles for free.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh, really?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
No, it's the motherfuckers who work at those stores now get them for free.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Oh.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
I quit, and then like a year later, like, here's a PlayStation 4 and an Xbox 3 server.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Xbox, whatever the fuck it is now, won, and ten games for each! Yay!

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
And I was just like, I had to win my Xbox 360, which I did.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
By fucking some guys up in video game trivia.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Awesome.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It was unholy.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Awesome.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vodnetwork.com.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
We have many regulars in chat who remember Dan, who are saying hello.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Lots of greetings there.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
We have Bobby Blackwolf who says, Dan, coffee.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Coffee. Dan, coffee.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, Rob, where's my coffee?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
What's the, what's, go make it yourself.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
What's the-

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Get in the kitchen, wench.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
What's the most annoying food request that Dark Sakura has?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Coffee.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Coffee, alright.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Now, believe it or not, Dan, I know you've been-

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
I don't believe it.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
I know you've been following this show on and off for the 12 years we've been doing it, because, well, you kind of have to.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
No.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
But we actually have new listeners.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
You know, we get a few new ones every week, so some people don't know who you are.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Up to 15 steady listeners.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
That's right.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
One a year.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Love it or not.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
We started with three.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
On the air for a dozen years with dozens and dozens of fans.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Hundreds and hundreds of people who have listened at one time or the other.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
So, Dan, what would you say, what kind of gamer are you?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
What are your favorite video games?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
What do you like to play the most?

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
At this point in my life, I'm definitely a retro gamer.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I don't really play a lot of new stuff.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
When I do play a lot of new stuff, it's mostly racing.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
You know, I've got Grid Autosport.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I've got a set of Corsa.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I'll probably get Project Cars.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, I was going to say, what do you think about Project Cars?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Looks great.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Has a lot of possibility.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
I won't be getting it on a console, because new steering wheels are like $400 apiece.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I've already got a $600 steering wheel.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
That should work on PlayStation 4 if I go that way.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
But since I have a triple screen set up for my PC, fuck the PS4.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Well, looking in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
SSG100Matt says, Dan will get the system with the best racing games.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I was going to allude to Xbox One for Forza Horizon 2.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Well, Horizon sucks.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I love Horizon.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Okay, Horizon's fine.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
If you're into the more sort of like Project Othomy, Casual Racer.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I can't play the real shit.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh no, I'm with you.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I don't play the sim games as sims.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
You know, when I play Gran Turismo, I kind of dummy it down.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
But it's the amount of content.

08:24.000 --> 08:32.000
It's the, you know, 10 different racing disciplines and 12,000 cars and 600 tracks,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
and you can race through your neighborhood.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Horizon is a cool game, it's just not as good as Forza.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I love Forza 5 in theory.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It looks great.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I just don't own an Xbox One.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
And if it turned out that, oh yeah, you can use your T500RS on the Xbox One,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
they might have suckered me in.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
But no.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Now, here's the thing, Dan, and I don't know if this would change your mind on the Wii U,

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
but I know for me this is the thing I just, I don't know what has to be sacrificed to the devil to make this happen,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
but F-Zero Wii U, yes or no?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I wouldn't buy a system for it.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Really?

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
If I was going to buy a system for a Nintendo racing title, I probably would have bought it for Mario Kart.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
And if I had more of a steady local multiplayer community, I might have anyway.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Eh, it's Mario Kart.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
I played it. I liked it.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
It was fun.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
It has a lot of personality.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's Mario Kart.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
It's good.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
You can't go wrong.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
I'll play it on my GameCube or my Wii or my SNES or my Game Boy Brands or my DS.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
By the time the Wii U version of F-Zero ever comes out, you'd probably pick up one of those GX cabinets,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
or I'm sorry, the AX cabinets for a decent cost.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I don't know about that.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
No.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
They didn't make a lot of those.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
All six of them.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Alright, let's see.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Tiger Claw says, Dan has a $600 racing wheel.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
Has he tried playing those driving sims on the PC with it, like Euro Truck Simulator?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I have.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Have you?

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
I picked up Euro Truck Simulator on a Humble Bundle, and it's insanely bad.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
And actually, the Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is a vast improvement, was also on a Humble Bundle recently,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
and I didn't get it.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
But I should have, because the problem was, it was the bonus game.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
So it's like, donate this much or more.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And I'm like, fuck charity.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
They have, what is it, spinning tires is supposed to be pretty good too,

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
like if you're really into hill climbing and stuff like that, it's supposed to be really realistic.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Dan, I can't believe you'd say that about charity.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I had this bucket of ice water ready to go for you.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Woo.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Alright.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Dan will be commenting throughout the night, of course, as he tends to do, on whatever is going on in the news.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
But I also want to say hello to a familiar face here.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I'm sure many of you guys have heard this guy pop in week after week.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Say hello, everybody, to Shane.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Hello.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Hi, Shane, how are you?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm fine.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
You don't want me to finish your intro, huh?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Nope.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Alright, what's new with you?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
How have you been in the past couple weeks?

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
I just got a shiny, like, 30 minutes ago in Pokemon, so I'm pretty pumped up.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Pokemon's still not old for you.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
It never will be.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Why not?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Because it's Pokemon.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
It's like, are you going to get tired of breathing air?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
He hasn't caught them all.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
No, I have, actually.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I do have them all.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I don't have them all shiny.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
He hasn't caught them all shiny.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I do not have them all shiny.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Is that your mission?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
No.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.400
I only want the ones I like shiny, and then every other shiny I get's just, I guess a

11:19.400 --> 11:23.000
bonus unless it's a crappy one, then it's, like, not as good a bonus.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Trading fodder?

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
No, I'll still keep it, because it's shiny.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.540
Um, are you looking forward to the new, I don't know, the new old Pokemon games that

11:32.540 --> 11:33.540
are coming out?

11:33.540 --> 11:38.540
I wasn't, and then they started releasing more stuff, like new mega evolutions or whatever,

11:38.540 --> 11:39.540
and it got me excited.

11:39.540 --> 11:46.780
So yes, I'm already, like, I'm ready to go with a Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

11:46.780 --> 11:52.340
In our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, act-dev says, Shane, if you find a shiny Hawlucha,

11:52.340 --> 11:53.340
let me know.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.340
Did I say that right?

11:54.340 --> 11:57.820
Yes, you did, and I'm actually in that area right now looking for a different shiny, so

11:57.820 --> 12:02.100
I'll let you know, and then I will keep it.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.100
You'll just rub it in.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.100
You'll be like, I got one.

12:04.100 --> 12:08.660
Well, not to rub it in, but, like, if I got two shinies, then yeah, I could trade one.

12:09.060 --> 12:14.260
I just got a shiny Bunnelby, which is adorable, and doesn't look like he's been playing in

12:14.260 --> 12:15.260
poop.

12:15.260 --> 12:20.260
And SSG100ManChat says, every other shiny Shane doesn't want becomes a coat.

12:20.260 --> 12:22.740
How many Osh-Watts have you bred trying to get a shiny one?

12:22.740 --> 12:24.260
I am nearing 1,000.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.620
Oh my gosh.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.460
So you've made Osh-Watt coats for all the poor kids in the neighborhood?

12:29.460 --> 12:35.660
Well, the rich kids first, and then the ones that aren't quite as well made go to the poor

12:35.660 --> 12:36.660
kids.

12:36.660 --> 12:37.660
All right, fair enough.

12:37.660 --> 12:40.460
I think all the kids in Pokemon are in the same income bracket.

12:40.460 --> 12:44.660
They can all afford just to wander the countryside waiting to fight each other.

12:44.660 --> 12:49.660
All right, now Shane is here in studio because I know he's dying to, because he's not going

12:49.660 --> 12:50.660
to stay for the whole show.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.660
No, no.

12:51.660 --> 12:55.100
But I know he's dying to talk about our kickoff topic tonight, and the kickoff topic I want

12:55.100 --> 12:59.340
to talk about tonight before we get into our gaming weeks is a interactive demo that was

12:59.340 --> 13:06.340
released a little bit stealthily on the PlayStation 4 marketplace this week, but as people figured

13:06.340 --> 13:10.980
out what it really was, this game gained more and more steam, and I'm talking about

13:10.980 --> 13:12.980
a lot, a lot, a lot of steam.

13:12.980 --> 13:19.700
And I don't know about you guys, but I have friends, especially the extended OLR family,

13:19.700 --> 13:23.660
people like Shane, maybe not the host directly on this show, but people like Shane, people

13:23.660 --> 13:29.520
like Extrovert over on Hoard House, people like our number one fan Flaco Jones, all those

13:29.520 --> 13:32.860
folks have been obsessed with PT.

13:32.860 --> 13:34.100
Would that be a fair statement, Shane?

13:34.100 --> 13:35.100
You're obsessed with PT.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.860
I was texting about PT, but yes.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.780
Who were you texting just now about PT?

13:40.780 --> 13:41.780
Christopher.

13:41.780 --> 13:47.620
So, okay, so PT, and this is a slight spoiler, but honestly, if you guys have followed video

13:47.620 --> 13:50.940
game news, I don't see how you guys have avoided this news at this point, but I apologize if

13:50.940 --> 13:52.380
I'm ruining anything for you.

13:52.380 --> 13:56.420
PT is a interactive demo for the new Silent Hill game in disguise.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.420
What?

13:57.420 --> 13:58.420
I know, right?

13:58.420 --> 14:00.980
You didn't just see the trailer 30 minutes ago in the other room.

14:00.980 --> 14:02.300
I read about it online.

14:02.460 --> 14:09.140
They're calling Silent Hills, which is being presented by Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro,

14:09.140 --> 14:12.860
and Norman Reedus, who a lot of people know from The Walking Dead, he's going to be the

14:12.860 --> 14:20.180
face model of the guy who Dan said should be just playing Solid Snake.

14:20.180 --> 14:23.420
When they show him in the game and he kind of turns his head, I was like, you know, he

14:23.420 --> 14:26.900
could play a live action Solid Snake fairly convincingly.

14:26.900 --> 14:31.100
What if it was Solid Snake that turned his head at the very end?

14:31.100 --> 14:33.900
That would be terrible.

14:33.900 --> 14:34.900
Silent Hill.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.060
Silent Hill, the S stands for snake.

14:40.060 --> 14:41.060
You never know.

14:41.060 --> 14:42.060
Okay.

14:42.060 --> 14:43.580
So Shane, what is it about that?

14:43.580 --> 14:48.540
Because seriously, I'm seeing on Twitter people like Xtavor and other people, I think Captain

14:48.540 --> 14:51.340
Spike from Gamebooyah.org has been talking favorably about this too, and some other people

14:51.340 --> 14:56.060
I follow on Twitter, some are calling it the game of the year, which is a weird thing to

14:56.060 --> 14:59.140
see because it's like a free demo.

14:59.140 --> 15:01.700
But on the other hand, I also kind of get it.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.280
I'm in that camp.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.620
Right now it's my game of the year.

15:04.620 --> 15:11.140
It has surpassed the entirety of Infamous Second Son and is now right now my game of

15:11.140 --> 15:12.140
the year.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.860
So why?

15:13.860 --> 15:21.700
Because I think just the way they, it's everything about the way they introduced it, the feelings

15:21.700 --> 15:24.100
it evoked while I was playing it.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.620
I was legitimately scared the first time I was playing it.

15:26.620 --> 15:32.220
And even when we were just playing it 30 minutes ago, I was still like kind of on my, on the

15:32.220 --> 15:37.020
edge of my seat, even though I knew what was coming, except some things that happened were

15:37.020 --> 15:38.660
not things I realized that were going to happen.

15:38.660 --> 15:39.660
There was a surprise.

15:39.660 --> 15:40.660
Yeah.

15:40.660 --> 15:41.660
Yeah.

15:41.660 --> 15:42.660
We had some surprises.

15:42.660 --> 15:43.660
And that's the thing.

15:43.660 --> 15:45.500
Nobody has figured out the pattern to the game.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.700
I personally haven't even beaten it yet.

15:47.700 --> 15:52.060
So like, you can't, you have to do a series of events at the end too.

15:52.060 --> 15:54.900
I don't want to get too much into the weeds on that for people who haven't experienced

15:54.900 --> 15:59.180
yet, but you have to get a certain, there are triggers, let's say on fifth dream already

15:59.180 --> 16:03.620
spoiled it for everyone in the chat room, fifth dream, spank, spank, spank, spank.

16:03.620 --> 16:04.620
It's online.

16:04.620 --> 16:05.620
Yeah.

16:05.620 --> 16:06.620
He's not accurate.

16:06.620 --> 16:07.620
If you really want to know it's out there.

16:07.620 --> 16:08.620
Well, so that's the thing.

16:08.620 --> 16:09.620
Yeah.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.620
Nobody's definitively solved it.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.620
Even though we might've had that posted.

16:11.620 --> 16:17.500
There are, there are three things in on the very last part of the game that have to happen.

16:17.500 --> 16:21.100
The first one, everybody knows how to get that to happen.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.100
That's easy.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.620
We, we, we've all figured that out.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.580
It's 100% confirmed proven.

16:26.580 --> 16:29.340
The second one, no clue.

16:29.340 --> 16:31.120
The second one can lead into the third one.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.740
If it does, then we know how to beat it, but you have to get that second thing to happen.

16:34.740 --> 16:39.100
And if you can't get it to happen the right way, then you're just stuck.

16:39.100 --> 16:42.420
I still have no idea how I remotely did it.

16:42.420 --> 16:43.420
So yeah.

16:43.420 --> 16:46.780
Uh, dark soccer, you experienced this demo for the first time just earlier this evening.

16:47.660 --> 16:51.700
And you are the first person in this household to beat it.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.220
So which we don't know by accident.

16:54.220 --> 17:00.060
She stood on Shane's shoulders, Shane did all the first parts of it.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.060
Shane beat the demo.

17:01.060 --> 17:04.820
Jamie was holding the controller and then he's like, I don't want to play this part

17:04.820 --> 17:05.820
anymore here.

17:05.820 --> 17:06.820
I'm like, okay.

17:06.820 --> 17:08.580
So what did you think?

17:08.580 --> 17:14.340
I think that I'm going to punch eyeless bitch in the face next time.

17:14.340 --> 17:17.140
You know what's interesting about it?

17:17.140 --> 17:20.440
It doesn't prompt you at all.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.620
It doesn't tell you how to do anything.

17:21.620 --> 17:23.220
It doesn't say press X to do this.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.700
It doesn't say press up or down.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.420
It kind of says press X to do this at one point.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.420
I don't know.

17:29.420 --> 17:30.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:30.420 --> 17:37.420
It lets you dive in and wander around and discover things in a finite world.

17:37.420 --> 17:39.620
Finding the picture piece scared me the first time.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.420
That was the first thing that scared me.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.940
That scared the piss out of her.

17:42.940 --> 17:44.180
She peed a little bit.

17:45.020 --> 17:48.020
Are you in my pants right now?

17:48.020 --> 17:50.740
And if so, why?

17:50.740 --> 17:55.500
Well since I'm not wearing any, I'll leave you two to be a little later.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.500
I'm not wearing pants, Rob.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.500
Yeah, I can see that.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
No pants.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.500
I'm wearing a skirt.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.500
I know.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.500
Okay.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.900
So this demo comes out and after about six hours, even less, people have figured out

18:03.900 --> 18:04.900
what it is.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.740
And Shane texts me, calls me and is like, Rob, you have to do live stream.

18:07.740 --> 18:08.740
Rob, you have to do live stream.

18:08.740 --> 18:09.740
Rob, what are you going to live stream?

18:09.740 --> 18:10.740
Rob, what time are you coming out?

18:10.740 --> 18:11.980
Cause you're going to freak out.

18:11.980 --> 18:13.280
So everybody wants to see that.

18:13.280 --> 18:17.440
So sure enough, I go on Twitch and I do a live stream and yes, there were parts of the

18:17.440 --> 18:22.160
demo that scared the crap out of me, but then we weren't able to beat it.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.280
Like we could, and I was on a timer cause we had a whorehouse, huh?

18:25.280 --> 18:26.280
We didn't beat it.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.280
No.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.280
Oh, you said we weren't able.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.280
We weren't able to beat it.

18:29.280 --> 18:33.400
There's also seeing her in the bathroom and I actually was going to laugh.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.840
I wanted to laugh my ass off when the baby started talking.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.320
Yeah, that's a pretty funny part.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.320
Let's see.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.400
We're going to live.vognetwork.com.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.280
Lots of comments on this in our chat room.

18:44.280 --> 18:48.280
Act Def says Guillermo del Toro participating in this project has me sold on it.

18:48.280 --> 18:53.120
You know, very interesting how much hype this, I mean, this is getting a lot of hype.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.680
I have not seen this much hype for a demo in a long time.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.440
It took over all the news at Gamescom.

18:58.440 --> 19:01.800
Once this came out, nobody cared anymore about Gamescom, I think.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.800
Well behold that thought cause we will cover the Gamescom news later.

19:03.800 --> 19:04.800
Well, I'm not going to be here first.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.800
I'll talk about it if I want.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.440
I'll be at Taco Bell.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.960
But well, but here's the thing.

19:08.960 --> 19:13.240
It's interesting too, because you have Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro, Norman Reedus,

19:13.240 --> 19:15.160
which you know, that, that excites a lot of people.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.240
And something I need to sacrifice to get a Kiriyamaoka back.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.280
And that's, that's the thing.

19:19.280 --> 19:22.560
It's making people kind of forget that who's not involved.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.560
No it's not.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.560
Where do you see that?

19:24.560 --> 19:29.300
I see people just praying to everything they can pray to that he's going to show up.

19:29.300 --> 19:34.620
And if he doesn't, whoever did the sound for the demo, I have to give a lot of credit to

19:34.620 --> 19:42.900
because it sounded like a Silent Hill game that was not downpour.

19:42.900 --> 19:46.740
But I see, it seems like the excitement for this is, is higher than any game in the Silent

19:46.740 --> 19:48.100
Hill series is like four.

19:48.100 --> 19:52.220
So it's like the first game probably where Yamoka is not involved, that people are excited

19:52.220 --> 19:53.220
for.

19:53.220 --> 19:54.220
Yeah, I can agree.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.220
Yeah.

19:55.220 --> 19:58.620
We're still sacrificing things to get him to show up somehow.

19:58.620 --> 19:59.620
Let's see.

19:59.620 --> 20:02.140
Tigerclaw says, I'd be surprised if the game of the year goes to a horror game.

20:02.140 --> 20:03.940
When was the last time that happened?

20:03.940 --> 20:04.940
The Walking Dead?

20:04.940 --> 20:05.940
Yeah.

20:05.940 --> 20:06.940
Well, I don't know.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.780
The Walking, I don't know if you'd count that horror though.

20:08.780 --> 20:09.780
Some would say this is more adventure.

20:09.780 --> 20:10.780
And it's The Last of Us.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.020
Oh, The Last of Us?

20:12.020 --> 20:13.020
Kind of a horror game?

20:13.020 --> 20:14.020
Oh, you probably heard it.

20:14.020 --> 20:15.020
That's right.

20:15.020 --> 20:18.020
Um, I was going to say, we don't need the full game to get game of the year.

20:18.020 --> 20:20.260
This demo is going to get game of the year.

20:20.260 --> 20:25.940
So I'm just glad that Konami has something that they're actually releasing other than

20:25.940 --> 20:31.340
Metal Gear Solid because it seriously, they have that in Pro Evo, I'm like, man, they're

20:31.340 --> 20:35.300
going to go out of business if they don't have any good, you know, I mean, yeah, Metal

20:35.300 --> 20:39.260
Gear is going to do well for them, but it was literally the only thing on their slate.

20:39.260 --> 20:45.420
It's like, okay, Metal Gear and Pro Evo happened to Konami.

20:45.420 --> 20:50.700
They're all, um, I know they do a lot of workout equipment and gym stuff and gambling stuff

20:50.700 --> 20:51.700
in Japan.

20:51.700 --> 20:56.500
If they release, you know, this, if they release Metal Gear in the first part of the year and

20:56.500 --> 20:59.580
you know, this at the end, I mean, that's a pretty good year for Konami.

21:00.100 --> 21:04.140
So, um, SGA 100 Matt says it's probably the most brilliant way to promote or announce

21:04.140 --> 21:05.140
a game.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.180
Fifth Dream says it's not even a game.

21:07.180 --> 21:11.260
It's a demo at best, but it's effing scary in a way that impresses me.

21:11.260 --> 21:15.740
So, uh, Tiger Claw says maybe demo of the year if there is such a category.

21:15.740 --> 21:19.980
Um, Bobby Black Wolf reemphasizing Konami does a lot of business in the gambling sector.

21:19.980 --> 21:20.980
They're doing fine.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.620
Um, let's see.

21:22.620 --> 21:24.580
Oh, how is it not a game?

21:24.580 --> 21:25.620
I want to know that.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.700
What makes it not a game?

21:27.700 --> 21:30.500
I don't know if I agree with that comment, but everybody gets a voice.

21:30.500 --> 21:34.980
So I wanted to say, say that the wrong, well, maybe we'll get more thoughts on that.

21:34.980 --> 21:35.980
It's a game.

21:35.980 --> 21:38.180
It's a very short game.

21:38.180 --> 21:42.780
And I would also say, yeah, it's a short game, but as they pointed out at the end, it has

21:42.780 --> 21:44.340
nothing to do with the main title.

21:44.340 --> 21:47.780
So this whole story that's going on is self-contained.

21:47.780 --> 21:52.060
And I mean, there's resolution enough as much as you've ever took that hallway and made

21:52.060 --> 21:53.580
it a hundred levels long.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.780
So would that be a game?

21:55.780 --> 21:56.780
Yeah.

21:56.780 --> 21:59.940
If it's something different happening every time.

21:59.940 --> 22:02.260
How many of, how many of us have played the red room?

22:02.260 --> 22:09.220
I mean, don't shit your pants as a game and that's just one screen, maybe two.

22:09.220 --> 22:10.220
You played, what was it?

22:10.220 --> 22:11.220
The, what was it?

22:11.220 --> 22:12.220
The Crimson room.

22:12.220 --> 22:13.220
Wasn't that what it was?

22:13.220 --> 22:15.500
It's just a little flash game where you're stuck in a room.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.500
Well, it could have been, you know, a follow up to, you know, silent Hill four of the room.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.620
I mean, it's kind of a room, few rooms in a hallway.

22:22.620 --> 22:26.740
This is silent Hill, the hallway, um, silent Hill five.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.140
Just a couple other comments I want to get out here.

22:29.140 --> 22:35.020
Kaijuto in chat says, uh, I haven't seen this much hype for a demo since destiny.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.700
Maybe sort of a hinting there that maybe it hasn't been that long since we've had a huge

22:38.700 --> 22:39.700
look at ground zeros.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.340
That was a pretty well.

22:41.340 --> 22:44.460
And then I thought this was a nice kind of comment here to end on here.

22:44.460 --> 22:50.220
Act F says, you know, ground zeros should have been what PT was.

22:50.220 --> 22:51.580
Very interesting comment.

22:51.580 --> 22:56.660
Could they have released PT as a commercial game the way they did ground zeros or

22:56.700 --> 23:00.900
if it was that short, no, I would have felt quite ripped off or would rage.

23:00.900 --> 23:02.820
They would rage.

23:02.820 --> 23:03.940
Maybe if it was like a dollar.

23:03.940 --> 23:04.940
Yeah.

23:04.940 --> 23:08.540
Or if like, what's the minimum price, five, $10 these days, maybe add a little more to

23:08.540 --> 23:12.460
it, but for free, it's a great value for sure.

23:12.460 --> 23:18.060
Can't you beat ground zeros, uh, in just a few minutes, I think they said, can you, I

23:18.060 --> 23:19.060
don't know.

23:19.060 --> 23:20.060
I thought it was a couple hours.

23:20.060 --> 23:24.580
Well, and then I was going to say the first day that PT was out and me and Flacco Jones

23:24.580 --> 23:29.140
and his wife were playing it, we played it for five hours trying to beat it.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.520
And we had, I mean, that was when we didn't look at any spoilers or anything.

23:32.520 --> 23:33.740
So we were going through it.

23:33.740 --> 23:35.180
So we spent five hours on a game.

23:35.180 --> 23:38.060
We didn't our demo, whatever you want to call it that we didn't beat.

23:38.060 --> 23:41.220
And I know ground zeros like does not take that long.

23:41.220 --> 23:46.420
So why should that be 30 and then PT only be a dollar when we had more, more time spent

23:46.420 --> 23:47.420
on it.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.420
Interesting.

23:48.420 --> 23:51.700
Well, I think the fact that they sold ground zeros anyways is just kind of lame.

23:51.700 --> 23:54.140
The fact that it was 30 bucks was also very lame.

23:54.140 --> 23:57.020
So I'm kind of glad they didn't go that route.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.020
Yeah.

23:58.020 --> 24:03.660
I'm I, I kind of wonder if maybe Konami should just release ground zeros for free and if

24:03.660 --> 24:06.380
that would have gotten as much hype as PT had, I don't know.

24:06.380 --> 24:07.380
Yeah.

24:07.380 --> 24:08.380
So Konami must have been awesome.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.600
Konami must be a screwed around with some different ideas there.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.600
But anyway, I do want to move into how was your gaming week, but just quickly, some kind

24:14.600 --> 24:18.180
of final thoughts on a PT Loki, you haven't really played it yet, huh?

24:18.180 --> 24:19.180
I just watched the video.

24:19.180 --> 24:21.460
What'd you think of the whole thing and kind of how it was done there?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.460
I don't know.

24:22.460 --> 24:25.380
All I saw in the video was just the end.

24:25.380 --> 24:28.720
So it looks neat.

24:28.720 --> 24:32.940
I am, I gotta say for me personally, I'm really excited for the next silent Hill game and

24:32.940 --> 24:37.520
I kind of, I've loved the silent Hill series, but I've always just kind of been, Oh yeah,

24:37.520 --> 24:38.520
that game.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.520
Oh yeah.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.780
And I haven't kind of been detached from it for the past few games.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.540
So this is a really good way to like attention.

24:44.540 --> 24:45.540
Get back over here.

24:45.540 --> 24:47.540
You're a fan of silent Hill.

24:47.540 --> 24:51.500
I'm curious to see what the trailers are going to be like, because you know, Kojima, he likes

24:51.540 --> 24:55.420
doing his like vignettes for the fucking trailers.

24:55.420 --> 24:56.420
Yeah.

24:56.420 --> 25:01.380
I'm hoping this will be a big E3 presence next year, but who knows?

25:01.380 --> 25:04.300
Dan, quick thoughts on the final thoughts on that.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.300
It was awesome.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.300
You know, I'd only read about it.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.300
So today was the first time I saw it.

25:08.300 --> 25:09.420
Really, really.

25:09.420 --> 25:12.900
I mean, I could see that being a whole game.

25:12.900 --> 25:16.700
You know, where you walk around an area, you have to do different things.

25:16.700 --> 25:20.580
I mean, there was a lot of, there are a lot of things you could look at that demo.

25:20.580 --> 25:23.780
There were a lot of touches that you're not going to catch your first, your second, your

25:23.780 --> 25:24.780
10th time through.

25:24.780 --> 25:29.540
Um, and like I was saying, if that thing was, if that hallway had a hundred repetitions,

25:29.540 --> 25:33.420
but you managed to work enough different content into it, I think it'd be awesome.

25:33.420 --> 25:38.100
I don't have as much confidence that the next silent Hill game will be like that.

25:38.100 --> 25:46.220
Uh, cause that would be a radical departure, but I think that the PT was, it was pretty

25:46.220 --> 25:47.220
good.

25:47.220 --> 25:50.380
What was interesting is that even though, yes, it would be a radical departure, you

25:50.380 --> 25:54.020
know, a lot of people have been noticing that it probably that demos in particular

25:54.020 --> 25:58.420
has more in common with silent Hill, the room than anything else, which is weird because

25:58.420 --> 26:01.620
the room was sort of that disconnected silent Hill game.

26:01.620 --> 26:07.020
But you know, like I really, I still really like disconnected game that God slapped into

26:07.020 --> 26:08.020
it.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.020
Yeah, it was.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.020
I'm just worried.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.020
This is going to try.

26:11.020 --> 26:14.480
They're trying to pull like a Bioshock infinite with this where it's just like, Oh, it's infinite

26:14.480 --> 26:16.900
universes and then we're going to tie them all together.

26:16.900 --> 26:19.020
It's like, okay, I don't know.

26:19.020 --> 26:21.900
Uh, Jamie, last thoughts on the teaser.

26:21.900 --> 26:26.460
Uh, it just, it made me shriek.

26:26.460 --> 26:31.540
So not like loudly, not like, you know, yeah, it wasn't enough where I could hear it over

26:31.540 --> 26:32.540
here.

26:32.540 --> 26:33.540
I didn't see it.

26:33.540 --> 26:34.540
It was loud.

26:34.540 --> 26:35.540
It was just high pitched.

26:35.540 --> 26:40.740
I know even though bringing him back is going to be very like kind of cliche and doesn't

26:40.740 --> 26:42.020
really fit in the story.

26:42.020 --> 26:49.260
I do fully anticipate and hope that they bring back a full HD pyramid head for, uh,

26:49.260 --> 26:52.820
some people like Shane's over there going, no, no, no, I don't want that.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.820
So people really don't want that.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.140
It'd just be out of character with what they just showed.

26:56.140 --> 27:01.340
Like a realistic, they've already said that they want this game to be truly horrifying.

27:01.340 --> 27:06.520
Uh, even to the point where the product is not commercially viable, this would be a really

27:06.520 --> 27:07.520
cool sort of thing.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.740
Now, if they do what I think they're going to do, I will have pyramid head and zombie

27:10.740 --> 27:15.900
nurses and I think it's going to have all this stuff from like all the other games kind

27:15.900 --> 27:16.900
of thrown in there.

27:16.900 --> 27:20.700
Maybe like it's going to cross universes and so you can get stuff from silent Hill two

27:20.700 --> 27:25.700
and with Kojima at the home now, I'm not so sure he might want to just, he might be eager

27:25.700 --> 27:29.300
to put his own nurses will have time.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.280
All right.

27:31.280 --> 27:35.900
And last but not least, uh, Shane, the big, the big fan boy in the room for this, uh,

27:35.900 --> 27:37.140
what are your thoughts closing out here?

27:37.140 --> 27:39.320
I think it's amazing.

27:39.320 --> 27:45.040
And right now I'm saying Dragon Age Inquisition is either going to tie it or probably not

27:45.040 --> 27:47.640
beat it for my game of the year.

27:47.640 --> 27:48.640
That's silly.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.640
Demo is my game of the year.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.640
All right.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.440
Well, but of course you never know what else might stealthily release between now and the

27:53.440 --> 27:54.440
end of the year.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.920
No, it's going to be Dragon Age or this.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.920
All right.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.440
Well, we'll check in with you at the end of the year.

27:59.440 --> 28:00.440
All right.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.440
Okay.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.440
Whatever.

28:02.440 --> 28:03.440
All right.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.200
Uh, anyhow, we're going to move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video

28:05.200 --> 28:07.400
games that we've been playing this week.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.400
Uh, Dark Sakura, ladies first.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.960
What have you been playing this week besides PTU?

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
We've all been playing that.

28:12.960 --> 28:13.960
Other stuff.

28:13.960 --> 28:14.960
Bejeweled.

28:14.960 --> 28:15.960
A lot of Bejeweled on my phone.

28:15.960 --> 28:20.520
I've been playing some, uh, Best Move, AKA Puzzle Bobble.

28:20.520 --> 28:23.360
I played some Battle Fantasy 14.

28:23.360 --> 28:28.600
Um, Dan, why are you looking like that?

28:28.600 --> 28:36.160
Um, we were, I was, uh, strategy guiding Dan through Kingdom Hearts 1.5 remix.

28:36.160 --> 28:41.240
Uh, and, uh, really that's about it.

28:41.240 --> 28:46.920
I've had a lot going on, so stuff that still seems like a pretty action packed week.

28:46.920 --> 28:51.200
I saw you on Twitter posting pictures of Kingdom, Kingdom Hearts, playthroughs on, if you saw

28:51.200 --> 28:52.200
that I responded.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.200
Not yet.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.200
I keep forgetting.

28:54.200 --> 28:59.960
I'm trying to make Twitter more of a thing and Facebook less of a thing because, uh,

28:59.960 --> 29:00.960
fuck.

29:00.960 --> 29:01.960
So.

29:01.960 --> 29:02.960
I hear you.

29:02.960 --> 29:03.960
I hear you.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.520
Uh, let's go to our guests, Dan.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.520
How was your gaming week?

29:06.520 --> 29:08.240
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

29:08.240 --> 29:10.240
Uh, what did I do?

29:10.240 --> 29:12.920
I played some, uh, I played some Grid today.

29:12.920 --> 29:13.920
Had a lot of fun.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.000
Basically, Friday night, I don't even know what happened.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.480
I got home on, or was it Saturday?

29:18.480 --> 29:19.480
When did you go to that game?

29:19.480 --> 29:20.920
It was Friday when we went to go see Showgirls.

29:20.920 --> 29:21.920
Okay.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.360
She was going to be out and I was like, man, I want to do some retro gaming.

29:24.360 --> 29:30.640
So I drug out the Genesis and I played a game each of the Revenge of Shinobi, Shadow Dancer,

29:30.640 --> 29:32.320
and Shinobi 3.

29:32.320 --> 29:36.160
And I know that my skills are quite diminished because I got to the second to last level,

29:36.160 --> 29:38.920
the second to last level, and the last level.

29:38.920 --> 29:43.480
One game, just not even like no continues, no spamming extra lives.

29:43.480 --> 29:48.040
Well, I did spam extra lives a little bit in Revenge of Shinobi, but, uh, I played some

29:48.040 --> 29:49.400
Zelda on Saturday.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.720
We played pretty much the first six Labyrinths, uh, in just a quick run through because we

29:53.720 --> 29:55.960
were showing it to my friends' kids.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.360
And today I played some Grid.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.000
Besides that, not a lot of gaming.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.400
All right.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.160
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

30:04.160 --> 30:10.040
Um, I really only played a couple games and it was actually funny, but not both of them

30:10.040 --> 30:12.960
were kind of Kickstarter related, I guess.

30:12.960 --> 30:19.120
I played more of Vanguard V, um, and I still like that demo, sadly, that there is no way

30:19.120 --> 30:21.320
that Kickstarter is going to make its money.

30:21.320 --> 30:27.680
Um, and then I played kind of along the lines with Vanguard V, um, the guy Maximilien Moreau

30:27.680 --> 30:30.880
who's actually doing, he does the Cooking with Unity show.

30:30.880 --> 30:37.920
They've been running this kind of, uh, series for, I think the last week or two called From

30:37.920 --> 30:39.520
Scratch to Publish.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.200
And they actually start from scratch and they made a game that's pretty simple and they

30:43.200 --> 30:45.680
publish it on pretty much every platform that they could.

30:45.680 --> 30:55.800
Um, you know, iOS, uh, Windows, Windows Phone, uh, Android, and, um, even PlayStation Mobile.

30:55.800 --> 31:00.880
And so I downloaded the Android version, um, for 99 cents.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.440
And so I've been playing their game, uh, Grid Cruiser, which actually it's kind of, um,

31:04.440 --> 31:07.800
inspiring because, uh, one, I do get done with my long project.

31:07.800 --> 31:12.160
I do kind of want to do something along the lines of that, where it's a lot of short projects

31:12.160 --> 31:17.680
that you can get done in like a week or two just to have some stuff to bring in some revenue.

31:17.680 --> 31:24.300
So, um, but yeah, it definitely goes support Vanguard V. I mean, although it's probably

31:24.300 --> 31:29.140
too late at this point, but hopefully they will decide to relaunch the Kickstarter.

31:29.140 --> 31:31.900
I have some other way to do funding later on.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.300
All right.

31:33.300 --> 31:37.540
Uh, before we get into my gaming week, I'm actually going to do something here real quick.

31:37.540 --> 31:41.860
Uh, we're actually going to, we're having a lot of problems live, uh, for our live listeners

31:41.860 --> 31:43.640
over a live.vognetware.com.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.240
Our internet keeps going up and down.

31:45.240 --> 31:48.060
I'm not sure what's up with that, but I think what we're going to do, or I'm going to do

31:48.060 --> 31:51.820
an intentional drop here and we're going to cycle our internet in an attempt to try and

31:51.820 --> 31:53.940
keep it up here, uh, for the remainder of the show.

31:53.940 --> 31:54.940
So I apologize guys.

31:54.940 --> 31:57.300
Thanks for sticking with us live for sure.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.780
Um, these things happen.

31:58.780 --> 32:01.860
Unfortunately, I don't know what's causing our internet to suck tonight.

32:01.860 --> 32:06.400
It's been pretty good the past couple of months, but, uh, I am going to do an intentional drop

32:06.400 --> 32:07.400
here.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.820
Um, but we will be back in just a couple minutes.

32:08.820 --> 32:09.820
I appreciate those.

32:09.820 --> 32:13.060
You guys that are sticking with us, uh, here at vognetware.com.

32:13.060 --> 32:18.560
We'll be right back to register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio

32:18.560 --> 32:19.940
at vognetware.com.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.660
Use the passphrase party.

32:21.660 --> 32:22.660
Okay.

32:22.660 --> 32:23.660
Let's try this again.

32:23.660 --> 32:25.340
The internet cooperates with us.

32:25.340 --> 32:28.340
Uh, of course those listening on the podcast are like, what's going on?

32:28.340 --> 32:29.340
Everything's fine to me.

32:29.340 --> 32:32.580
Uh, but yeah, we're having some, fortunately some, uh, difficulties sending our signal

32:32.580 --> 32:35.880
out to the server that rebroadcast everything live.

32:35.880 --> 32:39.380
So we just did a little power cycle here in studio on the router and all that good stuff

32:39.380 --> 32:42.060
to hopefully give us some decent uptime tonight.

32:42.060 --> 32:46.100
But, uh, you know, uh, despite all the live problems that sometimes occur, although it's

32:46.100 --> 32:50.880
been pretty good the past couple of weeks, uh, or months, even, um, we, uh, do always

32:50.880 --> 32:54.540
have the show complete and we do try to tape things for our podcast feed, which of course

32:54.540 --> 32:59.220
you can check out orange lunch radio.com available in the iTunes store, stitcher radio, all that

32:59.220 --> 33:00.220
good stuff.

33:00.220 --> 33:01.220
All right.

33:01.220 --> 33:03.480
When we left off, I was about ready to get into my gaming week, which, um, I don't have

33:03.480 --> 33:08.080
a whole lot of exciting stuff to report because we talked about PT, which was the big bulk

33:08.080 --> 33:11.560
of it, but I have also been playing Final Fantasy 14 here and there, which, uh, you

33:11.560 --> 33:14.960
know, you know, you know, I love my MMO, so I'm playing that, um, another MMO I've been

33:14.960 --> 33:19.360
playing an awful lot of, which I think I talked about last week, but, uh, never winner was

33:19.360 --> 33:20.360
one I've been spending time with.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.960
I don't, I think I got into it on a whorehouse, but not OLR.

33:22.960 --> 33:27.760
So, um, I've been playing a free to play MMO called never winner that's available out there.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.800
And, um, I like what I've been experiencing so far.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.280
Um, even though it is free to play, I haven't really felt nickeled and dime now, granted

33:34.280 --> 33:36.800
I'm only about what, 10 levels into it.

33:36.800 --> 33:40.200
So I haven't really experienced the whole thing, but, uh, I like it because it's kind

33:40.200 --> 33:45.440
of like that, you know, like a Warcraft MMO type of feel, but, um, you have, it's a little

33:45.440 --> 33:50.400
more actiony, like, because you, you dodge things by double tapping and so you, you move

33:50.400 --> 33:51.680
around a little faster.

33:51.680 --> 33:55.720
So everything feels a little more fast paced, uh, like almost like, uh, the combat feels

33:55.720 --> 34:00.600
almost more like Diablo esque in a way, but yet in that kind of wow environment.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.120
So, uh, yeah, I like that.

34:02.120 --> 34:05.280
And of course, since it's never winter, you have a lot of like user generated things to

34:05.280 --> 34:08.640
explore and I've barely scratched the surface on any of that stuff.

34:08.640 --> 34:12.400
But if you like D and D and you like free MMOs, you'll probably get a kick out of never

34:12.400 --> 34:13.400
winter.

34:13.440 --> 34:16.120
And dungeon Buster and chat says, just wait until you get to the late levels.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.120
Yeah.

34:17.120 --> 34:21.360
I figured in a free to play MMO type of thing, that's probably where you really start to

34:21.360 --> 34:25.880
feel it as towards the end game, but for what it is right now, I'm enjoying it as a nice

34:25.880 --> 34:29.580
little diversion because honestly, I like MMOs.

34:29.580 --> 34:34.680
I'm not really feeling wow these days, sorry, Warcraft fans, but the drought that has been

34:34.680 --> 34:36.400
going on in the game just finally broke me.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.600
And I'm just not interested in wow or the entire game.

34:39.600 --> 34:40.980
I'm not interested in the new expansion.

34:40.980 --> 34:44.220
You know, there was a lot of news about the new expansion and wow this, this week, and

34:44.220 --> 34:47.260
I got to admit, I'm not really, I'm not buying it.

34:47.260 --> 34:48.260
Like I know that sounds harsh.

34:48.260 --> 34:51.260
I have a lot of great, a lot of friends that really love world of Warcraft and have stood

34:51.260 --> 34:55.040
by it, but I don't know, maybe the people will ultimately bring me back.

34:55.040 --> 34:58.940
If I do come back to an MMO, it's usually the people is why, but the game itself, I

34:58.940 --> 34:59.940
don't know.

34:59.940 --> 35:01.460
I'm just kind of, kind of spent on it.

35:01.460 --> 35:04.940
Um, so, but it gives me time to play other MMOs and see what else is out there.

35:04.940 --> 35:09.060
So that part of it I like, otherwise I'm just waiting till the big holiday rush and a lot

35:09.060 --> 35:10.180
of the games to come out there.

35:10.180 --> 35:14.860
Speaking of Diablo, I got Diablo three on pre-order for Tuesday, the ultimate evil edition.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.980
So I'm excited for that on PlayStation four.

35:16.980 --> 35:19.740
So I will be excited to check that out.

35:19.740 --> 35:23.260
Um, all right, so that's it for our gaming weeks.

35:23.260 --> 35:26.220
Uh, moving into some housekeeping before we get into some gaming news.

35:26.220 --> 35:30.020
Um, housekeeping, we will not have a live show Labor Day weekend.

35:30.020 --> 35:31.260
That's two weeks away.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.860
That is because I will not be here.

35:32.860 --> 35:37.660
I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con, which is a huge, huge con, uh, for Southeastern

35:37.660 --> 35:39.260
US and, uh, and beyond.

35:39.340 --> 35:40.940
Honestly, I mean, I'm going out there for it.

35:40.940 --> 35:43.700
Uh, voice geeks network is pretty heavily involved.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.460
Uh, we're going to be participating.

35:45.460 --> 35:49.820
Uh, we have a panel Monday as a part of the podcasting track, uh, 1130 in the morning.

35:49.820 --> 35:55.420
So be sure if you are a dragon Han, I know I said am, and some of you guys might be a

35:55.420 --> 35:57.460
little hung over, but that is the day you leaving.

35:57.460 --> 36:01.100
So hopefully, uh, hopefully you're able to make it to our panel 1130 in the morning that

36:01.100 --> 36:04.900
day, um, will also be appearing on other panels throughout the show.

36:04.900 --> 36:07.380
Uh, I know Bobby and I are participating on another one.

36:07.420 --> 36:11.180
Uh, our pal Brian over at British invaders has a few things he's on.

36:11.420 --> 36:14.780
I want to say John from critical myth might be on a panel or two on some of the different

36:14.780 --> 36:15.220
tracks.

36:15.460 --> 36:17.460
Uh, but just keep, keep an eye out for that.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.740
Uh, uh, all throughout dragon con, we will be there.

36:20.940 --> 36:25.460
Um, but I know it's a big convention weekend in general and just in general, a weekend,

36:25.460 --> 36:27.980
especially in the US where people kind of go out of town, do other things.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.500
So we will not be having a show that week.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.340
Um, but, uh, we will be here next week.

36:33.340 --> 36:36.860
And then of course, we'll be back on September 7th, I believe the day is.

36:37.460 --> 36:41.220
Uh, you can also follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R for all the updates,

36:41.220 --> 36:42.820
facebook.com slash orange lingerie.

36:42.820 --> 36:47.140
If you want to be our friend on Facebook, let's get into some gaming news.

36:47.180 --> 36:51.940
There was quite a bit of it when there's a speaking of big expos, Europe had a huge one

36:51.980 --> 36:57.980
gaming related this game's calm and specifically ironically has kind of funny.

36:57.980 --> 37:00.780
Like I watched all those conferences live and.

37:01.420 --> 37:05.580
Even the one who was a micro, well, all of them makes it for EA because EA was at one in

37:05.580 --> 37:08.420
the morning and it's EA and it's one at one in the morning.

37:08.420 --> 37:12.780
So no, I'm not watching that, but I actually watched the Microsoft one and Sony one

37:12.820 --> 37:14.260
Microsoft was at five in the morning.

37:14.260 --> 37:16.820
Thank you kid for waking up that early.

37:17.220 --> 37:20.780
Um, so anyways, let's talk a little bit about Sony.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.060
So Sony, they had a lot of rumors kind of going into it.

37:23.060 --> 37:28.420
One of which was of course, um, HD remasters for journey and the unfinished one,

37:28.420 --> 37:29.420
which were confirmed.

37:29.740 --> 37:32.980
And the cool thing about those, of course, like a lot of the other games that they

37:32.980 --> 37:35.300
have, uh, they are cross by.

37:35.300 --> 37:39.500
So if you bought the PlayStation three version, you don't have to buy the

37:39.500 --> 37:40.900
PlayStation four version.

37:41.260 --> 37:45.260
It will already be there waiting to put, you know, waiting for you to play it.

37:45.820 --> 37:51.740
Um, also hustle Kings is still, or is coming to a PlayStation four as well.

37:51.980 --> 37:55.220
I am absolutely shocked that that series is still around.

37:55.220 --> 37:57.060
Do people really like billiards that much?

37:57.220 --> 38:02.380
I mean, I dunno, maybe it's literally the only game that's in that genre

38:02.380 --> 38:04.180
that's out on consoles nowadays.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.340
Um, all right.

38:06.340 --> 38:09.500
And then, uh, they also announced that of course they're doing

38:09.500 --> 38:10.780
pretty well with the system.

38:11.140 --> 38:15.020
10 million units sold and they made sure to confirm that.

38:15.020 --> 38:19.140
Yes, that's sold actually to customers and not just shipped.

38:19.620 --> 38:24.740
Cause you know, poking fun at Microsoft and, uh, about, you know, some of

38:24.740 --> 38:26.060
their numbers that they share.

38:26.700 --> 38:31.220
And apparently the best selling console in North America for the past six months,

38:31.220 --> 38:34.660
they said, and I think it's even outselling, uh, the PlayStation

38:34.660 --> 38:36.140
three during that same time period.

38:36.340 --> 38:38.580
They hit 10 million before the PlayStation three.

38:39.180 --> 38:42.380
Um, and then kind of following, you know, some of their announcements,

38:42.380 --> 38:48.380
they showed off a bunch of, I guess, unusual trailers, uh, for things

38:48.380 --> 38:53.700
like including Q games, new, um, the tomorrow children, which kind of had

38:53.700 --> 39:01.340
this, you know, Soviet Russia kind of vibe to it and, uh, very strange

39:01.340 --> 39:05.020
looking game, but, uh, that should be coming out to the platform at some point.

39:05.580 --> 39:09.820
Um, they announced that daisy is coming to PlayStation four.

39:10.180 --> 39:13.180
So I'm guessing probably going to be coming to both consoles at some point.

39:13.180 --> 39:17.660
And I don't know if it's going to be, uh, exclusive or anything with

39:17.660 --> 39:22.660
at least they announced that, uh, also, um, and some kind of pissing off

39:22.660 --> 39:26.580
some of the fans of Vita, uh, tearaway unfolded is going to be

39:26.580 --> 39:28.740
coming to the PlayStation four as well.

39:28.740 --> 39:29.860
So now they're getting kind of.

39:30.260 --> 39:32.620
They own their own version of the Vita game.

39:33.140 --> 39:36.500
Uh, well, I also think what pissed off fans, the Vita was an absolute

39:36.500 --> 39:42.060
lack of any news for the nothing, uh, which I, I'm going to be honest.

39:42.060 --> 39:47.900
It seems to me that Sony is destined to make the Vita a portable PlayStation

39:47.900 --> 39:51.980
television is what is what the Vita is destined to be through the PlayStation

39:51.980 --> 39:55.380
now and through, you know, the, the streaming with the PS four.

39:55.380 --> 40:00.620
And I kind of think they're really not super duper interested in having

40:00.620 --> 40:02.700
the Vita be maybe a games platform.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.940
They'll still support the indie development for it.

40:04.940 --> 40:07.020
Cause it's kind of like a feather in their hat, but I just, I think

40:07.020 --> 40:08.860
Sony's kind of done already.

40:08.900 --> 40:13.300
If anything, they're supporting the Vita with more independent stuff because

40:13.500 --> 40:17.700
they, you know, it is one of the few platforms that actually still supports,

40:17.700 --> 40:23.380
you know, was it a PlayStation mobile, which you can publish to, you don't

40:23.380 --> 40:24.980
even need like a dev kit or anything.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.540
You can just publish straight to it.

40:27.020 --> 40:28.380
Um, so there's that.

40:28.420 --> 40:32.940
And also a lot of these games that are coming out, um, on console

40:32.940 --> 40:34.740
are getting Vita versions as well.

40:34.740 --> 40:39.420
So I think, I think you'll see a lot in that sense, but yeah, as far as.

40:39.780 --> 40:42.180
Releasing major, major titles on the Vita.

40:42.220 --> 40:45.460
I just don't think that's going to happen right away.

40:45.500 --> 40:50.300
Um, maybe if the PlayStation TV really takes off and the numbers, you know,

40:50.300 --> 40:56.340
justify, you know, more portable versions of these games, the problem is just like

40:56.340 --> 41:00.620
the Wii U there's just not a lot of units out there and so they don't want to spend

41:00.620 --> 41:06.180
the effort and, you know, cost to develop a game for the Vita even Sony doesn't

41:06.180 --> 41:09.740
cause some of their big name franchises that they thought would do really well

41:09.740 --> 41:12.740
didn't, but I think that's kind of the blame on some of the devs because they

41:12.740 --> 41:15.900
had really shitty ports of like resistance and stuff.

41:16.460 --> 41:18.740
A couple of quick comments from chat and I'll let you get back to the news.

41:18.740 --> 41:19.020
Wrap up.

41:19.020 --> 41:19.220
Sorry.

41:19.220 --> 41:19.460
Lucky.

41:19.500 --> 41:22.660
Uh, Akuma JP says we had a lot of games in summer though on Vita.

41:22.700 --> 41:26.380
Remember Akuma JP is in Japan where it's probably a very different perception

41:26.380 --> 41:26.620
over there.

41:26.620 --> 41:30.180
I mean, Japan even had that other Vita before we did.

41:30.180 --> 41:32.620
And you know, it's a little different over there.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.460
There's still third parties are supporting it.

41:34.460 --> 41:37.540
I mean like, you know, especially the Japanese companies are really supporting

41:37.540 --> 41:43.380
the Vita like, uh, Atlas and, um, even was it like over here, access games.

41:43.380 --> 41:47.700
They kind of do a lot of translations of titles and stuff, but you're seeing,

41:47.700 --> 41:53.420
you know, uh, Tecmo Koe, um, they've got lots of stuff coming into the Vita.

41:53.420 --> 41:56.900
So if you like, you know, your Japanese games, you're in a lot of that stuff

41:56.900 --> 41:58.220
localized, which is kind of cool.

41:58.820 --> 42:01.420
Um, but really that's it.

42:01.420 --> 42:07.300
I mean, you're not going to see a lot of just Vita versions of big titles

42:07.300 --> 42:09.900
coming on, you know, no call of duties or anything like that, which is kind

42:09.900 --> 42:10.540
of disappointing.

42:10.700 --> 42:14.540
Uh, act Efton chat says, make the Vita $150 and make the memory cards

42:14.540 --> 42:14.860
cheaper.

42:14.860 --> 42:15.820
And I may consider one.

42:16.060 --> 42:17.180
Well, the Vita is going to be what?

42:17.180 --> 42:18.020
99 bucks.

42:18.020 --> 42:21.980
If you can hook it up to a TV that's seems to be where I think they will drop

42:21.980 --> 42:24.980
the price of it, especially if the, I mean, cause the thing about it, if it's

42:24.980 --> 42:29.420
$200 and you know, PlayStation TV is going to be 99, I don't know if you're

42:29.420 --> 42:30.820
going to have to drop the price of that.

42:31.060 --> 42:34.900
It's going to come down one way or another, you know, either it's retailers

42:34.940 --> 42:38.340
trying to clear out their stock or it's Sony dropping the price of it.

42:38.620 --> 42:40.740
But I think the price does need to come down on it.

42:41.220 --> 42:41.540
All right.

42:41.940 --> 42:45.220
Um, and oh, I was going to say it last, but at least, uh, they announced

42:45.220 --> 42:48.620
SharePlay, uh, the feature they're kind of showing off originally with the

42:48.620 --> 42:51.740
PlayStation four is now going to be coming in the fall update.

42:52.020 --> 42:56.220
Now SharePlay was that feature that they showed off where say I'm having trouble

42:56.220 --> 42:57.540
in a game or something like that.

42:57.540 --> 43:01.980
I can have my friend take over the game and actually play a part for me, or, you

43:01.980 --> 43:06.500
know, um, you can also do couch co-op, you know, over the internet.

43:06.500 --> 43:10.500
So if I have, you know, a two player local game, I can have someone join in

43:10.500 --> 43:12.060
on player two or something like that.

43:12.540 --> 43:18.340
But what people are also seeing is like, Hey, I can use this to loan a game to my

43:18.340 --> 43:21.660
friend, you know, across the country or something like that, they'll just take

43:21.660 --> 43:24.980
over my game and they can play it up to an hour.

43:24.980 --> 43:27.500
So it's going to allow you to play up to 60 minutes at a time.

43:27.940 --> 43:32.740
And, uh, you know, after that 60 minutes, it'll disconnect, but you can

43:32.740 --> 43:34.340
reconnect as many times as you want.

43:34.780 --> 43:37.820
And so that'll be coming in software update 2.0, which is

43:37.820 --> 43:39.180
coming in later this fall.

43:40.780 --> 43:44.220
And, Oh, and of course, because it is multiplayer PlayStation,

43:44.220 --> 43:47.220
plus will be required like everything else.

43:49.220 --> 43:49.820
All right.

43:49.820 --> 43:53.460
Well, Microsoft also had their big press conference and there was a lot of news

43:53.460 --> 43:56.740
coming out of that, including, uh, increased presence for indie games.

43:57.060 --> 44:01.500
Uh, on the ID at X-Box platform, which will include goat simulator.

44:01.660 --> 44:02.980
No time to explain.

44:02.980 --> 44:07.380
And, uh, one of the big ones coming over from PC is smite because smite is a big

44:07.380 --> 44:12.060
MOBA, uh, not quite as big as league of legends or dota, or, you know, even

44:12.060 --> 44:14.780
heroes, but, uh, smite definitely has its audience.

44:14.780 --> 44:15.900
I see it on Twitch all the time.

44:15.900 --> 44:16.780
So very interesting.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.900
That has made me actually very shocked that goat simulator was allowed on

44:19.900 --> 44:24.340
consoles because that came as buggy as hell on purpose, but it's just, I think

44:24.340 --> 44:25.660
that, yeah, I think that's the joke.

44:25.660 --> 44:26.100
Christ.

44:26.260 --> 44:27.020
Yeah, that's the joke.

44:27.340 --> 44:28.140
Uh, anyhow.

44:28.460 --> 44:33.900
Um, also, um, Dan, you haven't seen goat simulator.

44:33.900 --> 44:35.660
Oh, well I'll have to show you during break then.

44:35.900 --> 44:36.580
Oh, good.

44:37.260 --> 44:38.460
You know, I have this game, right?

44:40.940 --> 44:42.260
Uh, apparently not.

44:42.540 --> 44:46.300
Imagine if you will, a game like Tony Hawk, where you do tricks, except

44:46.340 --> 44:51.060
instead of Tony Hawk on a skateboard, you're goat pissing people off and

44:51.060 --> 44:53.740
breaking shit fucking much and going into space.

44:54.580 --> 44:56.500
Space space goat.

44:56.540 --> 44:57.020
I'm in space.

44:57.420 --> 44:59.220
Uh, let's see.

44:59.260 --> 45:03.980
Uh, also, uh, the Xbox one preview program, expanding their features for

45:03.980 --> 45:07.340
more friends, the ability to view messages, friends, parties, and

45:07.340 --> 45:11.180
achievements on a snapped app, uh, and playing media from USB device.

45:11.420 --> 45:14.380
Uh, there will be an FIFA 15 bundle in Europe.

45:14.620 --> 45:18.060
Uh, turtle rock studios is going to be bringing the beta for evolved

45:18.060 --> 45:21.420
to the Xbox one in January, uh, evolved by the way, pushed back.

45:21.420 --> 45:22.620
If you hadn't heard the memo on that.

45:22.780 --> 45:26.420
But the, uh, a demo or the beta, excuse me, will be on the Xbox one in January.

45:26.820 --> 45:29.140
Uh, let's see fable legends.

45:29.140 --> 45:30.980
Multiplayer beta will be in October.

45:31.340 --> 45:36.900
Um, there will also be a sunset overdrive, uh, package detail,

45:36.900 --> 45:38.620
which would be a retail October 28th.

45:38.620 --> 45:40.380
I'm not sure if that is specifically for Europe.

45:40.540 --> 45:44.020
No, they're going to have a system with it's a white console.

45:44.020 --> 45:44.500
Same date.

45:44.980 --> 45:50.340
Uh, yeah, the 28th it's, uh, it's, um, same con or white console for three 99.

45:50.740 --> 45:54.380
Uh, the beta program for halo five starts December 29th.

45:54.420 --> 45:56.420
So just barely in this year.

45:56.740 --> 45:57.980
Uh, let's see.

45:58.020 --> 46:00.820
Also, uh, there will be a halo channel.

46:00.980 --> 46:05.140
Microsoft and three 43 industry is a teaming up for the halo channel.

46:05.340 --> 46:07.820
This will broadcast live Twitch game play.

46:07.980 --> 46:11.900
There'll also be content based around the halo series available on this.

46:11.900 --> 46:13.340
This is kind of interesting, like a whole,

46:15.340 --> 46:17.260
you know why I say, yeah, why?

46:17.260 --> 46:20.180
Because they tried the same shit with call of duty elite member elite

46:20.220 --> 46:24.180
had all this content that was based around call of duty and it was fucking boring.

46:24.220 --> 46:25.300
No, I don't remember that actually.

46:25.300 --> 46:25.620
Yeah.

46:25.660 --> 46:28.380
And then they just continue to leave because no one gave a shit about it.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.060
So I, I don't know.

46:30.060 --> 46:32.980
It halo tournaments would be kind of cool, but I just.

46:33.860 --> 46:37.740
Aside from like, uh, that show from Steve or are they still doing the

46:37.740 --> 46:39.020
Steven Spielberg halo thing?

46:39.020 --> 46:42.420
Because it, you know, aside from that, I just don't get shit about the rest.

46:42.420 --> 46:43.780
Think that is still a thing.

46:44.220 --> 46:47.820
I, they said anything that had already started was still going to be a thing.

46:47.820 --> 46:48.140
I think.

46:48.940 --> 46:51.300
Do you guys talk about bungee firing Martin O'Donnell?

46:51.660 --> 46:52.740
A while ago when it happened?

46:52.740 --> 46:52.940
Yeah.

46:52.980 --> 46:54.500
Has three, four, three hired him yet?

46:54.780 --> 46:56.220
Oh, I haven't heard.

46:56.220 --> 46:56.940
Don't think seriously.

46:56.940 --> 46:58.540
What the fuck are you guys waiting for?

46:59.420 --> 47:01.580
That's the guy who makes halo halo, right?

47:01.620 --> 47:02.300
Hurry up.

47:02.420 --> 47:02.820
Right.

47:03.340 --> 47:07.980
Uh, last but not least the big, big, uh, bomb that was dropped, uh, crystal

47:07.980 --> 47:14.020
dynamics announcing rise of the tomb Raider will be exclusive to the Xbox one.

47:14.300 --> 47:18.580
Uh, in the days that followed that exclusive was, uh, clarified to mean

47:18.580 --> 47:23.460
timed exclusive, but I think we all kind of expected that a huge game like tomb

47:23.460 --> 47:27.940
Raider, even if it is exclusive on Xbox one or whatever, the game of the year,

47:27.940 --> 47:30.980
definitive edition, blah, blah, blah, blah, would have been on all consoles

47:30.980 --> 47:34.780
anyway, especially with a big game like that, but a lot of people really

47:34.780 --> 47:39.260
unhappy about that news, um, considering that probably a lot of people bought

47:39.260 --> 47:43.300
tomb Raider on the PlayStation four for the definitive edition, just because,

47:43.540 --> 47:47.220
you know, the number of, uh, PlayStations that were in households at the time and

47:47.220 --> 47:48.860
so forth, you had more PS fours households.

47:49.060 --> 47:50.740
So I think the game sold better there.

47:50.740 --> 47:53.980
So, uh, and then some people saying, oh, if you go all the way back to the O G

47:53.980 --> 47:56.820
tomb Raider games, that was always more of a PlayStation thing.

47:56.820 --> 48:01.140
So this feels like a, and I'm using my quote, he fingers slap in the face to

48:01.140 --> 48:05.060
those of us that have supported tomb Raider all these years, the DLC for

48:05.060 --> 48:09.100
like granted out of four was exclusive to Xbox for about six months.

48:09.820 --> 48:10.620
I don't know.

48:10.620 --> 48:12.740
They paid $50 million for that.

48:13.140 --> 48:18.940
So, um, you know, I, in my opinion, it's business and you might not like it, but

48:18.940 --> 48:22.820
I sort of think if things had been the other way around where tomb Raider had

48:22.820 --> 48:26.180
been announced exclusive for PlayStation four, people would have been like, oh,

48:26.180 --> 48:26.660
cool.

48:26.660 --> 48:30.820
And you might've had your occasional Xbox Microsoft tomb Raider.

48:30.820 --> 48:33.900
So I kind of like, and I'm talking to somebody who doesn't own an Xbox one yet.

48:33.900 --> 48:37.940
I own a PlayStation four and not an Xbox one, but I'm looking at this going, well,

48:38.380 --> 48:42.300
that's, that's kind of irritating, but at the same time, it's probably a pretty

48:42.340 --> 48:43.780
good business decision on Microsoft.

48:44.100 --> 48:46.020
It's weird from square's end.

48:46.380 --> 48:51.140
Because, you know, we all know that square doesn't do exclusive deals.

48:51.180 --> 48:54.260
Well, all except for square does exclusive deals all the time.

48:54.460 --> 48:58.700
It's not that Dan it's that they went out on record and said, we were a little

48:58.700 --> 49:02.420
disappointed in the sales of tomb Raider, even though they kind of backtracked on

49:02.420 --> 49:07.300
that later and crystal dynamics, I believe, I believe came out and said, no,

49:07.300 --> 49:10.500
we, we may we're in the black, the games in the black now, you know, cause they,

49:10.540 --> 49:12.540
they did sales in the definitive edition, so forth.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.300
They made their money on that game and so forth.

49:14.300 --> 49:15.740
It's cause square's delusional.

49:16.060 --> 49:19.740
Look, I'm offended because tomb Raider was originally a Saturn game.

49:19.740 --> 49:21.260
And then the PlayStation stolen.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.980
So you know what Sony fans suck it.

49:24.220 --> 49:25.660
Now you're getting your own medicine.

49:25.700 --> 49:28.780
Well, what about, and some folks to say at fifth dream says

49:28.780 --> 49:30.620
tomb Raider is a PC title.

49:31.180 --> 49:34.340
I got, isn't it a PC title before it's any of those things.

49:34.340 --> 49:39.140
I'm pretty sure that when tomb Raider was being developed, it was a.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.580
It was a console game.

49:43.020 --> 49:43.420
Interesting.

49:43.420 --> 49:44.540
I don't think it started for the PC.

49:44.540 --> 49:49.660
I think what happened was there was a PC version and then they made other PC

49:49.660 --> 49:53.700
versions, but it was like the lead console for tomb Raider was the Saturn.

49:54.300 --> 49:56.500
And here's the thing though, is it's not just Xbox one.

49:56.500 --> 49:58.660
It's Xbox one and Xbox three 60.

49:59.340 --> 50:00.980
Rise of the tomb Raiders on three 60.

50:00.980 --> 50:01.420
Yes.

50:01.420 --> 50:04.820
It's it's act it's coming to Xbox first.

50:04.900 --> 50:06.260
I didn't re I didn't catch that.

50:06.260 --> 50:10.340
I thought the game only had the newer, uh, no, I think it's

50:10.980 --> 50:14.340
I think it's just how great the new generation consoles really are.

50:14.380 --> 50:19.660
Last, last in, you know, new, last in, um, last gen and current gen.

50:19.700 --> 50:21.340
Are you absolutely sure on that?

50:21.380 --> 50:22.500
I'm pretty sure.

50:23.420 --> 50:24.860
Oh, it in your mouth.

50:26.260 --> 50:29.940
Uh, Sony's chain is screening, screaming from the other room.

50:29.940 --> 50:30.580
Yes.

50:31.980 --> 50:32.780
So interesting.

50:32.780 --> 50:33.020
Yeah.

50:33.060 --> 50:33.460
Oh yeah.

50:33.460 --> 50:34.140
I'm seeing it.

50:34.180 --> 50:35.260
I'm looking at Wikipedia.

50:35.260 --> 50:36.100
So it must be true.

50:36.180 --> 50:37.820
Three 60 and Xbox one.

50:37.820 --> 50:38.300
Interesting.

50:38.380 --> 50:38.780
Matt.

50:38.780 --> 50:40.780
Meanwhile, frantically editing Wikipedia.

50:45.380 --> 50:46.180
It's on Wikipedia.

50:46.180 --> 50:47.260
So it must be true.

50:47.300 --> 50:47.940
Here it is.

50:48.660 --> 50:49.100
All right.

50:49.100 --> 50:54.220
So, uh, yeah, I, again, I admit I'm trying to look at the silver lining of this.

50:54.340 --> 50:58.500
I figured by 2015 holiday, I'd have an Xbox one anyway.

50:58.820 --> 51:02.780
So maybe there'll be like a really cool bundle that comes out for two

51:02.780 --> 51:06.060
prizes, the tomb Raider, because Microsoft seems invested in wanting

51:06.060 --> 51:06.940
their own uncharted.

51:07.500 --> 51:11.500
Was the last two Raiders so big, despite being a disappointment that

51:11.500 --> 51:16.220
tomb Raider now has some sort of like relevance in the console war.

51:16.260 --> 51:20.620
Well, here's yes, because even though when that news came out that the

51:20.620 --> 51:23.700
two Raider wasn't selling well, Dan, it took a lot of us by surprise because

51:23.700 --> 51:26.460
the new two Raiders really good, great game, great game.

51:26.460 --> 51:28.420
And I figured it sold pretty well.

51:28.540 --> 51:30.860
I didn't figure that sold system selling.

51:30.860 --> 51:34.620
Well, I didn't figure it would be like if Microsoft rolled up and said, And

51:34.620 --> 51:37.100
this might date me, cause I haven't really been following new games too

51:37.100 --> 51:39.980
much, but if they just ran up and said, Hey, by the way, call of duty,

51:39.980 --> 51:45.260
Xbox exclusive bitches, drops mic, you know, it's like, Oh, we got tomb Raider.

51:45.860 --> 51:46.780
Good.

51:47.340 --> 51:48.700
I mean, it's cool.

51:49.100 --> 51:50.820
It's not going to change your fortunes.

51:50.980 --> 51:53.060
It's not going to sell Xbox one.

51:54.420 --> 51:59.660
If you consider that uncharted might be Sony's big game holiday 2015,

51:59.660 --> 52:02.580
it does create a very new tomb Raider.

52:03.580 --> 52:04.540
He does have a point.

52:04.540 --> 52:05.140
That's the thing.

52:05.140 --> 52:06.980
It's like, it's like, Oh, well, damn.

52:06.980 --> 52:07.940
I can't play a big yet.

52:07.940 --> 52:08.460
Hold on.

52:08.460 --> 52:08.940
Okay.

52:08.940 --> 52:09.460
Okay.

52:09.460 --> 52:11.540
I can't play tomb Raider right now.

52:11.540 --> 52:13.940
I'll just play uncharted until tomb Raider comes out.

52:13.940 --> 52:16.740
I mean, there's that scenario.

52:16.740 --> 52:20.380
I mean, especially now that it's confirmed that yeah, it's time exclusive.

52:20.740 --> 52:22.020
So people just like, fuck it.

52:22.020 --> 52:24.060
I'll just wait or I'll wait and see what the reviews are.

52:24.060 --> 52:26.980
And the reason that great, I'm just not going to buy it at all when it comes out.

52:27.300 --> 52:31.140
So it is a double edged sword that, you know, yeah, they get it exclusive,

52:31.660 --> 52:36.220
but if it doesn't turn out to be a great, great, great game,

52:36.220 --> 52:39.700
then it could hurt them in the end because now people are just not going to wait.

52:39.700 --> 52:41.220
They'll wait for it to drop price.

52:41.220 --> 52:45.060
We paid a hundred milos for an exclusive for a game that doesn't matter that much.

52:45.740 --> 52:46.660
We needed something.

52:46.660 --> 52:48.260
We got it Microsoft.

52:48.260 --> 52:52.500
We have bullet, which I remain hopeful

52:52.500 --> 52:55.180
because the first Tomb Raider was so darn good.

52:55.180 --> 52:56.340
I know it'll be a great game.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.820
I know I'm just the first Tomb Raider.

52:59.860 --> 53:01.860
You guys know what I mean? The first since the reboot.

53:01.860 --> 53:03.420
All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

53:03.420 --> 53:05.660
We're running really long because of all these stream problems

53:05.660 --> 53:06.660
we've been having tonight.

53:06.660 --> 53:08.500
Put us back a little bit. So let's move on.

53:08.500 --> 53:11.140
Dark Sakura, then I'll be quick.

53:11.140 --> 53:15.580
Warner Brothers is apparently interested in buying Xbox Entertainment Studios.

53:16.740 --> 53:20.220
There was something put out by a Hollywood reporter saying that Microsoft

53:20.220 --> 53:24.580
was actually considering selling Xbox Entertainment Studios

53:25.540 --> 53:28.620
to Warner Brothers because of

53:30.580 --> 53:33.260
I just lost my place because they wanted to,

53:33.860 --> 53:36.420
you know, after the negotiations with

53:37.260 --> 53:40.620
the merger of Xbox Entertainment and Machinima,

53:41.100 --> 53:43.500
that they thought that it would be a good idea.

53:46.940 --> 53:49.180
What? Hmm. You know what this means?

53:49.980 --> 53:52.460
But this news only can be one thing.

53:52.460 --> 53:55.500
The return of the WB.

53:56.500 --> 53:59.900
WBX. Well, you know that, you know, Xbox Entertainment was closed.

54:00.620 --> 54:04.620
Yeah, but they still, of course, own what is left of its assets in the division.

54:04.820 --> 54:08.820
Right. Well, and didn't the the documentary that they did,

54:09.300 --> 54:12.820
the E.T. one, didn't they have to go to Warner to do a whole bunch

54:12.820 --> 54:15.220
of the rights and stuff for like E.T. music and whatnot?

54:15.540 --> 54:17.100
Maybe that was the point of contact.

54:17.100 --> 54:19.300
Well, E.T. though is universal.

54:19.300 --> 54:21.620
OK, then fuck it. That's all wrong.

54:21.620 --> 54:23.940
God damn it, Dan. God damn it, Dan.

54:24.140 --> 54:27.340
I'm like, what? E.T. was a right at Universal Studios.

54:28.220 --> 54:30.500
But they licensed shit. I mean, you know, it's true.

54:31.100 --> 54:32.580
All right. You have The Simpsons right now.

54:32.580 --> 54:34.820
That's definitely not universal.

54:34.820 --> 54:36.860
Or I'm sorry. No, it's not even The Simpsons anymore.

54:36.860 --> 54:38.060
Fuck, I can't keep track.

54:38.060 --> 54:41.140
It's like Simpsons and then it was Terminator and then like.

54:41.180 --> 54:42.300
No, it's Simpsons now.

54:42.300 --> 54:43.980
No, it's back to the future.

54:43.980 --> 54:47.140
It's no, it's it's The Minions right now.

54:47.140 --> 54:49.300
They didn't replace Terminator turned into Minions.

54:49.900 --> 54:51.860
Simpsons was back to the future. Yeah.

54:51.860 --> 54:53.180
Yeah, that's disappointing.

54:53.180 --> 54:54.940
It was so cheesy. They had to keep it.

54:54.940 --> 54:58.500
I mean, anyhow, anyhow.

54:59.140 --> 55:02.300
Does does this affect the closure of Xbox Entertainment affect the whole

55:02.300 --> 55:05.380
like possibility of one versus one hundred returning or any of that?

55:05.900 --> 55:07.180
Oh, man, that was awesome.

55:07.180 --> 55:10.580
Well, if if if you mean the well,

55:11.140 --> 55:13.940
no, because, you know, zero percent

55:14.500 --> 55:17.980
chance of returning time zero is still zero.

55:17.980 --> 55:21.740
I think was the Xbox Entertainment was about like making TV

55:21.740 --> 55:22.820
shows and shit.

55:22.820 --> 55:25.780
It was about, oh, we're going to have all this original content

55:25.780 --> 55:27.820
and we're going to have like a Netflix thing going on.

55:28.020 --> 55:29.420
It wasn't about making games.

55:29.420 --> 55:32.380
That was like the Xbox community, man.

55:32.380 --> 55:35.380
And one versus one hundred was like, that was some cool content

55:35.380 --> 55:37.580
that sold Xboxes.

55:37.580 --> 55:40.100
I shit you not. We were selling Xboxes.

55:40.100 --> 55:42.540
People were like, how do we get this one versus one hundred thing?

55:42.580 --> 55:44.900
Oh, buy an Xbox, buy this card.

55:44.900 --> 55:46.540
Don't even the game desk.

55:46.540 --> 55:49.700
It's all good. Rod Band. Wow.

55:50.700 --> 55:52.820
I hope I will know.

55:52.820 --> 55:54.380
I hope that will come back in one way or another.

55:54.380 --> 55:55.420
Maybe Warner Brothers can do that.

55:55.420 --> 55:59.140
Warner Brothers, you joke about the WB, but didn't it become the CW?

55:59.140 --> 56:01.220
I don't know who has the controlling stake in CW.

56:01.220 --> 56:02.540
I don't know if that's mostly CBS.

56:02.540 --> 56:05.060
Who cares? Yes, that's true.

56:05.060 --> 56:09.260
Maybe, maybe because I want America's next top model on Xbox

56:09.260 --> 56:12.420
one with connect,

56:12.420 --> 56:14.540
make my best smize on connect.

56:14.540 --> 56:15.860
You're going to get supernatural.

56:15.860 --> 56:17.460
You can just do that for fun.

56:17.460 --> 56:18.860
I can. I'm doing it right now.

56:18.860 --> 56:21.940
The best you can hope for is an adaptation

56:21.940 --> 56:24.340
of a possible model and movie.

56:24.340 --> 56:25.140
I just saw a game.

56:25.140 --> 56:29.380
I just want my Xbox to root for me when I when I die in the exclusive

56:29.380 --> 56:30.460
Rise of the Tomb Raider.

56:30.460 --> 56:32.180
I want my I want Tyra to come out and go.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.540
We were rooting for you.

56:33.540 --> 56:36.580
We were all rooting for you.

56:36.580 --> 56:37.740
Anyhow, yeah.

56:37.740 --> 56:39.460
Loki, new story, please save this.

56:39.460 --> 56:42.940
All right. So speaking of comeback, Sierra is back

56:43.380 --> 56:47.340
resurrected in shambles, I guess, by Activision

56:47.340 --> 56:51.060
and Sierra's new direction is, well, they're going to be

56:51.780 --> 56:54.980
releasing some of their old titles, including King's Quest,

56:54.980 --> 56:57.860
the brand new King's Quest game and.

56:57.860 --> 57:01.180
Geometry Wars, three dimensions, which is like geometry wars,

57:01.180 --> 57:04.540
but now it's not quite flat, it's in dimensions.

57:04.540 --> 57:06.940
Bizarre Creations is back.

57:06.940 --> 57:09.740
Now, when they start doing time dimensions, then

57:10.580 --> 57:12.100
we have Tesseract edition.

57:12.100 --> 57:13.460
So correct me if I'm wrong.

57:13.460 --> 57:16.500
This is your only active.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.260
Fuck you. Oh, excuse me, excuse me.

57:18.260 --> 57:22.100
Not here. This is only Activision using the name, right?

57:22.100 --> 57:24.380
It's no there's no Roberta Williams.

57:24.380 --> 57:26.660
Oh, God, no original talent.

57:26.940 --> 57:28.860
She washed her hands of Lord gaming.

57:28.860 --> 57:31.780
Lord British isn't running back to Activision because

57:32.380 --> 57:34.020
more money after launching into space.

57:34.020 --> 57:36.220
Lord British tried to shoot himself into space.

57:36.220 --> 57:38.140
Right. No, he did shoot himself into space.

57:38.140 --> 57:39.820
Yeah, but he's not running back.

57:39.820 --> 57:42.660
This is just them saying we're going to release adventure games

57:42.660 --> 57:44.860
and we're going to release it under the order of British.

57:44.860 --> 57:47.100
He's making Facebook games now.

57:47.220 --> 57:48.140
Oh, no, that's what I'm saying.

57:48.140 --> 57:50.020
This those guys aren't coming back.

57:50.020 --> 57:51.580
So, yeah, it's not coming back.

57:51.580 --> 57:54.940
The name Sierra is being used for the King's Quest.

57:55.300 --> 57:58.620
Bizarre sequel slash remake slash resurrection.

57:58.660 --> 58:00.780
Bizarre, sadly, not coming back either.

58:01.020 --> 58:04.260
So even though I'm really no shit, even though I'm really.

58:04.380 --> 58:05.860
Fuck you, Activision.

58:05.860 --> 58:07.460
Fuck you for that.

58:07.460 --> 58:10.060
Fuck you, Microsoft, for even selling them.

58:10.060 --> 58:14.500
And even though I'm like really excited about a new Geometry Wars,

58:14.500 --> 58:18.140
I'm like super like shifty eyes, like don't fuck this up.

58:18.860 --> 58:19.980
Do not follow.

58:19.980 --> 58:23.540
OK, so King's Quest, they're saying is being developed by the odd gentlemen

58:23.540 --> 58:27.020
who did the misadventures of PB Winterbottom

58:27.340 --> 58:29.660
and I guess the wayward manor.

58:30.580 --> 58:33.900
And then lucid games are going to be taking over Geometry Wars.

58:34.580 --> 58:37.420
I have no idea who lucid games are, but it's Geometry Wars.

58:37.420 --> 58:38.700
I can't imagine it'd be that difficult.

58:40.140 --> 58:42.220
Famous. That's not true.

58:42.220 --> 58:47.100
Geometry Wars is a simple game that's perfectly balanced.

58:47.380 --> 58:50.500
It was designed not just like, oh, here you go, play this.

58:50.660 --> 58:52.300
Like they put some time into it.

58:52.300 --> 58:54.260
Remember the first year of the Xbox?

58:54.260 --> 58:55.980
It was the killer app.

58:55.980 --> 58:58.500
It was like, well, Project

58:58.500 --> 59:02.300
Awesome three is pretty good, but perfect dark zero.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.300
Do you have you played Geometry Wars?

59:04.300 --> 59:06.620
Oh, and Uno on Xbox Live. There you go.

59:06.820 --> 59:09.860
No, for like no lies detected on versus 100.

59:10.860 --> 59:12.660
And it's like it's so weird.

59:12.660 --> 59:14.140
Yet yet bizarre.

59:14.140 --> 59:17.780
Shut down vision camera, not support like what?

59:18.140 --> 59:20.660
Anyway, well, it was, you know, what happened was

59:20.940 --> 59:24.020
and I mean, I know that because I'm a racing effects, not a bizarre

59:24.020 --> 59:27.220
big thing was Gotham Project, Gotham Nine.

59:27.580 --> 59:31.820
It took three titles, but eventually for to eclipse Project Gotham.

59:32.020 --> 59:34.580
Microsoft didn't see any reason to keep bankrolling them.

59:34.860 --> 59:36.740
And so they sold them off to Activision.

59:36.740 --> 59:38.500
And then Activision had one release.

59:38.500 --> 59:41.140
It was like Splitter Splitter Blur.

59:41.140 --> 59:43.660
They had two releases because you remember Activision

59:43.660 --> 59:46.060
had them develop that crappy game, the club.

59:46.100 --> 59:48.460
Oh, oh, yeah. They did a double of seven games.

59:49.460 --> 59:52.220
Anyway, why do you why did you remind me about?

59:52.260 --> 59:53.260
I hate you so much, man.

59:53.260 --> 59:57.060
Here's the Geometry Wars two was still really good to evolved.

59:57.140 --> 01:00:01.220
Yeah, exactly. Anyway, that was Geometry Wars two was Geometry Wars.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.420
Sorry, whatever.

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.740
Remember, we did have one that got the name Geometry Wars two on Xbox 360.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:06.740
That's really good, too.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.300
And we we had was that the guys supported it over the Wii.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.180
So that's pretty good.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.540
And the way that was still bizarre.

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.980
And the Wii one was pretty good, too.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.620
Was it on 3DS or DS?

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:15.980
I think so. It was on DS. Yeah.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.220
And that game was awesome.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.260
It's a great game. It's just OK.

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.100
I'm just worried because Activision sucks.

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.700
I don't know. I wouldn't say they suck, but it's just like there's

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.260
EA has reclaimed their title, Crown of the Most Evilest.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.540
Oh, yes, yes.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:36.060
But I'm worried that the Activision and like even EA

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:40.300
has been trying to spin this where or maybe not EA, but there was like,

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.300
was it that the guy that did

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:46.380
or the group that did Devil May Cry, you know, that game sucks.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.740
Well, now they're trying to release these games as indie titles.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:55.540
So like, you know, like Geometry Wars three dimensions is an indie title

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:58.740
or like, you know, King's Quest is going to be more of an indie title.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.860
And they're trying to spin it that way to get people,

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.820
you know, kind of more on their side for that stuff.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.420
Like they have another game coming out.

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:07.020
I can't remember, but it looked exactly like Devil May Cry,

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:10.980
but it's it's it's an indie title by a triple A studio or something like that.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.860
It's like that doesn't make any fucking sense.

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.460
It's by what they call it.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.060
It's by a small market developer, you know, an indie developer.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.900
Indie developer, not indie studio.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.980
Yeah, because Activision is about the world's biggest or second biggest studio.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.540
Well, as much fun as we're having reminiscing evil bastards

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.300
about the past, let's do some more reminiscing about the past with this story,

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:37.020
because believe it or not, this week is the twenty five year anniversary

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.860
of the Sega Genesis, not the medium, right?

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:43.460
Not the not the Mega Drive necessarily, but the Sega Genesis

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.700
coming to stores in North America.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.660
Remember Sonic and Tails and Fantasy Star and Echo

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.260
the Dolphin and Shadow Run and Toe Jam and Earl.

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.140
Don't remember those from launch because you remember Altered Beast,

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.500
which which I went back and played not that long ago

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.100
because it was on the Sonic Mega collection thing.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.660
So I went back to get my trophies.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:09.020
I played Altered Beast on Genesis and I was like Ultimate Genesis collection.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:09.700
That's it. Thank you.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.140
I was like Altered Beast on Genesis.

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.540
This game sucks. That game was terrible.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:17.300
But the whole thing was you came from like Mario three,

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.700
which is a masterpiece of of gameplay design and whatnot.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.060
And you looked at the graphics and then you looked at Altered Beast

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:26.140
and you heard the graphics and the voice and you were like, God damn,

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.380
this is amazing.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.700
And there were a lot of great games during the launch of the Genesis.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:31.220
There was Thunder Force Two.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.780
There was Herzog Zwei.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.180
There was Truxton.

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.700
There was what else was going to launch?

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.180
Yeah, that's about it.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.580
I had Super Thunder Blade and Altered Beast. I got screwed.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:46.380
Yeah. And the Altered Beast.

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:46.900
Bulls and Ghosts.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.100
Bulls and Ghosts was the lead launch title.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.540
It was the reason to own a Sega Genesis.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.820
Altered Beast, everybody remembers from the arcade

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.940
and not that it was necessarily a much better game in the arcade,

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.940
but everybody remembers those sequences with like the voice

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.220
like when they transform in the wise from your wave.

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:05.460
The Genesis was a capable trance.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:09.620
The funny thing about the Genesis translations were they were always close.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.020
They weren't exact. Golden Axe wasn't exact.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.780
You know, what was the other one?

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.420
Ghouls and Ghosts wasn't exact.

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.500
Altered Beast wasn't exact.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:21.660
But because they were the closest you could get at home at the moment,

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.820
they were amazing.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.740
I didn't realize Omar Fudd did voice acting in that game.

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.420
He did. Oh, yes.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.940
Dungeon Buster in chat at live.vognetware.com says,

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.860
everybody poop who's Altered Beast nowadays.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.900
But it was like, holy crap, it's almost like the arcade at the time.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:35.420
Yeah, it was.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.260
That's what I was saying is it was mind blowingly close.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.060
And when you got your Genesis, that was, you know,

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.620
especially if you bought it in the first year before Sonic released

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:47.580
and became the pack-in, that was the game you slammed in and you turned on.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.660
And you were like, why didn't I buy a second controller

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.060
so my buddy could play with me?

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.660
And you play through the game in like 20 minutes

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:57.180
and then you play through the game again in like 20 minutes.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:01.660
And then you put it away and hopefully you'd bought another game.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:06.060
Dan, I know you have many fond memories of the Genesis

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:07.860
because I think you're kind of the Sega fanboy.

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:08.940
Yeah, Sega is my thing.

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.620
Which is kind of probably why you're here tonight of all weeks.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.740
No, it's just an amazing coincidence.

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.980
Amazing coincidence.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.060
What are your personal favorite memories?

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:20.780
Because I didn't own a Genesis and my friends did, but I didn't own one.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:21.780
You didn't own a Genesis?

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.380
I was a Super Nintendo kid.

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.180
Fuck you, I'm leaving.

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.380
Well, what are your favorite memories of the Sega Genesis?

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:32.140
Looking back, you know, the great thing about when the Genesis

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:37.620
actually launched was that it took the how do you say?

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:40.300
It kind of took the vibe that Nintendo was putting out, which was,

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.420
oh, it's real family friendly and it's good for kids.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.940
And the console is wide and the games are all brightly colored.

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.260
And I mean, the box was black.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.180
It had the big silver logo on it.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.540
It had the big screenshot from Altered Beast.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.540
And it just it looked edgy.

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.380
It felt edgy.

01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:00.220
The controllers were were a little too large for little kid hands

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:03.660
and had three buttons, which was amazing at the moment.

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.780
The game cartridges were really cool and sleek,

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.140
and they didn't have the names on the front.

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:10.300
They were only on the top.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:14.540
And it did weird little things like when you had two controllers plugged in,

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:16.580
it wouldn't ask you if you wanted to do one or two player

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.260
and some of the launch games you had to press start of the second controller.

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.540
But if you only played it, one player would let you swap controllers back

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.620
and forth, which Nintendo didn't do at the moment.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.900
And we were just like, oh, man, that's so cool.

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.140
What kind of thought went into that?

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:34.220
It had almost all arcade games, just really fantastic stuff.

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.380
I had a Super Nintendo.

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.860
God, you suck.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.700
And that's not what you said when we opened my luggage day one.

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.660
You're like, you bought a Super Nintendo.

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.940
I did not. You did. You did, sir.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.540
I'm like, wow, your Super Nintendo is ugly and discolored.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.980
Mine is beautiful and pristine.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.380
Let's throw yours away.

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.100
I know you still have mine.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.060
I think, OK, when we talk about our show, we do like like I throw away

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.540
a Super Nintendo, not to interrupt the family.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.460
So I was looking for you to interrupt because I was like out of breath.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.860
But I as a non Genesis owner, I still remember

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:12.660
what I think was kind of the big moment for me that made me want to Genesis.

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.300
And I think was was a big defining moment

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.100
for the Sega Genesis was the release of Mortal Kombat.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:22.180
And the fact that the Sega Genesis was the only system cool enough

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:28.140
to have the blood code, whereas on the Super Nintendo, it was like, no, it's sweat.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.260
I had the Super Nintendo version.

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.540
Did you really? Because the graphics and sounds were better.

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.860
But the gameplay was broken as shit.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.340
Yeah, it really was.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.540
You know, that was the big problem with this next version.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.540
It just didn't play right.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:45.700
But it looked like like the scale down, but it looked like the arcade.

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.660
And that was just sort of the weird thing about it was.

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.940
Yeah, the Genesis version was a big, big seller.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.180
But that didn't come out till, what, 94?

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.940
It was later on. It was.

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.420
Yeah, it's 93 or 94.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.460
So you're talking like three or four years in.

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.900
And it kind of gave.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:03.260
What was weird was, you know, the SNES came out and the SNES was successful

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.820
and the Genesis came out with Sonic and the Genesis was holding its own.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:10.620
And then the Mortal Kombat thing, you know, then the SNES got Street Fighter II.

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.500
And all of a sudden we were all throwing the Genesis aside

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.660
because it was like we had to play Street Fighter II.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.300
Talk about a third party exclusive.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.540
That was a huge system seller.

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:24.740
And, you know, because the Genesis didn't get Street Fighter II

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:28.220
and sell it until Special Champion Edition, they had no analog to it.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:33.780
So they brought out MK, MK gave the Genesis more life

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:37.060
because their version had fatalities.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:40.340
It had blood. It played faster. It played better.

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.220
Yeah, it sounded kind of wonky and it looked a little funky,

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:48.220
but it was closer to what people, to what the Mortal Kombat fan wanted.

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:50.540
Right. Very good.

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:53.020
Very good summary of that there, Loki.

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:55.900
I didn't have a Genesis right away, but I did get one.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.900
I did get one later on.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.540
So I think, you know, one of my favorite games on there.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.500
Well, I had two favorite games.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.900
One would have been the their version of Jurassic Park,

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.140
which was the side scroller version where you could play as the dinosaurs.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:10.220
That was pretty cool.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:12.340
And then Vectorman, actually.

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.180
I kind of like that was late.

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.860
And Earthworm Jim.

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.940
That was a good game.

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:20.140
You know, Earthworm Jim is a great example of a game

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.900
that was just hyped as shit, too.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.260
Like they pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and pushed it.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.940
And then it came out and it was good.

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:32.660
Guys, you know, in chat saying the game came out in 92, not 93 or 94.

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.980
That actually does sound right, because I remember I got in a fight

01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:35.820
with my ex-girlfriend.

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.940
I know it was a couple of years in.

01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.420
Because remember, it launched in 89.

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:42.060
So we're not talking like first Christmas or second Christmas.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.420
It'd be like the third or fourth Christmas for the console.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.220
You know, Dan, Dan, I hate to disappoint you,

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.660
but the first Sega system I ever owned was a Dreamcast.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:51.580
And even then, it was after they had slashed the price like 50 bucks.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.380
Well, I'm not surprised by that before the Dreamcast was out here.

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.180
Oh, yeah, with the Japanese, because there were like six people

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.820
who owned the master system. Yeah.

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.620
And so when the Genesis came out, it had it had a big mountain to climb.

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:07.300
But the whole thing was they kind of pulled the Sony

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:11.940
where they didn't go directly after the Nintendo consumer at first.

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.860
They went after the older gamer.

01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.020
They said, like I said, everything's a little edgier,

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.220
a little more expensive, a little bit bigger.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.980
But you're going to get the hardcore arcade games that you want.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:26.220
You're not going to get to Mario, but you will get Altered Beast.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.220
You will get Golden Axe.

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.380
You will get Revenge of Shinobi.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.900
You know, oh, yeah, that was probably the other really good launch game.

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.700
Revenge of Shinobi.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.300
Oh, Shadow Dancer. That was another great title.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.100
Yeah, Shadow Dancer, which is which is a Mega Drive or Genesis exclusive

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.660
because the arcade version is completely different.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.180
And Moonwalker. Come on.

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.660
How can I forget Moonwalker?

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.500
Oh, yeah, not a launch, but a great game.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.660
First year or maybe second year.

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.500
It's Strider. Strider.

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.060
Yeah, it was probably the first, not the first Christmas,

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.100
but the second Christmas, Christmas 90.

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:58.100
And you remember I sat down and beat it on Genesis,

01:09:58.380 --> 01:09:59.860
one of our first years together.

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.460
Actually, I think you beat it on the arcade emulator that we had.

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.860
Now, I beat it on the Genesis.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.300
I did. I was sitting on the Genesis version is easier.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.460
All right. Well, we could reminisce on Sega Genesis all night.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.860
And Dan's going to try, but we can't.

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.300
I do. I do want to move on.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.300
Let me talk about this new title.

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.460
Hey, did I tell you about something on Genesis?

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.500
So don't I have a story?

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.540
Well, that's what Nintendo shut up while I mute Dan's mic.

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:23.740
Let's move on to.

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:26.100
Hey, Jamie, tell us all about how great the Genesis is.

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:27.980
Well, how about Plants vs.

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:31.020
Zombie Garden Warfare for people?

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.900
For people who are interested in this game, it is the fans.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.300
OK, I'm done.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.540
She dropped the mic, take the mic out of his hand.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:44.540
Give me that. Oh, Dan, now I have two mics.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.340
Yes, I am. Oh, hey, leave my coffee alone.

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:55.540
Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.180
I'm going to strangle him with the cord.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.300
Do you get to play as the coffee bean in the Garden Warfare?

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:03.900
It's free, bitches.

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:06.060
It's free for a little while.

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.140
Seventy two hours worth of free on Loolergens.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.420
So go get it.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.540
And here's Dan talking about more Sega shit.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.540
You know, the plants didn't really have Plants vs.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:18.460
Zombies on Sega, but they did have Zombies Ate My Neighbors,

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.020
which had a lot of hedges.

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.420
It didn't have plants in it.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:25.220
Many, many plants and several zombies.

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:29.980
I love how Jamie literally read a story about a new game

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:32.180
that's free and neither one of you care.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.420
Is it on Sega Genesis?

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.980
No. Then it doesn't matter.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.060
Here's why I don't care.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.700
Here's why I don't care about that.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.260
It's because it's not free forever.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.540
It's just a free trial over the weekend.

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.260
Now, if it was one of those, hey, Origin, I mean,

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.140
or it's Origin giving me a free game.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:46.700
Yeah, sure. Go download it. That'd be awesome.

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:47.900
Wing Commander 3 is still free.

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.940
Yes, Wing Commander 3. Go download that.

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.140
But, you know, it's not one of those.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.660
Free trial? I don't give a shit.

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.220
So it's one of those.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.300
Isn't it a free weekend when you start it?

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.260
It's not like Steam weekends where it's between.

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.780
I thought it was like 72 hours when you download it and start it.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.460
Yeah, I still think that's how it works.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.460
All right. Anyhow, so let's travel around the world

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.700
and check out some release dates of some games that are coming out that,

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.860
sadly, they're probably not free, but you never know.

01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.700
Are they on the Genesis?

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.900
We'll cover Genesis release dates.

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.820
No, but guess what?

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.020
Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare is coming out on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4,

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.220
but that's because EA said, hey, guess what?

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:30.420
Microsoft paid for an awesome exclusive on Xbox One and Xbox 360.

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:34.900
So you guys get it six months later. Whoo!

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:38.420
So you better believe that whenever Tomb Raider comes out on PlayStation,

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.500
it's going to be probably six months later because that seems to be all their deals are.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.100
Six months comes out on the other systems.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.100
So those will be PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.780
And then Tales of Zilia 2 on PlayStation 3.

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:56.100
And finally, Diablo 3, the Ultimate Evil Edition on PlayStation 3,

01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:01.100
PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox 360.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.380
All right. Traveling over to Japan,

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.580
taking a look at the Mega Drive releases in Japan.

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:07.380
Nothing, Dan.

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.260
There's nothing coming out on the Mega Drive this week in Japan.

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.340
And Wii U releases and nothing.

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:15.020
The Mega Drive really wasn't the most successful system in Japan.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.380
Did you look at the European or the Brazilian?

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:21.020
So how about what's coming out on other systems?

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:24.500
Well, I was going to say also nothing on the Xbox 360.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.540
That actually isn't true.

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:29.020
That's usually a running joke, like Xbox 360 in Japan, ha ha ha.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:31.180
But the Xbox 360 is getting World of Tanks,

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:35.220
Xbox 360 Edition Starter Pack is out in Japan this week.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.460
So more releases than the Mega Drive.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.020
Go figure.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.260
On the PlayStation 4, a big week over there on the 21st,

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.180
Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls, Ultimate Evil,

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:47.060
and The Last of Us Remastered hitting Japan this week.

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:49.180
The Xbox One still not out in Japan,

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.260
so we don't actually have releases for that yet.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:56.020
On the PlayStation 3, Diablo 3 makes its way out there as well.

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.900
Nothing on the Wii U this week, because releases are few and far

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:00.860
between on the Wii U.

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:03.140
But the PlayStation Vita has a few games

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.100
to kind of follow up what AkumaJP said earlier.

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.220
Binary Star, Bullet Girls, and Chaos

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.060
had Duel all coming out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.740
So there are still some releases on the Vita.

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:17.620
Just one game on the 3DS this week, Tetsudo Nippon,

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:21.580
Rosa no Tabi, Kashima Orinkai Tetsudo Hen

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.820
comes out this week.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.320
I'm trying to see what that game is.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.340
It looks like it's a game about public transit,

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.940
or like transit trains.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:29.740
It's a train game.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.860
Some people love their trains in Japan.

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.660
Some people love their trains in America, too.

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:33.980
We don't get cool games like this.

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.700
Remember they used to have those big awesome controllers

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:36.580
for the train games?

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:37.500
I think they still do.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.500
They probably still do.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.140
Awesome.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.140
Yeah, and on 3DS, you'd have it on the bottom.

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.820
Isn't there like a big Shinkansen thing

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:45.300
that came out like last year?

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:45.800
Probably.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:46.420
I don't know.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.340
They don't release the really cool stuff here.

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.500
We got Railroad Tycoon, and I think I had the A train on.

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.900
No, they have a train simulator game.

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:57.740
I know it's on Steam because they have zombie DLC for it.

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.820
Don't ask me why.

01:14:58.820 --> 01:14:59.620
They have that.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.380
And then the warehouse simulator game,

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.900
they also had zombie DLC for us.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.580
What if you made like a funny typo?

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.460
Warrios.

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.500
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys,

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.060
and then the classic.

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:10.700
No.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:11.420
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.280
UK dates.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:12.940
My bad.

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:13.940
Jeez, Rob.

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.540
No one cares.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.500
You can leave.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.620
Is anything coming out on Genesis?

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.460
In the UK, it would be the Mega Drive, sir.

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:22.700
Oh, my bad.

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:26.300
On the 19th, we have Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls for PS3, Xbox

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:31.660
360, and PS4, and X-Bone, and not Genesis.

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:37.380
On the 20th, we have Counter Spy for PS4, Vita, and PS3.

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.620
Dan?

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.580
Mega Drive.

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:41.460
There, I said it.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:42.500
It's on the Mega Drive.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.260
Sweet.

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:46.220
I'm importing it.

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:48.860
On the 21st of August, we have Plants vs. Zombies,

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:52.300
Garden Warfare on Xbox 4, and I'm sorry, not Xbox 4.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.700
PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:54.980
See what you made me do?

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.420
Mega Drive.

01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.340
I'll Mega Drive the car over you.

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.300
I'll run over you with my Mega Fiat.

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:02.900
All right.

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:03.420
No.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.180
Now, just a couple more stories, and then

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.780
the classic game of the week.

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:10.140
It'll be back to Jamie, because it's all about Jamie.

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:12.780
The irony is it probably won't be a Genesis game.

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:19.180
It is actually not a Genesis game tonight, but that's OK.

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:20.860
All right, moving, because she's probably

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:23.240
done every Genesis game at one point or another.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.580
She's done a lot of Sega games.

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:25.580
Oh, shoot.

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.060
I actually fucked up, because I was

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:31.940
going to do my whole Capcom, the Qsound era games.

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.820
Yeah, you broke your own pattern.

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.540
I'm going to have to start my pattern again next week.

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:35.900
All right.

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:38.140
Well, that's OK, because the show is broke in itself

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.660
when it keeps disconnecting tonight, so it's appropriate.

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:41.620
Loki.

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:42.500
All right.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.340
Mario Kart.

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:47.020
So lots of copies have been sold.

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.940
They've surpassed $1 million in the US,

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.140
and that's a pretty amazing feat, considering they haven't

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.460
really sold that many systems.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:57.220
But Mario Kart definitely helped, so good for them.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.700
And of course, we'll see some free DLC

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:09.780
that's totally not cashing in from sponsors, but whatever.

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:13.380
I'm actually excited to see more track DLC.

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:17.060
And speaking of tracks, there's actually some cups

01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.180
that were not in the game.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:27.260
They have some unused icons, including, let's see here,

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:37.140
looks like a Yoshi egg, a star, a boo, and a blue shell.

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.060
Oh, god, I can only imagine what a blue shell

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.060
cup is going to consist of.

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:43.540
My understanding is, isn't one of the new DLCs

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.060
like Mercedes-based?

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:45.580
Yeah.

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.540
Like you get Mercedes carts?

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.700
It's coming out August 24th, I think.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.820
Where does that come from?

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.420
Just some weird type of deal.

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.700
It was in Japan first.

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:55.980
They've had it for a while.

01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:58.300
It was just some weird licensing deal they had.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.740
But I mean, who's going to be sitting there,

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.180
and they're going to be playing their Wii U,

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.420
and they're going to be going, because I could choose

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.900
a Mercedes and Mario Kart, I think

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.940
I'm going to head on down to my local Mercedes dealer

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:11.620
and take a test drive.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.740
It just doesn't seem to have a lot of synergy.

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.300
Not everyone is like you, Dan.

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:16.100
Brand awareness.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.420
It might work on me, but I mean, that's like, fuck it.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.700
I'll definitely, I mean, yeah.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.420
Dan gets out of bed going, I want to test drive a car today.

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.260
Mercedes is trying to hook them early.

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.540
They're all like, you know, when I was 10 years old,

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.780
I drove a Mercedes and Mario Kart,

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.700
and I'm semi-successful now.

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:32.780
If I actually took this seriously,

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.980
which I'm going to humor Dan and take this seriously,

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.020
I think it is a part of brand awareness.

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.260
And it may not be so much about trying to get the person

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:41.260
to go out and test drive a Mercedes

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:43.580
as it is trying to reach the person that's already

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:46.020
thinking about driving a car who may have thought,

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:47.740
I didn't think about a Mercedes,

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:50.100
but now I'm seeing it on these YouTubes

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.460
of people playing Mario Kart,

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.060
and it's just creating the awareness.

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:53.900
And-

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.740
You're a fucking idiot.

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:57.700
Fuck you, get off the channel.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:59.100
Fuck you.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.140
No, no, no.

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.340
I just don't buy that.

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.980
I just, I see the user base for the Wii U

01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:07.580
and the user base for the Mercedes Benz automobile

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:11.140
as so different that I just can't see them working together.

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.780
It's just, it's just two great tastes that don't go together.

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.220
It's just that they paid them money

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.540
to put it in their game.

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:19.460
I know.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.980
That's all it was because they're like, we need money.

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.220
Right, no, no, no, I'm not saying Nintendo,

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:25.180
yeah, that's why, that's exactly what I'm getting at.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.020
How did this go?

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:26.860
You know what?

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:27.900
Nintendo doesn't do anything for free.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:28.740
I want to see Trojan-

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:29.820
Oh my God, Rob.

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.660
I didn't, I don't, you're not really an idiot.

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:33.380
I want to see Trojan condoms,

01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.420
pay them a lot of money to put some DLC in,

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:37.300
like, I don't know, Mario Kart, why not?

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.140
Let's do that.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.100
Dude, that would be awesome.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.460
There could be a condom power up.

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.980
It covers you up and you're protected from everything

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.340
until it wears off.

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.620
Dan, you could have the Mercedes and Mario Kart,

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.020
or you can have Yaris.

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.860
Yaris probably made more sense.

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:54.860
Because it's a cheap-

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.380
Are you really right now?

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.500
Yes, yes, and I'll tell you why.

01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.060
First of all, Yaris is a bootsy game,

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.260
so I'm not trying to endorse that you,

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:04.340
well, you can't download it, but okay.

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.060
Yaris was a cheapy little car

01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:09.460
that's going to be geared towards 20-somethings

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.380
who are probably sitting on their fucking couch

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:12.900
playing Xbox 360.

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.460
Do I think for a second that Yaris sold Toyota any cars?

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.860
No.

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:19.420
But I'm sure, you know,

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:21.420
it's not as if Mercedes came out and said,

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:22.980
you know who we're going after?

01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.020
We're going after Gran Turismo players.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.220
Well, here's the thing, too, though.

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.220
When, like, I was looking for a car

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:30.700
and I was looking for some affordable cars and stuff,

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:33.260
I was like, oh, hey, cheap car, it's a Yaris.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.780
Let me see what that's about, you know?

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:35.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.300
Not saying that I was going to buy it,

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.780
but it's like, it's made it stand out

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.860
like a fraction of a percent more than, like, say,

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.700
you know, I don't know.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.300
Well, and unless I'm completely off base

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:52.140
onto what the common user of the Wii U is,

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:56.420
apparently it's an affluent, you know, 40 to 50-something

01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:58.180
that's making six figures.

01:20:58.180 --> 01:20:59.380
Because that's, well, no,

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:02.820
because I guess there is a $40,000 Mercedes out there now.

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.260
Maybe that's the whole idea.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.420
Maybe they're trying to say,

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:08.420
hey, you're 23 years old and you're sitting at home

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:12.220
playing a game for 12-year-olds, come buy a Mercedes.

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.060
You get a used Mercedes?

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.820
No, I'm sure, yeah, I'm sure it's got like an 83,

01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:20.140
you know, diesel piece of shit Mercedes

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.620
that you can drive in the game.

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.060
They do have the old class.

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:25.940
Mario's like sticking out of the hood, you know, fuck.

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:26.980
They do have, like,

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.860
was it some of the classic Mercedes in there?

01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.860
Like, they have the classic, I forget,

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.580
the one that's like the monopoly car in the game.

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:34.420
Right.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:35.260
And...

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:36.620
Yeah, it's only like, yeah.

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:39.300
And it's more expensive than any new Mercedes.

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.580
Yeah.

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.740
The SLR McLaren, you know.

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:45.900
Let's see, I was gonna see exactly

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.060
which cars were in there.

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:48.900
It would all make more sense to me

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:52.940
if it was like Mercedes free download pack for Forza 5.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.100
Let's see, it was...

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:01.820
The 1957 300 SL Roadster,

01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:05.060
the 1934 W25 Silver Arrow,

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:10.060
and let's see, the new compact SUV.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.340
The GLA.

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:14.420
I was thinking, hey, maybe it's not such a cash-in.

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.340
Maybe they're just gonna put some cute cars in there

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:17.180
as some sort of freebie.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:18.020
Then it's like, oh yeah,

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:21.420
and the new compact Mercedes SUV.

01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.020
All right.

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:24.060
For time, I gotta move on.

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:25.300
I wanna hit one more story here

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:26.820
before we get to the classic game of the week,

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:30.580
which has no add-on car DLC that I know of, but we'll see.

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:32.980
You guys all know about what went down on Twitch last week.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:33.940
We talked about that,

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.300
and I'm sure a lot of your favorite podcasts

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.420
have been talking about the controversy happening at Twitch.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.820
Well, a little bit of irony on this story.

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.180
Twitch seems to have expanded

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:45.180
into more live streaming demonstrations,

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.500
I suppose, for lack of a better term, for electronic music.

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:52.020
Porter Robinson released a new album this past week, Worlds,

01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:55.900
and he had a Twitch stream that ran this thing

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.180
where he hung out with fans

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.260
and talked about the video games that inspired the tracks

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:01.140
and showed the recording studio and so forth.

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.140
So it was a little weird because I guess it was about games

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:04.420
because he talked about video games,

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:09.420
but yet it was this album promotion for copyrighted music.

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:15.140
So I don't know if the archives got bleeped or whatever.

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:15.980
I don't know.

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:17.820
But this isn't the first time this has happened either.

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.580
There's, let's see, Mad Descent,

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:23.380
who is the label behind Diplo, Dylan Francis.

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:24.460
They did a Twitch channel.

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.300
Diplo.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.140
Is it Diplo?

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:28.900
Sorry, you can tell how much I listen to these artists.

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:30.540
They did a Twitch channel

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:32.500
where the folks are talking with fans.

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:35.500
And Darude, I know Darude, they did the after party.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.860
Remember Sandstorm?

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:39.340
That's my excuse to play Darude right now.

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:43.260
So anyway, interesting that this is some territory

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.100
that they're getting into

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.620
because it's not really directly about video games

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.700
and it's barking up the tree

01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:52.180
of something that they really cut back on last week.

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.260
So, I don't know.

01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:56.980
It's a little hypocritical actually.

01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:57.820
A little bit?

01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:58.660
A little bit.

01:23:58.660 --> 01:23:59.500
Why do you think?

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:00.340
Because they're like,

01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:02.020
no, you can't play copyright music.

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.100
We're gonna play copyright music.

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:03.940
That's right.

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:04.940
That's our job to play copyright music.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.300
But is it the copyright holder

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.500
playing the copyrighted music?

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.580
I would assume so in this case

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:10.060
because it's the record label doing it.

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:10.900
But-

01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:11.740
Then it's a little different.

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.940
But when you're using an all automated system

01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:16.060
to bleep things, I wonder if that matters.

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:18.460
Because we've seen cases on YouTube anyway.

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:20.300
I mean, I guess I am doing apples to oranges,

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.940
but if it's to be believed that YouTube's gonna buy Twitch,

01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.460
I think it's a fair comparison.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:28.660
YouTube has dropped video and copyright striked

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:30.340
like people that hold the IP.

01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:34.940
Like game creators whose soundtracks get flagged

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.660
from whoever owns that.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.980
It gets their whole damn movie flagged.

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.820
Right.

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.700
Well, they kind of backed off on that a little bit.

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:45.220
It was really bad about a year back.

01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:47.180
I think that Twitch is fantastic.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.620
And I mean, I haven't really followed

01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:50.340
their recent troubles.

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:53.260
I know that they just dropped the whole Justin TV label.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.980
But I think that for gamers,

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:59.980
Twitch is literally the validation of the hobby.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.560
It's an entire network.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.140
You can watch pretty much any game that you'd wanna watch.

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:07.300
You can stream any game that you'd like to stream

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.900
and try to get watchers.

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:13.060
But I can also see how if it's not already

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:14.900
being perverted terribly,

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:18.340
how it can be just perverted terribly and ruined in a second

01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:21.240
as any good idea does when you involve humanity.

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:23.800
All right.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.820
On that note, let's talk about

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:28.160
other of humanity's perverted ideas

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.660
in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.460
Dark Soccer's gonna take a step into the vault

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:34.300
and find a game that she thinks,

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.780
hey, you kids should be playing this game.

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.580
I don't know why you're not playing this game.

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:40.820
Actually, a lot of you have probably played this game.

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:41.940
But remember this game?

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:42.760
Yep.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.600
It's cool.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.440
Dark Soccer.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.420
And it actually is old.

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:46.260
It is old.

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:47.620
And I kind of looked at this going,

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.060
oh my God, this game is that old?

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.140
And yes it is.

01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:52.340
Dark Soccer, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.260
It's Bejeweled.

01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:55.080
Bejeweled.

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:55.920
Because it's old.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:56.740
It is.

01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.620
Came out in 2001 and it was,

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.980
I think this is the first solely browser game

01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:04.380
I've ever done as well.

01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:06.780
So we're definitely getting into the internet age with this.

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.620
Possibly.

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:10.460
But basically it's a puzzle game created by PopCap.

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:15.460
It started off as a web-based flash game called Diamond Mine

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.420
that was inspired by a game called Shariki.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:25.380
Basically, you just have to match up three gems in a row

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.820
and you can get more than that.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.700
It's kind of like the Columns thing too, right Dan?

01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.500
Columns, Sega.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:33.820
All I'm going to say is for the record,

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:36.060
I would be shocked if there's not a Sega Genesis version

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:36.960
of this out there.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.580
Columns.

01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:40.940
Columns is not the same.

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.220
I know, but still.

01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:47.100
But anyway, the game, it's basically just so simple

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:49.260
and kind of stupid and addicting,

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:53.060
but we now have so many different versions of Bejeweled

01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:56.180
and it's been on fucking everything.

01:26:56.220 --> 01:27:00.140
So basically, Bejeweled was actually created by,

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:03.140
the name came up by Microsoft who thought

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.420
that Diamond Mine was too similar to another game

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:08.140
called Diamond Mines as far as the name.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.140
So basically it's been everywhere.

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:13.280
It's been on Windows where it was Bejeweled Deluxe

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.300
and it was on iOS.

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.880
It's been on old PDAs like the Blackberry, the iPhone,

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.740
Palm OS, Windows Mobile Smartphone Platforms.

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:23.560
It's been on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.240
It was one of the first downloadable games

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.180
for the iTunes store on the iPod.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.380
I had it on my old flip phone.

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:35.640
I won't say anything about how often I played that game,

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.760
but I had it.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.980
It's been on the Chrome Web Store for free.

01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:41.680
There's an HD iPad version.

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.400
And basically it's also, I think,

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.680
what has led up to the popularity of such games

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.340
such as Candy Crush Saga.

01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.300
And other similar type of puzzle games.

01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:58.740
Although, you know, this game probably wouldn't exist

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:03.740
if it wasn't for its precursors like Columns, Puyo Puyo.

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:09.140
What was that one that Julie liked, Dan?

01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:10.180
Magical Drop.

01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:11.340
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:12.340
I like Magical Drop.

01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:15.320
All kinds of just the little puzzle games like this

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.020
that are, and the thing is,

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:21.860
the concept behind the game is really easy.

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:27.100
However, it just gets complicated,

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.980
especially now that they've got these multiple versions of it

01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:31.180
because I've been playing a whole crap ton

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.460
of Bejeweled 3 lately,

01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:36.060
which is just Bejeweled on iOS right now.

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:39.500
Like the butterfly mode I'm addicted to, diamond.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.700
There's actually a mode called Diamond Mine

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:46.100
that's like groundbreaking using the gems and everything.

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.180
It's pretty interesting.

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:49.180
But basically you just have to swap one gem

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:52.180
with one adjacent to form a horizontal

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:54.700
or vertical chain of three or more.

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:56.820
And then you can cause chain reactions,

01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:59.060
basically where they will cascade effect

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:02.780
and break many more and you get more points and stuff.

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:05.740
So you've got in the original, there were two versions.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:09.340
There was normal where every match would fill a bar

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.580
and then a level would be complete.

01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:13.540
And that's classic mode in some of the newer versions.

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:16.700
When you were out of moves, it was game over.

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.380
Matching four or five or six

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.740
was just still a regular thing.

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:24.820
You didn't get the special gems until Bejeweled 2 forward.

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:27.740
There was time trial where the bar would start

01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:29.060
halfway through the middle

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:31.100
and the level would complete when the bar is full

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:33.220
and over time the bar would decrease.

01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:35.180
So basically you're fighting the bar

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.660
to see how well you're gonna do.

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.780
And that's really it.

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:42.140
You know, you can actually still visit

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:46.940
the original Bejeweled Flash version and play it online.

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.820
So.

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:51.820
I used to play the crap out of Bejeweled on MSN zone.

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.660
How old is that?

01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:58.060
Let's see, 2001, you know,

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:02.420
I had barely been living out here only two years.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.660
Been out here for like two or three years.

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:07.540
About two years, so yeah.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.500
I'm just gonna go ahead and put a caveat out there.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.260
Bejeweled is not in the vault.

01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:14.620
Bejeweled will never be in the vault.

01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:15.460
Bejeweled is not a game.

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.460
It technically is, because I have a box for Bejeweled 2.

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.380
Technically we don't have a vault.

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:23.340
By the way, the vault's been disassembled for years.

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.900
But it lives on in-

01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:26.740
In my mind.

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:27.740
Yes, exactly.

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:29.580
All right, there it is, a classic game of the week.

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:30.620
It's very small.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:32.580
But jeweled.

01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:34.700
And some folks in chat asking like,

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.860
what up G says, how old is considered classic?

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:40.020
And the rule here at OLR is 10 or more years old.

01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:41.420
Which is, that's a decade old.

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:43.900
And yep, 13 years for Bejeweled, so.

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.060
I think classic should be pre-2000.

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.860
Well, what's funny is that when we changed the rule

01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:53.100
to be 10 or more years, it was about 2001, 2002

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:54.860
for how far back we were going.

01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:56.460
So it's just like, we're still moving forward.

01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:59.500
Not that I would say that Bejeweled is not a classic game.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.260
I mean, it's been played by 11 gajillion people.

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:03.100
Right.

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.260
Just, you know, because there's no-

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.340
You're just pissed it wasn't a Genesis game.

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:08.300
Oh, fuck you.

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:12.180
You know, you know there's a homebrew of Bejeweled

01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.260
on the Genesis.

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.940
You know it exists.

01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:16.740
And Bobby still keeps wanting me to do Halo

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.340
for classic game and I'm not gonna.

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.180
All right.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:20.020
Ooh.

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:23.820
We, part of the reason we changed the rules

01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.860
so that we could throw in Dreamcast games and-

01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:26.700
Yes.

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:27.540
And GameCube.

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:28.360
Yes.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.200
All right.

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.540
Dreamcast shit came out in 99.

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.380
Right.

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:32.220
Right.

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.620
But some of the other games I've covered

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:36.180
have been out in the 2000s.

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:38.100
Maybe classic is everything older

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.180
than the current generation.

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:40.020
Maybe classic is-

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:44.020
Maybe classic is two generations old.

01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:44.860
All right.

01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:45.680
Well, anyway.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.520
So it can't be PS2, but it can be PS1.

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.580
When you come to the show regularly you'll have-

01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:51.260
I guess it could be PS2, but it can't be PS3.

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.100
Dan, let it go.

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:52.920
All right.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.760
Moving on.

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:54.580
Right, Dan, you're right.

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:55.420
Well, no, you asked.

01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:57.900
Somebody asked and I was answering the fucking question.

01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.720
You're screwing up your own show.

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:01.820
How dare you?

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:03.860
Every gamer gets a voice.

01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.700
Well, I was answering the question.

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:06.900
I was answering the question.

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.020
Besides you guys' wishy washy.

01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.340
Besides you guys' wishy washy.

01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:12.060
Oh, maybe 10 years.

01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.020
Maybe as old as Jamie says it is.

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:15.760
All right.

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.540
Look, we're going to take a break.

01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:18.940
Calm down a little bit here.

01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:20.660
We'll be back with more of Orange Lawn's Radio

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.100
after a quick break here.

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:24.140
Your emails, Frugal Question of the Week,

01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:25.420
Rapid Fire News, and much more.

01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:27.300
We come back with more of Orange Lawn's Radio

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.140
right after this.

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.220
And more Sega Genesis.

01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:34.220
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live

01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:44.860
on this, let's see, it is August the 17th of 2014.

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.260
564 episodes down of Orange Lawn Show.

01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:50.340
Actually, this is 564 in progress.

01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:54.820
So anyhow, over there, I noticed in the corner,

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.680
Loki is showing Dan Goat Simulator for the first time.

01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.700
Is that what's happening over there?

01:32:59.140 --> 01:32:59.980
Because I hear Dan going over there.

01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.140
Yeah, showing him Goat Simulator.

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.740
That goat just got so goddamn simulated by that car.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.320
Good times.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.160
Good times.

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.060
All right, well, we are going to go over

01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:09.020
some rapid fire news.

01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:10.620
I hate to break into the Goat Simulator,

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.860
but we still have a lot of show to cover,

01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:13.580
and we're running behind tonight a little bit

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:15.700
thanks to live difficulties.

01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:18.140
But I appreciate you guys sticking with us here live.

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:19.780
Again, we do tape live at The Voice of the East Network,

01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:23.100
vognetwork.com, Sunday nights at six Pacific, nine Eastern.

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.860
Usually there's not so many fricking drops and stream issues.

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:27.660
But of course, if you do miss us live,

01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:29.900
you can always check out the podcast feed,

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:33.760
which is available on your favorite podcast app.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.600
Loki.

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:37.340
Hold on, Goat Simulator's being glitchy like,

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.720
I know, shocking, Goat Simulator glitchy?

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.000
What?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.540
Had to force quit this thing,

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.460
because it's all main menu.

01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.340
Nope, main menu.

01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.340
Nope, main menu.

01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.180
Nope.

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.920
So anyways, okay.

01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:54.260
All right, let's do this.

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:57.060
Okay, so hey, this is pretty cool.

01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.780
If you're a fan of shmup games,

01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:02.220
the creator of Ikaruga has a brand new game

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:05.380
coming to PlayStation 4 called Ubusana,

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:08.980
and that is literally all we know about it.

01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:11.460
He apparently talked about it on his blog,

01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:13.820
and mentioned that it's gonna be a downloadable title

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:15.300
on PlayStation 4.

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:16.500
You know where the creator of Ikaruga

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.940
got their start, by the way?

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:19.880
Genesis.

01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:21.700
Of course.

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:22.540
Okay.

01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:27.200
So that's all we know so far, unfortunately.

01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:31.980
And then, during the Microsoft conference,

01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:34.420
they actually announced that they're gonna be doing

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:38.520
an exclusive Xbox One bundle with Call of Duty,

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:42.240
and it's gonna have kind of a skin system, skin controller,

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:45.500
a digital download of Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare,

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:48.480
and a one terabyte hard drive,

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.980
and it's also gonna be $499,

01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:53.740
to which I say, why the fuck would I buy that

01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:57.420
when I can buy the Sunset Overdrive one for $399,

01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:00.060
and hell, if I really wanted to add some additional space,

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:02.580
it would cost a hell lot less than $100.

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.540
But I guess then I would get Call of Duty 2.

01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.380
Whatever.

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.780
But yeah, if you're interested,

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:11.660
that'll be coming out launch for,

01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:14.220
well, it'd be now on the third,

01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:16.820
because they're doing that Day Zero edition.

01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:18.060
Whoopty shit.

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.780
And then, last but not least,

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:24.820
Meta Knight is confirmed now for the new Smash Bros. game.

01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.260
Did you say Meta Knight?

01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:27.780
Meta Knight.

01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.860
Okay, because I didn't think they had

01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:31.560
much to do with video games.

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.200
You know, it's not part of their lifestyle,

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.740
and they are not the Amish, hello, they're different.

01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.700
Yeah, so Meta Knight, he will be coming,

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:44.700
and I wish they just would talk about new characters,

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.380
not old characters coming back, to be honest.

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:49.740
And just do it all at once,

01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:53.100
instead of like, one character now,

01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:55.060
another character now, another character,

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.660
I mean, we're only like,

01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.940
about six weeks away from the launch, just.

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.560
I kinda like when there's some surprises still in the game,

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.940
although I guess in this internet age,

01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:05.560
the surprises never last long, but.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.380
True, but hopefully there'll be some unlockable characters,

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:12.500
like Rob was last time, I mean, I thought that was cool.

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.780
What's so cool on Melee, when you unlock characters,

01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:16.620
and you have no fucking idea who they were.

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:20.020
You're all like, who the hell is this guy?

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:21.460
Oh, he's kinda awesome.

01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:23.500
Are they ever gonna confirm Ness?

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:24.340
That's the one.

01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:26.900
Let's go buy all of the Fire Emblem games.

01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:28.420
It's been in every single game,

01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:29.800
I don't think they're gonna take him out.

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:30.640
You never know.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:31.780
It'd be funny though, like, they have, you know,

01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:33.900
they do it like Melee, where they show the, you know,

01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:37.180
silhouette, and it's like, your sweetest Ness is like,

01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:38.980
haha, fuck you, you ain't getting Ness,

01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:41.540
and there's mother is never gonna fucking come

01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:43.340
to this console ever again, so.

01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.160
All right, well, I have a few stories for you guys here,

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:48.360
starting off with a game I'm sure y'all are very excited

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.920
about, Just Dance 2015, right Dan?

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.240
Big fan of this series, right?

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.640
Not on Sega Genesis.

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.160
Just Dance 2015 will be out on the Wii and the Wii U,

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.280
that's right, the original Wii is still there.

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.160
Let's see, it's also on, it's on everything, honestly.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.880
And it has some new songs that were announced

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.680
at Gamescom this week, including,

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.080
and I know Dan is a big fan of all these artists,

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:14.320
4x4 by Miley Cyrus, Ain't No Mountain High Enough

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.560
by Marvin Gaye, that's actually kinda cool.

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.640
That's cool.

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:20.160
Let's see, Macarena by The Girly Team,

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:21.320
so it's not just the Macarena,

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.760
it's a girly team cover of the Macarena.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.080
Yeah, it's not by the original couple Macarena guys,

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.840
it just ain't the Macarena.

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.800
You Spin Me Round, like a record by Dead or Alive, which.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.640
You're damn right.

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.220
That song's pretty fucking rad.

01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:37.400
And last but not least, Best Song Ever by One Direction,

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.720
which I do not actually believe is the best song ever,

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.600
that is a lie.

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.120
The test revealed, that is a lie.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:46.960
Moving on.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.040
Wait, it says something about Shenmue up there.

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.120
That's right, because this next thing is about Shenmue.

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.780
Oh my God, that's why Sega.

01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:55.280
How about an HD remake of Shenmue?

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:59.180
That's right, an HD remake of Shenmue is happening.

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.320
But here's the catch, it's happening by fans.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.880
It is not actually something that is Sega endorsed,

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.440
which makes me question if it will actually happen at all.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.160
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and put a no on that.

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:13.600
See how fast this gets shut down.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.120
But anyway, there's some YouTubes up there.

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.920
The creator, Nkun Kid, is using the original

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.400
background modeling that was in Shenmue, but new textures.

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.920
And the model for Ryo Hazuki is taken from

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:30.240
the Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.200
So, kinda interesting how they're doing that.

01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.440
So if you wanna see more, you can go to YouTube for that

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.080
for the fan-made HD Shenmue remake.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.560
Which in our chat room, we have Fifth Dream saying,

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:44.720
fuck yes, fuck yes, fuck no, God damn it.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.640
No, that was like awesome for like 20 seconds.

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.960
I was like, this is the best day, no.

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:52.520
Yu Suzuki is gonna find that guy and kick him in the head.

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.880
Yu Suzuki, by the way, still has every intention

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:57.980
of finishing Shenmue, he just needs fat cash.

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.480
Black Wolf in chat says, the fans are going to Sega

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:03.040
saying, hey mister, wanna wrestle?

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.800
And Sega will be like, yes, okay, you're dead.

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.560
Fifth Dream in chat says,

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.040
know where I can find a lawsuit around here?

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.240
All right.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.960
Why doesn't Sega like Kickstarter, Shenmue 3?

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.800
Because if they don't wanna spend...

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.420
When Sega goes to Kickstarter, they're gonna be like,

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:22.000
you're fucking Sega, you don't eat Kickstarter.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.400
But they make the money on it.

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.280
Well, cause the problem is that Sega can't afford

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:29.440
to bankroll a game that's gonna cost like $40 million.

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.000
Maybe if they stretched out his legs a little longer,

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.960
he might be viable as a character for these new consoles.

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.080
Like if Sega were to launch a Kickstarter like that though,

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.440
I'd be like, seriously?

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.400
Maybe Yu Suzuki should just do it himself.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.360
How about where the fuck is Phantasy Star Online 2

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.680
in the US already?

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.040
Oh yeah, well fuck that.

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:48.920
Yeah, fuck that.

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.680
All right, well, I guess I could always play this MMO.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.880
As I mentioned earlier in the show,

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.620
World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor

01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.080
had its release date revealed,

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:59.640
which is November 13th, 2014 is the day it's coming out.

01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.160
And if you're interested in getting the collector's edition,

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:04.040
you can pick that up for,

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:05.600
now the official price hasn't been announced,

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.920
but Amazon and GameStop are showing it at $90,

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.440
which seems to be accurate.

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:10.720
And-

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:13.120
Survey says ding, ding, ding, ding.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.420
This is, I believe,

01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:15.540
I don't know about the collector's edition,

01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:17.720
but I know the retail was supposed to be $10 more

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:18.880
than it has been in the past.

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.800
And I'm kind of sitting here going, for what?

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:24.860
But anyhow, some of the things that you can get

01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:25.960
in the collector's edition,

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.640
you get the physical DVD version of the expansion.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.400
Those are collector's items these days.

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.480
A behind the scenes DVD and Blu-ray two disc set

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.680
that gives you some commentary and interviews

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.580
that you'll never watch.

01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:39.600
The soundtrack, you get the soundtrack on CD.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.700
That's pretty cool.

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.920
You get an art book for your coffee table

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:45.280
with 160 page art book.

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.560
It's something that you put in the computer

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.000
and then rip to your iTunes

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.280
or whatever your music thing of choice.

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.960
You get a mouse pad because every collector's edition

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.380
has had a stinking mouse pad with it.

01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:56.640
This one featuring the Warlord Blackhand.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.680
And some things you get in the game itself,

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:01.840
a Dread Raven Mount and a Dread Hatchling pet,

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:02.680
excuse me.

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:05.280
And you get portraits for Starcraft two,

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.160
Warsong Pennant for Diablo three

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.640
and a card back for Hearthstone

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.780
because we love that Blizzard synergy.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.740
How about give us a good game?

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.840
I, well, it's not that I-

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.960
And it all comes in an oversized box.

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.080
That'll take up a lot of room on your shelf.

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:22.900
That's right.

01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:23.740
I don't know.

01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.280
I don't want to say that World of Warcraft is a bad game

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:27.240
because I've spent years of my life playing it

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.080
and having a good time.

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.640
The right people will always make a game fun, I think.

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.800
But it's just one of those things where it's like,

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.680
I just really disagree with the direction

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:36.860
the game's been going in lately

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:38.540
and the way they've been pacing content,

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:39.760
which is not at all.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.400
But anyway, I can do a whole nother rant on this

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:46.260
and I probably will on this week's courthouse.

01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:47.760
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:50.400
Well, for people who have been paying attention

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.960
to Mortal Kombat X, Kano has been teased now.

01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.160
There was a trailer acquired by Eurogamer Portugal

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:02.080
who said that there were three different versions

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.280
of Kano to be seen.

01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:05.640
One is a cutthroat version

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:08.000
that allows him to power up his knife attacks

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.140
with his cybernetic heart.

01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:12.820
Then there's a full cybernetic version

01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:14.360
that gives him a bunch of weaponry

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:18.120
and then the commando variation where he becomes a grappler.

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.340
So I don't know how I feel about that.

01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:21.520
There's also a jungle stage

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:24.480
because every Mortal Kombat has a stage with trees.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.920
They're probably evil.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.120
And then there is going to be a Super Smash Brothers,

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.640
a 3DS bundle that will be out October 3rd.

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:38.160
It is red with all the characters on the cover

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:42.240
and black and white or very, very grayscale,

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:44.960
you know, pick renditions of the characters

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:49.320
over a red background with red and black lettering.

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:52.840
And it's a limited edition as they all are.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:57.520
And it comes with it installed on a 3DS XL

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:02.160
so that you won't actually have a physical copy of it at all.

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:06.720
Also, last but not least,

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:08.760
Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.360
and Ground Zeroes are coming to Steam.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.680
So, good.

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.240
Oh, nice.

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.240
That's kind of cool.

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.360
We get to play the Phantom trailer.

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.720
Nice.

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:25.800
All right, let's do the FUGL question of the week.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:26.640
Every week here on the show,

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:28.080
you take Facebook and Google Plus

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.160
and slam them together and you get FUGL.

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:40.240
This week, our question had to do with demos,

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.960
since I know PT was on our minds,

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:44.160
which we talked about earlier in the show.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.760
So we asked our communities,

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:49.040
when was the last time you got really hyped for a game demo?

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:52.520
Did you ever buy something else just to get a demo

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.240
of a game you were really looking forward to?

01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:57.440
So let's start on Facebook tonight with Tech 2030,

01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.040
who says, back in 07,

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.840
I bought Crackdown just to play the Halo 3 beta

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:04.960
and I ended up liking Crackdown better than Halo 3.

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.040
I don't think you were the only one in that case.

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.000
Alan Alchemy said, let's get this one out of the way.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
The Omega hyped Final Fantasy 7 demo

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.640
that came with Square Fighter Tow Ball number one.

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:16.480
Yes.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.640
And yes, I did buy it for that reason.

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:20.760
Though, to be fair, Tow Ball number one and Einhander

01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:22.840
are the two top abandoned Square franchises

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:23.680
I'd wish to come back to.

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.920
Aw, Einhander.

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.440
Tow Ball number two wasn't that bad.

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.760
They came with a demo as well.

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.960
I thought the Tow Ball games were actually really cool.

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:35.800
DJ Rama S kind of chimed in there with a nice hearty yass

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:37.720
to agree with that comment saying,

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.040
I bought Tow Ball number one

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.680
just to get the Final Fantasy 7 demo.

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:41.880
Worth it.

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:43.200
DarkTetsuya said three

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.000
for the Tow Ball and Final Fantasy 7 demo.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.280
Also want to add the official PlayStation magazine's

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:51.440
Metal Gear Solid 1 demo blew my mind back in 1998.

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.720
Ah, he stole my answer.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.400
That was, I remember when that was PlayStation magazine.

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.840
That demo blew my fucking mind when I was younger.

01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:59.720
What about Zone of the Enders?

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.720
I don't remember that playing that demo.

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.560
That came with the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo.

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:04.720
Do you remember what the demo

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.920
that came with Final Fantasy 7 was?

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.360
That came with Final Fantasy 7?

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.200
No demo came with Final Fantasy 7.

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:10.840
There was Musashi Den.

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:11.680
No.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.520
Didn't it come with?

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:13.360
That had the demo for eight.

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:16.360
That was it, that was the reverse.

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.520
It was already like three or four discs.

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:20.280
Where were they going to put the demo?

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.280
Up your butt.

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.120
Robert K. said-

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:24.280
I don't think that would have had the proper effect.

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:25.800
Robert K. starts his answer with,

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:28.880
after being a staunch Sega fan boy,

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:30.800
does he have your attention, Dan?

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:33.680
The Tomb Raider 2 demo that came with PlayStation magazine

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.120
made me buy a PlayStation just to play it.

01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.400
Yeah, see, see what happened?

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:38.240
See what happened?

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:39.480
Sony stole that shit.

01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:41.400
Bonus Sega answer,

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:43.680
reserving a copy of the Sega magazine

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:44.880
just for Christmas nights.

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.680
I miss magazine demos.

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:49.080
Christmas nights came with like every magazine too.

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.280
I think I probably had like three copies.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.120
Although-

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:52.960
We only got one left.

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.160
Keep in mind, Robert K.'s overseas.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.480
Robert K., you the man.

01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.760
We have a Japanese one too.

01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:59.840
Overseas, they appreciate Sega.

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:01.840
In Europe, they fucking love Sega.

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:02.680
They love it.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.520
Nintendo was an afterthought in Europe.

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:05.720
You know what else they love in Europe?

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:07.040
Commodore 64.

01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:08.880
Commodore 64 is really neato.

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.400
You know what else they love in Europe?

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.240
What?

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:13.200
Marmite.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.160
No, no, no.

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:15.240
That's in Australia.

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:16.080
Moving on.

01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:16.920
That's Vegemite.

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:17.760
You think Vegemite.

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:18.600
All right.

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.000
Fuck you.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.720
Degenerate Johnny says,

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:23.840
back in the mid-90s, I subscribed to PC Gamer,

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:26.040
which came with PC demos almost every issue.

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:27.400
Although some demos were quite good,

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:28.240
none of them excited me

01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:31.000
more than the Aliens vs. Predator PC demo.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.600
As the player, you were offered the option

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:33.480
to play through the demo

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:35.480
as either the Marine, Alien, or Predator.

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:36.560
It came out during the time

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.640
in which AVP hype was at its highest.

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.520
To this day, the demo and the game

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.480
rank quite high amongst my favorite FPSs.

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:44.440
Andy R said,

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:45.880
I bought the Dragon Quest game

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:48.320
that came with the Final Fantasy 12 demo on it.

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.240
It was eight, wasn't it?

01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.080
It came with the 12 demo.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:50.920
I think it was.

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:55.400
Now, Alan decided to throw in two more answers here.

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:56.640
He's hogging the segment tonight,

01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:57.480
but I will mention this

01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.320
because he says,

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.320
Brave Fencer Musashi for Final Fantasy 8.

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.520
So that was the other one there.

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:06.040
So, and Jason, our buddy VXJ6V,

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:07.880
replied to that with a little up arrow saying,

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.160
yep, Final Fantasy 8.

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.600
I also remember being hyped

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:11.920
to play the Final Fantasy 8 demo,

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.840
though not owning a PlayStation at the time

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:15.680
meant I had to play it at a friend's house.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.640
The Halo 3 demo included with Crackdown

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:18.960
is the only other one that comes to mind.

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:22.360
Plus, Crackdown was an amazing game on its own.

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.200
Let's check out some of the answers from Google Plus,

01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.120
because believe it or not,

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:25.960
there's people on Google Plus.

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:26.880
Actually, we have quite a few answers

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.680
on Google Plus tonight.

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:30.880
Now, as part of the article,

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.600
I linked my YouTube,

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:34.760
where I did my playthrough of the PT demo,

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.240
which also got some response,

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.720
as Renee from Google Plus,

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.240
Renee Y.

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:40.080
We love her.

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.120
DNL from the DDR Freak days, if I remember right.

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:43.960
Renee said,

01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:46.720
loved watching Sky get scared witless during the stream.

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:49.240
I haven't been so hyped since Silent Hill 3, honestly,

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:51.520
but did anyone else feel like PT was a scarier

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:53.560
but less thought out Stanley parable?

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.120
Like some puzzles were too hard

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:56.980
while others were really obvious.

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:00.480
ActDeft replied and said,

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:02.800
I remember buying the official PlayStation magazine

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:06.600
just to get a demo disc with the DDR Max 1 US demo.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.480
I played that demo disc a lot.

01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.320
Curiously enough,

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.400
the featured game in the demo disc was Sly Cooper,

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.840
which I didn't know about back then.

01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:14.000
And when I played it,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.200
got really hyped for the game

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.840
and a bit of a fan of the series since.

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.320
Flaco Jones replies,

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.060
my mind goes to the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo

01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:23.680
that was bundled in with Zone of the Enders

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.520
on PlayStation 2.

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.360
You're damn right.

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:27.060
It was fantastic and better yet,

01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:29.080
it was based on the Japanese version,

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:30.600
which ended up being a little racier

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.640
and more fun than the eventual opening level

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.320
in the finalized American version.

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.720
We drove all the way down to San Francisco

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.660
to buy the import of Zone of the Enders

01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.920
so we can get the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo.

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:43.920
That's pretty hot.

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:44.920
Redertainment says,

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.240
the only time I've bought a game

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:47.400
to get a demo for another game

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.740
is when I bought Dragon Quest 8

01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:50.640
to get the demo for Final Fantasy 12.

01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.480
This is the only time I've done something like this,

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:55.320
including things like seeing movies to see a trailer,

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.000
watching a TV show to see something for another show,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.640
or paying for a concert to see an opening act.

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:01.760
Last but not least,

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.080
I think this is Brozime,

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.800
but it could be Brozime,

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:08.660
but I'm gonna guess Brozime replies and says,

01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:11.260
I've never purposely bought a game for a demo,

01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:13.120
but I do remember being quite happy

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.440
when I was told by a friend my copy of Crackdown

01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.960
had the Halo 3 demo with it.

01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.680
So it seems like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:20.280
seems to be the most popular answer.

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:24.000
Anybody in studio, open forum on this answer,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.760
especially if you can think of one that hasn't been named yet

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.800
demo and game combo.

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:31.320
There was one that,

01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.620
a demo that got me excited for the game,

01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:36.460
even though I didn't go out of my way to get the demo.

01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:38.560
And that was for Jumping Flash,

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.420
right when the PlayStation was new.

01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:44.460
And I just remember playing that one level of Jumping Flash

01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:47.460
on the demo over and over and over and over.

01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:50.380
And then I actually went on purpose and got,

01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.220
I paid like a buck because I could,

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:56.340
to get the demo version for Um Jammer Lamy.

01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.180
Before.

01:49:57.180 --> 01:49:58.180
Oh yeah, that's an awesome demo.

01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:00.300
Cause it's got a lot of like weird content on it.

01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:02.220
Yeah, and it basically has all of the music

01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:03.060
in the game on it.

01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:04.580
And it's just sort of locked out.

01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:05.740
So it's weird.

01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.180
So I ripped all the music from the game.

01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:11.140
Well didn't it have like the change stuff

01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:12.820
from when she dies?

01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:15.700
Yeah, it had like the rap about being in hell

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:18.940
and everything for the Chop Chop Master Onion.

01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:20.260
The Zoe,

01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:22.980
the Zoe Metal Gear Solid 2 demo is the ultimate expression.

01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:25.340
I did do the Tobaal number one

01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:27.580
and Final Fantasy 7 thing too.

01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:29.580
I mean, I bought both of those games for retail release

01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:31.380
because of the demo discs they came with.

01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.180
Both decent games.

01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:34.020
Zoe.

01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:37.740
Oh, what was, what game came with the,

01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:39.700
the first Devil May Cry demo disc?

01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:41.020
That was a really good one too.

01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:42.500
Oh hell, I don't remember.

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:45.700
But yeah, the one where it's all like strange and ironic

01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.620
that it should end the same way.

01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.540
Oh man, that was such a good demo.

01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:50.740
Loki, anything?

01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.460
I do have one that hasn't been mentioned yet.

01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:57.340
I imported the Japanese Blu-ray for Advent Children

01:50:57.340 --> 01:50:58.580
for Final Fantasy 13.

01:50:58.580 --> 01:50:59.420
I remember that.

01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:00.260
I remember that.

01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:01.900
That was a good one.

01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:03.540
This might be a little bit outside the scope

01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:05.300
but since my Metal Gear Solid answer got taken,

01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:06.300
I have to go this direction.

01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:08.060
But I remember it wasn't so much necessarily

01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:09.940
about buying a game to get the demo,

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.660
but I remember calling into the BBS

01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:17.340
and sitting there watching my modem download for an hour

01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:19.820
so I could play the Wolfenstein 3D demo.

01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:21.220
Fuck yeah, nice.

01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:22.380
Episode one.

01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:23.780
And then what was after that?

01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:25.740
Like there was, you used to get the episode one stuff

01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:27.380
all the time, it was Commander Keen,

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:29.100
but there were some huge ones like Doom.

01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:31.780
The original Doom had like the first couple levels

01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:32.620
were playable in Doom.

01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:36.140
Yeah, I always have the fucking config sys

01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:39.060
and my goddamn auto zet bat.

01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:41.380
The right memory allocated in the right spot.

01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:42.820
Yeah, so even though it wasn't necessarily

01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:44.020
buying a game to get another game,

01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.380
you still had to invest something just to play the demo

01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:47.220
just to get a taste.

01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:48.900
Yeah, it was the distribution.

01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:52.220
It was like that 3D Realms Apogee distribution method.

01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:53.060
Exactly.

01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:53.880
Hey, it worked.

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.380
Everybody had the first couple levels of Doom.

01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:56.220
It was awesome though,

01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:59.420
when PC gamers start putting full games in there.

01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:01.220
So they have like total annihilation

01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:03.300
was one of the ones that they had in there at one time.

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:05.600
And it's just, I always love just like,

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:06.980
I just buy a PC gamer all the time

01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:09.220
just for whatever free shit they had on their disc.

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:10.780
I remember when magazine started giving,

01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:13.920
like there was a weird thing with Sega specifically

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:18.920
where they gave away disc one of Shining Force 3

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.220
and it's like a four disc game.

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:21.900
They just threw the first disc in the,

01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:23.220
and like with the magazine.

01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:24.040
Wow.

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.440
So that you would have that first,

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.700
like third or quarter of the game.

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:28.540
Wow.

01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:29.360
And then want to invest in it.

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.320
I think they did the same for Panzer Saga,

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:32.520
Panzer Dragoon Saga,

01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:35.120
which is amazing because the game's got a production run

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:37.520
of like seven units.

01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:38.620
Right.

01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:39.680
But not the first disc,

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:41.240
cause there's plenty more out there.

01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:42.680
There's at least 12 more.

01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:43.560
Good answers tonight.

01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:44.720
Good answers tonight you guys.

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:45.540
Thanks for participating.

01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:47.160
If you want to answer a future FUGL question,

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.880
they go up on Sunday morning afternoon-ish.

or our Google Plus community.

01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:57.220
Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:59.260
We should bring back Jumping Flash.

01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:00.300
Props by the way,

01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:01.700
to the Google Plusters this week.

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.980
You guys, there was quite a few of you this week.

01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:06.200
You're showing the Google Plus love.

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:07.260
All right.

01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:09.180
Let's move on with some more stories.

01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:10.020
We have a few.

01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:10.980
There's actually one last thing.

01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:11.820
Yeah.

01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:12.820
SSJ100 Matt says,

01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:14.820
I'd subscribe to the Dreamcast magazine

01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:16.660
just for their demo discs.

01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:17.780
So did.

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:20.620
I mean the CD era really ushered in those demo,

01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:21.460
cause I mean,

01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:22.980
it's not like you were going to have demo cartridges.

01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:24.260
I mean.

01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:25.100
Well, you know,

01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:26.300
there was one month in the place,

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:27.580
the official PlayStation magazine,

01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:29.460
where there was like one demo disc

01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:33.780
that had the warehouse level of Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:36.220
I think it had a track on Gran Turismo.

01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.060
It had that Metal Trip demo.

01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:38.340
I remember that one.

01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:42.000
And that demo disc had so much gameplay in it.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.300
Like I probably played that disc

01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:47.620
more than I played any retail release for years.

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:48.540
I played the demo,

01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:49.760
it was for Cool Borders.

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.260
I think the very first Cool Borders,

01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:52.820
I played that demo like,

01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:54.340
I don't even know how many times.

01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:55.180
It would be just after school,

01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:57.340
just be playing that damn thing over and over,

01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:58.660
the same level over and over.

01:53:58.660 --> 01:53:59.860
Oh yeah, and you could master it.

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.380
I mean, because there was so much you could do.

01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:04.340
I remember the demo for Spy Hunter for PS2.

01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:05.780
I could beat the first level.

01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:08.100
I could beat every single possibility on it.

01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:09.980
But there was like just a couple of those demos

01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:12.340
from that glory time of the PlayStation one,

01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:13.560
where it's like,

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:17.260
that demo disc had three or four AAA hall of fame games

01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:18.100
on it.

01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:20.940
And you could play those levels for hours.

01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:22.020
Yeah, it was awesome.

01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:25.420
If you were broke and bored, which it was.

01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:26.260
All right.

01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:27.100
So,

01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:28.300
Not on Sega, but still good.

01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:31.580
Kickstarter, you see a lot of, you know,

01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:34.180
games being backed and funded on their wall.

01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:35.540
Not Shenmue.

01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:38.260
Well, not Shenmue, but the,

01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.820
I guess the original creators of Night Trap

01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:45.820
are trying to bring out an HD remake of the game,

01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:49.780
or not remake, but HD remaster of the game.

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:51.700
And they're seeking, what was it?

01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:55.980
$330,000 or some arbitrary amount.

01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:57.620
Yeah, $330,000.

01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:58.860
Ridiculously too low.

01:54:58.860 --> 01:54:59.700
I mean,

01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:00.520
Exactly.

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.540
Oh man, this is hilarious.

01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:06.780
So they want $330,000 and they're seeing,

01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:09.540
I mean, they're promising the world here.

01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:11.860
They're saying that they're going to actually print discs

01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:13.980
and they're going to put them out in cardboard sleeves

01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:15.620
and, you know, for game consoles,

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:17.460
which I don't even know if the game publishers

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:18.420
will let them,

01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:20.540
like the manufacturers will let them do that.

01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:21.380
Here's the thing.

01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:25.980
It's not a high def version of Night Trap.

01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:28.060
They're basically saying that they want to

01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:30.180
re-shoot the movie.

01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:31.020
I don't think they're re-shooting.

01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:34.060
They're taking the 35 millimeter footage.

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.980
Apparently they say it's like 4K or even like,

01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:37.820
they can re-

01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:39.600
Oh, so they're just going to reuse.

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:40.700
Yeah, they're going to reuse the footage

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:42.540
because apparently the footage that was in,

01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.700
the footage that they shot was at a much,

01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:47.340
much higher quality than was actually available

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:48.700
to be displayed in the game.

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:50.380
I mean, if it's 35 millimeter, it's good,

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.780
but my understanding was they wanted to re-shoot the game,

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:54.660
rebuild the game,

01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:57.660
rebuild a game engine and publish it for consoles.

01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:59.900
And they wanted to do this for 300K.

01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:02.980
And then they still needed to buy the rights

01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:04.940
to use the Night Trap franchise.

01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:06.820
No, they already bought the rights.

01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:09.020
They spent a quarter million dollars on that.

01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:13.700
So that $300,000, 250,000 of it is repaying them back.

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:16.800
Yeah, see that's why, okay, that's right.

01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:17.640
So that's what I was saying is that

01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:18.740
that is scammy as hell.

01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:21.580
Because you know, they paid like 16 bucks for those rights

01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:24.500
and managed to somehow get a $200,000 receipt.

01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:25.940
With all due respect,

01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:28.300
as I realized the original creators of Night Trap

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.120
are involved with this Kickstarter.

01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:32.980
Which was by the way, Rob, on Genesis.

01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:33.900
Yeah, yes.

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:35.280
But with all due respect,

01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.060
I have no interest in seeing this Kickstarter succeed.

01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.380
And I don't actually think it's a good thing at all

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:44.140
because let's be real and having come off just,

01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:46.800
taking your wife out on a quote unquote friend date

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.440
to see Showgirls at the movie theater.

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:53.840
Night Trap is kind of the Showgirls of the video game world.

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.240
It is, it's definitely.

01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:56.800
It's something that's so bad.

01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.200
It's kind of good,

01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:02.880
but that means you leave it in its original badness.

01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:04.320
It doesn't need to be redone.

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.480
It's gonna lose something.

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.520
Let's stop for a second.

01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:09.440
Has anyone in this room ever actually sat down,

01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:12.540
owned and or played Night Trap besides me?

01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.440
Not owned, but a friend of mine had it.

01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:15.720
So I played it at my friend's house.

01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.080
I mean, have you seriously sat down

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.400
to try to play Night Trap with any degree of proficiency?

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.560
I don't know on what scale of, but I mean, yeah,

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:23.400
we sat down and tried to play a little bit.

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.320
Did you try to beat Night Trap?

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.840
Night Trap is kind of a cool game.

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.600
The idea behind Night Trap is that literally

01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:31.600
you're monitoring the house and you're triggering traps

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:34.400
to take out monsters before they kill people.

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:36.000
It's a great idea.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.520
It was definitely ahead of its time.

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.780
And it wasn't going to be good

01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:47.780
because it was shot as a super, super B movie,

01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:51.600
starring a B movie actress who killed herself

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:53.720
and a bunch of B movie actors and actresses.

01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:58.720
But Night Trap isn't a bad game for what it is,

01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:00.900
which is a bad game.

01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:01.740
Exactly.

01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:03.420
But the thing with this is it's not even about

01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:05.780
the quality of Night Trap or not because I would love

01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:10.780
somehow to see Night Trap released as a DLC

01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:14.700
or as a downloadable game, even put on a disc,

01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:17.720
maybe even as a budget title, maybe even as a full release,

01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:20.660
but, and maybe even reshot, but these guys aren't doing it.

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:23.880
These guys are trying to get people to give them money

01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:25.260
and they have absolutely no,

01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:27.100
like they bought the Night Trap rights and they're like,

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.620
how the fuck do we get some money back out of this?

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:31.760
Oh, well, yeah, we'll make a game.

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.580
Yeah, we'll make a game out of it.

01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:35.520
And we're going to charge you for the rights.

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:38.620
And I just, if somebody paid $250,000 for the rights

01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:41.020
of Night Trap, man, they ought to be kicked in the balls

01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:42.060
until they explode.

01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:46.980
I mean, I'm sure it's the guy from Digital Pictures

01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:49.540
who is just, you know, his glory days.

01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:50.500
It was a bunch of old people.

01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.340
Like I seriously don't know who these guys are.

01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:54.180
His glory days are 30 years behind them.

01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:56.260
I don't even know if they have like any programmers

01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:57.900
or anything, it's just a bunch of like these.

01:58:57.900 --> 01:59:00.180
Yeah, no, it's just, it is.

01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:01.540
Let me get to some comments from our chat room

01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:02.820
over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:04.660
Ragenator says, the closest thing to Night Trap

01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:06.780
that I've played was Wing Commander 3 and 4.

01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:08.220
The only thing those games have in common

01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:11.180
is it's part of the full motion video PC craze

01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:13.980
and CD system craze at the time.

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:16.380
There's really otherwise not a lot of similarities

01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:17.200
I can think of.

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:19.340
Wing Commander 3 had kind of an awesome flight game

01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:21.340
to go with the cheesy CGI.

01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:24.180
SSJ100Matt says, I beat Night Trap at a party

01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:26.100
a few years ago with friends, eventually.

01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:27.920
I never owned it because my parents caught wind

01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:30.940
of the original scandal and wouldn't let me get it.

01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.280
Tigerclaw says, double switch was the closest

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.820
to Night Trap actually.

01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:36.700
So there's some comments from our chat room over at live.

01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:39.620
Double switch, that game's also insanely awesomely bad.

01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:40.980
I had so many of those Sega C,

01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:42.200
I mean, I probably still have a bunch of them,

01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:45.700
but I had Night Trap, I had Tomcat Alley,

01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:47.380
I had double switch.

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:50.500
You know, I loved the FMV games for what they were.

01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:51.340
I didn't walk into it going,

01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:53.460
this is gonna be the next generation in gaming.

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:54.560
It was just something different.

01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:56.620
Sewer Shark, you know.

01:59:56.620 --> 01:59:57.980
I remember Sewer Shark.

01:59:57.980 --> 01:59:59.740
Welcome to the sewers, punk.

02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.820
I can still do that entire opening monologue from that game.

02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:05.160
Well, maybe not, but I could.

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.000
I'd walk around Taco Bell doing it

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.560
and all my coworkers would just be like, fucking Dan.

02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:12.320
All right, let me move on.

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:14.840
I want to talk quickly about a new BioWare game,

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.080
which should have Jamie's ears perking up a little bit,

02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:19.160
except this has nothing to do with Mass Effect or Dragon Age.

02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:20.000
Sorry.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.160
I heard the Mass Effect guy.

02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:21.980
Yes he did.

02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:23.720
He was like, fuck you.

02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:25.240
That was last week's news, Dan.

02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:26.080
Yeah.

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:27.800
I just wanted to say it

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:29.040
because I know my wife loves Mass Effect

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:31.000
and this probably fucks up her good time.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.480
Ah, take that.

02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:33.680
I'd probably think he contributed to the-

02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:35.120
Mass Effect can eat me.

02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:36.840
It's not on Sega Genesis.

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:37.840
Watch your volume, Dan.

02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:38.680
All right.

02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:42.120
Shadow Realms is the name of the game from BioWare.

02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:44.160
It is a 4v1 game.

02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.120
Another one between Evolve-

02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.040
Four versus one?

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:50.200
Yeah, between Evolve and the new Fable game

02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.680
and what Pac-Man Versus.

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:52.520
Throwing it way back.

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:53.440
Pac-Man Versus is incredible.

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.920
I know, right?

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:56.220
All of a sudden everybody's like,

02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:59.040
I want to make Pac-Man Versus in my franchise.

02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:00.380
That's a good idea.

02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:03.440
I want to have a fighting game that's 4v1,

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:05.280
but just it's like completely unfair.

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:06.640
Just like, you know, the one person-

02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:08.160
It already is completely unfair.

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.480
It's four versus one.

02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:11.060
Pac-Man Versus is an awesome game.

02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:12.600
We should hook that up and play.

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:13.440
We should.

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:14.260
Right now.

02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:15.100
We should do a Twitch stream of that.

02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:15.940
It'd be so much fun.

02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:16.760
Fuck yes.

02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:17.600
Yes.

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.240
I have his Elgato capture card.

02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:20.500
I just never use it.

02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:21.340
All right.

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:22.540
Elgato es en fuego.

02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.640
Moving on, Shadow Realms.

02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:27.260
A 4v1 story-driven online action RPG

02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:31.680
with dynamic co-op missions in a evolving BioWare world.

02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:32.760
There's supposed to be new episodes

02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.280
that'll be released through this as well.

02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:35.800
So it's a new IP for BioWare.

02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:39.080
So that's pretty cool that it's a new IP.

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:40.400
That did come out of Gamescom.

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:45.400
You can register for the alpha at shadowrealms.com slash alpha

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:46.620
and I'm sure a lot of you guys

02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:48.060
are going to be signing up for that.

02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:49.720
So pretty cool.

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:50.560
Sounds like it could be,

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.800
especially if it's like story-driven.

02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:55.240
I'm curious how the 4v1 aspect of that works with that,

02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:57.360
but check it out.

02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:58.640
Be cool.

02:01:58.640 --> 02:01:59.480
Dark Sakura.

02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:01.520
Well, we've been keeping up

02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:03.080
with the whole net neutrality bullshit

02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.460
that's been going on.

02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:06.620
This one's a really interesting one.

02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:11.620
Basically Comcast and Time Warner had $132,000 in donations

02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:16.080
for an event that honored the current FCC commissioner

02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.280
and then pulled it when said commissioner,

02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:21.440
Min Young Clyburn,

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:24.500
basically made a bunch of accusations

02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:26.680
against the companies that were trying to become one giant

02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:31.540
ISP and buy his vote on the merger.

02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.600
So pretty much, yeah, that's what they were trying to do

02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:35.920
and they just pretty much made themselves look shittier.

02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:38.580
People from Comcast and Time Warner, by the way,

02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:41.000
donating 132,000 to anything,

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.020
that's like their pocket change.

02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:49.120
But still the fact that they pulled said pocket change.

02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:52.800
And you know, it's Comcast really getting dogged on a lot

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.080
in the news lately with all these people

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:55.720
recording the customer service calls.

02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:58.400
I just saw one today on the front page like Yahoo

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:00.760
or news.google or something where it was like,

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.960
the dude was on hold for three hours

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:04.920
until the customer service center closed

02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:06.720
and he had like the little timer running on his phone

02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:07.560
to prove it like just-

02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:09.620
It's a giant company of dicks.

02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:11.560
Comcast-

02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:14.120
To be fair, also the internet service provider

02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:16.040
powering our show tonight that keeps dropping.

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:18.360
They are the best internet service provider

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:19.660
in our part of the world

02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:22.920
because we can't get Verizon, Fios and shit like that.

02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:26.400
God, like if you have to call Comcast customer service,

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:28.820
they will happily fuck up your account

02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:30.120
for months and months and months.

02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:31.720
And every month you call up and you're just like,

02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:34.240
God damn it, reverse the late charge, it's your fault.

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:36.000
I will kill your faith.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.440
This is basically though,

02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:42.440
what the official Comcast VP of Community Investment said.

02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:43.640
We have-

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:44.480
It's a bribe.

02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:45.720
You know it, I know it.

02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:47.580
Let's just get it out in the open.

02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:48.960
We have great respect and admiration

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:52.000
for FCC Commissioner, Min Young Clyburn,

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.120
and for the Kites Foundation and its work.

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:57.480
We do not want either the Commissioner or Kites

02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:00.560
to fall under a shadow as a result of our support

02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:02.440
for the diversity in cable industry,

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:05.040
which is why we are withdrawing our support for the donor.

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:05.880
Pay off.

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:09.200
They just figured out a way to do it under the table.

02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.760
I, yeah, well, I'm kind of done, so.

02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:16.760
Jamie's just sitting over there going dot, dot, dot.

02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:18.480
Can I tell my funny Comcast story here?

02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:19.320
Cause this is hilarious.

02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:20.160
Fuck yeah.

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:21.760
So, you know, I just moved from the apartment

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:23.600
to this house not that long ago, right?

02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:26.900
So, I had my service moved, my Comcast service,

02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:29.000
but I don't know why they did it this way.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.280
They set up a new account for me completely,

02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.180
closed it, then did another one.

02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:36.120
So I've had like three accounts with Comcast.

02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:39.280
I ended up getting a check in the mail from them

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:41.800
for money that I guess somehow was not spent

02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:42.820
or like a refund.

02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:44.400
And I actually had to call them to be like,

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:45.600
can I cash this check?

02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:47.720
Cause like you just moved my service

02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:48.560
from one place to another.

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:51.400
Then I got a bill for the device.

02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:54.160
No, that was never returned.

02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:55.720
The device that they said was never returned

02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:57.360
because I moved it from one place to the other.

02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:59.080
So I called them and got that worked out.

02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.040
And finally they figured that out.

02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:01.760
I mean, to their credit, they fixed it.

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:05.040
But to this day, I still get mail forwarded

02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:06.000
from my old address.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.600
That's like, you should sign up for Comcast again.

02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:09.920
We miss you and dah, dah, dah.

02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:14.520
And I'm like, you guys, I moved my service.

02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:16.240
It shouldn't be that complicated.

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:18.060
I've got two awesome Comcast stories.

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:18.900
All right, quickly, quickly.

02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:20.360
Number one is like yours.

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:21.200
All right.

02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:22.920
When we were in the old house

02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:25.000
where you guys used to do the show

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.160
and we had terrible service

02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:27.120
cause I didn't own my own modem

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:28.720
or deal five or pay the big money.

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:30.360
Yeah.

02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:32.400
When we moved to the house that we're in now,

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:35.560
Comcast fucked up my billing for like six months.

02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:37.120
And this is like every month I had to call in.

02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:39.360
The other one was just like your second story.

02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:41.660
Comcast calls me one day we're living in a house

02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:44.260
and some lady in terrible broken English.

02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:46.200
And I'm sure she was just doing her best.

02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:50.240
Was just like, hello, is Danielle Devrina there?

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:54.200
And I'm like, this is Dan Devrend.

02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:56.280
Oh, hello, Mrs. Devrena.

02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:59.880
We understand that you don't have Comcast service.

02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:03.800
I'm like, my name is Dan Devrend and I do have Comcast.

02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:06.440
Okay, thank you.

02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:07.920
Click.

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:08.760
Awesome.

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.400
To be fair, and even though I dog on them,

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.320
I did actually call them this week to try to camp.

02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:20.160
Well, we got AT&T, AT&T came up to our door

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:23.120
and they're like, okay, here, we can give you internet

02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:27.600
and TV for basically $1 less than you paid right now.

02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:28.420
You didn't say yes, did you?

02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:29.260
No, I didn't say yes.

02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:30.100
Oh, thank God.

02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:33.800
Because their TV package was like their family package.

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.440
So it's all these family channels.

02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:37.040
Their internet is so, well, you do have a family.

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:40.420
Their internet is so bad that it'll give you cancer.

02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:42.480
Well, it's the fiber internet now

02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:43.720
that they have running through.

02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:45.560
It's 35.

02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:47.260
Remember when someone cooked a fiber optic cable

02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:50.080
in our neighborhood, sweetie?

02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:52.400
Remember when someone cut the fiber optic cable

02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:53.240
in our neighborhood?

02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:54.720
Yeah, we got like two months of service out of that.

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.200
I mean, service.

02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:57.600
They were trying to stop this show.

02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:59.600
But anyways, they crashed into it.

02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:01.720
They did offer like, they're all, hey,

02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:05.960
we'll give you a TV package and double your internet speed

02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:09.560
and give you HBO free for a year for like $4 more.

02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:10.960
Tell them you want an iPad.

02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:13.120
I don't want an iPad.

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:15.140
It sounds like people will give you a fucking iPad.

02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:15.980
Yeah, they will.

02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:16.800
The AT&T TV.

02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:18.980
No, the AT&T, they wanted to give me a,

02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:21.820
like it was a Google Nexus tablet or something.

02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:22.940
It'll be an iPad second gen.

02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:23.780
Fuck no.

02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:24.600
It is an Xbox.

02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:25.980
No, no, they give you the mini.

02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:27.740
What, you mean the one that's in my hand?

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:30.860
Like an Xbox 360, a 32 inch TV

02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:33.540
or like a Google Nexus 3 or something like that.

02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:34.380
And I was like, man.

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.860
You and I both know that's on your list to upgrade.

02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:39.780
You should give me a Mercedes, yes, it definitely is.

02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:41.140
All right.

02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:41.980
Nintendo's got some.

02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:44.380
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:46.660
SSJ100 Matt says, poor Danielle.

02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:49.940
I know, I feel real bad for her

02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:52.180
because she apparently does not have Comcast.

02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:53.580
And that was back when they had just started

02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:56.180
the cable modem and I mean, it was so good.

02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:57.900
Like I called Comcast as soon as I found out

02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:00.180
that that exists and was like, can I get that at my house?

02:08:00.180 --> 02:08:01.020
And they're like, yes.

02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:03.220
And I'm like, come and take my money right now.

02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:04.460
Then the guy was going to try to give me

02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:06.340
some extra network cards and a supervisor

02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:07.900
because it was like one of his first installs.

02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:10.140
Like just cock slapped him.

02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:10.960
It was brutal.

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:12.220
He's like, dude, I just got in trouble

02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:13.860
for trying to hook you up with free shit.

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:15.940
I'm like, dude, tell your supervisor he's a dick.

02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:17.820
The guy just busted up laughing.

02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:19.660
That's when we lived in the hood.

02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:20.900
But when we got our cable modem,

02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:22.660
that like revolutionized our life.

02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:23.500
It was so good.

02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:27.380
Because before that, we paid for two phone lines.

02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:28.900
We had two AOL accounts.

02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:30.980
When OLR first started, it was on DSL.

02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:33.140
Oh man, well, this is pre-OLR.

02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:34.460
This is when we still lived like,

02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:36.340
this is before we even knew you guys, right?

02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:37.180
Probably right around the time we met you guys.

02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:39.580
This is when we still were at the tail end of dial-up, right?

02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:41.420
I remember the house she lived in.

02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:42.820
The first time I ever met you, Dan,

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:44.620
you and your friends were over playing,

02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:47.660
having a LAN party, a local area Nintendo party.

02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:49.700
And you had like eight TVs hooked up,

02:08:49.700 --> 02:08:51.060
all playing The Legend of Zelda.

02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:52.260
And you were doing like a speed run.

02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:54.620
Oh, I dominated that night too.

02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:56.060
It was so good.

02:08:56.060 --> 02:08:58.220
That was where I lived in the hood house.

02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:00.220
Yeah, we lived in the fucking get-to.

02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:01.700
You gotta do that again, because I want in.

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:04.020
We should do that like tonight.

02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:05.540
I gotta work tomorrow, fool.

02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:07.380
Fuck, Colin.

02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:09.740
I'm doing an admin day tomorrow, so y'all can suck it.

02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:10.780
How about you suck?

02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:11.700
Nevermind.

02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:15.220
All right, as much as I love the Comcast Bitch Hour,

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:17.220
we do have more games to discuss, which is just-

02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:19.420
Comcast Bitch Radio!

02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:20.420
Loki.

02:09:20.420 --> 02:09:23.780
All right, so this is pretty sweet.

02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:25.780
No Man's Sky's gonna be a pretty ambitious game.

02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:27.180
And this is one of those stories that like,

02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:30.300
hey, let's throw a cool statistic and talk about it.

02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:32.580
So here's the statistic.

02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:35.220
You would need five billion years

02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:38.780
to explore every planet in the game for one second.

02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:39.620
So that's how much procedural-

02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:41.100
That's probably bullshit.

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:42.940
But if that game is even half as good

02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:45.460
as they're trying to say it's gonna be,

02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:47.380
it might sell me a PS4.

02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:48.220
Yeah.

02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:50.340
That sounds fucking cool as shit.

02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:52.420
I really do want this game.

02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:53.780
It does sound pretty awesome.

02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:55.140
And I already own a PS4, so I just-

02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:57.940
And my PC's not gonna be good enough to run that.

02:09:57.940 --> 02:09:58.780
You know, I need a PC.

02:09:58.780 --> 02:09:59.620
Is it gonna be on PC?

02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:01.260
I thought it was gonna be on PC.

02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.900
Fuck the PlayStation 4.

02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:06.460
Is it cross-play where PS4 people can play with PC people?

02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:07.300
I have no idea.

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:08.740
Probably not.

02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:09.580
Oh, Final Fantasy XIV doesn't.

02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:10.420
It might be.

02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:11.500
It might be because it's-

02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:13.380
Microsoft's the one that doesn't play that game,

02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:14.900
but you know, fuck them if they don't want to.

02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:17.340
I think that's more like a square thing.

02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:19.060
No, because, no, no, no.

02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:19.900
Square's come out and said,

02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:22.060
we would put Final Fantasy XIV on the Xbox One,

02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:23.580
but Microsoft won't do the cross-server

02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:25.420
and we're not having separate servers for Xbox One.

02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:27.660
Right, Square is like, we're having one server.

02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:28.780
And Sony's like, yes.

02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:30.740
And Microsoft's like, no.

02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:31.580
Exactly.

02:10:31.580 --> 02:10:32.420
But I think that was-

02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:33.420
But yet they did it for 11.

02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:36.420
But I think this No Man's Sky thing is probably more like,

02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:38.580
I don't know who's making it.

02:10:38.580 --> 02:10:39.420
Is it Square?

02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:40.260
Fuck, if it's Square,

02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:43.580
it's strangely enough, it's actually, it's Hello Games.

02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:45.060
They're the ones that did the,

02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:47.660
was it that Motorcycle game?

02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:49.500
The Joe Danger game.

02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:50.660
Well, their office is flooded

02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:51.860
during the production of this, right?

02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:53.780
We're all familiar though with like what this is, right?

02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:55.100
Like all your listeners are.

02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:56.380
It's like an open space game.

02:10:56.380 --> 02:10:57.220
It's awesome.

02:10:57.220 --> 02:10:58.180
Yeah, sounds awesome.

02:10:58.180 --> 02:11:00.020
Fucking sweet.

02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:00.860
Let's see.

02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:01.700
ActDeft in our chat says,

02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:04.780
Dan sounds like the guy from Jet Set Radio.

02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:05.620
Do you?

02:11:05.620 --> 02:11:08.500
DJ Professor K, Jet Set Radio!

02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:10.940
Ow, my ears.

02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:12.300
Ow, ow, ow.

02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:13.500
All right, a quick follow up

02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:15.620
to something we had talked about last week.

02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:17.980
This is GameStop announcing

02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:19.580
their simplified trade-in pricing.

02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:20.420
It is real.

02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:22.060
That whole thing did happen.

02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:26.740
So GameStop has 100 games worth $20 or more, they say.

02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:27.580
So, I mean, I'm assuming that means-

02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:29.180
Is that the press release?

02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:30.020
Oh, sorry about that.

02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:30.840
Yes, it is.

02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:31.680
Is the press release through-

02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:33.180
From a guy named Jason Cochran?

02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:37.860
Jackie Smith says in contact.

02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:38.700
I read one.

02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:40.260
I threw that guy out of my store.

02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:43.380
When he was my boss's boss,

02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:44.500
he came in and was bitching at me.

02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:45.340
I was just like,

02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:46.900
if you got nothing better for me,

02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:48.620
you just need to go.

02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:49.660
And he just turned around and left.

02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:50.500
My boss was like,

02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:51.740
what the fuck did you just do?

02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:53.340
I'm just like, I ain't got time for this.

02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:54.740
That is awesome as hell.

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:55.580
You're hardcore.

02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:56.400
It was amazing.

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.240
You're hardcore.

02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.080
I love it.

02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:58.900
All right.

02:11:58.900 --> 02:11:59.740
So yeah, so-

02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:01.580
What's that?

02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:02.900
I said, hi, Mr. Vrena.

02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:03.740
Mr. Vrena.

02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:04.560
Oh, Alan just walked in and said,

02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:05.400
hi, Mr. Vrena.

02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:07.580
All right.

02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:09.660
I do have Comcast, damn it.

02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:13.300
So yeah, if you sell-

02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:14.720
Anyway, you get a little more money

02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:16.940
if you're a Powered Up Rewards pro member

02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:18.420
and blah, de blah, de blah.

02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:20.300
I still say sell them direct on eBay,

02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:22.380
but if you want to take the easy way out,

02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:23.220
you can.

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:25.160
All right.

02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:26.000
Let's-

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:26.820
What?

02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:27.660
I was saying, yeah.

02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:28.480
Yeah, all right.

02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:29.500
Yeah.

02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:31.180
Let's get to the mailbag

02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:32.980
because every week you guys send us emails.

02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:35.940
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:38.820
And we read those emails live on air.

02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:41.300
Now, by the way, so our podcast listeners know

02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:42.660
because I threatened this last week.

02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:44.100
I said, if we don't get four emails,

02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:46.380
I'm going to play music from Kim Kardashian Hollywood

02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:47.860
during the break.

02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:49.440
Kim Kardashian Hollywood music

02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:51.040
was played during the break tonight

02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:52.740
because when I looked before the show,

02:12:52.740 --> 02:12:54.340
we had three emails.

02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:55.820
One came in during the show

02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:59.220
and I decided because people like Bobby and Act F

02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:00.220
were like, he won't do it.

02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:01.060
He won't do it.

02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:01.940
You know, don't send an email.

02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:03.540
I decided to torture everybody anyway.

02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:05.620
So just so you podcasties know,

02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:07.220
the live listeners got tortured tonight.

02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:09.980
I'm still thinking of a way to torture the rest of you.

02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:13.560
Besides having Dan on the show.

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:16.420
Then again, Dan was on the show this week.

02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:17.240
Yeah, yeah.

02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:18.780
I self burned before you could burn me.

02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:20.140
All right, fair enough.

02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:21.040
Burn shield.

02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:24.620
Burn heal.

02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:26.980
Plus one resistance to burning.

02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:28.340
You guys have been taking so long

02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:30.780
that I actually had to refresh all the emails.

02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:31.780
I'm trying to kill time

02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:34.340
until her iPad's battery dies.

02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:35.660
Dan uses burn heal.

02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:36.500
It's super effective.

02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:37.320
I'm gonna kill something other than time.

02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:38.160
It's super effective.

02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:39.420
All right, Jamie, do it.

02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:41.620
Well, I actually have to load the emails now.

02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:46.240
So we could fill more time talking about Sega Genesis.

02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:49.940
Have we talked about blast processing?

02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:51.500
Blast processing is great.

02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:53.340
That iPad needs blast processing.

02:13:53.340 --> 02:13:54.860
That iPad needs to be blasted.

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:56.100
What's up, Orange Lounge?

02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:58.420
I attached another song for Loki to sample.

02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:01.180
I actually like Jamie's opinion on the song the most.

02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:04.060
Which I still haven't gotten the original email.

02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:07.300
That first email that he attached never got forwarded to me.

02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:09.060
So I need that or either that

02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:11.380
or got lost in spam filter hell.

02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:12.620
Is this from Ranma?

02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:14.860
No, let me finish reading the damn email.

02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:17.820
So I apologize.

02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:20.220
I apologize for not getting back

02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:23.400
because I have not actually heard the song yet.

02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:24.420
Sorry, Robin Loki.

02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:26.200
She's your show star.

02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:27.780
What?

02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:29.140
My question is pretty simple.

02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:31.220
Why isn't Destiny going to be on PC?

02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:33.740
Do you think it eventually will be?

02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:35.140
Probably, maybe?

02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:36.820
Yes, I think it will be on PC

02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:38.100
just because it's so easy.

02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:41.580
The port, you know, the PlayStation 4, Xbox One games

02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:43.340
because they're x86 anyways.

02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:46.060
So yes, it probably will eventually go on PC.

02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:49.380
Especially if, well, yeah, why not?

02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:50.220
The funny thing is,

02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:52.460
Bungie really hadn't done any PC work

02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:55.340
since they went over to the console side,

02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:57.460
except for the PC version of what, Halo 2,

02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:58.300
Halo 1?

02:14:58.300 --> 02:14:59.820
Halo 1.

02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:01.100
Thanks, Smile.

02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:02.620
Hope you guys had a wonderful weekend

02:15:02.620 --> 02:15:04.660
and I hope you have an amazing upcoming week.

02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:07.060
Much love, EA Skeezy from Milwaukee.

02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:09.140
PS, Jamie, I would love to someday

02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:10.660
spend a weekend on your couch.

02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:12.060
We'll rock some games and eat tacos

02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:13.300
till our poop turns to salsa.

02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:14.140
Ew, LOL.

02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:17.460
Yeah, you ain't coming to my fucking house.

02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:21.100
All right, thank you for forwarding that to me.

02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:22.820
Just forwarded two emails to you.

02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:23.660
Sweet, I appreciate it.

02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:24.820
You can come stay on the couch

02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:27.420
if you bring us some of that fine Wisconsin cheese.

02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:31.020
Hello, OLR crew.

02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:33.260
13x forever here.

02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:34.580
Third time's a charm, I suppose.

02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:37.740
I also apologize for a long email with the Lord.

02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:40.100
So Trails, what?

02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:45.660
Whatever, Dan.

02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:49.460
So Trails in the Sky, AKA Sora No Kisuke,

02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:52.740
is the first game in the Kiseki sub-series

02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:54.460
of Legend of Heroes JRPG

02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:57.700
from Falcom, Dragon Slayer, Ys, many other games.

02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:00.300
Kiseki series is one of the biggest,

02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:02.940
most popular JRPG series in Japan right now.

02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:05.900
Trails in the Sky first came out in 2004 on PC in Japan.

02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:08.380
It was so large that the developer split it into two games,

02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:10.580
first chapter and second chapter respectively.

02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:13.180
Later, it was ported to PSP and PS3.

02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:14.460
So what makes this game series

02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:16.660
to stand apart from other JRPGs?

02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:19.300
First of all, it is more story-oriented

02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:21.260
than the vast majority of JRPGs.

02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:23.140
The story and world building is bread and butter

02:16:23.140 --> 02:16:23.980
of this series,

02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:26.780
which resulted in one of the most detail, alive,

02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:29.260
and consistent world in any JRPG out there.

02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.620
Scripts for these games are really,

02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:32.580
really huge example script shots.

02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:38.420
Flat characters, existential plot twists,

02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:40.940
mute town crowd, not in these games.

02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:44.420
You get your in-depth character.

02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:45.540
Stop it, Dan.

02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:47.980
I'm talking to Rob.

02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:49.780
Stay focused on your story.

02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:51.700
This is like an hour long.

02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:54.580
This is actually the guy that tried to call in last week

02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:55.820
and the internet sucked.

02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:56.660
And yeah, we said email.

02:16:56.660 --> 02:16:59.620
Yes, so that's why I'm happily reading this.

02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:01.180
You get your in-game character development

02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:02.380
from your main party members,

02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:05.340
and then for half the NPCs in the world,

02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:06.940
albeit a lot less detailed.

02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:09.020
That's right, you can see how things are going

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:12.380
for a lot of town people after each main story advancement.

02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:14.420
What's more, stories in each individual game

02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:17.220
are intertwined not only with previous titles,

02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:18.460
but with future ones as well.

02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:20.060
You'd be surprised at how many instances

02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:22.220
of foreshadowing were there in the beginning,

02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:24.980
even for the latest games.

02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:27.060
First game is relatively slow paced

02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:29.020
and light on the battle system in many games.

02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:31.220
There's a lot of introductory stuff for everything,

02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:34.060
but it picks up speed fast right before the second chapter

02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:35.660
and other aspects are greatly improved

02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:37.220
in later games on the series.

02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:38.820
Oh, did I mention background music?

02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:40.220
It was great from the get-go

02:17:40.220 --> 02:17:42.060
and it only got better ever since.

02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:43.820
Now, why is all the hype?

02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:48.220
Sadly, only Trails in the Sky FC for PSP

02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:49.660
came out in the West.

02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:51.220
That's it until just recently

02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:53.420
when XSEED finally released

02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:55.940
a greatly improved original PC version on Steam

02:17:55.940 --> 02:17:58.020
with lots of enhancements and ported features

02:17:58.020 --> 02:18:00.020
from handheld and console releases.

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:03.940
What is more important, they're localizing second chapter

02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:05.860
and plan to release it at the end of the year,

02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:08.540
maybe early 2015 on PC first,

02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:10.460
and then the PSP version as well.

02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:15.460
And if FC and SC of Trials in the Sky will sell well,

02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:17.340
they're going to get the third chapter,

02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:19.740
which is a new game that bridges Trails in the Sky

02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:24.740
with the next installment, Zero slash Aonokisuki,

02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:29.460
and GASP probably may be somehow the rest of the series.

02:18:29.460 --> 02:18:31.740
In other words, every sold copy of Trails in the Sky,

02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:34.220
first chapter, and more importantly, second chapter,

02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:36.220
will have measurable impact on the probability

02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:38.760
to see the whole series being localized in the West

02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:40.140
for the first time ever.

02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:43.060
In conclusion, these are really great game.

02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:44.900
These are really great games

02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:48.300
for a really low price of $19.99 on PC or PSP.

02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:49.900
If you're interested in JRPGs at all,

02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:51.280
you should try this game.

02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:53.700
Your friendly neighborhood bracelet, 13X forever.

02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:55.880
PS, sorry for the messed up email.

02:18:57.220 --> 02:18:59.260
You can't go wrong with anything by Falcom.

02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:01.460
I just downloaded Ease Origin, it's awesome.

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:04.660
I'm glad we got to give the game a proper shout out

02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:07.480
cause he was denied that shout out last week, so hooray.

02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:08.740
Yeah.

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:11.580
Hey, OLR, I've heard emails run to high demand,

02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:13.420
so I decided to finally write in about something

02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:15.820
I've been thinking about since the whole Ubisoft

02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:17.720
no fem assassin debacle.

02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:21.260
There are all kinds of ways that games implement the player

02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:23.220
in deciding what goes on with the main character

02:19:23.220 --> 02:19:25.140
ranging from almost none, Dead Space,

02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:27.300
Rise of Evil, Strider, et cetera,

02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:29.980
up to complete control over nearly everything,

02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:31.060
including how the player looks

02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:33.020
and often story related choices,

02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:36.420
Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect, Dark Souls, Saints Row, et cetera.

02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:39.700
My main question would be which type of,

02:19:39.700 --> 02:19:42.260
which of the types do you generally enjoy more?

02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:44.580
For those of you who answer complete control,

02:19:44.580 --> 02:19:47.340
do you think it takes away from the narrative of the game

02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:49.340
in some way since the events have to be planned out

02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:51.100
in such a way as to allow so many

02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:52.740
different types of characters?

02:19:52.740 --> 02:19:54.740
Or do you think it's sort of irrelevant

02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:58.780
and that we should always be able to create a character?

02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:01.620
Then for the second part of this question in games

02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:04.240
that have you create your own characters from scratch,

02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:07.140
do any of you have a character already in mind

02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:09.380
when you begin playing that you will use

02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:10.740
across different game series?

02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:13.580
Personally, I have a short roster of characters I'll create

02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:15.220
that I've been using since I was about 18

02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:17.080
with some new characters occasionally branching out.

02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:17.920
Pause.

02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:21.540
I really don't care as long as the story's good,

02:20:21.540 --> 02:20:23.420
although I really do love putting a lot of time

02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:25.220
into character creation.

02:20:25.220 --> 02:20:27.820
There really are pros and cons to both formats.

02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:30.100
I think it's so hard to pick one or the other

02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:32.940
because if I were to say that I only like it

02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:34.800
when I can create my own character and do my own things,

02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:36.540
I'd be saying I don't like Mario

02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:37.500
or things like that as much.

02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:40.860
There's great value in games like that.

02:20:40.860 --> 02:20:42.620
But of course, I love the ones

02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:44.940
where you can make your own character too.

02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:47.940
Especially in a genre like role-playing,

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:50.380
I think it works very well there.

02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:53.180
I mean, I wouldn't expect necessarily in an action game

02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:54.780
I can do that.

02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:57.540
Although I would think that in a multiplayer action,

02:20:57.540 --> 02:20:59.980
which is why the Ubisoft thing got a lot of crap,

02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:02.420
you would have a variety of characters to choose from,

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:03.780
but I digress.

02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:08.500
I don't mind the lack of openness

02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:12.220
in certain genres of games.

02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:15.820
But at the end of the day, is the game good?

02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:16.660
Yes or no?

02:21:16.660 --> 02:21:18.480
That's the most important thing.

02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:19.700
I do like to make characters though.

02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:20.540
I'm gonna be honest.

02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:23.100
I make characters usually that look like me.

02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:26.540
The characters I usually make, not always.

02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:28.980
Or I'll do a girl that looks nothing like me.

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:32.020
Well, I would like to tell the letter writer

02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:33.320
because there was a note added,

02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:36.520
you should read the first part silently before allowed.

02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:38.760
Please, I don't want to impose on you or the show.

02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:41.240
You should have put that up at the beginning of the email

02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:45.240
because I don't read the emails before I read the emails.

02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:46.840
I think he meant the rest of the email though.

02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:48.440
There's something else that he put after that.

02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:49.600
It said the first part.

02:21:50.580 --> 02:21:51.840
I think he means the second part.

02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:53.640
If you actually look at it, it says,

02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:56.120
it's fine, you can read it.

02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:58.800
I looked at it before the show and it's fine.

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:02.840
He was worried about making a cheap plug on there.

02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:04.080
It's fine.

02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:05.800
I recently started a YouTube channel,

02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:09.680
partly inspired by OLR and sometimes my favorite YouTuber.

02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:11.660
So I'd like to invite anybody that's interested

02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:14.340
in video game related content to come check it out

02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:16.840
since I'm trying to figure out what people want to see.

02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:19.520
And the chat seems to always be reasonable,

02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:21.400
fun people to interact with.

02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:22.960
It's Brozime on YouTube.

02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:26.540
Also, I hope to be in chat tonight, but no promises

02:22:26.540 --> 02:22:28.240
as I usually work quite late Sundays.

02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:30.120
Love the show, Brozime.

02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:30.960
There you go.

02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:34.080
I think it's reasonable and fun people on YouTube.

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:36.440
They're all a bunch of trolling, hacky assholes.

02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:37.640
Oh, I come on on YouTube a lot.

02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:39.600
I'm happy to promote your YouTube channel,

02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:41.320
especially when you kiss up a little bit and be like,

02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:43.080
you know, it's inspired by OLR.

02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:45.360
I don't mind plugging people, I'm fine with that.

02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:46.960
It's not in position.

02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:48.160
No, in all seriousness,

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:49.320
best of luck with your YouTube channel.

02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:53.280
I love, you know, I support indie broadcasting in all forms.

02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:55.080
What about walking around your neighborhood

02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:56.560
with a megaphone?

02:22:56.560 --> 02:23:01.400
I'm broadcasting right now live from Rob's house

02:23:01.400 --> 02:23:03.280
where all of his neighbors can hear me.

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:04.520
I don't want the police call.

02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:06.760
That is probably the stupidest thing you've ever said.

02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:07.880
You know what?

02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:10.000
I can think of another stupid thing that I said

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.760
that consisted of two words when we got married.

02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:14.300
And by the way- No way?

02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:16.100
By the way, Brozime's in chat saying,

02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:18.160
I meant the second, sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:19.000
So he's beeping up all the time.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.560
By the way, I love this guy.

02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:22.240
We know what you meant.

02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:24.000
Jamie doesn't know what you meant.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.940
I know that you can sit and spin.

02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:27.620
She's walking home from the show tonight.

02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:28.460
No, I'm not.

02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:29.280
Do we have another email?

02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:30.120
Yes.

02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:31.220
Last email.

02:23:31.220 --> 02:23:33.140
This is from Robert M.

02:23:33.140 --> 02:23:34.540
I wonder what effect the changes

02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:38.180
in Twitch's terms of service will have to salty bet,

02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:39.700
even though when Moogan channel

02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:41.640
is almost entirely focused on live feed

02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:43.420
rather than archived content.

02:23:43.420 --> 02:23:45.800
The prospect of betting on games

02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:46.940
that have already taken place

02:23:46.940 --> 02:23:48.660
seems even more silly slash dangerous

02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:50.820
than buying a DVD of world poker jar.

02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:53.820
People bet on games on Twitch?

02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:55.420
That's fucking brilliant.

02:23:55.420 --> 02:23:56.260
It's fake money.

02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:57.380
It's monopoly money.

02:23:57.380 --> 02:23:58.220
It's fun.

02:23:58.220 --> 02:23:59.780
No, but that's amazing.

02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:02.700
I mean, fake money, real money, that's inspired.

02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:03.540
You seriously need to watch it

02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:06.300
because it's all those independently made

02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:08.300
Moogan characters fighting each other.

02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:11.180
So they have ridiculous shit all the time.

02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:14.460
And you sign up and you get like X amount

02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:15.820
of salty bucks or whatever.

02:24:15.820 --> 02:24:17.300
And then you bet on it.

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:19.620
But it's difficult to win a lot of times.

02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:23.020
Now is it real players or is it computer versus computer?

02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:25.020
Holy shit, I've got to check this out.

02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:27.540
Remember when we did that for WrestleMania 2000?

02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:29.660
Yeah, we ran the entire card,

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:31.540
and in a lot of ways it was accurate.

02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:32.380
And they do that every year.

02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:34.340
Like they do the Madden bullshit like that.

02:24:34.340 --> 02:24:36.060
You know, and I was like, Twitch is all,

02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:37.460
you know, earlier on I'm like, Twitch is awesome.

02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:38.700
Twitch legitimizes our hobby.

02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:41.020
Twitch gives everyone a chance to kind of show off

02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:43.580
and it gives everyone a chance to see people showing off.

02:24:43.580 --> 02:24:45.580
I think that's amazing until we fuck it up

02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:47.640
and fucking it up would be real gambling.

02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:50.060
However, if somebody has managed to turn it into a game,

02:24:50.060 --> 02:24:51.580
that's like the best thing ever.

02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:53.060
They turned a game into another game.

02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:54.460
I am totally checking this shit.

02:24:54.780 --> 02:24:55.900
They took parts from games,

02:24:55.900 --> 02:24:57.540
they turned into a game into another game

02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:58.700
about betting on games.

02:24:58.700 --> 02:25:00.180
As far as the email goes though,

02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:01.540
I think you hit the nail on the head.

02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:06.540
It doesn't matter because like 98% of it is live based.

02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:09.060
You know, you're not going to bet on matches

02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:11.380
that have already taken place.

02:25:11.380 --> 02:25:13.460
So I think it's okay.

02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:15.580
Are they going to not let you broadcast live?

02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:16.940
Is that kind of the trick?

02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:17.960
No, you can broadcast live.

02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:20.700
It's the highlights you can only save in two hour chunks.

02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:22.860
Although I believe they ended up getting rid of those,

02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:25.260
but they're not going to keep your videos on file

02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:28.620
for all time, unless you specifically make a highlight.

02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:29.500
Which is fair.

02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:32.060
Yeah, which is totally fair.

02:25:32.060 --> 02:25:34.460
Vast, vast amounts of storage.

02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:35.300
Yeah.

02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:36.180
Dungeon Buster says in chat,

02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:39.600
I bet on Akuma and he was wrecked by a school girl

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:41.100
with a magic cat, I think.

02:25:42.140 --> 02:25:43.620
Yeah, it's very difficult to pick.

02:25:43.620 --> 02:25:45.140
They're like, there's all the rules in there.

02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:47.060
It's like always bet on Dragon Ball Z

02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:48.940
and never bet on Dragon Ball Z.

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:52.340
Never bet on Akuma because he takes damage

02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:54.180
twice as fast as every other character

02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:56.380
and never bet against a school girl with a magic cat

02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:58.060
because she will fuck your shit up.

02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:01.020
All right.

02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:03.020
That's it for emails tonight, yes?

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:04.780
Fifth dream says always bet waifu.

02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:07.180
Always bet on black.

02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:09.020
Yeah, that's it.

02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:11.420
All right, participate at orangelaundry.com.

02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:14.160
If you want to send us an email in a future week,

02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:15.360
I would appreciate it.

02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:18.180
Let's go, Jamie probably won't

02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:19.480
because then she has to read it,

02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:23.320
but who says we were here to make Jamie's life easy?

02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:26.200
I mean, dance here in studio tonight, people.

02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:27.040
All right.

02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:29.200
Love you, Jamie.

02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:30.440
XOXO.

02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:31.560
Love you, mean it.

02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:33.480
Damn, you better get me a burrito after the show.

02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:35.480
Let's go to the FUs of the week.

02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:40.480
FU to the intensely negative world around us

02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:05.360
and the fact that I came very close

02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:08.280
to just wanting to sit back and watch it all burn

02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:12.120
until I remember that there are truly good people

02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:12.960
in the world.

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:14.600
And me, and me.

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.480
Yes, except Loki, sorry, Loki, you're kind of okay.

02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:18.320
That's not good.

02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:19.160
That's fine.

02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:20.000
I'll stick with him.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.840
FU to Rob for making fun of his,

02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:23.240
for trying to, you know, rub in my face

02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:25.880
that he has a signed poster that I don't even want,

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:29.320
but I'm going to steal now just to prove that I can.

02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:30.160
Fine.

02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:35.160
Also, FU to the ghost bitch in PT that ate me.

02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:37.880
I made her scream and pee.

02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:39.040
I did pee.

02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:41.920
We checked the trousers later.

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:43.000
Doesn't like one of the,

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.240
like doesn't like ghost thing or whatever,

02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:46.360
like pee on you or something.

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:48.240
Cause I remember watching, you know.

02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:49.240
It sounds like it.

02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:50.080
It sure sounds like it.

02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:51.560
Oh, it's they're eating flesh.

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:52.400
They're rending.

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:55.920
Then I'm like, it sounds like you're getting drained upon.

02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:58.400
Watch out because if you talk about this game three times,

02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:00.280
then Shane will instantly be summoned.

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:01.280
Like he'll just appear.

02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:05.520
And then the ghost pissed from her ocular cavity.

02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:07.240
Okay.

02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:10.200
Am I the oldest yourself so I married an axe murderer?

02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:12.240
The only one who liked it.

02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:13.080
Bullshit.

02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:15.640
Like three other people did.

02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.800
Anyways, moving on. Bullshit.

02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:20.000
FU to Jamie for liking the old Michael,

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.120
Mike Myers movie.

02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:23.000
So I married an axe murderer.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.160
FU because you're being a dick.

02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:28.400
Me because I'm being a dick.

02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:29.240
All right.

02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:30.720
Is that it for your refuse, Dan?

02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:31.960
Probably.

02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:32.800
All right, Loki.

02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:34.560
FU for spilling Genesis wrong.

02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:35.840
Loki.

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:36.680
I guess just.

02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:37.520
Fuck that guy.

02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:41.040
I guess just FU to being hot.

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:42.440
It's like hot in here.

02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:43.280
I don't know.

02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:44.720
Sorry. I have the fan on.

02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:46.320
Are you pre-menopausal?

02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:47.320
No, it's just this.

02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:50.960
This is a wooden chair and it doesn't breathe.

02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:52.760
He's got himself on this wall.

02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:53.600
Do what I do.

02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:54.840
I stand up during the show.

02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:55.920
I should start doing that.

02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:56.840
Yeah.

02:28:56.840 --> 02:28:57.840
All right.

02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:00.880
My FU of the week goes to the Sega Genesis

02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:01.720
because I didn't have one.

02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:02.560
You know what?

02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:04.240
Sega Genesis F's you back.

02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:09.000
Also my FU of the week goes to mood swings.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.560
Yay.

02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:11.560
All right.

02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:12.400
That's it.

02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:14.560
Just a couple more stories.

02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:16.920
And then we're going to take your calls here real soon

02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:19.680
at 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype,

02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:20.840
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:22.640
You can call in and talk to Dark Soccer,

02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:25.240
Loki, myself or Dan, I guess.

02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:26.840
All right, Loki.

02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:29.680
So you may remember such games as,

02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:32.840
well, actually it is one game, but Remember Me

02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:36.720
was kind of a game that came out last year

02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:39.360
and it was okay.

02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:43.000
It was this sort of memory hacking,

02:29:43.960 --> 02:29:45.400
I don't know what you would call it,

02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:48.000
like futuristic brawler.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:48.840
I don't know.

02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:49.680
It was kind of strange.

02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:51.520
But anyways, that company Dot Nod,

02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:55.320
they're back with a brand new game called Life is Strange.

02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:57.360
And it's kind of like,

02:29:58.360 --> 02:30:01.400
they're kind of comparing it to like a butterfly effect.

02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:05.240
You know, every action acts a butterfly effect.

02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:07.460
But with the power to rewind time,

02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:10.360
what would you change and what would you,

02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:13.480
and what would it turn out to be,

02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:15.760
change for the better or for worse?

02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:16.920
So I don't know.

02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:18.520
It sounds interesting.

02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.840
It's scheduled to be out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One,

02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:25.920
as well as PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:28.640
And yeah, they only have like a little bit of a teaser

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:31.660
for it, but it looks pretty.

02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:32.600
I just don't know.

02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:35.240
Speaking of which, I wanted to mention though,

02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:37.480
totally aside from this,

02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:40.280
you know, Quantum Break wasn't really on my radar.

02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:43.400
It kind of looks stupid based off the first trailer

02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:44.360
that they showed.

02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:46.480
But man, that gameplay footage that they had

02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:50.280
during the Microsoft press conference was fucking awesome.

02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:51.480
That game looks sweet.

02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:53.520
So looking forward to that.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:55.840
That's it.

02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:57.320
All right.

02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:59.440
Lastly tonight, before we get to phone calls,

02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:02.420
obviously there's been a lot of talk this week

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:05.080
when the world lost Robin Williams,

02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:08.200
the fantastic, fantastic improv comic

02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:11.160
that a lot of you, of course, I know absolutely adored,

02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:12.000
as did we.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:15.240
And he was also a gamer, as I'm sure a lot of you guys knew.

02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:17.600
He had an active World of Warcraft account.

02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:19.720
He appeared in Nintendo commercials

02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:20.920
with his daughter, Zelda,

02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:24.360
which was named after the Legend of Zelda.

02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:26.260
So in gaming news,

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:29.720
how this is relevant to the gaming world,

02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:32.140
besides the fact that Robin was one of us,

02:31:32.140 --> 02:31:34.280
is the fact that gamers are sort of rallying

02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:38.160
for memorializations of Robin Williams in various games.

02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:40.000
There was a couple different change.org petitions

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.040
out there, one of them for Blizzard,

02:31:42.040 --> 02:31:45.240
to memorialize Robin Williams in the game somehow.

02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:47.440
And it sounds like Blizzard was pretty receptive to that.

02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:48.680
Pretty quickly they said, you know,

02:31:48.760 --> 02:31:50.280
we've got something in the works, you know,

02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:51.120
you'll see it soon.

02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:52.880
And I would think that Mork the York

02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:55.200
would make a perfect addition to World of Warcraft,

02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:56.360
who knows, who knows.

02:31:56.360 --> 02:31:59.160
Anyhow, Nintendo also responded

02:31:59.160 --> 02:32:01.760
to a similar change.org petition requesting

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:05.080
that Robin Williams be remembered in a future Zelda title.

02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:06.860
That one might be a little bit harder to pull off,

02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:08.740
but fans, you know, are asking for it.

02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:11.440
Nintendo did put out a response which says,

02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:13.440
Robin Williams was loved at Nintendo.

02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:15.160
Our hearts go out to his entire family,

02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:16.960
and especially to Zelda Williams,

02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:19.520
who we've worked with multiple times.

02:32:19.520 --> 02:32:21.240
We appreciate the outpouring of support

02:32:21.240 --> 02:32:23.680
from the gaming community, and hear the request of fans

02:32:23.680 --> 02:32:25.380
to honor him in a future game.

02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:27.960
We will not be discussing what might be possible

02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:30.320
for future games during this difficult time,

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:33.120
but we will hold our memories of Robin close.

02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:36.880
So I actually kind of really liked that response

02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:38.560
because it's showing that like,

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:42.720
we're not gonna make any decision really rash in the moment,

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:45.320
but obviously we were big fans of him as well,

02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:47.880
and we'll do, you know, it's kind of like,

02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:49.640
we'll assess this at a later time

02:32:49.640 --> 02:32:51.220
when we're ready to talk more about

02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:52.680
what's going on with The Legend of Zelda.

02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:56.640
So that, in that retrospect, it's pretty cool.

02:32:56.640 --> 02:33:00.160
So, anyhow, let's move on.

02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:04.120
It's time to go to the Skype line over at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:06.040
our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

02:33:06.040 --> 02:33:07.400
if you'd like to give the show a call,

02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:10.240
and talk about anything that we've mentioned tonight,

02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:13.040
or perhaps something else you'd like to bring up.

02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:14.960
I'm gonna head over to the Twitter real quick,

02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:18.040
but while I'm loading up our Twitter at twitter.com slash O-L-R,

02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:18.920
let me check in with Loki

02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:20.760
to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:22.620
And again, the Skype line is open.

02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:24.440
They have a new Minecraft set coming out,

02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:26.680
and these new Minecraft sets aren't the like,

02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:28.920
micro, micro Minecraft stuff.

02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:30.840
Lego Minecraft, I should say.

02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:35.360
And they've got one, it's, was it The Farm and The Cave.

02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:39.240
And they look awesome, because now they're minifig size,

02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:41.000
or minifig scale, I guess.

02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:43.760
Let me go to this Twitter topic,

02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:46.000
because somebody sent one in just for Dan.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.320
This comes from SSJ100Matt saying,

02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:51.680
Genesis and Mega Drive news just for Dan.

02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:53.920
Unreleased Bill the Tomato port

02:33:53.920 --> 02:33:56.960
released on reproduction cartridges.

02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:58.960
And he actually sends this to his story

02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:02.400
over at retrocollect.com about this,

02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:04.520
what is it, Bill the Tomato is the game?

02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:05.680
Yeah, Bill the Tomato, wow,

02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:07.160
they actually are putting it in like,

02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:09.000
a little Genesis box and everything.

02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:11.120
That's pretty cool.

02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:12.680
Yeah, they do stuff like that.

02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:17.000
Cool, you know, especially over retrocollect,

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.800
they're huge, huge into the Sega stuff,

02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:22.840
and the Genesis lives on.

02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:25.840
$75 in North America, if you want this.

02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:28.160
100 copies of this game being made available

02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:29.620
using all new parts.

02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:31.680
They've done some like, really incredible stuff.

02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:33.240
I mean, that's like an unreleased prototype,

02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:34.920
but they've done like, some homebrew,

02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:37.500
some brand new stuff, especially for the machine

02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:41.000
that you would be shocked to see coming out on Genesis.

02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:42.600
I seem to remember,

02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:44.120
and I know Bobby's probably listening,

02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:45.880
and he'll correct me on this,

02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:47.400
but I seem to remember he had a pretty big interview

02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:50.680
with somebody who was making like, a Genesis game.

02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:53.160
Like, he had those people on, and I, fuck,

02:34:53.160 --> 02:34:54.160
I don't remember the name of the game.

02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:55.160
He'll jump in there with it.

02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:57.840
There's this RPG that was like, a huge huge deal,

02:34:57.840 --> 02:34:59.480
and I always forget the name of it, but.

02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:00.320
And he had the developers on the show.

02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:02.460
It just looks cool as hell.

02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:04.840
And I really do wish that, had I known about it sooner.

02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:06.320
The Baker Prince, was that what it was called?

02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:07.360
Ah, fuck, I don't know.

02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:08.360
Had I been on it sooner,

02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:10.560
I probably would have ponied up for a copy.

02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:12.640
There was a Kickstarter, for one.

02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:14.480
There was actually, there was one that was more recent

02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:17.740
that was a Kickstarter, that they were using Unity,

02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:20.520
but I don't know how they would port that to Genesis,

02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:24.920
but it had, it was sprites with normal maps on them,

02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:26.920
so they had real-time lighting on the sprites,

02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:28.060
which is kinda cool.

02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:30.840
Yeah, just stuff that you wouldn't expect

02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:35.400
an X60 or a 68000 and a Z80 to be able to do, you know?

02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:37.400
But advanced programming techniques,

02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:40.520
they can take old consoles and make them do things

02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:41.840
that you're just like, holy shit,

02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:43.400
why couldn't they have done that back in the day?

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:44.880
Well, they didn't know how.

02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:47.240
One of the guys that we see at Atari party every year

02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:51.360
has this mind-blowing version of Space Harrier

02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:53.000
that plays on the Atari 800.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.600
It must use a huge amount of memory,

02:35:55.600 --> 02:35:57.540
comparative to what they had available at the time,

02:35:57.540 --> 02:36:00.400
but it looks like the arcade game.

02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:02.220
Not like, wow, it's the arcade game,

02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:04.420
but I mean, it looks more like the arcade game

02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:05.900
than a Master System version,

02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:08.120
like a Sega Genesis version, anything like that.

02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:09.760
And Bobby must have been AFK,

02:36:09.900 --> 02:36:10.740
because he didn't jump in,

02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:12.120
but Dartetsuya jumped in and said,

02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:13.720
Baker Prince, and sure enough,

02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:17.200
I went to look up the Wiki on it and it was Baker Prince.

02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:18.220
The thing about Baker Prince,

02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:21.120
it actually did come out in 96.

02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:23.320
I think it was in like Chinese originally.

02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:27.600
So the re-translation of the game happened much later.

02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:32.600
2006 was, I believe, the tangible release,

02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:35.440
and then they did Windows and all that in 2013.

02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:36.280
So there you go.

02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:38.440
I thought it was more recent, but yeah,

02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:40.000
that sounds very plausible.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.520
Yeah, it's supposed to be just this amazing game.

02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:45.440
And at 96, I guess it would have been a pretty late life-

02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:46.280
It would have been, yeah.

02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:47.640
Mega draft title.

02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:50.040
Again, I'm gonna throw that out, 1877 Game OLR,

02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:51.000
our username on Skype,

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.540
OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give the show a call.

02:36:53.540 --> 02:36:56.380
Do we have any other last minute stories from Loki?

02:36:56.380 --> 02:36:57.220
No.

02:36:57.220 --> 02:36:58.240
I think I saw anything else on Twitter.

02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:00.220
No, no, we do not.

02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:03.800
Well, Dan, if nobody's gonna call in,

02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:06.800
you have plenty of time to reminisce more about the Genesis.

02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:11.160
My wife showed me a picture of a cat driving a car

02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:13.440
on like a Logitech wheel.

02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:14.760
Oh, wait- It's a racing wheel.

02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:16.160
I do have some more tweets.

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.200
It is awesome.

02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:19.040
This is really important.

02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:21.440
Vizaya925 sent us two tweets.

02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:22.280
The first one says,

02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:23.880
I'd love a complete remaster

02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:25.400
of the original Resident Evil.

02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:26.460
That game was awesome.

02:37:26.460 --> 02:37:28.120
That was one of our stories last week, if you remember.

02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:31.000
And you can have one, it's on the GameCube.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:34.240
And Vizaya also responded and said,

02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:37.520
Jim Boy's Tacos have the best fish tacos ever.

02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:40.040
Tell Jamie she's trippin'.

02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:40.860
Which-

02:37:40.860 --> 02:37:42.800
No, they have the best vomit tacos.

02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:44.960
I wanna point out, I wanna point out-

02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:46.440
See, that's what summoned Shane.

02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:47.280
No, this is important.

02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:48.560
It's the badness of Jim Boy's.

02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:49.560
This is important.

02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:52.280
That tweet retweeted by the official

02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:54.160
Jim Boy's Tacos account.

02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:59.160
So Jim Boy's Tacos has indirectly told Jamie she's trippin'.

02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:02.040
It is, yeah.

02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:05.480
Jim Boy's Tacos is this weird acquired taste, I guess.

02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:06.840
It's a local chain, I feel like.

02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:07.680
It's a local chain.

02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:08.920
It's called the International Show.

02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:09.760
Oh, gross.

02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:11.360
And people are like, what the hell is this taco place

02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:12.480
that you're talking about?

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:14.160
Okay, dear Jim Boy's Tacos,

02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:17.120
if you get me free tacos for a year,

02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:19.040
I might say that one of them is good.

02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:21.040
Why would you want free tacos that you hate?

02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:21.880
Take it down to me.

02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:24.160
The first night that Jamie moved out here,

02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:27.320
I went and picked up Jim Boy's Tacos

02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:29.860
and it just destroyed her.

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:32.500
I mean, she was just not a happy girl.

02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:34.060
And it's very unfortunate because-

02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:35.580
And then we went to the one by your grandmother's house

02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:36.420
and I was taking her bathroom for two hours.

02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:38.420
I think that was the one I went to, I think.

02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:40.580
You know, there's people that live in like New York

02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:41.740
or something listening to this show going,

02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:43.140
I don't give a fuck about Jim Boy's Tacos.

02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:43.980
You know what?

02:38:43.980 --> 02:38:46.380
We don't give a fuck about you not giving a fuck.

02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:48.420
You want to see how many fucks I have to give?

02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:50.900
My fuck's given ratio is extremely low,

02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:52.020
even compared to yours.

02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:54.380
So eat a dick, taco.

02:38:54.380 --> 02:38:57.100
1-877-GAMO-L-R.

02:38:57.100 --> 02:38:58.900
Are you using him on Skype or in Sondra?

02:38:58.940 --> 02:38:59.980
No, nobody really felt like that.

02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:00.940
It was just Rob talking.

02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:04.540
For what it's worth, Visaya925,

02:39:04.540 --> 02:39:07.340
I had Jim Boy's Tacos on Friday and they were fine.

02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:08.740
So just saying.

02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:09.560
I like them.

02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:10.880
They're covered with like that weird powdery cheese.

02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:11.940
That's amazing.

02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:12.780
It's called Parmesan.

02:39:12.780 --> 02:39:13.620
All right, we got-

02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:14.460
It's not Parmesan.

02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:15.520
Finally, our phones are lighting up.

02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:16.360
Let's get to it.

02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:17.180
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:18.780
Who's this?

02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:20.100
Holy crap, I'm on the show.

02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:20.940
Holy crap, who's this?

02:39:20.940 --> 02:39:22.180
This is EA Skeezy.

02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:23.220
EA Skeezy?

02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:24.100
What's up, buddy?

02:39:25.380 --> 02:39:27.260
Malcolm, how you guys doing?

02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:28.780
We're doing good.

02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:30.900
From emailing to live on air,

02:39:30.900 --> 02:39:33.340
what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:35.580
Well, honestly, the girlfriend had to work

02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:37.780
third shift tonight and I randomly thought,

02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:39.420
well, hey, OLR's on.

02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:41.620
I don't have to wait till Monday.

02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:43.580
Let's call it and see how the game's doing.

02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:44.660
God, I'm lonely.

02:39:45.900 --> 02:39:47.520
Are you lonely, EA Skeezy?

02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:48.360
Is that what's up?

02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:49.420
I'll smack my husband.

02:39:49.420 --> 02:39:52.220
Are you lonely tonight?

02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:54.060
Do you miss me tonight?

02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:55.060
I'm just bored.

02:39:55.060 --> 02:39:56.260
All right, well, EA Skeezy,

02:39:56.700 --> 02:39:59.620
I'm glad you called to get entertained by us.

02:39:59.620 --> 02:40:02.540
You don't have any statements or opinions

02:40:02.540 --> 02:40:05.300
you wish to inflict upon the show tonight?

02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:10.380
Well, for one, I absolutely hate Time Warner Cable.

02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:13.820
Yeah, dude, they can suck a dick.

02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:16.140
Well, since we were talking about cable companies,

02:40:16.140 --> 02:40:17.980
why not spread the hate?

02:40:17.980 --> 02:40:20.340
What did Time Warner do to piss you off?

02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:25.380
They sent just, I was a little late on the bill,

02:40:25.380 --> 02:40:28.700
owed them about $100 and that's about it.

02:40:28.700 --> 02:40:32.020
And they sent the guy to the door to come get the modem

02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:34.260
and take everything away.

02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:37.020
And I told them, well, I'll just hold on to the modem

02:40:37.020 --> 02:40:38.300
cause I'll make the payment.

02:40:38.300 --> 02:40:39.540
It'll turn back on.

02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:41.180
Everything will be fine.

02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:43.180
Guy said, yeah, that's exactly how it works.

02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:45.700
So he left, but he failed to mention

02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:48.740
that he disconnected me downstairs in the basement.

02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:50.340
And now I have to go through the process

02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:52.540
of having a guy come here and put in a new modem

02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:54.040
and all that crap.

02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:55.440
And that's, you know, that's weeks

02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:58.920
and I got to pay service fees and crap like that.

02:40:58.920 --> 02:40:59.760
So, you know-

02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:02.040
That's what happens when you don't pay your bills.

02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:04.280
Well, that sounds like a worst interest system

02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:06.440
than GameStop's credit card, to be honest.

02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:07.280
I don't know.

02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:08.360
GameStop has a credit card?

02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:09.200
You didn't hear about that?

02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:12.120
Holy fucking crap, that's like the worst idea ever.

02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:12.960
You know what?

02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:14.040
You need to listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:16.800
We talk about all this shit that you're missing.

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:17.640
That's amazing.

02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:19.720
You know, you think my wife would come home

02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:21.080
and tell me these things.

02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:21.920
No, no.

02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:23.280
No.

02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:24.240
Anyway, all right.

02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:29.080
Well, EA Skeezy, to amuse Dan tonight,

02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:29.920
since he's taunting you

02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:31.760
for not having you paid your bill on time.

02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:33.160
What is your favorite Genesis game?

02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:35.120
Yeah, what is your favorite Genesis game?

02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:38.600
My favorite Genesis game, honestly,

02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:40.680
I did not have one as- Five seconds.

02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:41.840
Okay, hang on. Same rock.

02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:43.480
I didn't have one.

02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:44.600
Super Nintendo, man.

02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:45.960
Yes, he was a Super Nintendo.

02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:48.160
Okay, what's your favorite Super Nintendo game?

02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:50.960
Super Metroid, for sure.

02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:52.120
Dude, dude, fuck yes.

02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:53.680
All right, correct answer.

02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:55.440
Correct answer.

02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:57.720
Honestly, I honestly played it two weeks ago.

02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:58.960
You are damn right.

02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:00.720
See, at the very least, I can get behind you.

02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:01.560
If you didn't have a Genesis,

02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:03.200
but you were rocking Super Metroid,

02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:04.560
you made the right choice.

02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:06.520
Which, every time I try to get you

02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:08.360
to play Super Metroid, you won't.

02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:11.360
Because my thumbs are terrible now,

02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:14.400
and the Super Nintendo controller actually hurts my thumbs.

02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:16.240
EA Skeezy, will you come over, crash on-

02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:17.600
If I could use my Genesis 6 button pad,

02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:18.440
I'm on the Super Nintendo.

02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:19.360
Will you come crash on our couch

02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:20.200
and play Super Metroid for us?

02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:22.240
None of these people are ever touching my sofa.

02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:23.080
What?

02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:25.560
Especially this guy, he can't pay his bills,

02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:27.760
he didn't own a Genesis.

02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:29.480
I'm gonna punch my husband in the face.

02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:31.600
His only redeeming quality is that he listens to OLR

02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:32.600
and he likes Super Metroid.

02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:34.160
You don't even listen to OLR.

02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:35.440
I know.

02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:36.280
This man has no redeeming qualities.

02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:38.440
That's basically Rob's redeeming qualities, too.

02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:40.960
All right.

02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:44.280
If I'm ever in the area, I can cook and clean,

02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:46.680
and I can maybe stay a night just to hang out.

02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:48.720
So when changing the cat's litter and you're in.

02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:49.800
Dear God, no.

02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:51.880
That's not even a good deal for you.

02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:53.640
My girlfriend makes me do it all the time.

02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:55.240
I hate to fucking do the cat's litter,

02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:57.280
but I'm fucking pro at it now.

02:42:57.280 --> 02:42:58.120
All right.

02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:01.960
EA Skeezy, any last thoughts for our listeners tonight

02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:03.000
before we let you go?

02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:06.040
No, I just hope everybody enjoyed the show.

02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:08.080
I look forward to hearing the majority

02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:09.560
that I missed in the morning.

02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:10.400
All right, sounds good.

02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:11.240
We'll try to get it up for you.

02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:12.080
Keep writing us every week

02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:12.960
because I like your emails.

02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:13.800
All right.

02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:14.640
Yeah.

02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:15.480
Definitely.

02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:16.320
Bye, my friend.

02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:17.160
I'll send you a new one next week.

02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:18.120
Yep, good to hear you guys.

02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:19.200
Later.

02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:20.040
All right.

02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:20.880
That was EA Skeezy,

02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:23.080
who I believe is the first time actually on the show,

02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:24.800
even though we get the emails a lot.

02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:26.000
Now the phones are lighting up.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:27.160
Let's go back to it again.

02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:28.040
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:28.880
Who's this?

02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:29.960
Hey, guys, it's Jason.

02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:30.800
Hey, Jason.

02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:31.640
How you doing?

02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:32.480
Doing pretty good.

02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:33.720
Good to hear from you.

02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:36.040
Every show that's a reminiscing show is a good show

02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:38.160
because after reading,

02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:40.600
it's funny because I jumped in on Facebook

02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:43.400
just to correct the fact that Alan said 13 and not eight

02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:44.800
because he said X and not V.

02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:45.640
Oh, did he?

02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:46.480
I didn't even catch it.

02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:47.300
Yeah.

02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:48.140
Maybe he edited it since-

02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:49.900
Did it make you feel better about yourself?

02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:54.260
I am one of those assholes on the internet, unfortunately.

02:43:54.260 --> 02:43:55.100
So yes.

02:43:55.100 --> 02:43:55.920
Good man.

02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:56.760
So scary.

02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:57.600
And I meant to read the comments

02:43:57.600 --> 02:43:59.700
to see if anybody else had the whole Crackdown Halo thing.

02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:02.540
I'm totally not surprised that they did.

02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:05.580
But one of the other things that sprang to mind,

02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:07.980
talking about PlayStation Magazine demos and whatnot,

02:44:07.980 --> 02:44:11.440
was the disc, the issue, whatever date, whatever issue,

02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:13.140
that had Jet Moto 2 on it.

02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:16.200
Everybody else, if I remember correctly,

02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:18.560
I seem to remember three games on that disc.

02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:20.000
I love Jet Moto 2.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.840
The level, the music for the stage that they picked,

02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:25.760
I'm fairly sure it was just a one level demo, was amazing.

02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:26.720
But if I remember correctly,

02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:29.840
that same disc also had Xenogears

02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:32.360
and either Tomba 1 or Tomba 2.

02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:35.480
Oh, Tomba's such a good game.

02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:37.200
And I've never played either of them.

02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:38.400
People know about it,

02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:41.640
but the mainstream audience doesn't know about it.

02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:44.200
Yes, that game definitely has cult status.

02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:46.080
Man, I miss Jet Moto.

02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:47.680
That series is awesome.

02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:49.600
No, Jet Moto 1 and 2 were awesome.

02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:50.440
And then what was it?

02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:52.600
The third one was the 989 one, right?

02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:54.120
Because the first two were by Singletrack,

02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:54.960
if I remember correctly.

02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:55.800
Oh, I never played the third one.

02:44:55.800 --> 02:44:57.760
The third one went to 989 Studios.

02:44:57.760 --> 02:44:59.760
And 989 Studios had a way of taking everything

02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:02.480
that they touched and just making absolute shit out of it.

02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:04.200
Was that also the case with Cool Borders?

02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:06.320
That like the first three was somebody with a 989 afterword?

02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:07.940
Every Sony franchise,

02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:09.960
when they got rid of that original,

02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:11.200
when the PlayStation came out,

02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:13.240
Sony had a literal dream team of developers.

02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:14.280
It just wasn't pushed as much,

02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:17.840
but they had guys who were just really good at making games.

02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:19.640
And then they ended up taking those guys.

02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:21.720
And after they built these franchises and said,

02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:23.960
all right, now fucking pay us.

02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:25.840
Sony said, oh, thank you for your work.

02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:28.480
We're going to give your franchise over to 989 Studios

02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:30.040
who made games for, you know,

02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:34.080
peanuts and toffee and just fucking ruined them.

02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:36.360
And the game and the fact that they were made

02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:37.200
at that scale show.

02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:38.600
Jet Moto, blah.

02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:41.040
All their sports franchises, blah.

02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:43.120
Jesus Christ.

02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:44.080
It's a little unfortunate

02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:47.800
because I actually bought Jet Moto 2 for original PSP.

02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:49.280
I don't know if it's going to be better on the Vita.

02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:52.440
Probably not because like the game just doesn't feel right.

02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:54.040
And I don't know if that's just because

02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:55.640
I'm missing the second triggers

02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:58.000
because the PSPs don't have two sets of triggers

02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:58.840
on each side.

02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:00.280
You got to have that PlayStation control.

02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:01.640
Yeah, you really do.

02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:03.920
It's I, and I also,

02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:06.140
I actually don't even have a console PlayStation anymore,

02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:07.720
but I'm looking forward to,

02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:11.200
I want to say that the store said that you could play it

02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:12.040
on a console as well, but I'm sure.

02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:13.240
PlayStation stuff is still cheap

02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:15.800
and it's still out there and just get it now

02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:17.100
because they're mechanical.

02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:19.160
They're only going to get harder to find

02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:21.080
and they're going to get more expensive

02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:25.560
and just, you know, eventually titles like, you know,

02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:28.860
Warhawk and Jet Moto and ESPN Extreme Games,

02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:32.440
all those weird early PlayStation games that were so good

02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:35.040
from that early generation will be gone

02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:37.960
because they're not going to age like cartridges do

02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:39.240
where there's no moving parts.

02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:40.740
There's really nothing to break.

02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:44.020
Eventually it's going to be damn hard to find a PlayStation.

02:46:44.020 --> 02:46:44.860
Yup.

02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:48.800
All right, wow, all right.

02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:51.420
It's sort of, I just,

02:46:51.420 --> 02:46:53.620
you guys talking about like the PS1 demos and everything,

02:46:53.620 --> 02:46:55.420
it really does make me think about how all of that

02:46:55.420 --> 02:46:57.140
is really like a lost art because, you know,

02:46:57.140 --> 02:46:59.100
now obviously we do all the download demos,

02:46:59.100 --> 02:47:02.460
but even it seems like download demos even are less and less

02:47:02.460 --> 02:47:03.620
depending on the console.

02:47:03.620 --> 02:47:05.360
Like I think about like Wii U,

02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:06.700
it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot

02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:08.720
of downloadable demos on something like Wii U.

02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:10.340
Want me to tell you why?

02:47:10.980 --> 02:47:13.700
Because they figured it was a waste of time.

02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:16.100
The problem was is that they figured out eventually

02:47:16.100 --> 02:47:17.580
after all these years of doing demos

02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:20.660
that having a demo out didn't really affect

02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:23.500
the sales of your title positively

02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:27.900
and could in fact greatly affect it negatively.

02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:30.580
And since demos are typically early versions of games

02:47:30.580 --> 02:47:32.420
that lack polish and whatnot,

02:47:32.420 --> 02:47:35.220
unless you spent a lot of extra time and development money

02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:38.840
making a good demo, you probably were going to ruin your game.

02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:41.440
Plus tons of people would just play that demo and go,

02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:42.980
eh, it was cool.

02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:44.560
So companies pretty much decided

02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:47.120
unless it's something AAA and they need to create hype

02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:49.320
to buy themselves another six months of development time

02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:50.880
without losing momentum,

02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:52.640
then they're not going to give you that free taste.

02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:54.720
They're just going to let us sit back.

02:47:54.720 --> 02:47:56.880
At the same time, you know what's kind of weird about that?

02:47:56.880 --> 02:47:59.000
That was probably always the case for consoles.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:00.960
I know it was always the case for consoles,

02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:03.600
but like I started playing through Serious Sam

02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:07.720
and I was reminded of how that and Shadow Warrior

02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:11.560
and I know at least one or two other games

02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:14.160
that the demo was the same engine,

02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:17.380
but had otherwise shorter, unique content.

02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:19.640
And when you actually bought the full game, it said,

02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:22.060
hey, here's the extra content from the demo

02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:23.640
in addition to what you can play with the whole,

02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:25.380
with the full game, which is,

02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:27.360
and my idea, really cool way of doing it,

02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:29.680
especially since demos are more or less,

02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:31.760
we're more or less always digital,

02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:32.980
you know, BBSs and whatnot.

02:48:32.980 --> 02:48:35.060
They can make the game, master it, ship it,

02:48:35.060 --> 02:48:37.360
get it into stores during that time,

02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:39.120
whip up new content,

02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:41.280
be able to put that on digital mechanisms.

02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:42.880
And there's really no way,

02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:44.840
no reason why they couldn't be doing that right now.

02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:46.920
Well, PC demos are kind of a different world.

02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:47.760
Sure, absolutely.

02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:49.160
Because usually it's just like,

02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:50.920
they're going to take a little bit of the code,

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:52.280
they're going to polish it up a tiny bit

02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:54.500
and they're going to make it available for download.

02:48:54.500 --> 02:48:55.340
With console demos,

02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:58.280
because they needed to be mastered onto a disc,

02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:01.400
they needed more lead time.

02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:04.780
So, I mean, that's a super, super valid point.

02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:06.320
And it's also not applicable to everything.

02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:09.520
It's super applicable to those frenzied action games,

02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:12.400
which you get an RPG or an adventure game or a puzzle.

02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:14.380
I guess there's room for new puzzles

02:49:14.380 --> 02:49:16.280
to be made in a puzzle game, but like-

02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:17.240
Yeah, you know, it's a puzzle game,

02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:18.080
you want to do the demo-

02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:20.440
Peggle and other little trash games like that.

02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:21.760
Trash is the wrong word, but, you know,

02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:22.880
simple little games,

02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:24.920
there's not going to be interesting, unique content

02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:26.880
you're going to be able to do with those sorts of things.

02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:27.980
All right, well, Jason,

02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:30.640
I appreciate the walk down memory lane of demos here.

02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:32.240
Any other quick thoughts before we let you go?

02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:33.960
Because the phones are lighting up,

02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:36.300
so I want to try and get one more call in.

02:49:36.300 --> 02:49:37.640
I'm not witty enough this fast enough.

02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:38.480
Take another call.

02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:40.140
All right, take care, buddy.

02:49:40.140 --> 02:49:40.980
Bye.

02:49:40.980 --> 02:49:42.740
That guy's my favorite caller.

02:49:42.740 --> 02:49:43.580
He's a good guy.

02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:44.400
He's a good guy.

02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:45.240
All right, yeah, our phones are lighting up,

02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:47.300
so let's try to take at least one more call here

02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:48.960
before we wrap up the show tonight.

02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:49.800
Let's get to it.

02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:50.620
Hi, you're on Orange Home Radio.

02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:51.460
Who's this?

02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:52.300
Hey, can you hear me?

02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:54.360
Yeah, we can hear you, and we can see you.

02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:55.420
Hey, hello.

02:49:55.420 --> 02:49:56.740
Hi, it's Brozime.

02:49:56.740 --> 02:49:57.740
Brozime!

02:49:57.740 --> 02:49:59.940
Hey, is this your first time calling the show?

02:49:59.940 --> 02:50:00.780
Yeah, yes.

02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:01.620
That is two first time calls?

02:50:01.620 --> 02:50:02.620
Completely the first time.

02:50:02.620 --> 02:50:05.340
Actually, I think it's my first time here being live at all.

02:50:05.340 --> 02:50:06.180
Oh my gosh.

02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:08.120
The people are coming in the new crowd.

02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:08.960
The people are coming to see Dan.

02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:10.460
Were you here just to see Dan?

02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:12.260
Just say yes.

02:50:12.260 --> 02:50:13.980
I think the first time I heard Dan,

02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:16.780
since I've only been listening since like episode 500,

02:50:16.780 --> 02:50:20.100
was just a voice in the background yelling at you.

02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:21.420
That is, because I was asking.

02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:22.260
That's about accurate.

02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:23.100
I believe the quote was,

02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:23.940
What's up, bitches?

02:50:23.940 --> 02:50:24.760
Sup, bitches?

02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:25.600
Yeah, because...

02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:26.500
Oh yeah, that sounds about right.

02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:28.300
Dan had brought over a bed.

02:50:28.300 --> 02:50:30.140
When Jamie and Dan moved, they had an extra bed,

02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:31.300
so they brought it over to this house,

02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:32.380
because we have all this space now.

02:50:32.380 --> 02:50:34.340
So yeah, that was the episode they brought it over.

02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:36.180
When we brought Shane something to sleep on.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:37.840
Yeah, you guys definitely don't want to hear

02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:38.900
about the beds in my house.

02:50:38.900 --> 02:50:40.860
I want to hear about what you want to say tonight.

02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:42.220
What's up?

02:50:42.220 --> 02:50:43.380
Uh, not much.

02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:46.240
Got off work early and was able to make it home

02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:48.540
to be in chat whenever you guys are reading emails and stuff.

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:50.220
So I missed the first part of the show,

02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:53.660
but I'm glad I got to hear like the majority, I guess.

02:50:53.660 --> 02:50:55.580
Yeah, we've been having live stream drops anyway.

02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:57.380
Wait, so you're like EA Skis.

02:50:57.380 --> 02:50:58.860
You don't have any comments on what's going on?

02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:00.580
What's your favorite Genesis game?

02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:02.420
Ha.

02:51:02.420 --> 02:51:03.740
Well, please tell us your favorite Genesis game

02:51:03.740 --> 02:51:05.900
if you don't got nothing better to say.

02:51:06.580 --> 02:51:07.740
I think it was Sonic 2.

02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:09.100
Okay, good. That's valid.

02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:11.420
Sonic 2 is a great game.

02:51:11.420 --> 02:51:14.280
I think Sonic 2 is the only Sega Genesis game

02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:16.020
I played though at a friend's house.

02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:17.740
It is the best selling game,

02:51:17.740 --> 02:51:20.100
I believe for the Sega Genesis.

02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:23.500
It is the best selling game of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.

02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:26.060
And it's also probably one of the most like

02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:28.600
speculated about games in terms of beta versions

02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:29.440
in the history of games.

02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:31.500
And it's also one of the most cursed at versions

02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:33.460
because of the chemical plant.

02:51:33.460 --> 02:51:34.420
Chemical plant zone.

02:51:34.420 --> 02:51:35.740
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

02:51:36.460 --> 02:51:37.500
And that's like stage two.

02:51:37.500 --> 02:51:39.380
So you mentioned you had to go to a friend's to play it.

02:51:39.380 --> 02:51:40.620
Were you a Super Nintendo guy?

02:51:40.620 --> 02:51:42.060
Or let me guess, you're probably-

02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:42.900
Oh yeah.

02:51:42.900 --> 02:51:44.220
Okay, I was gonna say, you're probably young enough

02:51:44.220 --> 02:51:47.140
where you only had a PlayStation or something.

02:51:47.140 --> 02:51:51.100
Well, the weird thing is that I had a Super Nintendo

02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:54.180
like while the N64 was out.

02:51:54.180 --> 02:51:55.220
Okay.

02:51:55.220 --> 02:51:57.620
So I was just like late to the party basically

02:51:57.620 --> 02:52:02.180
because my parents had the, not N64, Super Nintendo.

02:52:02.180 --> 02:52:05.700
So I was playing that for ages before I got an N64.

02:52:06.540 --> 02:52:08.260
So what was your favorite Super Nintendo game?

02:52:08.260 --> 02:52:10.180
Favorite Super Nintendo game was definitely

02:52:10.180 --> 02:52:12.220
looks like the original Legend of Zelda.

02:52:12.220 --> 02:52:13.780
Like that was my favorite game.

02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:15.580
Well, the original Legend of Zelda was NES.

02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:17.580
But if you're talking about a Link to the Past.

02:52:17.580 --> 02:52:19.100
The Link to the Past, sorry.

02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:21.160
That is, to be fair, that's the second best answer

02:52:21.160 --> 02:52:22.480
you could give next to Super Metroid.

02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:23.780
That's another game I cussed out a whole lot.

02:52:23.780 --> 02:52:25.660
I did play a lot of Super Metroid,

02:52:25.660 --> 02:52:27.860
but when I was little, I had no hope

02:52:27.860 --> 02:52:29.700
of completing Super Metroid.

02:52:29.700 --> 02:52:30.840
That's fair.

02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:33.300
And to the chatters, yes, I am saying

02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:34.940
those are better answers than Chrono Trigger.

02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:35.900
Sorry about it.

02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:36.900
Damn right.

02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:37.740
Sorry, not sorry.

02:52:37.740 --> 02:52:40.020
I didn't play Chrono Trigger until like

02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:42.460
after I was already done with my N64.

02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:45.120
I like this guy.

02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:47.720
That was a game I didn't, I had no idea.

02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:49.620
I had no idea about Chrono Trigger

02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:52.240
until like I was so much older

02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:53.580
than whenever I had been playing

02:52:53.580 --> 02:52:55.780
like my Super Nintendo originally.

02:52:55.780 --> 02:52:56.760
It was silly.

02:52:57.940 --> 02:52:58.780
All right.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:00.840
Bobby's in chat saying,

02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:03.000
I'm gonna take down Rob's internet for reals.

02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:06.400
Great, I'm gonna get a DLS attack

02:53:06.400 --> 02:53:07.240
during the show.

02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:08.720
Chrono Trigger is such a good game.

02:53:08.720 --> 02:53:10.240
I'm not dissing Chrono Trigger.

02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:13.400
I like to poke fun at you crazed foamy fanboys.

02:53:13.400 --> 02:53:16.160
I never, never have purchased Chrono Trigger

02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:17.660
because my friend left it at my house

02:53:17.660 --> 02:53:18.940
and then he moved to another town

02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:20.780
and then I moved out here with it.

02:53:20.780 --> 02:53:22.920
Then I married her so it became community property

02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:26.040
and now it's just as much fun as whoever she stole it from.

02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:28.160
You ever come after it, I will kill you.

02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:29.820
I have never played Chrono Trigger.

02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:32.280
However, no prenup.

02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:34.800
So we have 50% ownership of everything.

02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:38.480
So that means I also have half the copy of Dracula X

02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:41.240
and all of those boxed SNES games.

02:53:41.240 --> 02:53:43.320
I usually need to play half of Dracula X.

02:53:43.320 --> 02:53:45.580
She has that game with the fricking dish.

02:53:46.520 --> 02:53:47.360
Yes, I do.

02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:49.220
The Cardcaptor Sakura game.

02:53:49.220 --> 02:53:50.060
I love that game.

02:53:50.060 --> 02:53:51.160
I'm gonna play it.

02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:52.000
All right.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:53.440
Isn't there a Cardcaptor Sakura anime?

02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:54.600
Quick, hang up.

02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:56.480
All right now, Brozime quick,

02:53:56.480 --> 02:53:59.000
any last thoughts before we let you go?

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:00.560
Thanks for reading my email

02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:02.720
and talking about my channel, I guess.

02:54:02.720 --> 02:54:05.360
I just started doing it like a while ago.

02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:06.920
So anyone that wants to go check that out

02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:07.960
can go check that out.

02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:09.960
And it's fun, I guess.

02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:10.800
I don't know.

02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:11.620
I've been playing Nazgoth recently.

02:54:11.620 --> 02:54:12.460
I just came out on Steam.

02:54:12.460 --> 02:54:13.880
Wait, hold up a sign with your address on it.

02:54:13.880 --> 02:54:14.860
It's not a video show.

02:54:14.860 --> 02:54:16.360
We see the video, they don't.

02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:18.200
So we'll have to put it out there.

02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:19.760
Oh yeah, that's hilarious.

02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:21.320
Dan, only one plug a show.

02:54:21.320 --> 02:54:24.320
We used to have a video.

02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:25.480
Yeah, back in the day we did.

02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:26.320
That was awesome.

02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:27.160
Yeah, it was all right.

02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:28.360
Remember we played Street Fighter on it?

02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:29.200
Yeah.

02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:30.020
That's so cool.

02:54:30.620 --> 02:54:32.660
All right, Brozime, are you still there, Brozime?

02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:34.340
His video froze up.

02:54:34.340 --> 02:54:37.020
Is Brozime, uh-oh, there's a problem with this call.

02:54:37.020 --> 02:54:39.620
Or did our entire internet just crap out again?

02:54:39.620 --> 02:54:40.460
Is that the problem?

02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:41.560
It's Bobby gotcha.

02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:42.500
Yeah, oh yeah.

02:54:42.500 --> 02:54:43.700
Fucking Bobby.

02:54:44.780 --> 02:54:46.060
All right, I think he came back,

02:54:46.060 --> 02:54:46.900
but we were wrapping it up.

02:54:46.900 --> 02:54:48.220
Sorry about that, don't know what happened.

02:54:48.220 --> 02:54:49.140
I don't know what happened either.

02:54:49.140 --> 02:54:49.980
I'll blame the internet.

02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:51.660
All right, but Brozime, we are gonna let you go

02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:53.460
so we can wrap up the show, but have a good night.

02:54:53.460 --> 02:54:54.540
All right, sounds good, you guys too.

02:54:54.540 --> 02:54:55.420
All right, later.

02:54:56.420 --> 02:55:00.060
Ah, if it's not the frickin' feed sending

02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:03.020
to the Shoutcast server, then it's Skype,

02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:04.500
and if it's not that, then it's this.

02:55:04.500 --> 02:55:06.580
All right, sorry to those that didn't get through,

02:55:06.580 --> 02:55:08.500
because nobody called for five minutes,

02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:10.060
and all of a sudden it was lighting up on fire,

02:55:10.060 --> 02:55:11.420
so there's a few people that didn't get through.

02:55:11.420 --> 02:55:12.820
Please consider sending us an email.

02:55:12.820 --> 02:55:15.640
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:17.820
Give Dark Soccer some work to do.

02:55:17.820 --> 02:55:19.180
Anyhow, that is about it.

02:55:19.180 --> 02:55:20.220
We're gonna wrap up the show.

02:55:20.220 --> 02:55:21.420
We were done with last minute stories.

02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:23.180
We got the Twitter stuff.

02:55:23.180 --> 02:55:25.260
So, actually, wait, no, we didn't finish the Twitter stuff,

02:55:25.940 --> 02:55:27.940
because I had one other tweet I wanted to read here

02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:31.180
from our old pal, Pika Uno had sent something to.

02:55:31.180 --> 02:55:33.320
Oh yes, it was about the whole TV tax,

02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:35.660
because last week we talked about TV tax overseas,

02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:39.220
and Pika Uno does live in what I call London land,

02:55:39.220 --> 02:55:41.620
and Pika Uno says, it's not the TV tax,

02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:44.060
it's the license fee, and no, you'll still have

02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:46.200
to pay the license fee to watch any live TV.

02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:48.460
The important difference is that this is how the BBC

02:55:48.460 --> 02:55:50.580
is funded, directly by the public,

02:55:50.580 --> 02:55:52.460
not through the government.

02:55:52.460 --> 02:55:55.020
So, a minor correction there too.

02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:57.180
Probably some other Downton Abbey tangent

02:55:57.180 --> 02:55:58.140
we went on last week.

02:55:58.140 --> 02:56:00.540
All right, anyway, that is it.

02:56:00.540 --> 02:56:02.640
We're gonna wrap up here at Orange Laundry Radio.

02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:04.100
Hey, thanks you guys for listening to the show.

02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:05.020
Really appreciate it.

02:56:05.020 --> 02:56:06.980
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio

02:56:06.980 --> 02:56:08.200
and you stuck with us the whole show,

02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:11.060
why not tell a friend or two or 17 about our program

02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:11.960
and help spread the word,

02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:14.560
because you're all we got is word of mouth.

02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:17.380
We don't have a major magazine backing us.

02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:19.300
We don't have demo discs of OLR out there.

02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:21.660
Actually, 1E3, we did have OLR demo discs,

02:56:21.660 --> 02:56:22.500
now that I think about it.

02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:23.540
I still have some.

02:56:23.540 --> 02:56:26.460
I was gonna say, those will be collector's items someday,

02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:28.380
Loki, when we're big and famous.

02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:31.700
All right, anyway, that's about gonna do it,

02:56:31.700 --> 02:56:33.580
but I wanna say, Dan, thank you for being here.

02:56:33.580 --> 02:56:36.260
Always fun, even if you're kind of a dick sometimes.

02:56:36.260 --> 02:56:37.100
No, I'm kidding.

02:56:37.100 --> 02:56:40.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got me, you got me.

02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:43.420
But I'm glad you could be here for the Sega Genesis

02:56:43.420 --> 02:56:44.980
and Mega Drive look back episode.

02:56:44.980 --> 02:56:46.860
It seems oddly appropriate.

02:56:46.860 --> 02:56:49.420
Any last thoughts for our listeners tonight, Dan?

02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:50.260
No.

02:56:50.260 --> 02:56:51.540
And also, actually, this is also very important.

02:56:51.580 --> 02:56:53.300
Do you have anything you wanna plug?

02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:55.780
You have like a Twitter or a podcast of your own?

02:56:55.780 --> 02:56:56.620
Everybody has podcasts these days.

02:56:56.620 --> 02:56:58.740
You guys should listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:56:58.740 --> 02:57:01.420
My wife is on it and her friends.

02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:03.420
It's pretty amazing.

02:57:03.420 --> 02:57:05.200
They do it all the time.

02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:08.120
And I mean, it's a little pedantic sometimes,

02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:10.500
but in general, it's worth listening to.

02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:11.540
In general.

02:57:11.540 --> 02:57:12.780
All right, thank you, Dan.

02:57:12.780 --> 02:57:13.740
Come back any time.

02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:15.860
Anyhow, but not Labor Day weekend,

02:57:15.860 --> 02:57:16.940
because we will be here.

02:57:16.940 --> 02:57:17.780
Neither will I.

02:57:17.780 --> 02:57:18.600
All right.

02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:20.020
Let's see, Darkstar.

02:57:20.020 --> 02:57:20.860
You know what?

02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:22.060
That's our anniversary weekend.

02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:23.100
Oh, there you go.

02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:25.180
The spouse and I will have been married for nine years.

02:57:25.180 --> 02:57:26.700
You going to Disneyland or something?

02:57:26.700 --> 02:57:27.540
No.

02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:28.380
All right.

02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:29.200
You can?

02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:30.040
Yeah, you can.

02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:33.620
That's funny.

02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:35.260
Rob's paying for himself to go to Dragon Con.

02:57:35.260 --> 02:57:36.900
Yeah, I'm going to Atlanta

02:57:36.900 --> 02:57:39.180
to get some of the Sue's infamous gummy bears.

02:57:39.180 --> 02:57:40.500
That's the only reason I go.

02:57:40.500 --> 02:57:41.420
That's the only reason I go.

02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:43.260
All right, Darkstar, I had to follow Dan here

02:57:43.260 --> 02:57:44.780
with your final thought tonight.

02:57:44.780 --> 02:57:46.700
Even though I was super full when we got here,

02:57:46.700 --> 02:57:49.260
I'm super hungry now and really want a fish burrito.

02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:55.020
I'm a good Mexican place like El Forstero.

02:57:56.420 --> 02:57:58.940
My final thought is, now you mentioned that place,

02:57:58.940 --> 02:58:00.300
now I'm craving tortilla chips.

02:58:00.300 --> 02:58:01.600
Damn you.

02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:02.440
Damn you.

02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:03.260
All right.

02:58:03.260 --> 02:58:05.200
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:09.380
My final thought tonight is I should play more games.

02:58:09.380 --> 02:58:10.220
You should.

02:58:10.220 --> 02:58:11.060
Word.

02:58:11.060 --> 02:58:11.900
Because I haven't played any games.

02:58:11.900 --> 02:58:12.740
How about everybody?

02:58:12.740 --> 02:58:13.860
It's the OLR challenge.

02:58:13.860 --> 02:58:16.640
Everybody play one new game this week.

02:58:16.640 --> 02:58:18.140
Play something new.

02:58:18.140 --> 02:58:18.980
Yeah.

02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:20.980
Be jeweled, Jesus Christ.

02:58:20.980 --> 02:58:22.700
Bonus points if it's indie.

02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:23.540
All right.

02:58:23.540 --> 02:58:24.860
That does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:26.180
We will be back next week

02:58:26.180 --> 02:58:28.420
before our little break for Labor Day.

02:58:28.420 --> 02:58:30.280
So 565 next week.

02:58:30.280 --> 02:58:33.300
We're inching closer and closer to episode 573.

02:58:33.300 --> 02:58:34.140
You know, I gotta be honest.

02:58:34.140 --> 02:58:35.740
I never thought we'd get that high,

02:58:35.740 --> 02:58:37.740
but that is something that's gonna be happening in October,

02:58:37.740 --> 02:58:38.580
believe it or not.

02:58:38.580 --> 02:58:39.400
All right, that does it.

02:58:39.400 --> 02:58:40.440
Have a great week, everybody.

02:58:40.440 --> 02:58:41.820
We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:41.820 --> 02:58:42.800
Good night.
