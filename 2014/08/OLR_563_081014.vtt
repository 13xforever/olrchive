Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, Sierra Entertainment, the legendary 90s adventure game comedy, sprung back to life.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
No longer a redirect to Activision's website, the future is bright above ground.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Join us for a trip down memory lane as we bring you more news from the week of gaming on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live on this August the 10th, 2014 with the 563rd episode of our show.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts here to talk with you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
Live at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com. We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
And if you are listening live, I encourage you to join chat and have your voices heard.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
Live.vognetwork.com. And you will hear such interesting things such as Seattle in chat saying,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
And my sister stole my only USB 3.0 cable.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
Well, you know what, if we're going to learn something tonight about the way America works, you clearly need to sue her.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
You're going to need to sue her to get that cable back. We'll get into more about that in a little while.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
Joining me here in studio, always here to lend their voices to the week in news and let you know what they think.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
And this woman certainly never has a shortage of opinions. Say hello to Dark Soccer, Jamie Sommers.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I have an opinion about that slice of pizza I just ate.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yes.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
It was delicious but my stomach hates me now because I got sick from the big black cock yesterday.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
What? What? What? Dan and I went to...

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Right now, somebody's editing that as a little clip for a future OLR soundboard.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
She went to the Castro and put a big black cock in her mouth.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
There's photographic evidence.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Thanks, Techmaster Loki.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Wait, what?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
There's photographic evidence.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
OK.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
We went to visit Grandpa.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
For all the... OK.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
There's some people who are listening to this show for the first time that are like,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
What the hell are these people on? I thought this was a video game show.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
OK, first off, Grandpa from Hoard House, another podcast that I do about all things online gaming but never too seriously,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
lives in the Castro, right? Or right above the Castro.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Above it. He hovers over the Castro like the queen.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
To judge people.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
To judge.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
He just sits out on his balcony and judges.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Him and his wife, Lady Victoria, are out on the balcony.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
By the way, Grandpa's gayer than Christmas. It's not really his wife, but that's what we all call her.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Lady Victoria, they judge everybody out in the Castro. That's what they do.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, yes. All our subject.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Now, you went to go be judged this weekend.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
No.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Among other things.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I went to participate in the judgment.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
So you went down into the Castro and you actually bought a penis shaped, what, cookie?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Macaroon.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Macaroon.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Because I love the macaroons at Hot Cookie.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
And I don't even care, y'all. I'm going to give Hot Cookie a shout out right now.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Thank you for making macaroons that were so delicious I threw up.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Okay.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
We were already full from eating at Harvey's, which really, really good food.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
But I went and had to shove because they would put whipped cream on it if I started eating it now.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
So I had a big chocolate covered macaroon dick with whipped cream on the tip.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Only in the Castro.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Only in the Castro.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
And how was it, our soccer?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh, it was freaking amazing.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Better than the real thing.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Amazing.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I cannot believe our chat is not responding to this whatsoever.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Did the internet die?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Ronchon did.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Or are they all in shock?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I don't know.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Ronchon is in shock.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Look at his face.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Look at that.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
All right.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
But it was totally delicious except I think I might have already had a bit of something going on wrong with my stomach.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Because it was like we got home after a long, long visit and everything.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
And I laid down for about 15 minutes and all of a sudden my stomach's like, nope.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
You got to be careful what you eat in this day and age.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I mean, we were just talking before the show with Shane.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah, but that was Jim Boys and that's to be expected.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
All right.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Anyway.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Jim Boys is...

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Garbage.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yes, it's garbage.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Thank you.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Okay.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Sometimes it's delicious garbage.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I like it.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I like it.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
But it is not fit for human consumption and your body will let you know.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Watch out.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Watch out.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Because they're going to contact the show because they found Shane's Twitter.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
When he wrote, like, he didn't even put an at sign or a hashtag.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
He just mentioned and they were like, what's wrong?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
All right, Jim Boys, this is your chance to prove us wrong.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
By cooking us some food that does not make me sit in the bathroom for two hours.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I'll eat whatever she does.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I love Jim Boys.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I've never had a problem with Jim Boys.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Anyway, enough local eatery talk.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
It's because your insides are made out of cast iron.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
How are you, Tech Master Loki?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Full.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
But, you know, I should have stopped at Jim Boys now that I think I had the time to do that.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
I was going to actually almost stop it because we went there earlier this week at Dicky's Barbecue.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
They have fried okra.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
They have pretty awesome barbecue.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
I thought it was just like this cheapo chain thing, but it's actually really good.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Really good.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
It's legit southern food.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
You're going to make all the listeners hungry, you guys.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Go get us tacos while you're at it, listeners.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I had like a beef brisket sandwich yesterday.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
It was awesome.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But yeah, I almost stopped there, but I didn't.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
Instead I went to Round Table and got pizza, but I got pan pizza, and so it's way more filling.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
What kind of show is this?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Is it a game show or a food show?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
We'll get to the games.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
It's a three hour show.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Quickly, how's Unity programming going to try and bring this to games a little bit?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
How's your programming adventures going?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Good, actually.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
I think I'm close to finished with fixing my editor because I had tweaked some stuff,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
and I wanted to do something differently, and then it got way too complicated,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
and then I dialed it back.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Now I think I've gotten it to the point where everything should be okay.

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
I put my palette that I was using into a script now so that I don't have to actually have a palette for it,

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
and I can add stuff, custom colors if I want to on the fly.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah, so I'm just finishing that up.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Hopefully going to have that done this week, and I can get back to kind of where I stopped before.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
What else?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
That was pretty much it, actually.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
I've been still trying to figure out a way to do ambient occlusion,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
but I just don't think it's possible with Unity free.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
I think you really need to have that registered version, or I'm sorry, the pro version,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
which is $1500 that I don't have.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
I thought, well, I'm sure they've got their way of doing it.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Why can't I just look up a way to do it?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
How would you do it outside of Unity and just apply that to Unity?

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
It just doesn't work because they have these things for graphics cards like texture buffers.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Instead of writing to the screen, you can write to a texture file,

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
and then you take that texture file and do something with it, like capturing the screen or something like that.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
Say you want to do a blur, you'd capture the screen, and then you would apply a blur to it,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
and then you'd put that back on the screen again.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
I don't have that access to that buffer in Unity free, so there's not really a way to do that.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Or if there is a way to do that, it's incredibly slow. It just wouldn't work.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I've seen you out there trying to get help on Twitter and stuff, though.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
I know I see Tim sometimes answer some of your questions, and I'm sure you have other people.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Just because a lot of times I don't know what I'm talking about.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
I want it to look like this, but I don't know what that is, so I don't know what questions to ask.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Even earlier this week, I ended up trying to get depth textures to work.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
I'm like, I don't even need that. I don't know. It just got way too complicated.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
So now I'm just keeping it as simple as possible, just vertex colors, and I'll figure the rest out.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Well, best of luck. We look forward to it.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Didn't we get something in the mailbag with music or something? I never got that forwarded to me.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I thought so.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
If it did get forwarded, it might have gotten lost in the stacks of junk mail that I get.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
I'll look it up again and send it over to you.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Meanwhile, letting the chat room drive the show a little bit over at live.vognetwork.com.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I see a lot of people talking about the big geek movies in theaters right now.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Guardians of the Galaxy, obviously a big one. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles opened this past weekend.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
You guys, I never get out to movies anymore.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
We had a screening for Ninja Turtles on Wednesday, but I couldn't go because of kids.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Have you seen Guardians?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
No, I really want to see it.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I want to see them both.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I want to sneak out at some point and do that.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I thought you and Dan went to go see Guardians.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
No, Dan went to see it without me.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
What a punk.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Because I was working.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Hi, I have to earn money so that you can go see movies.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay, so wow, we're all on cool. We didn't see.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Shane's in the other room. Shane, didn't you see Guardians?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Did you like it?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Everything, but why don't we just get up?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, okay.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Shane's like, everything, but why don't we just get up?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Shane had to get up so he can come talk.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
I know, I'm getting him away from his Pokemon.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Somebody didn't have a game tie-in with that.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I mean, they had infinity, but yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
It's not the same thing. Make sure that's on.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Is it picking me up?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
We can hear you just fine.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Okay, so Guardians of the Galaxy.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah, I saw it.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
How was it?

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
It was good, except for the part after the credits.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh, I actually read a spoiler on that. I won't say anymore.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Why? I'll say it.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
No, don't you dare.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It's been out for like two weeks.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
No, no, no, don't. That's not cool.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
It's garbage. You don't need to stay for the end.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Just leave when the credits start. You're not going to miss anything.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
For the first time ever in a Marvel movie.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
But you didn't see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
No, I refuse to see that.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Why?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
That is terrible looking.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Because, like, from what I read...

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Everything I've seen on Twitter from TigerClaws, like, 10 of 10, A+, 100%.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Okay, so he said all three of those.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I think so.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Well, there's your three reviews from one person.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
I am going to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because I've seen them all.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
I will see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because, and I've said this before,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I'll see literally anything with Whoopi Goldberg in it.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
She's in there? Poor her.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
She plays the Chief. They changed the gender swap to Chief.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Her and Will Arnett I feel bad for.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Stop.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
But, no, I heard, like, the Turtles...

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It can't be worse than the one from the 90s. Come on.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
No, no.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
And the one from the 90s was really bad.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Which one?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
The original. It was bad.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
No.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
We all loved it because we were kids.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
No, it cannot. There's no way that the first two movies at least will be worse than this.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
That third movie was garbage.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
It's 90s charm, I guess. I don't know.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
It wasn't terrible, but it was, I don't know, it was okay.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Granted, yeah, it's like, okay, Ninja Turtles 2.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah, they had a rap scene in it and who cares.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
That's what you do in a 90s movie.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
The third movie had ancient Japan.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah, and nobody liked that one.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I liked it.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Two people liked that one.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
No.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
That's why I'll like the new one.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I liked Ninja Turtles 3.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
This is why the first one succeeded because it took part of the storyline from the first comic, the original comic,

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
yet blended it with what people expected to see with the less violent, more fun.

11:30.000 --> 11:39.000
I've never realized this, but did you know that original Ninja Turtles movie was the highest grossing independent film of all time until Pulp Fiction came out in the mid-90s?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I never did. I didn't realize that.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
And it was done by, I believe the animatronics were done by Jim Henson.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
They were.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
But he expressed that he was not happy with how it turned out because there was too much violence.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
Which, here's the thing. I feel like just right now with the new Ninja Turtles movie, because I know they reference a lot of the stuff from the new cartoon,

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
and god, I don't even know how many different shows they have now with Ninja Turtles because I know the one on Netflix right now.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
It's just like, it looks like fucking terrible. It's like live action or something. No.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Oh, that's the one that was on Fox then that has the girl turtle.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And they had a Power Ranger crossover.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
That was weird.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I liked the CG movie, by the way.

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
But yeah, oh yeah. CG movie's awesome. But here's the thing. A lot of the stuff they're referencing, oh yeah, that's this version of Shredder.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't even know what the hell you're referencing. Oh, it's part of the cartoon.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm like, well shit. I haven't, I'm not a little kid anymore. I haven't watched all this Nickelodeon stuff.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Taking it back to games a little bit here.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
But I didn't get to finish.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Finish. Hurry.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Okay. I don't want to see it because A, I hear the turtles are only in about 40% of the movie.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Really?

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah. They only say Cowabunga once. And come on, that's a Ninja Turtles thing.

12:53.000 --> 13:03.000
I am a little bit like, I heard there's no Casey Jones. I heard there's no Shredder in it, but not, I keep wanting to say Crain.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I keep wanting to say Crain, but I'm like, that's Metroid stupid.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Crain is not in this movie. You're right.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Okay. But Crain, thank you.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
It focuses, I guess, mostly on April O'Neil. And apparently, I've never seen a movie with Megan Fox, but she can't carry it, I guess.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
All right. All this stuff aside.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
We're just going to get off topic in a minute anyway.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
Going back to Guardians of the Galaxy, trying to bring it back to gaming. Would you play a video game based off of it?

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
No, because I didn't even like, I had no interest really in the movie, but I thought it'd be fun to see.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
So those characters and Chris Pratt's acting really didn't do anything for me except for Groot.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
And if there was a Groot game, maybe I'd just play as Groot.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Because you would have to have Rocket Raccoon with him.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
I love Rocket Raccoon because I loved him in the comics.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
I just, I didn't know that was Bradley Cooper until after the movie. I was like, that just sounded weird.

13:50.000 --> 13:57.000
But to kind of bring it back still, you know, as definitely someone that has had a game already, but yet no movie.

13:57.000 --> 14:04.000
Deadpool, the Deadpool movie, they're still trying to get some sort of like, hey, let's rally up on the internet.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
That clip was awesome.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
It was fucking awesome, okay? Let's get that clip clear.

14:10.000 --> 14:20.000
Now, you know, they're trying to rally support for that movie. I don't understand why, you know, they can make like, I don't know, all these really terrible movies.

14:20.000 --> 14:30.000
And yet, I mean, fuck, you know, there was a Daredevil and Elektra movie, yet, oh, we can't fucking make this really kickass Daredevil movie.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
I, you know, I'm going to say something y'all aren't going to like me for, but it's how I feel. I don't want another goddamn comic book movie.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't want none of them. I don't want Deadpool. I don't want, I don't want any of them until, until I get my goddamn Wonder Woman movie.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Which we practically are anyway.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
You and I both know that we would have huge reservations.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
That's about the most we're going to get to one. Now, you know what I would rather see than a Wonder Woman movie?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
What?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I want to see him as a Marvel movie.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Alright.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Because Carol Danvers could kick her ass.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Now, chatters are seeming to love this chat, so I guess we can entertain it here a little bit.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Tigerclaw is saying they greenlit the sequel to Ninja Turtles already.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Boo.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
There's possibilities. There's possibilities. Casey Jones and Bebop and Rocksteady will be in the sequels.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
As Jotunner Matt says, the original movies were campy, silly, and it held up in its time and it played off the cartoon.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
My problem with the new movie is that it's forcing the campy feeling with big budget special effects and trying to piggyback on the nostalgia factor.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And the turtles are ugly. Let's just get that out of the way.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Rama says Casey Jones didn't show until much later in the comics.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Alright, speaking of games, try to get to games a little bit.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
One little tiny thing, tiny, tiny thing. I want to see them do a turtle movie that's like the original comics. That would be awesome.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Super dark.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Super dark and bloody.

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
Switching topics here for just a minute. Before the show, quickly, you were talking about a new TV show that you're into that's kind of like a game.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Tell us about this TV show.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
The Quest.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Okay, but most people are going to hear you say that.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
How am I supposed to talk about the show if you interrupt me?

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
Because you're going to say reality TV show and everybody's going to be like, nope, nope, nope.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
So make it nerdy. Go. What is it then?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
It's an unreality TV show.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Tell people why they should care even though it's a reality show.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
It is a reality show. First of all, with no price. So these contestants are competing for nothing.

16:16.000 --> 16:25.000
And they are in a fictional fantasy world where they live in a castle and they are becoming paladins to save the kingdom from an evil force.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
So as Rob put it, it's real life LARPing. Wait, is that redundant?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
LARPing is a TV show.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah, yeah. And it's really good and it had a plot twist at the end of the second episode.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
The first episode made me uncomfortable to watch for a little bit because it's really awkward.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
It's filming people LARPing and then they add special effects in post-production and stuff, right?

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
I've only seen, only at the very end of each episode is there special effects.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
Everything else is like actors and sets. And apparently there's going to be animatronic monsters too.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
It's just interesting to me. This is from the same network that last year brought us.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Ah, whodunnit. That was so good.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Clue IRL where they made it look like people legit died.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Which was really good.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Contestants got voted off, or they didn't vote, but they lost. And when they lost the show or whatever, they got killed.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah, it was awesome.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
There'd be a whole special effects team that would make it look like they actually got murdered.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
And then they'd have to investigate the bodies. That was cool too.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
That's such a good show.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
I got to hand it to ABC. Even though they never let their reality shows last more than one season, they always have the best.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
The best reality shows. I understand when people are like, I don't like reality shows because I don't like Real Housewives.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Yeah, those aren't garbage.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
But the stuff on ABC, like the mole, was awesome.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Just think of it as an elaborate game show.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
It's just really what they are.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
It's just an elaborate game show, and that's it. I mean, fuck.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
It's just like the shit that they used to have on Nickelodeon stuff.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
They weren't really raiding a temple, okay?

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, those temple guards took those kids and never gave them back.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
And these people on the show, they take it so seriously.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
I think that's part of the reason why I get uncomfortable watching it, because I don't do anything like that.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
I don't roleplay. I don't do Dungeons and Dragons or anything like that.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
So it's very awkward to me to see these people get so into it.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
But at the same time, there's been some really good heartwarming moments because of it on this show.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
But now you heard that it's already coming back for a second season.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
They are casting or have finished casting for the second season.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
So in case it does come back, because they said they have at least 12 kingdoms or whatever.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
So they said they already have 12 storylines that they can do.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
If they're going to bring it back for a second season, I'm just going to nominate Dark Sakura to be on the show.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
Because I think Dark Sakura would be great in a LARP on TV.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
You know, I actually haven't LARPed since like 1997.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
So what kind of competitions do they have on this show?

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Because obviously, pretending who can pretend the best is not really good TV.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Oh my god, that was part of the heartwarming moment tonight.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I won't spoil it for people that will watch it.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
But the first competition they had to do was they had to practice their...

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
I don't know, they had these big crossbows that they would load up like a bolt and then fire over a wall at enemy targets.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
So one person on their team was overlooking the entire field to tell them where to point.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
One person was the runner to get the arrows.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
And the other person was the person that was moving the big bow and arrow machine and pulling it back and firing.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
So that would be the first thing they did.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
And then today they had a horseback competition where they were all in horseback.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And they had different stations they had to go through.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
And they had to shoot an arrow horseback, they had to throw a spear, they had to joust.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
And then they had to bash a skull with a big hammer at the end of that.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Looking in our chatroom over at live.volgnotwork.com, Actf says,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Legends of the Hidden Temple, Cross-Survivor. Somebody kickstart that.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
They had that, didn't they? It was called the Eco-Challenge, right?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Was that what it was called on Discover Kids?

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
That's not like Legends of the Hidden Temple. There were no temple guards.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
It was Survivor for Kids.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah, but I don't think that's the part where he's saying Legends of the Hidden Temple.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Whatever, alright.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
You would have said Kids plus Survivor and they'd be like, oh, Kidnation.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
That was a good show.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Alright, anyway, we got to get to video games, so we are going to get to our gaming weeks.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Shane, before you leave us and say goodbye, I know you're playing Pokemon now,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
but what other video games have you been playing this week?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I just finished Dragon Age 2, like a complete pleasure.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Oh, you finished it?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Mm-hmm.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I spent like 52 hours.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
You did your romance.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Fenris?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yes.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Who else would you romance in that game?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Fenris.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Maybe Isabella, maybe Meryl, but no, Fenris.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
You know what, if Varric, though, was a possibility, I would have gone that way.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
He's pretty funny, but Fenris is hot.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I tried to romance Meryl.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
She's fun.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I love her.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Because, I mean, Eve Miles, hello.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I don't know.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
She was in Torchwood.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
She was in Torchwood.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
She wrote for everyone.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
But then she started really pissing me off and I was like, oh, Fenris.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
For Dragon Age 2, for all the people that hate that game, I don't understand now,

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
because I've gone through it.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah, there's a lot of repetition in your locations you go to, but the story was actually

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
really, really good, and the companion dialogue and writing.

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
I might say it rivals Mass Effect in terms of characters I like to play alongside.

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
I think they were probably written better than most characters in other games.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Definitely better than the original Dragon Age characters, at least.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
But I loved it.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Oh my god, how could you stand romancing Anders?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Ugh, creepy.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
No, I killed him.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Spoiler, I killed him.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I let him live, but in my brain she went back and killed him later.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I stabbed him in the back with a knife.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
It's like a three year old game, so it's okay.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Oh, that's really it that I've been playing, though.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
But I did do everything.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
You excited for Inquisition?

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Yes, I am ready for it to be November 17th.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
How do you feel about that delay?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I don't care if it makes it better, it's fine.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
I'm ready to go romance Dorian, because he's the gay romance in the game.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
I want romance Vivian.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
Believe it or not, a story that somehow didn't make our show roll tonight, but I'm sure you

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
and Jamie have something to say about it, so I'll bring it up now.

22:06.000 --> 22:13.000
It was announced this week that Casey Hudson, the producer of Mass Effect, left the company.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
How do you feel about that?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Good for him.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
I never hated him.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
I never understood all the hate for him, so I'm sad because at least he was a constant there.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Just don't put him in charge of any more games.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
I'm still fine with all the stuff he did for Mass Effect.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Without him, we could have had a completely different game that may have been quote unquote worse.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
But we also could have had some story consistency.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
If you squint, it's pretty consistent.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Aren't we scapegoating with that, though?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Because it's not just him.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
It wasn't just him.

22:45.000 --> 22:55.000
But when you're the creative director, you have to be the conduit from which all creativity flows,

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
or through which all creativity is coalesced into a final thing.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Some comments in chat for Shane before you go.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Act-Def says,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Shane, opinions on the new mega pokies revealed?

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
And 5th Dream says, cosplay Pikachu, motherfucker.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Cosplay Pikachu, that's a stupid name.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
I don't care about any of the new megas, except kind of like Mega Salamence,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
because he turned into an airplane.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
Or he kind of looks like, I guess people are saying like Star Wars, like a Star Wars insignia,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
but I think he kind of looks like a Cylon Raider.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
When I get my Salamence and I get his mega stone,

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
I will name him something Battlestar Galactica related, because he totally turns into a raider.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
And cosplay Pikachu, worst name ever.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
But I'm totally going to use the Lucha Libre whatever, the Lucha Pikachu,

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
so I can see the awesome flies up into the air and then does like a belly flop on the flying press move.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Love that.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
Or maybe I'll use Bell Pikachu, because that one's silly and looks like a southern bell.

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
Alright, anything else you want to share with us before you go back to the other room to breed oshawottes?

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
I have bred like 800 oshawottes now with no shiny.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
So that shiny charm?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Oshawottes?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Oshawottes.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Okay, I was about to say, because I might be offended in a moment.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Oshawottes.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
He's an adorable little sea otter.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Okay.

24:23.000 --> 24:30.000
I've bred like 800 of those now, and I have a shiny charm, and I still have not got a shiny oshawottes.

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
So there are a lot of like underprivileged kids that are getting oshawottes coats this Christmas,

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
because I'm going to kill them all.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
You should make a coat out of them.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Yeah, I'm going to make a whole bunch, because I have 800.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And you'll furline your house.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Oh yeah, I'm also going to make slippers, because those are year round.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
So I'm going to keep making oshawottes.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
By the way, we need Kickstarter for Final Fantasy XIV so people can give me money to make my room.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Why would we give you money to make a room?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Because you love me.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Because people give money to someone to make potato salad.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
My cause is far worthier than potato salad and cosplay combined.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Potato salad's gross anyway.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
It's delicious.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Alright, thanks for dropping in, Shane.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Come say hi if you have something to say later, which I'm sure you will.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I probably won't.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Alright.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Do you have a Power Rangers story again this week?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I do not have a Power Rangers story again this week.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Skylanders?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
No.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
We already talked Dragon Age and Mass Effect.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I don't know what else I'm about, so...

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah, you never know. You never know.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Alright.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Let's move around with the rest of us.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
And how was your gaming week?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Darasacra?

25:31.000 --> 25:38.000
I've been doing Silph quests over and over and I'm getting sick of the stupid Silph quests in Final Fantasy XIV.

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
I kind of forgot to play Bravely Defart, because I've had lots of stuff going on.

25:44.000 --> 25:51.000
I'm playing a lot of Bejeweled, for some stupid reason, because I'm really good at Butterfly mode in Bejeweled 3.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
It's one of those games you can just really easily zone out to, you know?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
That's what makes those PopCap games so addicting.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
They're all zone-out games.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
I don't know. I just really...

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
It's been kind of a weird week, because I got really, really good news and I was so excited I couldn't sit down.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Well, that's good though, right?

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Yes it is, but I'm not going to tell anybody yet.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Alright.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Keep it to yourself.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
You know what it is.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
I do. I do.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
I got really shitty news this week and you know what it is, but I don't want to talk about it either, so there you go.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
We're even, I think. Not really.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Alright, moving on.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
I only played one thing this week and that was the Kickstarter edition of Vanguard V, because I backed it.

26:39.000 --> 26:46.000
Even though there's no way in hell it's going to make its goal, but I have to support, you know, Maximiliano Moreau,

26:46.000 --> 26:54.000
who is the host of one of my favorite YouTube series, Cooking with Unity, and he's actually doing some programming on the game.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
And I was a little disappointed before, because it is an Oculus...

26:59.000 --> 27:06.000
Well, it was a VR-only game at one time, but they made a non-VR demo version that you can play,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
so I actually got to try it out and it's awesome.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
And the best part about it is it's super easy.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
Like, I want to actually have my son try playing it, because it just uses the mouse and you look and that's it.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
There's no fire button, no nothing.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
It just moves and looks.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
It just looks, actually.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
It moves where you look.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
But the soundtrack is pretty sweet and, I don't know, it's just a fun game.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
It's like a rail shooter.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
That's it.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
That's all I played this week.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I played a few things this week.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
I played more of Crypt of the Necrodancer, which I talked about a little bit last week,

27:38.000 --> 27:44.000
which I'm having fun with that one, even though I'm still not sure I've completely figured out what I'm doing,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
because it's one of those games where you have to kind of...

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
You learn more about the game the further you go and what the items really do.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
There's not a whole lot of tutorial in the game.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
I mean, in the very beginning, you kind of figure out, oh, move to the beat of the music,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
but you have to kind of unravel everything else.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
But as a roguelike, that's what it should be.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
But anyway, I talked a lot about that last week, so I'll leave it at that.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
This week, I've been playing more of, believe it or not, Fez, which I know is a couple years old at this point,

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
but it just came out on PlayStation 4, and it was free on PlayStation Plus.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
So I'd given that game a whirl when it was originally out on Xbox 360,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
so I decided to give it a whirl again on PlayStation 4.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
And this time, I'm going to fully admit I'm using a guide to get help a little bit with some of it,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
so I can just, you know...

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
Some of the puzzles are really, really, really, really intricate in the game,

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
so I kind of like being able to take it a little more at a casual difficulty, if that's even calling it that,

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
by using a guide to kind of help me when I get stuck.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
And now that I'm able to explore more of the world than I did the last time,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
I like what he did in, like, some of the zones.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
There's this one area that I went into that I don't remember what it was called,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
but it's like this...

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
The graphic style suddenly goes from the 8-bit pixelation thing, you know,

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
to a more CGA monitor from, like, the 1980s that only shows, what, it only shows four colors,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
white, black, magenta, and cyan, right?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
There's a whole cave where you...

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
And the music, which is actually Fez's strongest point out of everything is the music,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
is great in that game.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
You have to, like, jump up the little platforms in, like, a Mega Man-level style thing to the music.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
And I just, I don't know, I thought that was frustrating,

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
but they're at the right level of difficulty, little thing to get through as a platforming thing.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
So, yeah.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
So Fez has been kind of fun to re-explore on PlayStation 4, so I've been doing that.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Robert M. in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I just downloaded Fez from PlayStation Plus as well,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
but I haven't touched either that or the one I got in the Humble Bundle.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
And BlackWolf says, yeah, I revisited Fez too.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
So, yeah, I think there's a lot of people revisiting that this week.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Ragenator says, I played Wing Commander 3 too.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
I forgot about that. That's the Origin game right now, right?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
The free game on Origin is Wing Commander 3?

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
I gotta pick that up. That was, like, Malcolm McDowell and Mark Hamill and shit doing the live acting.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
Like, that was, like, the pinnacle of, like, 90s full motion video games,

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
which console gamers remember from, like, Night Trap and Sewer Shark and that stuff.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
But there was a whole mess of PC games that did that stuff.

30:07.000 --> 30:13.000
You guys know there was a remake of SimCity that I always loved to make fun of on this show

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
because it was so poorly acted and overacted with the whole, like, news report on SimCity Action News and all that, right?

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
That was a CD-ROM game. Mega Race, I know that's one you really liked, right, Logan?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
I love Mega Race.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
Right? And then there were just some really awesome ones we'll get into a little later in the show.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
One developer that really got into this a little bit was Sierra.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
And, like, I think of games like Phantasmagoria, which I'm pretty sure you've done as a classic game of the week in the past.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Yes, I have.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Dark Sakura, which was really ahead of its time in some ways.

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
So, yeah, anyway, now I'm going down nostalgia lane with these 90s CD things.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
But, yeah, Wing Commander 3, I gotta check that out because that was really the peak of all that.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
The other game, I actually spent quite a bit of time with this.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
A friend of mine recommended this to me, and I dabbled with this game, I think it was last year,

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
maybe it was a year and a half ago when it first, first came out, like, in the beta.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
I dabbled with it a little bit, but I was playing way too many other MMOs at the same time

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
because that was when XIV Realm Reborn was new and I was still into Warcraft.

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
Well, now that I don't play XIV as much and I cancelled World of Warcraft, I have time to add a new MMO in the rotation show.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.000
I checked out. Neverwinter was the game I decided to check out, which is free to play.

31:22.000 --> 31:29.000
Perfect World, I believe Arc System Works, those guys put this one out as a free to play.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
And it's in Steam, if you want to check that out, and it is an MMO.

31:34.000 --> 31:43.000
Because it is free to play, they do have the premium currency that does things like name changes and stat rebalancing.

31:43.000 --> 31:49.000
Now, granted, I only got a character to level 5, so I haven't seen a whole lot else what you can buy with it,

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
but I'm assuming, based on some things I've seen, there's like fashion outfits,

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
like what your character actually looks like as opposed to the armor you wear.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
I'm sure a lot of that is premium as well.

31:59.000 --> 32:06.000
But I gotta say, being a fan of Warcraft for so many years, I like that Neverwinter has a lot of the same tropes,

32:06.000 --> 32:13.000
but I like that Neverwinter also felt kind of action-y, which is obviously based in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.

32:13.000 --> 32:20.000
So if you play D&D, you'll see some familiar things that you know from D&D, like the rolling of stats,

32:20.000 --> 32:27.000
and a lot of the classes are very classic. A lot of the races, like half-elves and things, are things you would see from D&D.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
So a lot of that is in the game, but I liked that it felt almost kind of action-y,

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
like, oh, I was playing a mage in the game, and I'm like, oh, I'm going to channel my ice and freeze this mob,

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
and oh, he's frozen, so now I'm going to quick swing my mouse over this way,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
and I'm going to hit this guy with magic missile and attack the darkness.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Okay, I wasn't really attacking the darkness, but I had to throw that out there somewhere.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
But yeah, some of the fights in there were kind of fun.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
I did this thing in the very beginning that kind of felt like a one-man instance,

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
because I had another little guy with me, and I was running through the little instance,

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
and there was like a boss monster, and I had to freeze him, that I'd run away a little bit and fire magic missile,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
and then freeze him again. So that was kind of fun.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
So I got to admit, I wasn't expecting much out of Neverwinter, because it is free to play,

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
but I was pleasantly surprised with how well put together and how fun it was.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
Keep in mind, I've only experienced through level five, but that was still a good couple hours of entertainment the other night.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
So yeah, Neverwinter. Good times. I like that.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, whoa, Neverwinter. Yeah, I know, it was kind of random, huh?

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
Dungeonbuster also says, a lot of the costumes are premium in Neverwinter.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Yeah, I figured that was going to be as much.

33:28.000 --> 33:35.000
And Bochacawa says, it's not based in D&D, it's based in Farin, which is going to be D&D when the next edition is official.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
Cial says, did you attack the gazebo sky? No.

33:40.000 --> 33:48.000
But I went in like the back of the king's throne room. I don't remember what the whole thing was.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
I had to go get some, protect some crown from being stolen, but spoiler alert, it got stolen anyway,

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
which sets the plot for the rest of the quests, I'm sure, for a few levels.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Dun dun dun.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
As I was playing it, I actually was like, this feels a lot like a Dragon Age story that I'm playing right now or something.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
Are you going to shame your dice? What's that? Are you going to participate in dice shaming?

34:10.000 --> 34:17.000
What? Oh, oh, the whole Dungeons and Dragons stuff on Facebook. You don't actually roll dice in Neverwinter.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
No, I just, that's why I got confused. I was like, what? Dying clothes? What?

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
I'm going to start back to Star Trek Online, by the way, again.

34:26.000 --> 34:32.000
Are you? Grandpa. Yeah, he's really into that and they have an expansion coming.

34:32.000 --> 34:38.000
I've had a Rear Admiral sitting at Quark's Bar for the last two years.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
Appropriate. Yeah. All right. So there you go. That's my gaming week.

Upcoming shows, we will be here next week. We will not be here Labor Day weekend.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
There will be no show Labor Day weekend because that is huge convention weekend.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Dark Sakura will be at SacAnime here locally.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Possibly. Oh, I thought you were going for sure.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
If it works out because of reasons.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
Gotcha. Well, hopefully you'll be at SacAnime here locally.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
And if not, I'm sure Jonas and Diego, some of our friends from last week will come back and talk about that.

35:30.000 --> 35:38.000
I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta. So for those of you guys, I'm pretty sure within like probably about a 500 mile radius of Atlanta and then some.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
All the nerds I know convene on Atlanta for that convention.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
So if you're going to be there, be sure to stop by and say hi.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
The VOG Network panel is 1130 a.m. on Monday.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
So just before it's time to go.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
But we will also be on some various panels in the podcasting track throughout the weekend.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
And I'll be around the convention.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
I'll have a VOG shirt on. I'm hoping my Joker cosplay is finished.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
But I'm being a horrible, horrible procrastinator.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
So we'll see.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
But I know I'm going to get so much shit from Travis if I don't finish something.

36:07.000 --> 36:13.000
So I'm going to try for Dragon Con, which is like it's like two weeks from today.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
No, three weeks. Better get on it.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I know it's three weeks from today.

36:17.000 --> 36:23.000
Last minute cosplay is never a good idea unless you'd like for me to remind you of the time Evan and I didn't sleep for three days.

36:23.000 --> 36:29.000
Girl, you're talking to somebody who did Rocky Horror and has done last minute costumes forever.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I'm talking about a whole brand new costume.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
I know. I know.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Yeah.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
All right. Well, the good news is I already have the hat thanks to Dark Sakura.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
And I have pants that work too. And I kind of think I know how I'm going to do the top.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
I think I'm going to do a layered thing, which use like because he has like a gray shirt underneath.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
So I was thinking gray long johns would work very well for the top part.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
And then it's just about basically painting the black jacket is the big thing I have to do and cutting it and making it look right.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
So I just and I have to find that right material that will make it look good because I don't want to look like a jacket.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
Keep in mind. Well, it's not. Joker doesn't wear a jacket.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
It's not. But I'm thinking that's what I can use if I cut it.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
So because he has like these cuts, like I'm drawing on my body, which you can't see.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
No. And if you if you need it, I've actually got a heat bond.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
OK. Material. So so we'll make it work. Yeah, we were. I will.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Robert M in chat says last minute Halloween costumes never work out for me.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
Always works out for me. Always, always looks out for me.

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
All right. There we go. That is what's coming up for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
Let's get into some gaming news. No more movie talk, no more food talk.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
It's gaming news talk. Loki, start us off.

37:45.000 --> 37:58.000
So Sony is found themselves as part of a class action lawsuit in California regarding deceptive marketing of Killzone Shadowfall for the PlayStation 4.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
The reason being is because it was advertised that the game was running in 1080p.

38:04.000 --> 38:12.000
However, Digital Foundry found that the multiplayer portion of Shadowfall runs in an upscaled 960 by 1080 resolution.

38:12.000 --> 38:24.000
It's like a step below 1080p. They do that in a lot of multiplayer games to make sure, you know, the frame rates, you know, up there with multiple people in the game, stuff like that.

38:24.000 --> 38:35.000
And of course, because of this, somebody feels that they should, you know, pay damages because it's not really 1080p. It's just upscaled.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
And right now they said that they seek damages more than $5 million total.

38:40.000 --> 38:56.000
And they basically said, Sony admitted that it did not, in fact, design Killzone to display multiplayer graphics in 1080p, but instead use technology shortcut that's supposed to provide subjectively similar results.

38:56.000 --> 39:03.000
But Sony never advertised or convinced consumers to buy a technological shortcut.

39:04.000 --> 39:32.000
This is just dumb, is what it is. This is basically kind of what's been going on in, like, NeoGaf and other places where, you know, usually it's more between the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, where PlayStation 4 will, you know, display at native, you know, 1080p, but the Xbox One will be upscaled to 1080 or, you know, the PlayStation 4 will be upscaled from a slightly higher resolution or something.

39:32.000 --> 39:52.000
But I don't know. I don't think there's really any deceptive marketing. It's displaying at 1080p whatever you do to get, you know, that. If it's not, it didn't say native 1080p. I don't think they advertise that at all. It's just kind of a money grab, it seems like.

39:53.000 --> 40:13.000
This whole thing obviously reeks of fuckery, you know, the whole lawsuit, but to the credit of this or whatever, I think some people are starting to get real sick of feeling like in gaming, and this happens a lot with gaming, like even more so than movies.

40:14.000 --> 40:28.000
Like, we all know trailers make the movies look better than they are, but at least for the most part, things that are in the trailer are going to be in the movie, although that actually doesn't always happen either. I've seen trailers where scenes are in the trailer that aren't actually in the movie, but anyway, I digress a little bit.

40:29.000 --> 40:43.000
With video games, and this happens all the time, you see Shitty 3, you see all this stuff that doesn't end up actually happening with the game. The Aliens Colonial Marines, a classic example, right? Everybody was expecting one thing and got another.

40:44.000 --> 40:54.000
And unlike movies, video games are such a pre-order heavy industry that one could argue that a lot of this stuff really does kind of influence people's purchases.

40:55.000 --> 41:13.000
And to kind of go along with everything, this law firm, this is the first lawsuit that they've done in the gaming industry. For example, they also had a suit against Zynga, I guess there was some information leaked out of Farmville or something like that, personal information.

41:13.000 --> 41:27.000
Aliens Colonial Marines, because of the poor quality of that game, and the whole Battlefield 3, I believe the Playstation 3 copies were supposed to be getting free copies of Battlefield 1943 and that never happened or something.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
And so they were suing for that. So they've done this a lot.

41:32.000 --> 41:47.000
Now, so yeah, please do not mishear me, I'm not siding with the lawsuit, because at the end of the day, the game does run in 1080p, it just doesn't all run in 1080p. The title screen can be 1080p and technically it runs in 1080p.

41:48.000 --> 42:04.000
We're talking multiplayer, the regular game does run in 1080p. Here's how they explain multiplayer mode. It says, however, we use a technique called temporal reprojection, which combines pixels and motion vectors from multiple lower resolution frames to reconstruct a full 1080p image.

42:05.000 --> 42:12.000
If native means that every part of that pipeline is 1080p, then this technique is not negative.

42:12.000 --> 42:32.000
And to which I say, you know what, is the game fun? Yes or no. If yes it's fun, then shut up. It's just pixels. I was just talking about a game called Fez I was playing this week, and Fez runs in 1080p on the Playstation 4. Do you think it really utilizes that 1080p to its full extent?

42:32.000 --> 42:49.000
Not really. But is it still fun? Yeah, it's fun. So, I don't know why we're going so fucking crazy over this graphic thing, but the only little credit I am trying to give to it is that, okay, we are getting a little sick of games being misrepresented.

42:50.000 --> 43:01.000
And it does need to be more about what is actually in the game, and even if it's not actually 1080p, oh well, is it fun? Yes or no? That's the more important question.

43:02.000 --> 43:08.000
Anyway, but as far as this lawsuit goes, it's ridiculous and seems very frivolous to me. In my opinion.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Like many of them.

43:10.000 --> 43:20.000
Unfortunately. Which, as Loki pointed out, seem to all be coming from the same place. Can a judge call them out in court on that? Probably not.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
They can throw out a case as being frivolous.

43:24.000 --> 43:30.000
Yeah, but can a judge tell a company like, hmm, I noticed you have a tendency to do this type of shit and you really ought to knock it the fuck off.

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
They can put them under investigation for a potential disbarment for abuse of...

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Oh, like what happened to Jack Voldemort.

43:38.000 --> 43:51.000
Well, I think in this case, though, it's a legitimate concern, but is it that important? No. I don't think it's that big a deal.

43:52.000 --> 44:01.000
Is it that deceptive, I guess? I mean, are we talking a significant difference between what was advertised?

44:01.000 --> 44:13.000
I'm not saying 1080p native on the box or something like that versus what's actually being shown, but are the visuals that different from what was being shown in trailers and stuff like that?

44:14.000 --> 44:30.000
I mean, if it was significantly downgraded, then maybe yes. But if it looks pretty much the same, I mean, if you couldn't tell without Digital Foundry doing actual...

44:31.000 --> 44:38.000
you know, analyzing footage and counting pixels and stuff like that, I mean, if you couldn't tell that it was downgraded, then I don't see the problem.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
It's one like, you know, Aliens Clone-O Marines where it looks significantly different than what they were showing off.

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
Or Watch Dogs looks significantly different than what they were showing off during their E3 demos. That's a little bit more deceptive.

44:52.000 --> 44:59.000
Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com because I'm really curious what you guys, our listeners, have to say about this because we do say it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

44:59.000 --> 45:06.000
Dungeon Buster says, reading his explanation for why he was so offended by the game, the person suing Sony sounds like the most shallow person on the face of the planet.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
Had he known the full story, he allegedly would have not purchased Killzone at all or would have paid substantially less for it.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
And I think we're all sitting here going, yeah, right.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
And Bochi Kawa simply says, first world problems.

45:20.000 --> 45:27.000
Cial says, Jack Voldemort, a lawyer turned dark wizard. I forget, we haven't brought this guy up in a very, very long time and for good reason.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And that's good because as soon as you bring him up, then he comes back.

45:30.000 --> 45:39.000
I will, for our newer listeners, Jack Voldemort was our name for Jack Thompson, a very famous, at least a few years ago, anti-video game lawyer.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
This guy was, in my opinion, batshit crazy.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Yes, Starcyra?

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
And he hated Ice-T.

45:48.000 --> 45:57.000
And he was just, yeah, but he ended up getting disbarred in Florida, but we always called him Jack Voldemort because we felt he was an attention whore and we didn't want to help get his name out there.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
So, oops, we broke that a little bit tonight.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
But for reference purposes only, did I say his real name again.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
If I see an article with his name in it tomorrow, I'm blaming you.

46:07.000 --> 46:13.000
And I will deserve it. I will take my beatings with your shoe or whatever you're going to hit me with because, yeah, I shouldn't have brought it up.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
But for the sake of listeners, I want to remind them where that comes from.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
Alright, let's move on with some more stories. I'm surprised he's not involved somehow.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
He doesn't have anything to do with violence.

46:24.000 --> 46:31.000
Yeah, I guess that's true. This is some news that has some people disappointed, but these things happen in the industry, people move on to new jobs, right?

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
We just talked about Casey Hudson with BioWare a little bit ago.

46:34.000 --> 46:44.000
Well, also this week, Nintendo lost Dan Adelman, and if you don't know who Dan Adelman was, he was big on indie developers and getting them to work with Nintendo of America.

46:44.000 --> 46:49.000
Because after all, the Wii U, especially when it launched, really did have a pretty strong lineup of indies.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
And to be fair, has continued to have a pretty good strong lineup of indies on the console.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
And I think we've heard about that the Wii U shop is pretty easy to work with.

46:59.000 --> 47:07.000
But we also saw that Dan Adelman would sometimes be a little bit vocal in some of the challenges he would face with Nintendo.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
And at one point, he got squelched by the big N and didn't use his Twitter anymore.

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
And all of a sudden, earlier this week, he just let the floodgates loose and was talking everything. It was a very honest conversation.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
He wasn't anti-Nintendo in anything he was saying, don't get me wrong.

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
He's very kind to them in his departure, but he says he's very excited about the future as well.

47:31.000 --> 47:37.000
He says that, I'm going indie. As the indie games business matures, a real need for business expertise has started to develop.

47:37.000 --> 47:48.000
I've been working with the indie community for almost nine years now, and one consistent theme I've noticed is the tension between developers following their passion to make the game they want to make, and needing to be able to make a living doing it.

47:49.000 --> 47:54.000
Unfortunately though, there are a lot of business types who at best just don't get what indies are trying to do, or are at worst pretty much unethical.

47:55.000 --> 48:01.000
So I kind of get the sense that he's moving into this position where he's going to help indie developers get published on all game systems.

48:01.000 --> 48:07.000
Kind of work the system a little bit, if you will. Handhold these indie developers through what can be a scary process.

48:08.000 --> 48:17.000
I'm not sure how one makes money off of that, but perhaps you would get a cut. Like if you're somebody's manager, you get 20% of whatever they make.

48:18.000 --> 48:23.000
Like when Tom Cruise makes $15 million off of him, is he even worth that much anymore? Who makes all the money on movies now?

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
Oh, Robert Downey Jr. He's like the highest paid actor in Hollywood, right?

48:27.000 --> 48:38.000
Okay, his agent gets like 20% of that $20 million that he makes. That's why these fees are negotiated so freaking sky high, because his agent, or in the case of Robert Downey Jr., agents, I'm sure, they all get a cut of it.

48:39.000 --> 48:48.000
So maybe, and I'm theorizing, I don't know this to be true, but I would think that there could be a pretty good business model in there somewhere where essentially Dan Adelman may work as your agent.

48:48.000 --> 49:00.000
Seems fair enough, right? Loki, if you knew that there was a guy out there that could help you get your dream game that you're making published on all these systems, would you be like, yeah, you can take 20% to help me do that?

49:01.000 --> 49:13.000
No, because, well here's why, because it's so easy to do that. I mean, it's easy to register with these companies and get it published.

49:13.000 --> 49:26.000
I mean, with Uni, you can just export to all these different game platforms and it's signing up there. And hell, if Nintendo's gonna, if it's gonna be really hard to sign up with Nintendo, then fuck it, I just won't do it. Oh darn, everyone.

49:27.000 --> 49:42.000
Well now, in the tweets, I get the sense, and he's swearing up and down that Nintendo is not gonna suddenly stop supporting indies. I get the sense, again, from his tweets, I'm hugely paraphrasing here, that he seems like I helped that relationship with indies, and now it's gonna stay that way.

49:43.000 --> 49:52.000
Like, the door is open for indies, Nintendo gets indies now, and we're gonna continue to have this relationship. That's the impression I get from what's going on. And that's a good thing.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
They might see other people, though.

49:55.000 --> 50:09.000
Yeah, but that's okay. I like to see the indies flourish on all the consoles. I mean, the indie development is very important. Without the indie scene, you would not have something like Minecraft, you would not have something like Crypt of the Neko Janser I talked about earlier on the show, or Rogue Legacy, which I've talked about at length on previous episodes.

50:10.000 --> 50:30.000
I mean, everybody's played an indie game that they like probably an unhealthy amount. Right? So, anyway. Best of luck to him in his travels. I hope that, you know, if he is moving into something that's an agent role, that could be a very good thing for all game consoles, not just Wii U. So I do hope that's a good thing.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Let's move on. Dark Sakura.

50:33.000 --> 51:00.000
Well, this is not quite so indie. This is possibly the resurrection of a name lost to our past. There has been a teaser up from Activision about Sierra's return. And, I mean, keep in mind, Sierra did King's Quest, Space Quest, You Don't Know Jack, Half Life. So...

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
Originally, yeah. Sierra published the first Half Life, I believe. Yeah. And the expansion.

51:07.000 --> 51:25.000
Yep. And there was the big rivalry going on with LucasArts and Mythic and all that, you know, but there's a chance they might come back. There is maybe a classic game being rebooted. Who knows? But maybe Activision will go away and we'll get Sierra.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
That would be great.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Rebranding! We're gonna be someone that sucks less.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Can I put on my tinfoil wishful thinking hat?

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Oh, do it.

51:34.000 --> 51:48.000
Please? Okay. So do you guys remember Telltale was working on a King's Quest game? A King's Quest reboot, but then it was mysteriously cancelled. Could this be the reason why, fingers-toes-crossed, Return of King's Quest?

51:48.000 --> 51:59.000
That hopefully is more like King's Quest 4 or 5 and less like the later King's Quest games, which were kind of hot garbage? I'm hoping it's something like that. That would be fantastic to see something like that come back.

52:00.000 --> 52:12.000
Maybe people are looking at Telltale's success because Telltale has had a lot of success. I know the Jurassic Park game kind of got, eeee, reviews, but clearly Walking Dead, phenomenal, right, does very well for them.

52:12.000 --> 52:30.000
Lots of good things about the Fables game, The Wolf Among Us. Lots of good feedback on that. Back to the Future. They've had a lot of really well-received games that they've done. Maybe other companies are looking at that going, oh, maybe this point-and-click thing isn't as dead as we all thought it was.

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
Well, but it could also be possible that their name is just coming back for the sake of publishing.

52:36.000 --> 52:55.000
Could be. It could be. Yeah, because remember now, on the flip side, EA brought Origin back. Remember the Ultima games originally, before Ultima 1. I'm talking about Ultima 1-2. That was Richard Garriott's thing was Origin, and then EA bought it, and now Origin means something completely different.

52:55.000 --> 53:14.000
So hopefully that's not what's happening with Sierra, because I'm like, Activision doesn't have a storefront right now. Please don't let it be that. Please don't let Sierra be the name. Please do not tarnish another classic computing games company name with a freaking storefront.

53:15.000 --> 53:20.000
Enough! But we'll see. I guess we'll find out soon enough, right?

53:21.000 --> 53:37.000
Bobby Black Wolf, yelling out some other games they did. They did a few non-Quest games. The Colonel's Bequest, Codename Iceman, Jones and the Fast Lane. Love that one. Oilswell, Mixed Up Mother Goose. I keep on saying Incredible Crisis. Incredible Machine. That was a Sierra game, too.

53:38.000 --> 54:04.000
Curse of Dr. Brain. Loved those games. The Dr. Brain games were amazing. Island of Dr. Brain. Those games were freaking great. What else did Sierra do? Did they do Chirandia? The Hoyle card games were really good, too. Chirandia was not. Chirandia was not LucasArts. There was another one involved. Maybe they were LucasArts. No, it wasn't LucasArts. Somebody in chat will know. You're right. It was somebody else. It wasn't Sierra. It was the third group.

54:05.000 --> 54:15.000
Did they do 3D Ultra Mini Golf? I think so. Or at least they published it. I love that game. I know. I think it'd be great. It'd be great to see some of that come back.

54:16.000 --> 54:33.000
I should do a Mini Golf game. And Bobby Black Wolf says Leisure Suit Larry had no Quest. And Alan Alchemy says let's not forget their Dynamix subsidiary. Which is right. Willy Beamish was a Dynamix game. Which that game ended up on Sega CD. Willy Beamish? I could be wrong.

54:34.000 --> 54:45.000
Dark Soccer, do you remember? Willy Beamish. I remember it, but I didn't care about playing it. I had that game on, I want to say it was 14 three and a quarter floppies.

54:46.000 --> 55:01.000
I would love a new Space Quest. Well, we had an opportunity for a new Space Quest game, but I would love a legit new Space Quest game, I guess. Thank you, MXC. MXC, you get a cookie. Here it is. Here's your cookie, MXC. Chirandia games were Westwood.

55:01.000 --> 55:12.000
That's right. And Black Wolf says Willy Beamish was on Sega CD. I have it. You know what, I might actually have it. I've got like some, I have no idea what I own anymore.

55:13.000 --> 55:23.000
If you have Willy Beamish, I want it. Can I have it? I'll give you a taco, but not from the place you don't like. No. You can come over and play it though and I'll purl. Alright, fine. That'll work.

55:24.000 --> 55:30.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, cartoon.

55:31.000 --> 55:39.000
Alright, there you go. Well, I'm hoping this means some of the classic Sierra stuff coming back. Although, I think I read online that Incredible Schween has a spiritual successor that's out there.

55:40.000 --> 55:46.000
Yeah, they do. It's those original guys that made it. I forget what it's called now, but yeah, they've got that. They have several games, I think.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Well, moving on, Loki.

55:48.000 --> 55:55.000
Alright, so speaking of another company that's come back from the dead, or will be coming back from the dead, because they have their website up right now, but there is a countdown.

55:56.000 --> 56:05.000
It's going to be one week from today, I guess, or maybe a week from Monday, it looks like, that this will go live.

56:05.000 --> 56:15.000
But it's a new company called TSI. I don't know if you may remember SSI, which is Strategic Simulations Inc.

56:16.000 --> 56:22.000
It was back in the 80s and 90s. They put out a bunch of these Goldblox games, including some of the Dungeons and Dragons games and that kind of stuff.

56:23.000 --> 56:38.000
Well, now, formed by the alumni from SSI, they have the new company, Tactical Simulations Interactive, TSI, and it's going to be a new video game studio with old-school RPG sensibilities, they say.

56:38.000 --> 56:57.000
Of course, saying that they're drawing on their experience of the old studio, and not sure if they're going to be bringing back any of the old Advanced Dungeons and Dragons games or anything like that, but I guess we'll find out soon, when their site launches a week from Monday.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
So, pretty cool.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
What is up with all these classic computing companies all of a sudden making a comeback? Not that I'm complaining.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
It's indies, indies coming back, that's what it is.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
Great. I just hope they're coming back in ways that we want to have them back, and again, not storefronts.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
As long as it's not mobile games, please.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Oh, no, why did you say that?

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
I don't think so. I don't think it's going to be mobile games, but I just hope that it's not. I mean, at least not this sense.

57:25.000 --> 57:35.000
I don't have a problem with a mobile version of a game, but like, you know, the mobile game design, I guess, model, you know, where it's free to play and energy and all that stuff.

57:36.000 --> 57:45.000
And a lot of that classic stuff just doesn't translate to touchpad. I'm sorry. It's not, like, when you port a lot of that stuff to mobile, it doesn't work.

57:45.000 --> 57:56.000
The mobile games that are successful work because they're designed with mobile in mind. Things like Temple Run, Kim Kardashian, believe it or not, that crap is designed with mobile in mind.

57:57.000 --> 58:04.000
And that's why they work where Sonic the Hedgehog being ported doesn't. Because the fake joystick, it just doesn't work.

58:05.000 --> 58:17.000
So, anyway. Moving on. There's some other big, big news going on in gaming this week that doesn't affect the game companies directly, but more of a new thing that has been born of that.

58:18.000 --> 58:25.000
And Dark Soccer and I have a pair of stories here touching on what has gone on this week at Twitch TV. And there were a lot of changes at Twitch TV this week.

58:25.000 --> 58:37.000
And the first big change that happened, Justin TV shuttered its doors. Closed. As of Monday, no longer in service. Shut down. If you were streaming on the network, too bad, so sad. You're done.

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
Which, just to give you a little bit of backstory, Justin TV was what was there before there was Twitch TV.

58:44.000 --> 58:52.000
We actually used to broadcast this show on Justin TV. It was like a simulcast thing because a lot of listeners were like, we want to see a webcam while you do the show.

58:52.000 --> 59:00.000
And we actually used to, we had a better setup in the garage studio we used to use, which I don't live in that house anymore, so we don't have that.

59:01.000 --> 59:11.000
But I distinctly remember one episode, because it's probably the most viewers we ever got on Justin TV. You were streaming Final Fantasy 13, a demo that you'd imported from Japan, Loki.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
And you were playing that on the little TV and we were streaming it on Twitch with the show audio in the background.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
So we used to do that stuff on Justin TV because there was no Twitch at the time.

59:21.000 --> 59:28.000
And I did, a couple years ago, though, have the Justin TV channel converted to a Twitch channel.

59:29.000 --> 59:35.000
So I believe some of our OLR archive stuff is still there at Twitch Orange Launch Radio, but I'm telling you it's really, really old stuff.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
And it might get deleted soon anyway, but we'll get to that in a minute.

59:39.000 --> 59:52.000
So yeah, a lot of history with Justin TV. And speaking of history and things, no secret that we were once a network on live 365, then we were a part of the All Games Radio Network, right?

59:53.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And I remember Scott, over at All Games, Scott Rubin, the guy when he was doing All Games Interactive and all that, he was really big on adopting the Justin TV.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Because I think he did the whole live streaming cam stuff for a little while, which was a big part of Justin TV.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I distinctly remember one E3, he was wearing that camera and took it to like an Xbox conference or something, or maybe it was GDC.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
One of those things, like he took a camera to and was kind of streaming that stuff.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
So, you know, snaps for Scott, he kind of predicted that this is where things would end up, that it was going to end up a big gaming thing, right?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And sure enough, Twitch TV got so huge, it literally swallowed Justin TV.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So, I mean, you know, it's unfortunate, but, you know, again, how many live streamers were there compared to game streamers?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:48.000
It was a lot smaller. And the live streamers, they have other places they can go. There's that actual live stream site, it's like livestream.com, but they don't want gaming content.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Ustream is a very popular alternative as well, so you have all that.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But the father of Twitch TV, Justin TV, had closed their doors this week.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Let's see, Rageinator says, speaking of OLR simulcasting, will you three bring back the simulcast, please?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I'm iffy on it. I just don't think, it's Orange Lounge Radio, not Orange Lounge Video.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
When I have a compelling reason to use video, then we'll do it.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
It's also the bandwidth. I don't know if it can handle, yeah.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I kind of like the fact that people, and we have a YouTube channel, but a lot of that is for ease of consumption, because YouTube is on every single stinking device.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
It's really easy to get a YouTube of the show as opposed to downloading an MP3 of the show on your 3DS, right?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You can't do that. You can't download an MP3 of the show on your Vita very easily.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
But you can bring up the YouTube channel, so I sort of see OLR on YouTube as that type of thing.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And for those that do want to watch, Jason does take the time to enhance the videos and kind of does that.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But I also get emails from people that are like, I listen to you guys at work. I can't watch it.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I listen while I do my job, my data entry job or my other job that I need my eyes for that, but I don't have to listen to my work.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Or Commuter is another big thing we have too, and obviously you can't watch a video while you commute.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So I kind of like that we fill that need, and I don't really see the need to change it.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Yeah, and also if you do video, then that's less people that are on the regular stream and that kind of skews numbers.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And that'll steal my soul.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Exactly, exactly. So I just, I don't know. I'm not saying no. I'm just saying I can't think of a compelling use for it at this time.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
So that's what I'm saying there.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Let's see. And Tigerclaw points out that the archives are still there. That the Twitch TV archives are apparently still there.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
At least for now. I don't know if they're highlighted or what, but there it is.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So, alright. Moving on. A related story with all this. So that happened first, and then what, DarkSara?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Well now, after all the crap going on and the, I'd probably say the fallout from what's going on with Twitch, they are working, well, I don't know if it's there yet.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:17.000
It looks like they're going to be putting up an appeal button so that for anyone who's been affected by that copyright issue, they're going to be able to appeal it.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:31.000
In fact, the direct quote coming from DiPietro, I'm sorry, who is the VP of Marketing and Communications at Twitch says,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
We're deploying an appeal button for VODs that have been flagged for copyrighted music by the new audio recognition system.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
We recognize that the system is not yet perfect. We want to make the system as fair and unobtrusive as possible and we greatly appreciate your help.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:52.000
He didn't say anything about how it works. He didn't say anything about response time. There's no big FAQ on this or anything.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Just that there's a way to appeal it, which doesn't really help people much. So, there's that.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I honestly think that it's just throwing a bone in that, you know, yeah, they may review it, but they're going to, you know, listen to who has more money, so.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
There's a lot to say on this and I'm sure you guys have comments in our chatroom as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And Loki, I'm dying to know what you think too, but I'll start. This may surprise you, my initial thought on this, but listen to what I have to say on this.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I support Twitch doing this. That's right, I said it. I am totally fine with Twitch wanting to get the copyrighted music that people play in the backgrounds of their streams

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
while they're playing video games off of the network because that's not what the network is about. Totally support that actually.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I think if that's what you're relying on for the content of your stream, if what you're doing as you're playing the game is not compelling enough that you need to have music in the background to make your stream more interesting.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:03.000
If that's what you're doing on Twitch, then guess what? Step up your game. Wake up call. It's not interesting and it's not legal.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:13.000
So sorry, I know that's a painful thing to hear, but that's the reality of it. Try banter. Get a friend to stream with that you guys can talk while you're playing the game.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Narrate the game that you're playing. Take questions from chat. Do something a little more interactive, but don't just leave Pandora playing in the background while you're trying to play the game.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:30.000
If that's what you rely on for your content, this is your wake up call to do something different. That's not what Twitch is about and so on that end, I support what Twitch is trying to do.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Now, before you put down your pen and paper and your angry emails, because the other thing I have to say is I don't like at all how Twitch is doing it.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And I think that's a big problem a lot of people are having is that they just sprung this out of nowhere, ran this automated system through everybody's content, which flagged even Twitch's own crap.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And then if you don't like it, too bad, so sad, you're bleeped for 30 minutes with the audio dropped and all this and no warning whatsoever. That was shitty.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Now, they went out and did the Reddit, the Ask Me Anything, which Reddit, being the angry mob that it was, voted down all the answers anyway.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:24.000
So, yeah. So there was all that. They did come out and say, I think that's where that appeal button was born of and all this stuff was because of the AMA and they said the two hour length for highlighting and so forth, that would go away and all that.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:32.000
So that is good that some changes were born of that, but I still don't like the whole automated system because I fucking hate the way YouTube does it.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And what pisses me off about YouTube to no end is that their appeal system is shit and it doesn't put the consumer first, the content creators first.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:55.000
YouTube does not care about its content creators when it comes to this copyright stuff. They always side on the side of these third parties who can flag something incorrectly with no recourse whatsoever when they do it incorrectly.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And that's happened one too many times on videos I have made, and I don't even have that big of an audience, but I've made videos for games where the people who did the music and the games say it is okay to monetize this stuff on YouTube.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And it still gets flagged by some third party. There is nothing I can do about it. I can appeal it, but I'm at the mercy ultimately of those companies.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
That is not where I want to see Twitch end up, and that's what makes me nervous about this whole thing where they're going to get acquired by YouTube.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:31.000
So, okay, they put an appeal button in, but how's that really going to work? What I would have liked to have seen Twitch done is I would have liked Twitch to have said,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:43.000
we no longer permiss the third party music in the background while you're playing the game. Please stop. Because in the future, if you continue to do this, XYZ will happen.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Twitch is now a billion dollar company. They're about to get acquired by YouTube for a billion dollars if all these rumors are going to be true. Don't tell me they don't have the staff to have a couple people go in there and screen content when it gets flagged for repeatedly violating those rules.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Somebody's looking at who's screening the Twitch content right now to make sure somebody ain't fucking on their Twitch channel instead of playing a game. I'm playing a game. It's called porno.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Somebody's looking for that content right now, so Twitch can go through and figure out who's following the rules and who can't.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Well, YouTube doesn't do that. And Google's a multi-billion dollar company.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Right? Now, the other problem, and I'm sure a lot of you are sitting there screaming this out. Rob, you're not addressing this. Well, hold on. This is where things get weird.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Because you get games like Rockband, Rocksmith, Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row that have licensed soundtracks in the game that you stream these games on the network.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And I could be talking over it, but the automated system's going to pick it up anyway. So my options are I could stream Grand Theft Auto and turn the music off.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Or I guess maybe put it on the classic station, although I'm not even sure that would work because the performance is still copyrighted and they could match on that.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:08.000
So if I'm playing those games, I'm still going to get flagged. I'm not quite okay with that because I do feel like, and I realize this is not the way the law is today.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
You're going to say, well, Rob, that's not the way the law is written. Well, I'm saying this is the way the law should be written.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I kind of think if you get the license for the game and you're going to be broadcasting on Twitch, then when the game companies acquire these licenses for music, that you should be able to rebroadcast as you can the video games today.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:45.000
That should be allowable under fair use, under criticism, and those sorts of laws. And if you sign the agreement with the game company to have your song in the game, then you should therefore have those rights subject to your Twitch broadcast.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And I'm well aware that ain't how it works today. I'm saying it should. That's the way things should work.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Loki, your thoughts on this while I look at chat over at live.vognetwork.com?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I just think that as long as they don't go crazy with it like they did with YouTube, I know it's gotten a lot of backlash just with how it's handled there.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:13.000
And it doesn't seem like it's too smart that they didn't have a way to appeal them even in the beginning. It's like, gee, you know, this just happened on YouTube and you really didn't pay attention to what happened over there.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Maybe go, hmm, we shouldn't do that too. Maybe we should approach this a different way. And they just didn't see that is the reason.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And you know why they did this? They did this because of YouTube. Google probably told them to do this.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Either in preparation to purchase them or because they've already purchased them is why they're doing this.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And so, you know, the way Google did it, I mean, I don't know. It's not good.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.000
And I just kind of wonder, though, if Twitch is like, ah, fuck it, who cares? We're going to get a billion dollars.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So, you know, let's try to keep as many people happy as we can right now because we're the only kind of source for a lot of this game streaming right now.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Or at least the easiest because it's integrated in the consoles and all that stuff.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
But yeah, I agree that it's kind of a hassle that, you know, games have music in them.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I mean, it's just it's stupid, though, that you would just because you hear a song on the radio in the game, there's like other crap playing over.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
It's not like I'm going to record it with my tape player and fucking, you know, oh, I've got a copy. Now I don't need to buy one.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Come on. That's just like that's the whole cassette tape argument from years ago.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I'm totally going to make a mixtape of stuff I hear in video games. Just saying.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I don't know. I kind of I remember being younger. I used to put the little tape recorder up to the Nintendo and tape the songs I really loved.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
In fact, I remember one year. All right. Already for Tangent Time. This is a huge one.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Anybody ever heard of Odyssey of the Mind? Something we used to do in grade school where you have these big projects and things.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
So every year in Odyssey of the Mind, one of the somebody, so at least one person in chat will fucking know what I'm talking about.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Look it up on Wikipedia or something. All right.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Well, Odyssey of the Mind, when I was in like fourth or fifth grade, there's always a competition to build structures and who can build the structure that can hold the most weight.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And that's the thing we did one year. But you do a performance around it as well.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
So we did like a little Egyptian themed performance. Don't ask. It made sense at the time. Okay.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But here's the deal. To get the music for the Egyptian themed performance that we were doing for the balsa wood structure that we made in like the fifth grade,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I took a tape recorder, held it up to my Game Boy. No, I took a cord and took it from the Game Boy output and put it in the boombox and taped that way.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I taped the background music from Super Mario Land when you're in the Egyptian temple. You remember that?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
No, that was great.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
That was the music we used when we did the performance.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
That's awesome.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000
So it's funny that you joke like, oh, I'm going to make mixtapes of video game music, but like I actually did do that shit back in the day.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.000
When I lived in Alabama and I didn't have a Nintendo 64, Dan, this is when we were still in our phone phase.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I said, I want Orchid's music from KI Gold.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:12.000
And he kept, because it starts you at a random stage every time, he kept restarting the game until he got it to start at that and recorded the music for me.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Because he's a good husband.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Let me just put it this way. Okay, game companies or people that license music to game companies, you do realize it's so much fucking easier to pirate that song off the internet than try to fucking record it off of a livestream of a game.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I mean, it just doesn't make any sense why you would even do that, other than the fact that you're just evil is the only thing I can think of.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Do you know how easy it is to find music on YouTube?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
It's seriously easy. It's like, oh, I like that song in Grand Theft Auto. Well, I can't buy the soundtrack for it, at least at the time.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:54.000
So it's like, well, fuck, I'm gonna look up the artist. I'm gonna look up the song. Hey, look, it's a video on YouTube. Oh, look, I can just download it off of YouTube because there's a billion programs out there or websites or whatever to download the music off of YouTube.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Or I can just play it and run another audio program and just record it straight off that because that's a thing. So why is it?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I used to, with my full duplex sound card, used to be able to get the music off of people's Myspace.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I would record while I play and there you go. Perfect digital copy.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.000
It's so dumb. I know you're well within your rights to do that, but you're also a dick. You're also a dick for doing that.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should do it because, if anything, and I did legitimately buy some of these songs I liked from Grand Theft Auto, and I found them because of Grand Theft Auto.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So, I don't know, it's just really dumb that they go about this. It doesn't help your image, RIAA. I mean, seriously.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Raginator in chat says, I actually had my Super Nintendo's audio cables hooked up to the aux on a stereo and I made mixtapes of game music. Games like Actraiser, Super Girls and Ghosts, Super Castlevania IV, the Star Wars games, etc.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Robert M says, Google's actions are due to pressure from the labels, publishers, etc.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000
VX Jason XV says, Twitch doesn't have the staff to screen content as a matter of fact. The fact they're a hundreds of million dollar company is moot.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Twitch is made of engineers, designers, administrators, sales, and very few community reps. So, policing is hard.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I understand what you're saying with that, but my whole thing is that if you want to be a billion dollar company, you have to have a department that's able to handle some of these regulations and things like that.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It's very common in many industries that you have a department that makes sure the products you're putting out there are in compliance.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Well, business is hard, so get fucking staff to cover it.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
That's what I'm saying. And if they don't have the money to cover it, well then it's not a profitable business.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I feel so bad for Twitch not having the staff to cover that. Oh, they'll show their money. They're gonna get sued by these guys. I mean, come on. I don't feel bad for them at all.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000
The World 2 in our chatroom says, to add legitimacy to the company, they had to do this. The issue is how they didn't talk to gamers prior to this.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
The backlash will go away very quickly. YouTube had a big issue with copyright and had to fix a bit of it to get bought by Google.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Yeah, and that kind of brings, you know, what a lot of other people are saying is, oh, everybody's abandoning ship and going to Hitbox now, Hitbox TV.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Here's the thing with that. I think competition would be great. I would like to see something like Hitbox get bigger.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I mean, I know Ustream's kind of a thing right now, but Ustream isn't exactly focused on gaming either. Ustream's kind of gaming's like a little bit of an afterthought over there.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Even though it is built into the PS4, I know. But I would like to see something like Hitbox that could really compete with Twitch on that same gamer level.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I'd like to see that happen because I think if there was something like Hitbox that had been at that same volume competing for that billion dollar cash from Google with Twitch TV,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I don't think Twitch would have made these very quick decisions that, you know, would cause their community to take issue with it and easily pack up and go somewhere else as some of the most extreme people have had.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:14.000
At the end of the day, however, if you think Hitbox TV is some magical island that is immune from all of these problems...

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Nope.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Because when Hitbox gets big enough, guess what? They're going to have the RIA knocking on their door too or whatever company wants to legitimize them and get their money too.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And then there'll be another competing company and then we can jump to that one too!

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I agree with AxeDeft. I blame Metallica. Thank you, Lars.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Take it all the way back, right? All the way back.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Isn't that kind of where things started?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And The World 2 makes a comparison there in our chatroom saying, people said they abandoned Vimeo or Daily Motion or other video sites. YouTube's still alive and well.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So, you know, and really, here's the thing about that whole Napster mess. All it took was for somebody to legitimize what Napster was doing and make it just as easy to do things the legal way as opposed to the illegal way.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:14.000
And that's all it took to get people to go to the bright side. And that was Apple with iTunes finally did that. And then, of course, there's millions of knockoffs.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
And then Napster decided to do that, but it was already too late.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It was already too late at that point. But once iTunes was a thing, you had a lot of people that were willing to pay money because it was just as easy as Napster was.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I don't necessarily know that tons of people pirated. I mean, this is God. This is like a 20-year-old conversation.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:45.000
But I'm not sure that people were pirating off Napster just because they wanted to steal. They did it because it was easy. I want to hear that song right now. Oh, Napster's got it.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:53.000
It was easy, and I could find, like, if I typed in, you know, an artist's name or something like that in Remix, I could find all these, like, things I've never heard of before.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It's like, fuck, I didn't know there was remixes of this song. That was awesome.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Alright, anyhow, lots of opinions on this, and I'm sure you guys have more opinions as well. Be sure to email us. Participate. If you want to participate with the show, participate at orangeloungerated.com is the email address.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000
For now, let's travel around the world and check out upcoming release dates. We're almost to the Classic Game of the Week, but first, what's coming out this week? Loki?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Not a whole ton. There's the disc version of World of Tanks, at least I think it's a disc version. It's a retail version for $19.99.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It's the World of Tanks, was it the, what's their, Combat Ready Starter Pack. It's got a bunch of shit in there.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:39.000
But yes, so you can purchase that at retail now on Xbox 360. This guy of four I promised revisited on the Vita.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Akiba's Trip, Undead and Undressed on PlayStation 3 and on Vita. And Risen 3, Titan Lords on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That's it.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Alright, going to Japan and looking at the releases in Japan this week on the Wii U. There's actually nothing on PlayStation 4, there's nothing on PlayStation 3, but on the Wii U this week has the huge release.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Zelda Musou comes out this week. You guys know what that is?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Hyrule Warriors.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000
It is Hyrule Warriors coming out on the Wii U this week in Japan, so I'm sure there's lots of excitement around that. So that's the big, big release in Japan this week. That is out on the 14th.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Going quickly to check the other platforms. The Vita does have Clannad comes out on the Vita as well, and checking the 3DS really quick. No, nothing there.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Hyrule Warriors really the big, big release this week in Japan.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Dark Sakura.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Well, in other releases there's a 1. 1 for the 13th in the UK. And that's Gravity Crash Ultra. That's it.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.000
So Capcom announced that they are remaking Resident Evil. It's gonna be coming out early 2015.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And it's basically the original Resident Evil getting an HD remix and supposed to be out on, I guess, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Sorry Wii U, no Wii U.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:22.000
And it'll be 1080p and support 5.1 surround sound and, you know, classic and modern schemes and blah, blah, blah.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000
And I gotta be honest, I like the screenshots of this. It doesn't look that great. I mean, I don't know, it doesn't look that updated.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.000
But I guess at this point, no, we've run out of ideas for Resident Evil, so let's remake them now.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Because they, you know, did that before when they ran out of ideas, so why not? Let's re-remake them.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:52.000
How do you guys feel about remakes? Dark Sakura, I know you're into Resident Evil. Do you think this is a good direction for the series? Or God, no, make it stop.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I really have no more feelings about Resident Evil anymore. I was done. I was done after the third one.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:09.000
It could be smart. I mean, they probably are realizing that they've probably pushed the story a little bit further than where they feel comfortable.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Or where it can go.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Six was really kind of a departure, I guess, from the series. They made it more like action and over the top.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Kind of like the movies, actually, if you think about it. Because the movies are like, okay, there's zombies in there.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:30.000
But then it's also Mila Yomich just like fucking going crazy and doing kung fu and all sorts of crazy stuff.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
The movies are pretty fun if you don't take them seriously.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:42.000
They are fun. See, that's the thing. I don't know anything about Resident Evil. I mean, I kind of get the basic plot, but I can't follow that in the movies.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
But the movies you don't really need to follow because it doesn't make any sense.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Dan and I played through the first three together. And then we played through Code Veronica together. And then after a while, we were sort of like, what can they do? Done.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Although I will have to say that Biohazard 2 Gun Survivor is really fun in the arcade. Which is basically Resident Evil with a gun.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. TigerClaw says, if they're going to remake Resident Evil 1, they can finally get better voice acting.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I already did that once anyway.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I kind of don't want that. Or at least let me pick. Let me pick.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I hope this is not Chris's blood.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Oh God, I wish I had that MP3 readily available because that was so frickin' funny.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Just relax and play.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Raginator says, I'd rather buy play remakes of the first four Resident Evils than buy or play Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I would think Resident Evil 4. I mean, I haven't played that game in a while, but I would think it still holds up pretty well today.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I mean, I realize it was, what, two gens ago? GameCube, right? PS2?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
But they've remade it. They've already remade four. They remade four, I think, for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Oh, you're right. I think they did.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
That's why I can't keep track of all these goddamn remakes because they've remade all these games several times.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
It's true.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I don't even know anymore. It's like, okay, he had all these remakes and then Resident Evil 5 and then Resident Evil 6.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
You know, giraffe fellatio edition.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I can't think of Resident Evil 6 without thinking of the frickin' logo that looks like somebody blowing a giraffe.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Yeah, it's giraffe fellatio edition.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I couldn't tell you anything about actual Resident Evil 6 except, oh yeah, that's the logo where it looks like someone's blowing a giraffe.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I know that there's a motorcycle jumping from an explosion and that there's, you know, the logo looks like, you know, a giraffe getting blown. So, that's about it.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
That's about it.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Alright, well, in less giraffe fellatio news, news about Mario Kart 8. Hey, Mario Kart 8 still driving along.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Lots of people enjoying that on the Wii U. There will be new content coming out for Mario Kart 8 later this month.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:54.000
August 27th, the day that Mario Kart 8 gets more stuff, including Mercedes-Benz themed DLC.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
This is already out in Japan, but we're going to be getting it finally on August 27th.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
And what's pretty cool is that there's also a major update happening to the game on August 27th.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Some things that are happening is that your preferred kart customization will be saved to the system, which will shorten the process of choosing what you want your kart to be.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Plus, you can copy and edit other players' highlights in Mario Kart TV. That's pretty cool.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And the scoreboard area can be selected so you can view your total coins, online record of wins and losses, selection of characters, and so on.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000
The online communication and races will have improved stability, that's a good thing, and other minor fixes to problems.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:41.000
And I believe I read somewhere as well, the button will default to, when you're done with a race, it will default now to next race as opposed to view highlight.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Because I don't know how many times I've done that where I hit the A button, I'm just like A-A-A, like I'm just pressing the button real fast, and it goes in the highlight reel.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And I'm like, shit, I didn't want that, I wanted the next race. So that's nice to see that happening.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Thoughts, hearing that Nintendo is patching Mario Kart and adding new things to it after the fact? I think it's good.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.000
It's nice. I don't know about the DLC, it's a little stupid, but whatever, it's free.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000
But Yaris is free. I don't know, it's just skins for cars, it's not really new cars, it's not like anything new to the game.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000
It's just kind of like, ooh, now this car looks like, you know, a different, you know, car.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I feel like what this DLC amounts to is it's like, okay, well I'll check it out and I'll play it like one time, after it comes out I'll update the game, play it one time, and then be like, alright, I saw it.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
And then I'll save it until I have a party, and have people over to play.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000
And it totally kind of throws you out of the whole Mario Kart universe, I mean, because it looks a little weird.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Whatever, I mean, you can pretend that you're driving the monopoly car.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Just imagine they're cardboard boxes, because it's kind of what they look like.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, actdef says, this Mario Kart 8 update is going to be awesome.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000
DarkTetsuya says, I'm stoked for the new Mario Kart update, also I believe the MK8 DLC isn't out in Japan yet.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
There's a trailer that also says 8.27, but it's the Japan trailer.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I believe the Mercedes-Benz thing is already out there.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:19.000
So, there you go. Very, very, very, very, very cool.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000
That's that for that, let's go to a simpler time.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Before we, when you could not patch games, you could not download and patch games, you could not do that.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
If the game was broken, it was broken. It's a more classic time for games.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Or they would release another cartridge of it.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:46.000
The classic game of the week, where Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find the game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
There's no Mercedes-Benz in it, but it's awesome.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I think I'm going to actually go with a theme for the next few weeks of Capcom CPS2 arcade machines.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Because, the CPS2 is awesome. We had some of our best games.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
As long as you do Quiz and Dragons.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Maybe. But, the game I'm bringing up first is Alien vs. Predator.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Sweet.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Which was one of my favorite beat-em-ups. Ever.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000
You had, basically, a bunch of aliens all over the world. What happens?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.000
They have two cyborg soldiers, who was Dutch Schaeffer and Lin Kurosawa, who I would always play at.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
And then two predators, a hunter and a warrior.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
And then, they all have melee weapons. Lin has a katana.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000
There's a bladed staff for the hunter, an extendable spear for the warrior.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
And Dutch doesn't have one, but he has a big cyborg arm and can punch the fuck out of him.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
I mean, basically, they've got different types of ranged weapons.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Like a smart gun, a rapid-fire handgun, all kinds of different things.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
And, basically, you just play through the whole game, beating up aliens and beating up people who are working with the aliens.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Working with the aliens and or trying to breed said aliens.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And you sometimes fight the mama alien a few times, especially at the end.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Which actually shows a man being ripped in half.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
It's true. You watch the, he's like the main boss of the game.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And then, spoilers, the alien thing comes down and stabs him in the gut.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And then she bites his head off and rips his body in half.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
This was the 90s.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
So that's species?

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
No, she wasn't trying to fuck him.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
She was just trying to fuck him over.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Anyway, so the game was, I mean, it was really awesome.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
It was voted as one of the top beat-em-up games by Heavy.com.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
It was ranked number 12.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And it really is one of, I would probably say, it was well received, but I don't think it's appreciated when you compare it to some of the other CPS2 games.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And also Kurosawa made appearances in other Capcom games, like Street Fighter Alpha 2, Street Fighter 3, and Namco X Capcom.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:27.000
And her design was actually reused for Ibuki in Street Fighter 3, who had a friend named Sarai Kurosawa.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I never realized that those characters were kind of related like that. That's awesome.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:44.000
And then the character, Simone from Cannon Spike, was derived from her appearance as well.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:59.000
There was one of Treasure's designers, Tetsuhiko Kikuchi, said that Mad Stalker, Full Metal Force, and Alien Fish Predators were his inspiration for Guardian Heroes.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
So there you go. And there's really not too much else to be said about it.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:11.000
It is a beat-em-up. You have, you know, your food hidden in boxes and stuff to help you replenish life.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:17.000
The cabinet does allow you to play up to three people simultaneously. Smaller ones are only two.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And you do get the four characters. You have, like I said, you have the two human and the two predator warriors.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
They also, you know, they have their melee weapon, they have a gun, and then they can pick up grenade launchers and flamethrowers.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000
And the joystick is one of the eight directional joysticks. It has three buttons. Attack, jump, and shoot.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.000
So, and the game is set in California, in a place that doesn't exist.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Sandrad.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster having some comments on this game saying,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
an Alien vs. Predator came out for the Super Nintendo in 93, but it was nothing like the arcade version.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And Dungeon Buster says it also never came out in a Capcom collection of any kind, as far as I know, and it stayed in the arcade,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
which is really too bad. The beat-em-up is really one of Capcom's greats.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Obviously it has to be a licensing thing, right?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I would think so, and also keep in mind there was an Alien vs. Predator on Jaguar that was probably one of the few good Jaguar games,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.000
well at least one of the ones that people mostly got the Jaguar for, that and Tempest 2000.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:31.000
There, and if you think about it now, this was sort of a wishful thinking, you know, type of game at the time, combining the two licenses.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.000
And, of course, eventually it led on to us getting an Alien vs. Predator movie, there were comics going on forever,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
which of course these characters had nothing to do with comics.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
But, you know, I would have liked to have seen, I would have liked to have seen more, you know.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
But, unfortunately, no.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
It was not meant to be.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
But you do get to see someone torn in half.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Just to reiterate.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
By the Alien Queen.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Ripped in half with blood splatter.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Awesome.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
In a 90's Capcom game.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Rad.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Alright, there it is.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Yes, the Jaguar game was a first person shooter.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Alien vs. Predator, in the arcade on the Capcom CPS2 system.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And did we mention, guy gets ripped in half, blood everywhere.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Squish.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Alright, not for the squeamish.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Alright, that is going to do it here for the first half of our show, we're going to take a quick break guys,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
and we'll be back with more.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
We have the football question of the week coming up, including also rapid fire news,

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
and some discussion on some upcoming things.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Diablo 3, a little bit of news coming out about that,

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
because the release of that game on Playstation 4 and Xbox One is coming right up.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And also, we've talked a lot in the past about Twitch plays Pokemon,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
but now who's playing Pokemon on Twitch?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Glub, glub.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you guys know, but we'll talk about that.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
And what could possibly be next when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 563 for August the 10th, 2014 already in progress.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Welcome to the second half of the show.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I'm Rob Roberts, she's Dark Sakura, he's Loki.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Continuing on with the second half of our show tonight.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Dark Sakura, I don't know if you saw this going on,

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
but there's a little bit of chatter on the Twitter Zs and the Facebooks and all this,

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
but it sounds like GamerX, which was the convention you and I went to a couple weeks ago,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
doesn't sound like it's going to necessarily be dead after all.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And this seems like it might be as a result of all those companies jumping in a little while back,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000
saying that they would kick some money in.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Definitely sounds like they're going to go the Kickstarter route with GamerX 3.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000
So sometimes fussing about stuff on the internet is good?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Perhaps. I sort of get the sense, and again, it's not like I can speak for them in any official capacity,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I can just go off of what I see on Twitter and Facebook,

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
but I'm getting the sense that they're kind of going at this place where it's like,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
okay, everybody's talking about, we need to do another, we need to do another,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
so let's see if people put their money where their mouth is.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
That's kind of the impression I'm getting from it.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I'm all for it. I'm all for it too.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I don't want to see those guys lose money out of their own pockets,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:19.000
so I hope, I just hope they don't get it out there now to get the money before they have some sort of plan,

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
because my impression is they don't know where they're going to have it yet,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
and so I hope they at least have that somewhat figured out,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
because there's talk about, it seems like they're certainly taking it out of San Francisco,

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be out of the Bay Area.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000
It could be in, what, San Jose or near SFO, but I'm seeing talk about what, Portland, Texas, possibly.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Portland's been a big one.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Yeah, Portland.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
If it's in Texas, I can't go, and I'm serious.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Portland would make a lot of sense, actually, as would Seattle, but Seattle has packs, so I'd support Portland.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
You can drive to Portland in ten hours, and it's beautiful up there, so we'll see what happens,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.000
but best of luck to all those guys over at GamerX. Hope to see you guys back next year, or in two years, however long it takes.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Alright, we've got some more gaming news to get to. Let's do some rapid-fire news, some quick stories we want to hit on,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
even though we might not discuss them in depth. Loki.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Alright. So, let's see. More delays, unfortunately. The game evolved,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
which is going to be the four-on-one multiplayer game by Turtle Rock Studios.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Remember, they did the Left 4 Dead series. Unfortunately, it has been pushed back to February 10th.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Pac-Man versus the first-person shooter, right? Kinda.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Except, instead of Pac-Man, it's like, you know, a giant Cthulhu.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
This was one of the big, big games at E3. I believe it's Evolve-a, singular.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Yes, it's Evolve.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Yeah, you said evolved at first, but that's alright. Anyway, yeah, I was looking forward to that game,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
so that's a bummer to see it pushed back, and everybody's talking about,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
oh my god, all the games this year are getting pushed back, every game that's coming.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
This happens every stinking year, that all the Christmas games get pushed back.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Well, I think this year it's less more, or less of, we don't want to compete with Call of Duty,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
and more of, it's just not done.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Yeah, and you know what, I'd rather the game be finished, and bugs worked out, and all that good stuff.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Hey, I'm just glad that Grand Theft Auto, the PlayStation 4, Xbox One version,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:26.000
still on the financial report for holiday of 2014, so I don't give a shit about Evolve.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I want more Grand Theft Auto 5 that you will play, since you said you would.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Yes, I will play.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Alright.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I will punch a hooker in the face just for you, Loki.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
They have cats, you can kick a cat now, too.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Why would I kick a cat?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
If I throw a cat at a hooker.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Why? It's a cat.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Can you throw a hooker at a cat?

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
If it was Saints Row, you probably could.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
This is the power of the PlayStation 4, and I can't throw a hooker?

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Hookers are people, too. Naked people.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
No, no, they're not really naked, they're just drawn that way.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000
And then finally, we knew that there was going to be an Assassin's Creed coming to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Wii U.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Assassin's Creed Rogue.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Unfortunately, it's not coming through the Wii U.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Because Ubisoft has this thing against the Wii U now, I guess.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
So Assassin's Creed Rogue coming on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
The twist this time is that you were an Assassin, but you've switched sides.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Now you are, you know, what was it?

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
An Assassin traitor.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Nah, you're not with the Templars.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Oh, you switched sides, so you're finally a woman?

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
No, you're with the Templars now.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
I have my hopes up for the Assassin's Creed series.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Hey, do you want to play woman Assassin's Creed?

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
No, there's the Vita one, there's the Vita one.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
It's technically on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I have to give a little jab, come on.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Remember, hey, you know what, if the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One can't render a woman, what makes you think of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 again?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I don't know what I was thinking, Loki, you're right.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
And definitely not the Wii U. The Wii U can't render anybody.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
The Wii U can't render anybody.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
It can only render cartoons.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
It can only render Mario. Hey, Assassin's Mario.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Dude, Mushroom Kingdom Assassin's Creed game, but like with Mario, and just like straight up violence against, you know, everything, that would be totally awesome.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Mamma mia, my princess is in another castle, your death is in this one.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Alright, and then, let's see, yeah, so, apparently, the compensation rules from the NCAA lawsuit thing are, they're violating antitrust laws.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:40:03.000
See, I don't understand much of this stuff, but apparently, the US District Court, Judge Claudia Wilken, she ruled that the NCAA rules prohibiting student, you know, the student athletes that were in those games, from receiving compensation for use of their likeness, violates antitrust laws.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:19.000
So, does that mean now that they're gonna have to get rid of those rules, and, you know, allow them to receive compensation?

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Because if that's the case, then EA's probably like, cha-ching, we can do NCAA games again.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Basically calling it unreasonable restrained trade.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:45.000
So, that's kind of interesting, and this is especially, you know, interesting after they've already kind of settled and paid each student $1,000, but it may open it up for more NCAA games now that they've kind of ruled that.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Kind of cool to see what happens.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I'm sure EA's looking forward to that.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:04.000
The whole legal stuff, there's so much legal stuff, I just don't understand. I don't think anybody does. I don't, I don't, oh my God, I don't, I, how am I supposed to make sense of it even between this and what we were talking about earlier in the show?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Basically, you know, they said, you know, enforcing any rules to prevent its members, schools, and conferences from offering to deposit a limited share of licensing revenue in a trust for their FBS football and Division I basketball recruits, payable when they leave the school or eligibility expires.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Let's see, so, I guess the injunction allows the NCAA to cap the trust fund at $5,000 for each year of college athlete is academically eligible to play, and the students would be paid upon graduation.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:51.000
So, maybe it opens it up, I don't know. I'm sure EA's looking to anything they can to get that because, you know, that was their big month, cash cow for July.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And now they don't have it.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Alright, well, let's move on and talk about Rise, Son of Rome. You guys check this out on Xbox One?

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I don't have an Xbox One, so I can't play that game.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000
If you missed Rise on Xbox One, you can check out Rise, Son of Rome on PC.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
What?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I know, Crytek will be putting the game out on PC at some point this fall, teaming up with publisher Deep Silver, who's going to handle the boxed version of the game.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000
That's crazy, next year you're going to tell me Dead Rising 3 is coming to PC.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Or am I going to tell you that, you know, you should have figured this out because of Homefront, but anyway.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Rise on the PC will feature some DLC from before, the Colosseum pack, the Mars Chosen pack, the Duels of Fate pack, all this, all this packs, packs upon packs.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000
PC players are also going to have the Ruins multiplayer map, and the game will support 4K resolution.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Yeesh.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Alright, not supporting 4K resolution, but should still be a heck of a lot of fun, and I know people looking forward to this on the Wii U.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:04.000
That is Hyrule Warriors, and there was a whole Nintendo Direct about it this past week, where they confirmed Ganondorf, Zant, and Ghirahim confirmed as some more playable characters.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Who the fuck are these characters? I mean, I understand who Ganon is, but who the fuck are all these other characters?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:16.000
I mean, I really only skipped Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. I mean, are there that many fucking characters in these games?

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Yup. There were that many characters.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Well, I guess I also skipped Twilight Princess, and...

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
There you go, that's what's wrong.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Twilight Princess is great.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
So, anyhow, you have all that to look forward to. Lots of other stuff about the game to mention too.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.000
There's an adventure mode where you get a grid of challenges that looks like the NES Legend of Zelda map.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.000
So, Nintendo never afraid to milk that nostalgia a little bit, but you know what? When it comes to Zelda, I say milk it.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:48.000
If you're a club Nintendo member and you buy and register Hyrule Warriors within four weeks of launch, you get alternate Ganon costumes as free game DLC.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Unfortunately, I'm hearing there's some other costume DLC that's going to be exclusive to retail, one of them being GameStop, but it sounds like they're going to offer it to...

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I think they said three different retailers, so hopefully Amazon or Best Buy or somebody else is involved too. We'll see.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Also, a Chain Chomp will make a guest appearance as a weapon.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Yee, Chain Chomp.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And if that isn't your cup of tea, perhaps in Nintendo you are a fan of Princess Peach.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
And this kind of cracks me up, because you know how we had the Year of Luigi last year, right?

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Which actually went on for like a fiscal year, because it went on the way to like March, right?

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Before they finally said, okay, no more Year of Luigi.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
And then the angry Luigi meme happened after the fact.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Well, whereas you had the Year of Luigi, we're going to get the month of Princess Peach.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Nintendo putting out a tweet.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Gender equality.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:47.000
It's kind of fucked up in a way, but Nintendo putting out a tweet saying, August is National Princess Peach Month.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
So tell us what you love about the Mushroom Kingdom's glorious rulers. So there you go.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000
The month of Princess Peach. I don't know what else they're going to do to celebrate the month.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Maybe they're doing DS games on the, maybe they'll put Super Princess Peach out or something, or I don't know.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
So there you go.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
The month of Princess Peach.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Our very own Princess Dark Sakura.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Who would like to have-

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Connie Queen.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
How about some Borderlands 2 news?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Borderlands 2 has shipped 10 million copies. It is 2K's highest selling game.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
And Borderlands 2 is awesome.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Plus, Borderlands, the pre-sequel is going to be coming out, which is awesome.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I got to play it. I sucked at it, but it was fun.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
That's my song about it.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
By the way, that's going to be out on October 14th for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:53.000
In other news, how about Xbox One is getting some in Europe?

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:07.000
There will be the digital TV tuner out in October, which is a USB peripheral that will allow you to watch TV on your TV, but with your video game system.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Because cable boxes are overrated.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I wonder if that's going to bypass the TV tax in the UK.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
You know about the TV tax, right?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Yes, I do.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
And then, last but not least, more X-Bone news.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:30.000
There will be a white Xbox One coming out with Sunset Overdrive and or Madden.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Madden 15 bundle will be $399 without a Kinect and will be out on August 26th.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:45.000
And then, of course, there is the Sunset Overdrive edition on October 28th.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Well, the game is scheduled for October 28th.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
I would only guess that the bundle will be out at the same time.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Yeah.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
This might be finally what gets me to get a white Xbox One for the Sunset Overdrive.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I think we'll be good.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Because I don't have an Xbox One yet, but I'm going to buy one this holiday.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
And I wanted to get Sunset Overdrive anyway, so it works out, right?

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Yeah.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Loki, would this bundle encourage you to get an Xbox One?

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
You know, I have to ask.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Money is really going to be the factor, being that I will be getting laid off right before that happens.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
So, not really looking to add any consoles to my library at this moment.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
But yes, if I was going to buy a console a holiday...

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Actually, I would probably wait closer to the end of the holiday, because what kind of bundles are they going to be doing?

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
That's what I want to know.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
The color doesn't really matter. White Xbox will only be pretty cool.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I did want to pick up Sunset Overdrive.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Well, I hope, if nothing else, I hope you can land a new job quickly.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
And if anybody in Sacramento is hiring, contact the show.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000
I hope you can land a new job quickly and buy yourself an Xbox One as a celebratory gift would be great, right?

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Right.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Actually, I'd want a PlayStation 4 first.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Fair enough. Let's get to the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000
You take Facebook and Google+, you slam those words together, you get FUGL.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Every week in our Facebook and Google Plus communities, we ask a question of our communities and we read our favorite answers here on the show.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
I'm a little disappointed at the lack of participation this week.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
We did not get a lot of answers.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Did I just ask a shitty question? I guess I did.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.000
What's up with it, you slackers?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Alright, maybe the question was just too weird. I don't know.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Sometimes we get millions of answers. It's also that Facebook algorithm.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Sometimes our statuses will get seen by like 600, 700 people.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
This one got seen by 140, so maybe that's why. I don't know.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
You know what I'll blame? I'll blame Messenger.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Why not? Everybody else is blaming that for their problems this week.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I blame Facebook Messenger.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Here's the Facebook Question of the Week and Google Plus Question of the Week.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000
What indie game, not out on Wii U yet, would you like to see ported and released ASAP?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000
After all, we were talking earlier in the show about Dan Adelman and he was a big part of the indie games on Wii U and now he's not going to be there anymore.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
So what does Nintendo need to get on putting on the Wii U right away? Let's get to the answers.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Over on Facebook, Andy R. replies and says, is Rogue Legacy on Wii U?

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
If not, then Rogue Legacy. I just picked it up on Vita and I'm loving it.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000
I probably wouldn't buy it again on Wii U since I can just play on my PS4, but I want to see that game reach as many people as possible.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
That's a good answer. I mean, you could have the mini map, right?

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I mean, that's the quintessential use for the gamepad, right? You have a little mini map there, maybe your item.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Well, there's not a lot of items, but you can sometimes switch magic or you can see the little profile of your character.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
I could see that working very well, actually, so that would be cool.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Fabrice A. replies and says, the Kickstarter, 90s Arcade Racer. I remember that Kickstarter. That's on its way, right?

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
You were following that a little bit, right, Logie?

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:04.000
90s Arcade Racer is still on its way and yeah, one of the platforms it was expected to be out on was Wii U, actually, and it looks awesome.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
I don't know if they've done any updates recently, but yeah, it looks pretty sweet.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Dark Tetsuya responded and said, how about one of the behemoth games like Castle Crashers, Battle Block Theater, or something new in that same style with four-player simultaneous action?

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Good answer. I think that Castle Crashers is a great, fun little title. I think that would be a lot of fun to see there on the Wii U.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.000
All right, let's go over to Google+, where I think now, for the first time, our Google+, and Facebook almost got the same amount of answers.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
We had three on Facebook, we had two on Google+, so getting close there. Who said Google+, is dead?

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Act F seems to agree with one of the Facebookers, saying Act F says Rogue Legacy is one I've been thinking about recently.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Getting a Wii U port would be pretty sweet.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Redertainment says, what titles on a platform I don't own would I like to see released?

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
How about that detox album Dr. Dre is supposed to be working on?

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:05.000
What? Is that a game? Do you want to see C&C Music Factory making the video, or what was the other one, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch?

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
It's Criss Cross One, don't forget that.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
You want to see that on Wii U?

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
I'll make you jump jump.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:20.000
There it is. Those are the answers there. How about you guys here in studio? Any indie games you think ought to make their way over to Wii U?

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
All the games.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Yeah, there's a couple indie games I can think of that actually would be really good for the Wii U.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
There's this indie game called Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
That is not an indie game.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:38.000
There's an indie franchise called Madden. Let's see, what else can we put on there? That would be really good.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I want Fairy Solitaire.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
At least that's actually an indie game.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:50.000
How about, there's another indie series I love. Saints Row would be great.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Dude, how about Hotline Miami?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Thank you, Darth Vader's actually giving us one. How about, Loki, if you got to go with these, how about Minecraft would be a great indie game?

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.000
That would be fantastic, since it's on every other fucking platform on Earth, but Nintendo, you just...

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I think that was Notch's thing, where he's like, I'm not doing it.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Well, he pissed them off. Obviously Nintendo pissed them off.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Maybe they said, hey, you got to put Mario in there somewhere.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000
The thing is that the Wiimote would actually lend itself well to some of those puzzle games that aren't exactly timed.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Like the ones that I like.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
What about Drunken Robot Pornography?

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Drunken Robot Pornography wouldn't work on it. It just wouldn't control right.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
But Fractal, and you can use the Wiimote as a pointer instead, or you ever play Kami?

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
It's an origami-based puzzle game.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
But you know what I really hope that they put on that platform?

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I hope they put a really interesting game where you play as this giant robot and you have to move your limbs around and stuff like that.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.000
And maybe it could be made by Miyamoto and completely be boring when he showed it off.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Because that's really what I want to see, is his fucking stupid ass game.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Or maybe, hey, let's make a security game where he guards some building from Rob the Robot.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Because that's fucking stupid.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I thought you were talking about Mega Man Legends 3 at worst.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
No, Mega Man Legends 3. Yeah, an indie game like Mega Man Legends 3 would be awesome too.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Well you just said Grand Theft Auto.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Yeah, but I'm just saying, you know, because that's what we want to see.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000
We want to see a fucking security game, or a game where you play like a bumbling robot.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Star Fox? Fuck that. We're not going to show much of Star Fox, but we'll show this piece of shit that he's working on.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Look, I understand that you don't want to keep making sequels of games and stuff like that or rehashing old stuff, but make interesting shit.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Splatoon looked interesting.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Yes, but that wasn't Miyamoto. Okay, that was a team that made interesting games.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Well?

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Well, let's get him making some interesting games. Maybe he doesn't make interesting games anymore.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Fuck, I'll take, you know what, Splatoon guys, you make Splatoon and you make some more interesting games because they're fucking not doing it.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.000
And, you know, props to the guys making, you know, like the new Zelda game and stuff because that looks fucking interesting.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:20.000
But this shit that Miyamoto's working on, because I, you know, he's the designer of Mario and many other great, you know, properties and stuff.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Let's let him work in the corner and work on some more hopefully brilliant ideas.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
But it's just not happening anymore. He just doesn't have the spark anymore.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000
He's coming up with like a jump to conclusions mat is what he's coming up with.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Participate at Orangelaungerator.com for your cards and letters and candy vouchers for Loki.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Participate at Orangelaungerator.com.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Speaking of Loki, let's get back into some other gaming news now that the frugal hush is over. Loki.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Alright, let's see here. This is kind of neat. Duke Nukem Critical Mass on PSP. Never released. Disappeared.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:07.000
But it was supposed to be coming out on the PSP and it was found in the most unlikely of places. The Library of Congress.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Apparently, David Gibson, a moving image technician, stumbled upon the game and media related artifacts, I guess, in the library, including a complete playable but never released version of the game.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:31.000
And also it was, I guess, a different version of the game than what was released on the DS.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And apparently it was on like a DVD rom or something.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:43.000
So he actually dug through some of the code in there and actually looked at and they showed some of the 3D models. He posted a video.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I got to wonder, is that like violating some sort of thing? You know, put digging through someone's source code. I mean, I know it's part of Library of Congress, so maybe everyone has access to that stuff.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Exactly. I think that you're answering your own question, I believe.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I don't know if he should have been doing that, but whatever. But it's still kind of neat. I don't know if it would have been a great game because it's on PSP and it's not exactly like Duke Nukem 3D or something, but I guess it can't be worse than Duke Nukem Forever.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:25.000
That almost sounds like a dare. That's kind of neat, though. Like, that's a weird way to kind of unearth this new game in a series that is extremely well known, you know.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:37.000
And he's like, you know, now he's saying, hey, you know what, I'm actually going to kind of start digging through here to see if there's any more of these games that are unreleased that have stuff in the Library of Congress. So, hopefully he finds some more stuff.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Yeah, I'll be curious to see what else is discovered.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Alright, well, something a lot of people will be discovering soon is the new Diablo 3 release. Now, Diablo 3 was already released, of course, on PC, and it was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 last year, I believe.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:03.000
But we have next week, or coming August 19th is the day, Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls, or the Complete Edition, if you will, or Ultimate Evil Edition, they're calling it.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:12.000
It's going to be on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and will also be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but a little bit cheaper since those platforms already had Diablo 3 releases on them.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:20.000
This is kind of neat, though, is that because the original Diablo 3 on console was out before the generation shift started happening,

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Diablo 3 is going to have a cross-manufacturer, cloud-saving feature, meaning you could actually take a saved game from Diablo 3 on the Xbox 360 and move it to the PlayStation 4.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:40.000
It's going to be all through saves in the cloud. It's that way it gets around the infrastructure of Microsoft and Sony.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:51.000
You can head over to Blizzard's blog if you want more information on how to do that. What they did is they patched the current Diablo 3 games with a patch where you can export saved data to the cloud with Blizzard,

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:57.000
and then you can download that data onto the new game when it's released on the 19th, so that's pretty cool.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:08.000
You can't use it for PC saves, which makes sense because the PC versions of the game, not only are they on a different patch, but they play completely differently.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
The keyboard and mouse controller makes a huge difference, so they're not going to allow those saves to be cross-platform.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I was a little hesitant on if I was going to get Diablo 3 Ultimate Evil Edition or not. I ended up getting it because I do really like Diablo 3, and I'm curious to see what they do with console.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:29.000
They promised, and Blizzard better fucking stick to this or I'm going to be so angry. I'll sue them like that guy did Sony.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:40.000
For real, they said that they're going to be better about the patching this time because the infrastructure of the systems will allow them to be a little more competitive with the PC patches.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I am really looking forward to the next PC patch that's going to be doing the greater rifts and some of the seasonal rolling of the characters and things like that.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I really, really want to see that. I hope that makes it to the consoles. That would be great.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Anybody else interested in Diablo 3 Ultimate Evil Edition?

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
I'm trying to get myself interested in Diablo 3 Any Edition.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
The game is in much better shape now than it was when it was first released.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000
I've just got tons of other crap to play.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.000
It's always sad to hear that it's in better shape now than it was at release.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:19.000
It has more content than it did at release. That's how it should be.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000
And it does. But here's the thing, Loki, it actually does have less content and that's a good thing because that would be the real money auction house.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:35.000
But it's just, you know, come on, folks. You're developing a game and you just release it and you're like, ah, fuck it, I'll fix it later. That's terrible.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000
SSG100mad in chat says, did Shane convince you to get it, though?

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Sort of. He's yelling from the other room. I helped. He said, what do you want, Rob? Do you want to buy it or not?

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
And I'll just pretty much support your answer and tell you that that's what you should do.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
And I said, I think I want to get it. And he's like, then you want to get it?

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I was like, you're right, I want to get it. There it was.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:08.000
So, I'll check that out. I'll be sure to stream that on Twitch or whatever as I'm sure a lot of people will be doing on their PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones when this game is released on the 19th.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Just don't play copyright music in the background or you'll get bleeped.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Moving on, DarkSakura.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Well, this is a fine kettle of fish that are playing Pokemon.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Yeah, we've had Twitch plays Pokemon. Now we have a fish plays Pokemon.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Where basically it's, um, a fish is being watched by a webcam that has button inputs over the top of it in a 3x3 grid.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:48.000
So when the fish, by the way, his name is Grayson Hopper, goes to a certain tile in the tank, the camera says, oh, he went up.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Oh, he did this. So basically there's a Twitch feed where you can watch a fish play Pokemon.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:04.000
This is the dumbest thing I've heard of all day and it was so stupid that I had to share it with everybody.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
With our dozens and dozens of listeners.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Fucking fish.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.000
What's going to happen when that fish is just floating at the top of the tank? Is the Pokemon trainer going to move up forever?

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
You go up and up and up and up and up.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Then you get the flute.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Then it'll be just like, uh, it'll be just like, uh, Twitch plays Pokemon.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Except they did beat it eventually. Do you think a fish will beat it eventually?

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000
The fish will die first.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I liked Loki's idea.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000
What was Loki's idea?

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.000
My idea was to have two fish playing a game and it would be a fighting game.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
So you have two fish fighting each other in a fighting game.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Maybe like, you know, Street Fighter or something.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Obviously you'd have to have an infinite round time, but it'd be kind of fun to see.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Would that be like, um, those beta fish that will like totally get?

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Sure. You could use those beta fish if you want. I mean, that's fine.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
It'd be more interesting if you have more fish in there too, I think.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Especially in a fast paced, you know, fighting game. It'd just basically be fish button mashing.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
So they'd be playing Tekken 3?

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000
They could play Tekken 3. That's the best part about it is you can adapt it into multiple fighting games.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.000
You have a whole tournament.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Don't give the internet any more ideas.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Kittens play Pokemon.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000
That would be funny.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Just have like, smear tuna all over a controller and then have the kittens bat at it.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Or lick it until something happens.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Now it's going to be insert thing here plays Pokemon. It's like this joke that won't die.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Make it stop.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Loki.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Alright.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
So speaking of stuff here, let's see.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Speaking of stuff?

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Yeah, speaking of stuff here.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Best transition ever.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Speaking of stuff.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Speaking of stuff stopping.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:11.000
They are reducing the amount of preorders on your, you know, the Destiny Ghost Editions.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:22.000
That's right. If you want the embodiment of Peter Dinklage, you're going to have to just play the regular game and not have like an actual physical thing.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.000
This is because it's extremely limited and the preorders have been crazy.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000
They are actually canceling preorders for the Ghost Edition.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
And honestly, I don't know why you'd spend that much money on a game in the first place, but.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Whatever. 150 bucks, I guess.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
And you got a bunch of cool shit with that.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
So you'll have to make do, I guess, with the limited edition.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
So are you saying for the Peter Dinklage version of the game they had to cut it short?

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
They had to reduce the amount.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000
I see.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.000
The volume that they had.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I see. I see. They only had a small amount available.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000
They only had a small amount available.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Gotcha.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Dark Sakura, you looking forward to Destiny?

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000
No, not really.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Were you off the week we talked about Destiny? I can't remember. Were you here?

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
I think I was here, but I didn't get the beta because somebody didn't give me a key.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Somebody didn't ask for a key.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Somebody didn't care to ask for a key, so that's really what the issue is.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
But Dark Sakura, it was like Phantasy Star Online with a gun.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Good.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
How long did I play Phantasy Star Online 2? Like a week?

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
It's because they won't release it here.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
You know why? Because Sega's bitches.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000
I played a patch.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Alright.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Moving on here to something that will be coming out in an arcade near you soon.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
It's a redemption machine.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I don't know how I feel about arcades, you guys. It's all redemption games these days.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000
It's going downhill.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000
It's just going up and down, up and down, up and down.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000
That's right. Just like this game.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
That's all you're going to do. You're going to go up and down and up and down forever.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
It is called Flappy Tickets.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
As if there weren't enough flappy bird clones in the world.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Which, by the way, have you checked out Flappy VoG? Available at VoGnetwork.com.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Here's the worst thing about that.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:21.000
And I gotta say, it's because they're using a giant HD monitor for that.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.000
First off, I have a big problem with putting a monitor vertical like that and not have a space shooter on it whatsoever.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.000
But the fact that they're using it for Flappy Bird is stupid.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
iPhone games are the new things for arcades.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
When I went to Milpitas Golf Land it was like Doodle Jump and Infinity Blade and...

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Oh my god, I've never played this game!

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Wait, yes I have. It's on my phone.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Right?

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
So now you can play Flappy Tickets.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
And guess what it is?

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
It's Flappy Bird.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
It's fuckery.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
That's right.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Now what my question is, is how do they make it so that you never hit the jackpot?

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I'm assuming it just starts scrolling faster and faster.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Easy, it's Flappy Bird.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Hey, I can get a pretty high score on Flappy Bird.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
But see, here's the trick.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Now Bobby did Flappy VoG and he made sure the game got harder as you play.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
So I'm assuming they did something similar to that in the Ticket Redemption game.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Because I never win the jackpot.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
There's two games in the arcade that I can win the jackpot on.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:29.000
One of them is the little slot machine game they have at Dave and Buster's where the light spins around in a circle and you have to hit 777.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Because the light moves slow enough that it can hit the 7 every time.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
That I can win the jackpot on.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
And the only other game I've ever won the jackpot on?

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Flame and Finger.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Sorry, the Namco game where you trace the maze with your finger to loud techno music.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
I got one on Smoke and Token once.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
What the fuck is Smoke and Token?

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
It's like a ski jump one.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Where you have to roll it down the little thing.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
It was when I worked at Aladdin's Castle.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.000
ActDeft in our chatroom over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says, Flappy Dead Horse.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Yeah, this does feel a few months late, doesn't it?

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Don't give them ideas.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:13.000
As much as I sit here and I bitch about arcades and how I miss the golden age, and I'm sure we all do,

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
I do sometimes have fun like when I go to Dave and Buster's.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
But you know why? Because alcohol is involved.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Mixed with those ticket redemption games. It makes everything fun.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
You know what's always fun is our mailbag.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Why? Because we get to talk to you.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
You send us emails to participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:40.000
And Dark Sakura in our mailbag segment jumps into mailbag, dives in, pulls out from the masses and masses of email

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
that is sent to us every, and I'm saying email in the singular tense this week.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Oh, one of it.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000
The email that she's going to read tonight.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.000
So Dark Sakura, wow, we had such incredible participation on Facebook and Google Plus,

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
and now our mailbag has one email in it.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I want to see four emails next week.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Or else what?

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Fuck if I know.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Four of them.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
We will sit here and play, you know what, if, okay.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I'll make you all listen to me sing.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Nope, I got it. I got it.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
This is it, and this is going to work. You ready, Dark Sakura?

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
If it involves Politary, fuck no.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.000
No. If we don't get, it's worse, if we don't get four emails in the mailbag,

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:21.000
they've got to be quality letters, too.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Just not really long.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Yeah, don't make them too long, but they've got to be good enough to get Dark Sakura Stars of Approval.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000
If we don't get four emails-

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
If we don't get four emails in the bag for next week,

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.000
I'm going to play for the Break Music next week, music from Kim Kardashian Hollywood.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000
The fuck you are.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000
So I'm just saying, you're going to get Kim Kardashian Hollywood for your music.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
I will plug the iPhone into the mixing board.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
You're going to get Kim Kardashian Hollywood music during the break next week.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Shane is running in here going, it has good music.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
I would rather you torture them with Politary.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Well, if I don't get emails, you're all going to find out if it's good or not next week on the show.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Just get ready.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.000
All right. That's my threat to the listeners this week.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000
The people on the podcast are like, I don't care. I don't listen live. I don't have to hear that.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
I'll think of something for you, too.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Dark Sakura will sing the Politary Hollywood.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000
In the worst possible attempt at singing, which is normal.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Read the email, Dark Sakura.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Hey, Orange Lounge. Thanks for the entertaining midnight release answers.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
I waited in line at a GameStop for a full hour for Modern Warfare 3.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.000
When I got to the counter, they didn't have my copy and I had to go back at 8 a.m. to pick it up.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000
I watched all my friends play all night in my living room while I ate pizza and drank too much beer. Ugh!

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Let's pretend it's summertime Christmas! Exclamation point times three.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
And there are three presents under the tree for you.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
What are you praying is in those three presents?

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.000
My sanity, humanity, and a fuck to give. No.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.000
No.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
I got that summertime, summertime Christmas.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I'm going to want all Jewish presents, so pencils.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
You want summertime Hanukkah. You want gelt?

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Yarmulke and peace in the Middle East.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
All right. Loki, what do you want?

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
No, that's not actually right. Go ahead and answer, though. I have to think of something.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Answer what I want for summertime Christmas.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
What do you want for your summertime Christmas?

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Three presents. Three presents.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and a UD Pro license.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:38.000
I want world peace. I want, no, what would I want? Totally superficial things I would want.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Superficial. Go for it.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:50.000
I want a license to Adobe Creative Cloud so that I can play with Captivate at home.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Rob, get an EDU email address. Trust me.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
I used to have one years and years ago.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I'm paying 20 bucks a month for my Creative Cloud.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Nice. That's, yeah, because I want access to Adobe Captivate.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
It's 40 bucks a month if you're not a student.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I want, something I don't want to say on there.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
It's not dirty. It's just something else going on.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Beated. What?

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
He wants a huge beaded popsicle.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I want dinner at Ruth's Steakhouse or somewhere comparable.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000
I will take Espritu's Brazilian Steakhouse as well. That's what I want.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Take you to Rudy's Hideaway for actual good seafood.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Anyway, and I want an Xbox One.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Mortons. We'll take you to Mortons.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I'll go there. It'll work.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Alright, Darsakra. What do you want for your summertime Hanukkah?

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
What I want is a house.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
I would like a PS4.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.000
And I would like for all of those poor, poor kittens out there to have happy homes.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
That's not superficial though.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
I want a shopping spree at Sephora.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I want a shopping spree just like they had on Supermarket Sweep.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
I want Supermarket Sweep, but I want it to be at Target.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Oh my god, that's all I really want. For my one gift, I want Supermarket Sweep to come back on television.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I want to be on it at Target in the video game section.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
You just want it at Fry's.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:31.000
To be honest, I already have the one thing I really want for myself.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:35.000
You know what it is. My good news.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Oh yeah, Midna.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Oh, my Midna baby is awesome.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Dan. I have my Dan.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Alright, anyway.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
What else do I need? I have Dan and a Midna and I have Perler Beads.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000
That's right, Perler Beads.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Alright, there you go. That's the email. So participate at Orange Lunch.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000
No it's not. There's more.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Oh, sorry.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Rob.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Then finish the email.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.000
By the way, you guys are the most informative, news-based video game podcast I've ever found.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
And I absolutely love you guys for it. See what you interrupted?

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Clearly you're not looking very hard. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Much love, EA Skizie from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000
PS Jamie's the best, grin.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Oh, that's why I couldn't interrupt the damn email.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Hell yeah. Thank you, EA Skizie. You can come sleep on my couch if you want to.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Alright.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:30.000
There you go. Now remember, four emails next week or Kim Kardashian Hollywood.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Which, by the way, the chatters.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:38.000
The chatters are saying, uh, nobody email. No emails next week. I'm actually more curious than horrified.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
And Act Def says, we'll see if Skye lives up to the hype.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Oh really now?

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000
You dare to challenge me?

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
This bitch will do it and I will be in the bathroom during the entire break.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.000
You dare challenge me?

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:53.000
I don't even care.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Fine. Have it your way.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Moving on. On that note.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.000
An Anakin is not better than Midna because Midna will bite the fuck out of your cat.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Just saying.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Moving on. This is an appropriate time to get into the FUs of the week.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Why do we have the FUs of the week?

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Um, because the chat room dares to challenge me on certain things and so we say FU.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:42.000
I have a big FU that I want to say but it is highly politically charged so I will say this way.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Research world events before you go around saying one side does this and one side does that because you're not there.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
You don't fucking know the story.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:10.000
The other thing too is, um, FU to my own general antsiness and to people who don't say anything at Whole Foods but they will block the aisle and just stand there looking at things blankly forgetting that there are other people in the universe.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
That happens in more places than just Whole Foods.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000
But it really happens a lot at Whole Foods.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:22.000
It's like all of the people with the I'm the only person in the world mentality seem to congregate at Whole Foods and you know what's actually really funny Rob?

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Try engaging one of them in conversation and then you will see this, is someone talking to me? I don't know what to do.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:37.000
And then they'll be super nice and awesome and have a great day but that's just what happens when you stop and fucking say words to other people.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
It's a California thing. No one fucking talks to each other.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.000
It's like, what are you doing in my world? Ah, this is my world. Bitch, I will talk to you and you will like it.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Just saying.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Alright, Loki, you're up. Who's the week?

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Umm, note to self, need to make a new song for F because this one's getting old.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:06.000
And then umm, I think it's a little unreasonable that it took them five minutes at the window to pour me a soda at McDonald's today.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Five minutes.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Because originally he gave me my soda with ice in it. Yes, I know, first world problems.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:22.000
That's not the point. It takes literally 30 seconds to, not even 30 seconds, like 10 seconds to dump ice out, fill soda back up again.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Yeah, five minutes of him wandering around and he comes back, do you have your receipt? I'm like, oh, that's where you get the soda. Sorry, sorry.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.000
I'm like, what the fuck are you doing in there?

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.000
You should have threatened to go Super Siam.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:40.000
I'm like, seriously, I'm like sitting here and there's like cars backed up all through the drive-thru and it's just like, you are fucking dumb.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:54.000
If you cannot get this job, then you do not stand to fare very well in the workplace out there, I mean, because it's just, it's a lot harder than pour soda, pour drive-thru window, I mean, come on.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Alright, my F.U. of the week, I can't get into details because I just pretty much have a policy that I don't really talk about my daytime stuff here on OLR, but there was a lot of drama this week and I'm just going to say F.U. to all of that in general. Thank you very much.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
I will double that too, Rob.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Thank you, I appreciate it.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Alright, let's move on into just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to your phone calls at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, but you got two more stories to get through before we get there. Loki.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Alright, so Sony is killing off PlayStation Mobile on Android. They are removing support after Android 4.4.2 and I guess access and re-downloads on 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 will be up to the publishers.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:18:02.000
They're saying that, I guess, I don't know, it's really just their Android devices. They had some really weird Android devices, I remember, and I guess the Xperia Play would fall into that as well.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Now, let's not forget that this doesn't mean PlayStation Mobile is going away because PlayStation Mobile is still pretty prevalent on the Vita and, of course, the PlayStation TV or Vita TV.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:26.000
So, yeah, they'll still be available to that. I'm actually looking forward to, hopefully, being able to publish on that someday because you can do that for free. So, that's awesome.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.000
So, yeah, check those out. That's it.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Do you think, is this a surprise at the end of the day that this got canned?

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:50.000
No, I don't think it's a surprise because, I mean, after all, it was only available to certain devices and who really needs another fucking storefront out there in the Android marketplace? It's already fragmented enough.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:57.000
I think anyone that's really going to publish on PlayStation Mobile probably could just publish to Android pretty easily.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Fair enough. All right, I got one more story for you guys here and that has to do with some hilarity that happened on the mobile marketplaces this week.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Have you checked out this awesome new game that's on the iPhone marketplace called Dargan Quest?

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:20.000
That's right, Dargan Quest 4 from Square Enix hit the iTunes Store this week.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:32.000
As you might be aware, the legendary series Dragon Quest was being released on the iPhone, iPad, and all this stuff. I believe it's coming out on Android as well.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:44.000
It's available on the iTunes Store, but when it first came out in the New Zealand App Store, it was called Dargan Quest, who's misspelled, which led to Twitter hashtag hilarity.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:54.000
So, there it is. And everybody was getting into a hashtag called Dargan Quest My Game, where they would purposely misspell things.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:03.000
And that led to things like Bored Lands, Mince Craft, and my favorite, Murdered Soup Suspect.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.000
So, there you go. Love it. Dargan Quest there. Obviously, that was fixed.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:21.000
What was not a typo, the price that they were asking for the game, $18.99. I don't know if that was New Zealand dollars or something, but Square Enix games tend to be a premium price.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Square Enix Premium.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Yeah, I don't know. As much as I would like to play this game, I have not really been swayed by a lot of the Final Fantasy releases on iOS.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
3 and 4 were okay, I guess, but they really were just the DS.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.000
It's just the lack of buttons that does it for me.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Yeah. I would rather see it on the Vita or the 3DS. I would much rather see it there, where I can actually have buttons.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:55.000
You know what's still awesome? It was a PSP game, but it's still awesome on the Vita, too, is the Final Fantasy IV, the After Years collection.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Sorry, the After Years wasn't exactly a great game, but the remake of Final Fantasy IV, the sprite-based remake that was with it, was great.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
And, you know, playing the After Years is okay, because at least it's still pretty much the same game.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Yeah, that'd be awesome if they did that for 6.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
I would love to see that, but I'm just not going to hold my breath.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Alright, that is it for the news that we had tonight, so it's time to open up the Skype line and let you guys have a say.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:25.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call, and talk about whatever is on your mind tonight.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:30.000
We have a little bit of time, so hopefully we get some calls, or it's going to be a short show tonight.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:36.000
We'll see. I'm going to check in with Loki while I bring up the tweets to see if we have any Twitter topics at twitter.com.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute topics tonight.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Yes, there was supposed to be a brand new Elgato game capture card, and it's been leaked out already what it is now.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Game Capture HD 60, it's going to record Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Wii U gameplay, built-in live streaming to Twitch, YouTube, and more with webcam and overlays, and 1080p and 60 frames per second capturing for $179.99.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
It probably is exclusive to Best Buy.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Still sounds pretty nice. Hey, we have a call coming in already, let's get to it. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Hey guys, it's Jason.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Hey Jason, buddy, how you doing?

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000
I'm busy, needless to say.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Yeah, I miss having your face in studio, but I understand you've got your own life to live, so glad to hear things are going well.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.000
I have my own life to live in the greater western states of the United States.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Hey, you know what, travel while you're still young, right?

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Well, never stop traveling, fuck your age, but you know.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
That's true, that's very true. So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:43.000
I'm really, really disappointed with how the Twitch discussion turned. Your point, Rob, up front, was the correct point.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
It was heavy-handed, and they rolled it out wrong, period.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:55.000
That's like, if the conversation had just stopped there, or kind of made better alternatives, I mean, you said that.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:03.000
You went on to say, well, if they had said that this was going to be a change, that it may not have been as visceral a reaction as they got.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:13.000
But, if there's one thing I cannot stand, and I very much developed this over the last year, I cannot stand trivialization of decisions.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:21.000
The way that Twitch was personified was, fuck the users, we're making millions, we don't care if you're inconvenienced.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Nobody has that attitude. No business owner will ever have that attitude. Ever.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Are you sure you want to put that out there?

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Have you heard of this company? It's called Comcast?

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I'm just saying, Jason, I respect that viewpoint, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not sure you really want to say that.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:48.000
That's not the way Twitch went about this decision. That's the point that matters.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:54.000
And even Comcast, yes, they fucked over their support decision. It sucks.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I've never had a problem on the phone with them anymore, but fuck Comcast, that's not what this discussion is about.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Twitch did not choose to dole this out so poorly. They made a mistake in their implementation, but this is business.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:15.000
We made the point about the fact that this is going to happen to any other company, and you want to know what's even worse?

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Music copyright enforcement is worse in Germany. Do you guys know that Hitbox is based out of Austria?

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:39.000
If they get remotely popular, at least the people in country are going to be dicked over even worse, super fast, because GEMA, the German musical association, whatever German word it actually corresponds to, European enforcement is a hell of a lot worse than it is in America.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.000
So far, Jason, I really don't disagree with you. Yes, I made a Hitbox account. Like I said, I like the competition.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Which I did at the same time as soon as you said that you did.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:57.000
But the very next day after all this, Jason, I did a two-hour stream on Twitch over the weekend. So it's not like I'm planning on abandoning Twitch. But I also don't play copyrighted music in the back of my streams.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:04.000
However, I'd like to be able to stream Grand Theft Auto 5. What the hell game are they on?

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:11.000
I'd like to be able to stream Grand Theft Auto 5 when it comes out for the Playstation 4 and not have to worry about the soundtrack and things like that.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:22.000
But I also kind of take the good with the bad. They're not going to do anything to live. And that is a point that we didn't say that I really should make sure is out there.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:28.000
They're not changing anything with live. They can't run this software on live and do that type of stuff.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:36.000
And I don't have this delusion that people are going into my feed and saying, oh, I'm going to watch two hours of Rob Roberts playing this game.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:47.000
There might be like, I could probably count on one hand the people that might actually do that. But I can do more YouTube things or something that balances out the Grand Theft Auto 5 I play.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:56.000
So I'm not totally heartbroken about this. But you're right. It's the way that they did it. And I, in general, you know I hate this about YouTube.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:06.000
I really hate the whole thing where it's, I have no power against these people that I would argue don't really hold the copyright either. Copyright trolls.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:14.000
To be fair, nobody besides Twitch potentially knows what the actual appeal button is, how that's going to work.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:23.000
And that's not cool either. But I'm willing to cut them a little slack because at least in the AMA they said we made a mistake.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Okay, this shit's going to take a little time to iron out. Nothing's going to change overnight, even when the YouTube buyout happened.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
You know, we all knew the changes were going to happen tonight, but they were going to come slowly.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Not so slowly in this case.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Yeah, I guess that's true. It may not have happened overnight, but when it happened, it happened big, didn't it?

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Yes, yes it did. And all of these points, all of these points are valid and correct and I love the fact that you made them.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:58.000
There was a streamer, speedrunner that I follow, a friend of mine from New Mexico growing up that really, really irked me at the same time.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Because, hey guys, let's move to Hitbox. And I ask him why. He says, oh, because Twitch fucked around my stream and my viewership went from 60 to 8 numerous times over the course of the stream.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Because that couldn't be the flagrant abuse and bullshit that people were causing on a single network because they were pissed off about these sweeping changes.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Like, legitimately or not, I don't fucking care. There was a lot of bad stuff that was going down that day.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:29.000
And what a surprise, a massive influx of bullshit is going to hamper a network. I'm shocked. No, I'm not.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.000
The fucking first day, MMO, SimCity, Diablo, everything.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Like, scale is the hardest thing to do for people and for everything. For people, technology and for anything else.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:52.000
And I'm, I just, I don't want to, I don't want to dissuade people from their choice and if something is wrong, you should absolutely use something else.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:28:04.000
But just the slightest bit of consideration of the fact that one day later, things will probably be okay, but the day of when the news and the blogosphere and the Twittersphere and everything else is going apeshit over something.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Yeah, shit sucks. It goes sideways.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:13.000
To be fair, and you clearly are very passionate on this topic, but I love that. You know, as an independent broadcaster, I'm passionate about this stuff too.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.000
But to be fair, isn't this kind of internet culture? Don't we do this all the time? Isn't there somebody we're mad at every day?

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Of course it is. And I was thinking, when I was thinking about this topic, when I was thinking about the fact that I was going to call in, my brain jumped back to the last time that I did exactly this.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:34.000
SimCity. That everybody was dogging on the fact that SimCity was fucked up because it was such a server-side geared game.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:51.000
And I came out in defense saying, this happens every MMO, this happens every online game, and yeah, you can capacity plan, but until you have hundreds of thousands of users at the same time, something inevitably fails. Period. That is technology.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:57.000
That's true, but not to dredge an old topic, but I think the real question was, should SimCity have gone online only in the first place?

02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Definitely a whole different topic.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:10.000
And maybe the answer is no, considering where we are. But yeah, anyway, I just call it the fact that I know somebody that works there now, and he's a really, really good friend of mine.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Call it the fact that I've now been in the middle of this professionally because I work for a startup, and because I've always been interested in this culture.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Gaming, technology, anything modern is basically the way that I would describe it. Modern technology in gaming and media. I've always been super interested in it.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:47.000
And until the last two, three years, I've always been on the outside in. I feel, I consider myself, I have my visceral reactions about things. I say stupid shit. I've gotten called out for it. I'm going to continue to make these mistakes.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:30:07.000
But especially for something like this, where I feel I have a lot more hands-on knowledge than most other people. It is rude. I consider it rude to personify anyone with the quickest decision to fuck over their users when they entered into this business.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Twitch was started for a reason. That hasn't changed yet. They went all in on that by the closure of Justin TV. And it's just a really big deal to me, possibly also because I'm involved in these sort of processes now.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:32.000
And I know what goes into any sort of a technical decision. The reason why this was such a joke is because copyright enforcement is not built for gaming and exceptions like Rock Band and Rocksmith, etc.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:43.000
It says this person has a legal claim to it, so we have to throw the blanket law enforcement on top of it and oh shit, there's an edge case. A very big one in the world of gaming.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
And so here we are with no easy answer.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Right. Yeah, we really don't. And I truly do hope that one, the drama is going to subside. It already did as far as I can tell, as far as I care. But two, I can only hope that they continue to make these worthwhile, call them backtracks, but enhancements to make sure that their resolution to any of these complaints and more is handled responsibly.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Jason, I love the call. I love the passion. I gotta get some more calls, however.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Would you like me to end it on a positive note? Please.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Why did Susan bring two pairs of pants to her golf game? Why? In case she got a hole in one.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Thank you, popsicles that I ate just about ten minutes ago. I'm hanging up on you.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Works for me. Have a good night.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Bye. Well, very well stated case. Very, very good. Let's move on. Our phone is ringing and we got more calls coming in, so let's get to it. Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Hello. This is 13X Forever.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Hello, 13X Forever. I have seen your name on like the Twitters, and I see your face. Hello. I have seen your name on the Twitters and so forth. I don't think I've heard you on this show, but maybe like one other time. Welcome back. What's up, buddy?

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
No, no. I never called in.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Oh, well, first time caller then.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Yes. I live on the other side of the planet, so it's kind of hard to call in when you're on the face.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Wait, where are you from?

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
I'm from Russia.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Oh, my gosh. From Russia. Wow. So, I don't think we've had a Russian caller before that I can think of. I know we've had, you know, Switzerland and we've had Europe and I think Scotland we had a guy.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Not Russia.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Switzerland is in Europe and so is part of Russia.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Sorry, I meant Britain. But anyway, all that American ignorance aside, what's up, my friend?

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:44.000
So, I want to talk about great injustice that you did last week.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Uh-oh, what'd I do?

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:53.000
I want to talk about a great game that just recently came on Steam. That is Trails in the Sky.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Uh-oh. Your audio is cutting out. I don't know if you can hear me, but your audio just cut out. Just check your connection there.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Hello?

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Yep. Can hear you. What is the game?

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Oh, you're cutting out again, my friend. I don't know if that's...

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.000
I think it was Trails from the Sky or something.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Trails in the Sky was the game?

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:17.000
That sounds like it to me.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Yeah, but the audio is cutting out. I can hear myself though. Try again.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Yeah.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Oh, it's like he says something and then it just like cuts out right away.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:33.000
No, I want to hear what our Russian friend has to say. He's even making a face like, God damn it.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Yeah, Jason is suggesting shut off the video for a minute. Go ahead and shut off your video and that'll help your bandwidth.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Can I shut it off on my end?

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Hello?

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Yeah, you're cutting in and out and we probably have to have the video cut in order for you to have the bandwidth. That's probably what is happening.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Okay, the video just shut off. So try again, my friend.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Is this better?

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Yes, we can hear you now. Okay, so what was the great injustice we did?

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Hello?

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Yep, we, uh oh. Oh my gosh, it cut out again. I am so sorry, my friend. I hate to do this. I've got to cut it out.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Send us an email.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Please send us an email. Please. I'm so disappointed. Stupid internet.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Email us and I'll read it. I promise.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Akuma JP in chat says, thanks Obama NSA. Seriously. Alright.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:36.000
All right. It says this guy's calling in from a Russian sub. I don't think it was a sub cause I could see, I could see his background.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.000
He had like a giant copy of bravely default sitting back there. So that's a sub.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.000
You're right. They don't let those on subs.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:50.000
That's right. I'm sad or I'm so sorry, my friend. I was excited to have an international call and then it cut out.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.000
But I want to know what I did, what the injustice was that we did. We didn't find out what that was.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And I first thought when Jason called in, he was mad at us too. Cause I thought that whole point of that call was you said this, but.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:08.000
All right. Who else is mad at us tonight? Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.000
I have no reason to be mad at you whatsoever, Mr. Rob Roberts.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Hey Rama. How are you doing?

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I'm pretty good. How about you?

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:22.000
I'm, I'm sad because I wanted to talk to our Russian guy, but internet is internet. So, Oh well.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:24.000
So what's up buddy?

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Yeah. I have to, you know, this whole pulling down, take down notices and so forth coming from a person that goes to conventions.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.000
I deal with this shit every single time I go to YouTube.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Interesting. How, how, how, how is it similar in that context?

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Okay. Let's say team team OLR goes up one stage and we do this awesome skit to ABBA. Okay.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Yep. I go and upload it a couple of days later, I'll get an email saying that either the copyright people who hold music from ABBA don't like it.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:14.000
They want it pulled, or it can be blocked in certain countries or it gets muted altogether.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:18.000
I have seen that type of thing happen now that you're mentioning that. Yeah, totally, totally.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Like, uh, yeah, those, like the performances that are camcordered and that automated stupid software picks up a match, right?

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Yes.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.000
And how dare somebody try to rob me of my ABBA?

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Exactly. I mean, I just got an email from YouTube last night of a complete masquerade that I recorded got muted.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:45.000
So I pretty much had to go in and explain, I'm using this under fair use. I'm just putting it out there for everybody to watch.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:54.000
And I have allowed, um, I'm looking at my list here. I have anywhere between 30 to 50 videos I have to manually go in and argue fair use under.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:03.000
And I usually will win them because number one, I don't have to monetize because you really can't make any money off of somebody making a fool of themselves on stage.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Right, right. Exactly. Yeah. It's like you're not making money off it. So.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:12.000
So what, what can Twitch do in this situation?

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Um, well, this is something that that's done at conventions. If you notice how we go to various con video rooms, you'll see they're showing different series and so forth before they're able to show the series.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:38.000
They have to get permission, whether it's this Warner brothers, whoever, whoever holds license. And if they give you the permission to do it, you can.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:48.000
That's what Twitch needs to do. This might go into a monetary licensing thing. Like the reason why, you know, we gave y'all gave middle finger to lie at 365.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Right. But this is what it might come down to. If Twitch, if they want to keep the Twitch users happy, they can do this trees, whatever means they might have to go out and drop money on a blanket license in order to do it.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:12.000
And depending on the cost, they might have to send that out there. I don't stream on Twitch. I don't know. So if it's free to do certain amount, but then you have to pay for a certain tier.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:23.000
If you, if those price quotes jump because licensing, they'll have to straight out say, look, we had to get this blanket. They had to get this license. You have to pay more for it.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:34.000
So you could do whatever you want on Twitch done and done. It's either you could do your less plays in this with, with your favorite music or without your favorite music.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:46.000
And if you want your music that badly, contact the licensee holders and see they'll give you a license to do it. But between you and me, most people on Twitch, YouTube don't even have that type of money.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:59.000
There's a pretty well known list out there that somebody is keeping. And it's like, I don't know if it's like a Wiki or whatever it is, but it's like a list of these are the game companies that will allow you to monetize things on YouTube.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:09.000
I kind of feel like I'm getting from what you're saying that Twitch needs to be responsible for having their own list that is built into the system of what you can and can't broadcast. Is that what I'm kind of hearing?

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Yes. And, but, but you, sorry, just saying what's interesting about it is that what's interesting about that whole thing Rama is that Twitch is built into the PlayStation four.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:32.000
And that's a huge selling point of the PlayStation four is the ability to instantly share your gameplay. So I kind of feel like if you release a game on the PlayStation four, you know that your game's going to be able to be streamed on the internet.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:39.000
And I've heard of that, you know, they can actually block, like, I don't know what it is, like the ending or certain scenes or things like that. You can block that.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:48.000
But I have not heard yet of a game released on PlayStation four that just flat out would not stream on Twitch with the exception of play room. But that was a completely different circumstance.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Because honestly, you, okay, in the, in the Sony kingdom, do you really think Sony music is going to pop shit with Sony computing entertainment? Think about which division brings home the most bacon.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Right now? It's not the television branch, that's for sure.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Right now it's like Sony computing is pretty much bringing in more, probably bringing in more money than Sony music, probably. I may be wrong, but I'm just saying, you know.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:23.000
I don't know, Sony Pictures probably does alright too.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Yeah, of course. And same thing happens with AMVs. A lot of times when it comes to AMVs, you're either going to catch a copyright strike from either the licensee of the anime or the licensee of the music.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying, and I didn't realize this, NBA 2K14 won't stream the audio. It also won't save the audio on Xbox One record that.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:56.000
So it won't save the licensed soundtrack audio or it mutes all gameplay audio because that's very interesting. It's almost like a little bit like we knew this was coming.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:04.000
And so EA did that or EA maybe saw ahead of the curve or something or maybe it was part of license agreement. I don't know. But, uh, interesting.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:13.000
I'm going to say it's the whole thing because with these new sports games, it's like they have like these feature tracks by these artists and it's like, yeah.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:22.000
If you stream this, these artists are not going to get their money and they're going to pitch off it. Sorry, something got caught in my throat. But you see the point I'm trying to get at.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:39.000
And Bobby says it's all audio. See, I would think that it would just mute the lights. Like it would be better if they could build it into the game where at least you could still have, you know, the sneakers squeaking on the court and that type of sound effect, but just not have the license audio when you're streaming online. You think the game could be smart enough to do that, but I don't know.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:55.000
No, it's probably like the same audio output is going through. And besides, I don't know about you, I probably have more fun watching people on Twitch streaming NBA 2K14, hearing the conversations between each other, like the insults and the shit talking because that shit's funny.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Yeah. So weird. All right. Well, Rama, thank you for the interesting comparison with the conventions and a thing to think about. It just goes to show that, you know, we need to re-examine some of the copyright law in this country with a lot of this new technology we have.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.000
All right. Rama, take care, my friend. Anime Jam session Tuesday nights here at VOG.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Damn right.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:17.000
All right. Take care, buddy.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.000
You too.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000
All right. Bye.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:30.000
That is it, you guys. I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line. Thank you guys for calling in. I'm sorry to those who didn't get through, and I'm really sorry to our friend 13 Forever who had the internet connection problem there.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:40.000
But again, please email us. Participate at orangelaundry.com. You can always tweet us as well. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We look forward to hearing from you guys in one way or another in a future week.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Other last minute stories, Loki, real quick before we close up shop tonight.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Yeah, actually I got a few things. So Microsoft apparently is going to be offering indie developers on Xbox One free Unity Pro licenses.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:07.000
It's going to be specific, though. Xbox One only Unity Pro licenses will be offered to qualified developers, and they're basically on the lookout for promising titles.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:21.000
All right. This is kind of cool. Apparently, the original Pikmin on GameCube could be played on Windows.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:34.000
There's a file actually on the disk if you dump the ISO and add a DLL to it and do a couple of folder renamings and add some stuff to a shortcut.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:39.000
You can actually play the game in debug mode through Windows natively, which is kind of cool.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:47.000
And then, let's see here. Apparently, Resident Evil is going to become a TV show.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Oh boy.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Yes. Along the lines of, they're saying, Gotham. They're saying it's going to be called Arklay.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Hmm.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
And I have zero interest in that.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.000
And then, I'm predicting the future right here, okay?

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:17.000
There is a guy who goes by Chromemods that does, like, Grand Theft Auto mods right now, and he's got some really powerful one for Grand Theft Auto Online.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:22.000
And he's added the ability to do different animations that they have built into the game.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:32.000
And they have a scene in the game where you're taking a picture of this starlet or whatever that's getting fucked, basically.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
So, how did they spin this?

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Now, there's a mod that allows you to rape other people on Grand Theft Auto Online.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Hmm.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Because it allows you to do the fucking motion, and you lock down a player on the ground.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:55.000
I mean, granted, it's just trolling and silly, but how long is it going to take a news outlet to do that forehead line?

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Yep. That is a Tumblr tag waiting to happen.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:02.000
That is definitely, you might want to rethink those mods.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Quick, sorry, was there other last minute stories?

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.000
That's it.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Alright, I want to do some quick Twitter questions, topics here before we close out shop tonight.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Some tweets from last week's show.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Flaco Jones tweeting us about the Lay's Talk, the chip talk at the beginning of the show. Remember that?

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Flaco says, yay for Lay's Talk. My take. Wasabi, amazing. Bacon Mac, okay, but way better cheese and bacon chips out there.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Mango and cappuccino, both gross.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:31.000
I feel pretty much the exact opposite of Flaco. I thought mango and cappuccino were the two best.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Nasty.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Mango was kind of an acquired taste.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:46.000
My rank, just saying, the bacon mac, cappuccino, the mango, which I actually did not hate the mango, and then I will not try the wasabi just because I hate fake wasabi.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:54.000
My final ranking would be cappuccino was the best because they tasted like Taco Bell Cinnamon Twist to me.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Cappuccino was way the best. Way, way, way up there. Mango would be next.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:03.000
Followed by probably wasabi, actually, because I don't have the hatred for wasabi that my co-hosts do.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:10.000
And then last place, bacon mac. Just unoriginal and it'll win anyway and it's going to piss me off.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Blinrich on Twitter tweeted us saying, just saw your featured game from last week's show on Inside Edition.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Reminds me of the old 900 number controversy. Was that Mylon's Secret Castle? I was trying to figure out how that related to the 900 number controversy.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:31.000
I don't remember. Was there something with that or it could have been about ZZT from two weeks ago.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Maybe.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Maybe because I'm not sure sometimes when they say last week that could actually be the week before that they were listening to.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
I don't remember there being a 900 number controversy for anything.

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Brad from Pod Culture, by the way, says, that is our geek cuisine on this week's Pod Culture.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Pod Culture's got a huge week ahead. By the way, Brad was sharing some stuff.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
If you haven't heard Pod Culture, you should check it out Monday nights at the Voice Geek Network.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
6 Pacific, 9 Eastern. They have a huge show.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:02.000
He just went to this local convention out there and got all these bumpers from people.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
I don't even think I can say who, but it's really, really, really big.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
He sent me one of the bumpers and I was like, you suck.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
But in a loving way.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Lastly, Pika Uno sent us a tweet that says, the golden rules for credit cards.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.000
Always pay off in full each month. Remember we talked about the GameStop card last week.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Always pay off in full each month. Get paid to use credit cards with reward cards.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:29.000
And budget with YNAB, which I believe means you need a budget.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
I think that was a game that was on Steam during the game.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
An app that was on Steam during the sale.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.000
I know a lot of people were picking that up because it's very popular budgeting software.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:40.000
I don't think it's on Steam.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:42.000
It is. It's an app. Because Steam has apps.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Oh, yeah.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.000
They have some music software. I think you need a budget.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:48.000
I have an app. It's called a ledger book.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Okay.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.000
In our online banking.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:54.000
I'm sure there's a lot of similar iOS apps.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:59.000
What is it about YNAB that makes it so popular?

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:01.000
It's supposed to be pretty foolproof.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Yeah. I've heard a lot of people really like big fans of that.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.000
As opposed to like, I don't hear anybody sticking up for Quicken in that same way.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:09.000
You know what I mean?

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:11.000
Quicken is...

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:13.000
But that's my point. Or Microsoft money or any of that.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:15.000
I don't hear anybody like going, oh, man, you got to pick that up.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:17.000
It's only YNAB.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Mostly because those charge. They're more expensive.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Yeah.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:23.000
And they're more like business accounting.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:25.000
You don't need something like that for your home finance.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:29.000
All right. Well, that was it for the Twitters. That's it for the phone calls.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:32.000
I believe that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
So I'm going to say, as I always do at the end of every show,

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.000
thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to the show.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:39.000
Thank you for supporting independent radio.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.000
We don't get paid to do this show. We just do it because it's a way for us to hang out.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:48.000
And it's a way for us to spend time with you guys and have a lot of fun doing something we really enjoy.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:50.000
If you've enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
or even if you hated it but you think you might know somebody else who might like it,

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.000
be sure to tell a friend or two or 15 about the show because that's all we got is word of mouth.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:02.000
We don't have a $1 website or game company or Kickstarter backing us.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.000
So we need your help to spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Thank you guys so much. If you didn't like this show, try another independent podcast.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.000
Support independent broadcasting and all the people that are very hardworking out there.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
And if you are an independent podcaster, I tip my hat to you.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Thanks for taking the time to listen to us.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Unless you go around hating on other podcasts.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Yeah. If you should talk other podcasts, then seriously, you need to get out of the pool.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Stop podcasting because that's not what it's about.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Keep it clean.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Thank you. I love that. Love that. So important.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
And especially, oh God, you know what pisses me off more than anything?

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:44.000
More than anything is when you try to go around writing negative reviews on other podcasts to bolster your own.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Do you know how awful that makes you look?

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:52.000
It makes you look so awful. And if you think you're fooling anyone, it's so easy to look at your profile

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.000
and see which podcast you gave five stars to and how all the rest you gave one star to.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:00.000
I'll let you know that'll never happen for me because I'm too damn lazy to do any of that.

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Right? Just saying.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
And because I don't listen to any of your podcasts. No, that's not true, right?

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:09.000
Cooking with Unity. I love that show. Seriously, watch that show. It's awesome.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:11.000
I listen to history podcasts.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:16.000
I do listen to some other gaming podcasts. I don't listen to as much as I would like.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Mr. Poops.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Yeah. I try to listen to everybody as well.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:22.000
I was on his podcast once, sort of.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:26.000
I remember. I remember. All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up the show tonight.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:28.000
Loki, I'll start with you. Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:33.000
Yeah. Since Act Def just put a comment on there, it says, unless it's the ball pit.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:40.000
You know what, Ranma? I think that they need to have a new show that talks about cons called Live from the Ball Pit or something.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:42.000
That would be hilarious.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:44.000
And the host could actually sit in a ball pit.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Yeah, sure.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Although, here's my concern. The ball pit joke is going to get played out real fast.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Like, I'm already seeing the cosplays about it and I'm like, okay, we're approaching Fonzies getting on the water skis about to head towards the shark.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:03.000
And I know some of you are like, the ball pit joke will never get old. I don't know about that. Some memes get old.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
When was the last time you saw a dramatic prairie dog? Just saying.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Actually today. Someone on Tumblr busted that out.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Of course it was Tumblr. Of course.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:14.000
It was great.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:16.000
All right. Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:23.000
I still feel kind of sick to my stomach. Damn that delicious macaroon cock.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:36.000
And my final thought tonight is, um, I, I'm just, everything's been really weird this week, but I'm happy that OLR is here.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:38.000
You need some pinkberry.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:47.000
I do need some pinkberry. Again. Because I already had some this week. Because on my, on my bad day, Alan was like, we need to go get pinkberry. I'm like, yes we do.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.000
But I'll take more.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.000
I want to try the vanilla latte.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:59.000
It's not that good. All right. Thank you guys everybody. You guys are the best. Thanks for tuning in. We'll be back here next week to do it all over again.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Thanks for being an awesome audience and participating with our show and sticking with us to the very, very, very end. You're the reason we'll be here again next week. Good night.
