0	17400	This week, a new service starting up means another one is shutting down, but one single
17400	20200	game ending means that many more are becoming available.
20200	23240	It's a new month, and a new story about EA's decisions makes it to the top.
23240	26280	We'll explain all the changes that are in store on the show, where every gamer has a
26280	27280	voice.
27280	34680	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34680	36440	where every gamer has a voice.
36440	45120	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this August 3rd, 2014, with the 562nd episode of our program.
45120	49200	My name is Rob Roberts, joining over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming
49200	53280	culture, and the gamer lifestyle, hopefully hiccup-free this week, thank you very much,
53280	54720	with my co-host.
54720	57960	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
57960	59440	Can't talk, I have a milkshake.
59440	62700	Speaking of sick, you were out sick last week.
62700	63700	I had the plague.
63700	68800	I think you and I had a similar thing, because I was here on the show, and I did the show
68800	72080	anyway, and I had hiccups, and then I was feeling really sniffly, and sure enough, I
72080	73080	missed work on Tuesday.
73080	77340	I didn't have sniffly things, my stomach felt like rocks were in it, and I ended up having
77340	84000	to eat very, very plain, plain chicken broth and rice, because every time I would eat something,
84000	85840	it would cause immediate reflux.
85840	86840	You.
86840	87840	So, yeah.
87840	89960	I think mine was a case of gastritis.
89960	91680	Happy place, video games, yay.
91680	93120	I have chocolate milkshake this week.
93120	94120	There you go.
94120	95120	Is it bringing all the boys to the yard?
95120	96120	Mm.
96120	97120	All right.
97120	98880	Well, I know who it did bring to the studio.
98880	100440	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
100440	101440	Hello.
101440	103400	Hi, Loki, how are you?
103400	104400	Doing fine.
104400	107680	So, a little bit before we went live tonight, we did a little taste test, and I think a
107680	112600	lot of your friends and people on YouTube and Facebook are talking about this contest
112600	117360	that's happening for the second year, and that's the whole Lay's Do A Flavor contest
117360	121040	where they have the crazy chip flavors, and last year, what, they had chicken and waffles,
121040	122040	which was amazing.
122040	124200	Sriracha, the garlic bread one, right?
124200	126160	You mean the spicy ketchup one?
126160	127160	Yes.
127160	130400	So, this year, and I just had Loki and Dark Soccer, I tried these before the show, and
130400	131720	I'm curious what you thought, Loki.
131720	134780	We had wasabi ginger, which you refused to touch it.
134780	139180	I don't like wasabi or ginger, so this wouldn't have been good.
139180	143500	And then there was cappuccino, which I think is way better than people are giving it credit
143500	144500	for.
144500	146740	They taste like Taco Bell cinnamon twists to me.
146740	147740	It's kind of meh.
147740	150220	All right, and then there was bacon mac and cheese.
150220	151220	That was really good.
151220	152220	Of course.
152220	153220	That was really good.
153220	154220	Of course, because bacon.
154220	155220	It was really cheesy.
155220	157260	No, the thing is, I didn't even taste the bacon in it.
157260	158260	I like this show.
158260	161620	All right, and then my favorite reaction I saw to you all night, mango salsa.
161620	162620	Oh, that was nasty.
162620	163620	Where you literally went through it.
163620	164620	It wasn't bad.
164620	166180	It was absolutely nasty.
166180	167420	It was not bad.
167660	171620	All right, we're going to the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the
171620	175540	Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,
175540	177060	right after the Bobby Blackall show.
177060	180620	It is the show where every gamer has a voice and you guys can join in in our live chat
180620	182500	room, live.vognetwork.com.
182500	186180	And you know, every gamer has a voice, even when they're wrong, such as Brad from Pod
186180	189020	Culture, who says the chicken and waffles one was nasty.
189020	190580	You're entitled to your wrong opinion.
190580	192580	Those were the best.
192580	196340	Okay, maybe you all don't agree with me.
196340	197340	That's fine.
197340	198340	Everybody gets to have a voice.
198340	202180	Hey, we've got a voice here in studio tonight that we haven't heard from in years and years
202180	207740	and years, but thanks to the magic of running into each other at conventions, we've got
207740	209980	him back on the show tonight and I'm hoping his mic works.
209980	213620	Say hello everybody to Jonas back on the show tonight.
213620	214620	Hello.
214620	215620	Hey Jonas, how are you doing?
215620	216620	I've been doing great.
216620	221260	I know it's been seven years since the last time we met.
221260	223300	Has it really been seven years since you've been on the show?
223300	224300	Yeah, I think so.
224300	230300	Because I remember I came to the show before SacAnime of 2007 because you've heard it better
230300	233340	and I was like, oh, I'll stop by the Orange Dance Radio to talk.
233340	236140	You're a little quiet, so just make sure that mic gets a little closer to your mouth.
236140	237140	Can you all hear me now?
237140	238140	Yes, we can.
238140	239140	Okay.
239140	244020	Yeah, it's been seven years because I remember me, I guess I was talking to one of you guys
244020	247460	to have a panel at SacAnime on July 2nd.
247460	248460	Oh, that's right.
248460	250620	Yeah, we had one years and years ago.
250620	253540	I don't know why we haven't had one since, it never is hooked up.
253540	255020	That was the same year I bought the Dalek.
255020	259100	Oh, and SacAnime's Dragon Con weekend now, which VOG does a lot of stuff with Dragon
259100	260580	Con, so I go out to Atlanta now.
260580	262380	And maybe they're cosplaying, by the way.
262380	263380	Awesome.
263380	266920	Yeah, I know the SacAnime weekend is usually tough for summer because it's the same time
266920	270500	as Dragon Con, as mentioned, as well as PAX.
270500	271820	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
271820	273800	And that's where we went in 2008.
273800	276220	That's probably how we kind of lost touch because we went there the next year.
276220	280060	Well, it's fantastic to have you back on the show and believe it or not, we have some new
280060	281620	listeners since 2007.
281620	283020	Oh, that's great.
283740	288420	Not everybody knows you, but we all met playing DDR, which if you don't know the history of
288420	293300	Orange Lawn Radio, Dark Soccer, Loki, myself, we all met at Roseville Golf Land or Milpitas
293300	298420	Golf Land or some, insert golf land here, playing Dance Dance Revolution and the old
298420	300420	school music games.
300420	303820	And this was born of that community, really, and Jonas, you were a part of that community
303820	304820	as well, right?
304820	305820	Correct.
305820	309580	So I have to ask you, do you still dabble in the foot stomping and all this?
310020	317900	DDR, not so much, but whether it's DDR or ITG, it's kind of out of touch a little bit.
317900	321740	Only because DDR is only in Japan now because of the future installments.
321740	322740	Right.
322740	324620	You know what's funny though?
324620	329580	I was at Milpitas Golf Land yesterday, and that's the first time I've been there in probably
329580	330580	like six or seven years.
330580	332480	It's been a very long time, right?
332480	337920	And so I went there and I remember the first place I ever saw DDR, ever saw the game.
337920	342920	You can thank that for this show, that weekend for this show, because I remember going into
342920	347120	the back arcade and there was like a mini tournament going on and people dancing crazy
347120	348120	on the machine.
348120	353480	And I was like, these hams up there doing that stuff, I'm like, I want to do that.
353480	355880	I know I'm white, but the arrows will tell me how to do it.
355880	360540	Well, see, that's the thing is the first time I saw DDR was actually at Fanime.
360540	365060	They had a fourth mix there and I was like, wow, that looks really cool.
365060	370900	And then I ended up buying the soundtrack and like, just then later on importing, you
370900	371900	know, mixes.
371900	372900	The music was very special.
372900	374420	I think it's a good way to put it.
374420	375620	It was a very special time.
375620	376620	It was cool.
376620	377620	I don't know.
377620	378620	It was.
378620	387380	Just rewind back to Anime Expo 2000, with the third mix machine and the chair.
387380	388380	Okay.
388380	392620	The first time you and I ever met was at Milpitas Golf Land in that same back arcade playing
392620	393620	Para Para Paradise.
393620	394620	Yes.
395180	399100	That was the whole time when I lived at Melrose Place and, you know, that whole thing was
399100	400100	going on.
400100	401100	And then that was like the first time we met.
401100	402100	Right.
402100	403540	So you were living at Melrose Place after that.
403540	404540	Oh, was it?
404540	405540	Oh, it's all a blur.
405540	406540	It's all a blur.
406540	408540	Anyway, let's not talk about those theatrics.
408540	414060	What my point that I wanted to talk about with the whole, um, uh, the back arcade and
414060	417140	everything that happened there, I went to Milpitas Golf Land only to discover that back
417140	418140	arcade gone.
418140	419140	What?
419140	420140	Gone.
420140	421140	It's the laser tag arena.
421140	424380	Now they converted the back arcade to a laser tag arena.
425140	430060	I want to find whoever made that decision and smack them in the nose with, with, with
430060	432620	a used a low.
432620	436660	Here's the, it's the sad reality of arcade star soccer at the front arcade, nothing but
436660	437900	ticket spitters.
437900	446260	And in the back corner, you've got your initial DS, your racing games, and then beat me to
446260	449420	the X, Technica in the groove.
449420	450420	That's it.
450420	451420	Your little, your little corner.
451420	452940	We need to just open the moneycade.
453500	458980	I know, but it would, it would sadly probably flop actually, um, that's something that could
458980	462220	actually work based on the situation with shenanigans.
462220	463220	Okay.
463220	464220	Okay.
464220	467260	So literally you walked in here like two minutes before we're live tonight and you're telling
467260	471900	us here that locally Scandi, I don't, I don't know if we're contributing to drama or gossip,
471900	477180	but Oh, well, so the Scandi here locally, which has a bunch of these Bemani machines,
477180	478180	which we're loving.
478180	479180	They're not going to have these machines anymore.
479260	485260	Um, because, okay, the con, what happened was, um, when, when, I think it was after
485260	489580	United States Pump Festival, for those who are not aware, it was the United States Championships
489580	491580	for Pump It Up, which is still going on.
491580	497060	And it's going to happen in November again at Pacific Media Expo, um, shenanigans decided
497060	502980	to put their machines, um, in Scandia as like a partnership thing, which includes converting
502980	512660	the DDR supernova one into a dual, um, switched, um, DDR extreme plus, um, the, in the groove
512660	518260	two with like the simple theme, like the Pump It Up pro to Pump It Up, um, fiesta two, which
518260	525660	is the latest one, as well as all the Bemani stuff like 2DX, pop in music, DJ Max Technica
525660	528380	and upgraded in, um, maximum tune.
528380	529380	Wow.
529780	530780	And okay.
530780	534140	And of course, um, Street Fighter 4 arcade edition.
534140	535940	Oh yeah.
535940	542140	But so this is, it's leaving, it's, it's going away because there's a disagreement between
542140	543140	the two.
543140	545940	I don't even know what it is because I just read the thing too.
545940	549220	Apparently it's like an audit or whatever done by the owner.
549220	554460	But he even like, you know, Sean was just like, listen, I, it's more important to me,
554460	559340	you know, that these games are there for the community there to use them because he's all
559340	563820	well, I'll even leave them there for free, allow you bring in whatever revenue you want
563820	568980	and I'll leave them there for free and is, but you know, cause these people, you know,
568980	573140	are coming here to play these games and it's really important to keep that going and there's,
573140	574740	they're saying, well, no.
574740	575740	Okay.
575740	581980	I look, look, message to Scandia, Sacramento, you know, I, I, hi, I'm Rob and this is Loki
581980	582980	and Dark Sakura.
582980	587020	We have a podcast with dozens and dozens of listeners, so we're really important.
587020	588020	Okay.
588700	592140	Please don't get rid of these, these machines cause it's like the whole reason to go to
592140	593500	the arcade right now.
593500	599380	Like our, I hate, it pains me, I hurt, I ache when I see these other once great arcades
599380	604220	like Milpitas Golf Land and stuff and golf lands in general go the way of the redemption
604220	605220	scene.
605220	607660	But Chuck E Cheese does this too, not to pick on Golf Land, but everything's going the way
607660	609260	of the redemption machine.
609260	615740	Like actual video games that are, that, that contribute to music and you know, the enrichment
615740	620340	of that and making people excited about music and wanting to possibly play a real instrument,
620340	621340	you know, that type of thing.
621340	622700	This is a great thing for the community.
622700	626180	So please think twice about what you're doing cause it would suck.
626180	627180	So.
627180	630180	Well, I mean, to be fair, I think Scandia has tried a lot of weird shit.
630180	635940	I mean, look at, was it the Scandia Screamer, this giant thing that's just an eyesore, you
635940	640960	know, or, or they're like shooting gallery or just like, you know, all sorts of weird
640960	645460	stuff that they have there that it seems like money making ideas that they thought, you
645500	649140	know, I don't know if that does make a lot of money for them, the Scandia Screamer or
649140	650140	whatever.
650140	651140	It's, I don't know.
651140	653340	I'll be a weird screamer when they truck those machines out of there.
653340	654340	All right.
654340	655340	Anyway.
655340	656740	Um, so on the, on the happier things.
656740	661380	So I ran into you at gamer X, which if you guys saw the videos over at VOG network, you
661380	663320	guys saw where I was interviewing Jonas.
663320	666840	So some, some stuff you've done in the past few years, since you got more involved with
666840	672980	SAC anime and all this, you actually do the game rooms at anime cons, right?
672980	673980	Correct.
673980	675340	And how does that, how did you get into that?
675420	681980	How did, how did you go from gamer guy who likes to play DDR to, I'm now putting together
681980	683660	all these gaming rooms at expos.
683660	684660	How did you get into that?
684660	685660	Okay.
685660	687540	Um, I'll try to keep this as like short as possible.
687540	691340	Like as, as, as, as short as possible because it's a really, really long story.
691340	692340	It's all right.
692340	693340	It's a three hour show, but yeah.
693340	694340	Give us, give us a cliff notes.
694340	697740	Cause I know it started like when, you know, this history, let's say like go to orange
697740	701380	house radio and stuff and then suddenly I'm starting to do tournaments because I thought
701380	703340	the tournament C would have died in paradise Island.
704340	711100	Cause you know, like what kind of term has happened like past, um, the shaft tournament?
711100	712100	Not a lot.
712100	713100	Yeah.
713100	718100	Shaft probably killed DDR for a lot of people, but yeah.
718100	722020	But so I decided, okay, I start with the whole tournaments with paradise Island.
722020	723020	Let's see how this works.
723020	726980	And I didn't know it would go that, that a decent size.
726980	732580	And so we did three shows and then of course paradise Island shut down for unknown reasons.
732820	737940	Um, of course, give my involvement, give my hands on like game development with in the
737940	740500	group too, because they liked some of my step charts at the time.
740500	741500	Right.
741500	744600	And it was fun experience, but unfortunately my contract didn't renewed from pump it up
744600	745600	pro too.
745600	747100	Cause I was working at pumping a pro as well.
747100	748440	Oh, I didn't realize that.
748440	749440	Very cool.
749440	750440	Yeah.
750440	752780	So when people heard my name working on these things, they thought, well, let's bring this
752780	753780	guy along.
753780	755260	So you did some of the steps for pumping a pro?
755260	756260	Some.
756260	757260	Yeah.
757260	758260	That's like what Shane did for DDR ultra mix and that stuff.
758260	759260	You guys should fight.
759940	764940	Hey, he had some awesome steps back when, God, when I was trying to put that, uh, statement
764940	772980	in a cabinet in it, um, yes, once again, let's dredge up the bad memories of that thousand
772980	773980	dollars.
773980	778520	It costs me to buy the parts and everything for that machine, which they ended up not
778520	779520	doing anyways.
779520	783100	And all I want to do is be reimbursed a thousand dollars for those parts.
783100	786660	So they reimburse me and then they sent me tax forms.
786660	789460	And they charged me $300 in taxes.
789460	790460	What?
790460	792340	Yes, exactly.
792340	794140	Because it was like, I don't know.
794140	795140	It was stupid.
795140	796140	All right.
796140	797140	Stop making it about you.
797140	800620	I'm sorry, but no, but he had a, some pretty awesome, he had a, I forget what song it was
800620	803980	now, but he had some pretty awesome double step charts for that.
803980	804980	All right.
804980	805980	Anyway, so, okay.
805980	809540	So you, you got more involved with, with even some of the game making and so forth.
809540	813220	But then how did you get into your first anime con?
813780	819660	Well, I did go to Fanime Con 2005 as my first con, but I think it was AOD 2006.
819660	823420	I just went like with a few friends of mine, but they couldn't make it to the next day.
823420	825460	So it was like, okay, I had to figure out a hotel place.
825460	830580	And some people found out that I actually did some game development and, but for those
830580	835380	who are part of the anime con scene in 2007, there were some people talking about some
835380	838580	issues behind the scenes that people were not aware of.
838580	842740	Whether the room where people stealing money or whatever, like I said, I don't know that
842980	845540	70 year old drama though, 70 year old drama.
845540	852300	But anyways, they probably drama at anime conventions, get out, get out, Jonas, get
852300	853300	out.
853300	855820	There's a lot of politics stuff, but there's some stuff I can't say, just fair enough.
855820	856820	Fair enough.
856820	857820	I understand.
857820	860780	I'm just saying like, they said, okay, this guy might be a future leader of certain things
860780	863860	because I guess I just brought on one random sack anime.
863860	868420	I brought my DDR, DDR pads, like a hard pads because they're running a DDR tournament,
868420	869980	but they're going to use soft pads.
869980	872500	Was it because you were the only sucker willing to do it then?
873220	876820	I just thought, okay, I paid a badge for a sack anime at one point.
876820	880980	And I thought, okay, the tournament is like, I have hard pads, we could just probably use
880980	881980	that possibly.
881980	882980	Oh, okay.
882980	885240	And then one successfully led to another.
885240	888940	And of course, since some people found that some people there actually competed in one
888940	894460	of our tournaments and then I guess the word got spread far that I did the game development.
894460	896540	They said, bring this guy in.
896540	899220	I was like, okay, I'll give this a shot and stuff.
899220	904540	So then this grew into something like, I'm assuming you were doing Fanime kind of regularly
904540	907460	and then you started dabbling in other conventions too?
907460	910680	Yes, we didn't start doing other conventions.
910680	917260	We didn't do some other conventions until 2009 where we got the gig with Fanime Con.
917260	922340	With numerous people, because some of the group members that joined in 2007 were also
922340	923440	friends of mine.
923440	926980	So we thought, okay, we could form a group and start just doing sack anime stuff.
927060	931900	And then in 2009, we grew into more than just sack anime, then Fanime Con, then all these
931900	937140	other people who want to run conventions, start-up conventions, or even GamerX just
937140	938140	contacted us.
938140	939140	Like, you want to do game rooms?
939140	940140	Like, sure.
940140	942780	Because you guys like now have this whole little organization, right?
942780	944780	Because you guys have a Facebook page, right?
944780	945780	Correct.
945780	946780	What's it called?
946780	948240	If people want to go check it out and like it and all that?
948240	956180	The name is The Big Anime Game Room, aka Teabagger.
956180	961500	So you're here representing teabaggers, all right, that's fair, all right.
961500	965920	You sound like my mother talking about politics.
965920	970380	Those teabaggers are at it again, Rob.
970380	972540	So gross, those teabaggers do.
972540	975540	I can't stand that woman in Alaska, she's so stupid.
975540	976540	Anyway.
976540	981460	Oh boy, the initials was unexpected, it just happened.
981460	982460	You're with teabaggers?
982460	984100	All right, fair enough.
984100	988300	Okay, so The Big Anime Game Room, which is teabaggers.
988300	992300	So how did the teabaggers, so you guys just get approached by different cons because you've
992300	997100	done a big one like Fatime and SacAnime, which is like SacAnime has gotten huge just in like
997100	1000100	this, you know, six or seven years I've been kind of seeing it.
1000100	1005820	And so these other conventions, like you said, GamerX, they come to you now.
1005820	1008820	How do you set up for a convention like this?
1008820	1012220	How do you know like what games you're going to bring to a con?
1012220	1016220	Like is there a science to it, or is it just, this is what we have available, let's just
1016220	1019620	kind of throw it all out there, randomize things, or do you actually go like, because
1019620	1022620	I'm going to this convention, we should bring this, this, that we should make sure there's
1022620	1027220	DDR, we should, like, how do you kind of choose what goes to what convention?
1027220	1031060	We actually, it's not just a group of, again, by the way, it's not just a group of just
1031060	1033580	being random games.
1033580	1038480	Since based on like my background with the competitive scene and our staff members actually
1038480	1042400	have background with the competitive scene of Aether Weathers from Smash and other games,
1042400	1047280	we actually do some research, like, and analysis of human behavior to see what games people
1047280	1048280	like.
1048280	1052600	Like, at first, we didn't think like, for example, we didn't think like Just Dance would
1052600	1056360	be big, and Just Dance 3 had some songs that we actually liked.
1056360	1060940	So we give it a shot at an event called Yaoi Con and we didn't expect it to be that big.
1060940	1064400	And later on, the popularity of Just Dance and the conventions became much bigger than
1064400	1065400	we expected.
1066040	1069440	I wouldn't have thought that Just Dance was a huge convention game, but it makes sense.
1069440	1070440	It actually makes a lot of sense.
1070440	1075280	Aren't they, like, talking about adding Just Dance to, like, MLG or something like that?
1075280	1078240	I think, I think, I feel like we had a story like that not that long ago.
1078240	1079240	Yeah.
1079240	1080240	It actually exists, so.
1080240	1081240	Wow.
1081240	1082240	Okay.
1082240	1085340	Because of, um, Electronic Sports World Cup in Europe.
1085340	1087640	They're actually hosting a world championship right now.
1087640	1093660	So, okay, so you kind of have to keep a pulse on, like, what games, and you might not necessarily
1093660	1096780	be right that this game is going to be a huge thing at conventions.
1096780	1102420	Like, have you ever found that there's a game that you didn't bring, but somebody else brought
1102420	1106580	it, and, like, suddenly everybody's playing that, and you were like, shit, we didn't think
1106580	1108580	to bring that?
1108580	1114220	Um, that was, that was just, yeah, that was the story of Just Dance when, um, we didn't
1114220	1119700	know, she wasn't a staffer at the time, Patricia, um, she, they said, okay, let's bring Just,
1119700	1120700	she had the idea of Just Dance.
1120700	1124420	This is before she became part of the gaming group.
1124420	1127660	So we give, still we decided to give her the shot and see how it works, but it actually
1127660	1130140	turned out, we exceeded our expectations.
1130140	1131140	Wow.
1131140	1132140	Um.
1132140	1135540	And since we do, there was tournaments, we actually have suggestions of what people,
1135540	1136540	what people actually want.
1136540	1137540	I see.
1137540	1139380	It's like, you get through your Facebook page and stuff?
1139380	1140380	Yeah.
1140380	1142340	From Facebook or emails too, like direct emails.
1142340	1145060	And I see your website's actually getting pimped in our chat room right now.
1145060	1150620	Dungeon Buster says the big anime game room, www.tbagr.org.
1150620	1153140	Fifth Dream says, just remember, teabagger orgy.
1153140	1154140	Yeah.
1154140	1155140	Perfect.
1155140	1156140	Teabagger orgy.
1156140	1161140	Boy, if we named the shows there, there would be right there.
1161140	1163340	Uh, that'll be Horde House this week.
1163340	1167500	Um, so, okay, uh, I want to get to the really good stuff.
1167500	1171780	So I, I, somebody's had to try to steal your shit before, right?
1171780	1174060	Have you ever had people try to steal your shit?
1174060	1178620	Yes, we had, we have, which this is why we had to increase our security purposes as well
1178620	1183420	as the community getting involved and to making sure that no one steals crap from the game
1183420	1189860	room because if somebody steals a agreement, it affects not just one con, but the entire
1189860	1193700	area and also ruins the trust between the community itself.
1193700	1198260	Do you ever like, I mean, this might be a really weird question, but I'm always curious
1198260	1201980	like kind of what makes people tick in that regard because I'm sure you've had to have
1201980	1205260	as the leader of this organization, you've probably had to have these awkward conversations
1205260	1207180	with people that have tried to steal shit.
1207180	1210400	And have you ever been able to figure out like, why, why do people, why do people try
1210400	1211400	to steal?
1211400	1216020	Is it just that they want a free game or do they, are they trying to hurt you guys hurt
1216020	1217020	the convention?
1217020	1218300	Are they addicted to stealing?
1218300	1220300	Like, I don't even know if you have an answer for this.
1220300	1222860	I'm just kind of rambling, but what's the reason?
1222860	1227320	There's a lot of answers, but the direct answer is usually personal issues happening.
1227320	1232420	Some people, this is why we don't really discuss about drama and conventions, but some
1232420	1236120	people's like, oh, they didn't win a tournament, so they're going to try doing, whether it's
1236120	1240840	they didn't win a tournament, they think a certain price is too large.
1240840	1242880	Let's say they saw something in the dealer's room.
1242880	1249880	Oh, it's too expensive for them to buy or, or they've never seen, they've never seen
1249880	1256620	a quote this game or so they want us to, you know, the intentions of stealing.
1256620	1261020	So it's acting out like a dog pees on the carpet to act out when the dog doesn't get
1261020	1262020	his way.
1262020	1263020	Correct.
1263020	1264020	That, that, that's okay.
1264020	1265020	Okay.
1265020	1266020	So that's okay.
1266020	1267020	So it's very animalistic.
1267020	1268020	What do these people do?
1268020	1269020	Yeah.
1269020	1272580	But we always track them down, make sure that it doesn't happen because, you know, because
1272580	1275500	it does more damage than actual trying to help.
1275500	1279960	Now going to the flip side of things and talking about something a little more positive, I'm
1279960	1285200	sure you guys get like some donations too, and people that like contribute as well to
1285200	1286200	what you guys are doing.
1286200	1289440	Do you ever get any like really cool, like, Oh my God, somebody's contributing like this
1289440	1291960	rare game import that everybody's going to want to play.
1291960	1293280	Do you ever kind of get that kind of stuff?
1293280	1296840	We get, we actually sometimes get that because I remember the first, let's, here's a good
1296840	1302400	example of like gamer X one where they got sponsorships from Microsoft and so, or an
1302400	1307960	EEA to get like battlefield copies to people who participate, who win the determines.
1307960	1311360	Because companies will fund it if you give them like the right reason to, for them to
1311360	1313440	come up with an approach.
1313440	1314440	Okay.
1314960	1320760	And sometimes like some other groups or what we call proxy, like let's say I'm like orange,
1320760	1324640	like you're orange and orange and I'm like teabag or we can proxy each other to build
1324640	1328880	relationships or another group, like let's say mission star podcast at one conventions
1328880	1331800	where they wanted to do a raffle in the, in the game room.
1331800	1332880	It's like, well, let that happen.
1332880	1333880	See how things go.
1333880	1334880	Okay.
1334880	1339280	So they bring not only new ideas, but it also gives us a more, a more better understanding
1339280	1341840	of what other communities do too.
1342240	1343240	We should look into that.
1343240	1347440	See if we can get some free games and get a little voice of geeks network and, and teabag
1347440	1348440	or magic going on here.
1348440	1351880	It'd be a lot of fun to look into that for the future.
1351880	1352880	Okay.
1352880	1353880	Very cool.
1353880	1356480	So you, you just wrapped up a gamer X two.
1356480	1357480	That's where we ran into each other.
1357480	1358560	How'd that convention go for you?
1358560	1359560	Was it fun?
1359560	1360560	It was fun.
1360560	1366120	I know that a lot of the information has been posted online, whether it's from, from polygon
1366120	1371800	for those who have read and it's, but it's kind of unfortunate though for us.
1371800	1378840	That gamer X two is, is in hiatus right now based on the news that we've read, right?
1378840	1382040	Cause yeah, yeah, it's going to, that's a convention you don't get to do next year.
1382040	1384800	Maybe I don't know what actually we're going to touch on this a little later.
1384800	1387240	There's a very interesting, very interesting gamer X developments this week.
1387240	1390640	We're going to get into a little later, so I'll put that on hold a little bit, but, uh,
1390640	1394160	we don't know what's going to happen and it's going to be how I mean, but, but you're, you're,
1394160	1398980	you're a straight guy that, you know, and, and we heard a lot of these, these talks from
1398980	1402580	straight guys who went to gamer X that were pretty impressed with the convention that
1402580	1404420	they were just kind of like, yeah, it was cool.
1404420	1405420	It was really chill.
1405420	1406860	Did you kind of walk out of there with the same attitude?
1406860	1408260	Like this was different.
1408260	1409260	Of course.
1409260	1411460	I mean, like I said, Oh, sorry.
1411460	1415980	Um, like I mentioned to some of the people, this is going to be an article that's going
1415980	1421600	to be written soon that one of the biggest reasons why we wanted to try, um, gamer X
1421600	1426620	and gamer X two was to show that there's more to gaming than just like straight people as
1426620	1430300	well as for us, like get teabaggers and stuff.
1430300	1431660	We do not discriminate at all.
1431660	1438100	Well, if you're going to call yourself teabagger, you have to have a little bit of, you obviously
1438100	1442100	have a little bit of, you know, I, I don't, anyway, I, I, that's, that, no, that's great.
1442100	1443100	That's, that's fantastic.
1443100	1444540	I think that's the perfect attitude.
1444540	1448780	Because, um, even though we deal game room, sometimes, you know, the people that go to
1448780	1454940	all these events sometimes show some social inactivity or negative comments that even
1454940	1458240	though it doesn't hurt, even though it's not, we didn't have nothing to do with it,
1458240	1460460	it could affect us too.
1460460	1466140	If it's that person once said the, the, the forbidden words to other, right?
1466140	1470140	Like the T word or F word and the things that I get it, like somebody in your game room
1470140	1473940	says something, then that's not going to be posted on Facebook.
1473940	1478700	That such and such person said it's going to be, Oh, that game room at gamer X was so
1478700	1482380	awful because they used all these slurs type of thing that is not going to fall on the
1482380	1484300	individual who said it's going to fall on you.
1484300	1485300	It sucks.
1485300	1488700	So you have to kind of create an environment where that doesn't happen.
1488700	1489700	Right?
1489700	1490700	Yeah.
1490700	1491700	Yes.
1491700	1493580	Um, yeah, this is a one, one challenge that happened at gamer X too.
1493580	1494580	Yeah.
1494580	1498300	And this is something that was really hard to figure because we're, again, we're trying
1498300	1502980	to be, we're trying to figure out the behavior of like, what can we do to make people happy?
1502980	1503980	Right.
1503980	1508620	And one of the Just Dance tournaments, I guess this one person, I'll just say person, I can't,
1508620	1510420	I can't, it's hard for me to identify.
1510420	1511420	Right.
1511420	1516020	Um, some, like one of the attendees said, she said that, but the girl got, I mean, that
1516020	1519220	person got upset and said, is it she?
1519220	1520220	Okay.
1520220	1521220	So it was, it was misgendered.
1521220	1522220	The person was misgendered.
1522220	1523220	Correct.
1523220	1524220	Okay.
1524220	1525220	Right.
1525220	1526840	Which is not the environment, like, you know, gamer X is trying to create an environment
1526840	1531620	where people can be who they, who they identify as and you know, who they, who they are.
1531620	1534820	So yeah, I can, I can, yeah, if somebody gets misgendered, that's a big no-no, especially
1534820	1535820	at a con like that.
1535820	1536820	Yeah.
1536820	1539300	But we did clear it up to her just to make sure she feels better over the matter.
1539300	1543460	It was just an unfortunate sight cause it, the Just Dance room was so, the tournament
1543460	1548220	was so big that everybody heard it like, and she heard it too, like right in front of a
1548220	1549220	bunch of people.
1549220	1553140	Um, hopefully, I don't know if, if they had one of those stickers, I know those helped
1553140	1554140	a lot.
1554140	1557240	Like when, you know, it's like, well, how do I, you know, what, what gender does this
1557240	1558240	person prefer?
1558240	1560420	Then you can, you know, you can see the sticker.
1560420	1561420	So yeah.
1561420	1563180	But I think at the end she was okay with it.
1563180	1566540	Like it was like, it was not done with ill intentions or anything like that.
1566540	1567540	Okay.
1567540	1568540	Okay.
1568780	1570620	So what, what about what's coming up?
1570620	1572340	You've got other conventions coming up, right?
1572340	1575620	You're doing, um, SacAnime, this coming, right?
1575620	1578980	Um, FYI, I know some people are wondering, what's the tournaments and stuff.
1578980	1583020	We will release the tournament list this week also.
1583020	1590420	And we're asking, we're going to make it a special announcement for additional PopRise.
1590420	1597340	If the, if two objectives actually follow, if, if people can bring, bring teabag to 500
1597340	1603880	likes or a certain post that to like like 50 likes on an actual post, we'll offer a
1603880	1605860	special bonus to a certain tournament.
1605860	1610640	So this is like a Kickstarter only you want people's social, social involvement, not their
1610640	1611640	money necessarily.
1611640	1616100	It's social involvement because with new games coming out, they want to see like the competition
1616100	1621260	still rise up while still teaching the people who are not in the competency to be competitive
1621260	1622980	and to enjoy the game at its fullest.
1622980	1623980	Okay.
1623980	1624980	All right.
1624980	1626580	So it's not just getting like 500,000 likes.
1627020	1628020	Oh, and whore it out.
1628020	1630860	It's more like connect, connected to community.
1630860	1631860	Yeah.
1631860	1636340	It helps you get a bigger voice when it comes to, um, you know, what, what do people want
1636340	1638140	to play and really see the cons and stuff.
1638140	1639740	It's a win, win all around.
1639740	1640740	Yeah.
1640740	1641740	Correct.
1641740	1642740	Cool.
1642740	1643740	Uh, quickly, any other cons that you've got coming up?
1643740	1648340	I got to get into gaming news for the week, but, um, I know SacAnime is coming up.
1648340	1652140	Um, SnafuCon, the Reno event.
1652140	1653520	Oh, okay.
1653520	1655380	It's coming up soon in October.
1655380	1659620	One of our, one of our partners, crew members who brings like the old school games that
1659620	1661220	you bought, like the Sega Genesis and everything.
1661220	1662220	Yeah.
1662220	1663220	I know.
1663220	1666140	Cause I know you're playing, I saw you playing like Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic.
1666140	1667140	Yeah.
1667140	1669580	Uh, Jeremy from Koopa Club and I were throwing down on Sonic.
1669580	1670580	It was Sonic three.
1670580	1671580	Yeah.
1671580	1672580	It was Sonic and Knuckles attached to Sonic three.
1672580	1675740	What was the only thing that was open that we could find because your game room was so
1675740	1676740	popular.
1676740	1677740	We couldn't.
1677740	1678740	So that happened to be open at the moment.
1678740	1679740	We were like, yeah, let's do this.
1679740	1682700	So we had a lot of fun playing that I had more fun cause I won.
1682700	1683700	Awesome.
1683700	1684700	Yeah.
1685020	1688860	Um, yeah, I got to thank Abe who actually brought the equipment there and he was actually
1688860	1690980	the manager of the SnafuCon game room.
1690980	1694180	So it happens in October, so stay tuned for that.
1694180	1695180	All right.
1695180	1696180	Um, yeah.
1696180	1703380	And just one, um, to clarify things, if people don't see, if people don't see a game that
1703380	1706060	they want to play badly, just ask us.
1706060	1708800	Not all games can be shown because of the high demand that everybody wants to play every
1708800	1710300	game possible.
1710300	1714460	So you can always ask if we have this game and we'll assist you guys as much as possible.
1715220	1716220	All right.
1716220	1717220	Very cool.
1717220	1718220	Well, um, again, check them out on Facebook.
1718220	1723960	Uh, just, just remember teabagger, the big anime game room, because if they get to 500
1723960	1727260	likes, they're going to bring more prizes to SAK anime.
1727260	1730700	And even though you might not live in Sacramento, you might live somewhere in California or
1730700	1735200	hell Nevada, it sounds like in probably Oregon soon where these guys are going to be.
1735200	1739940	So, um, best of luck to you as your thing grows and grows, uh, your, your organization.
1739940	1743780	And um, yeah, uh, stick, stick with us and talk about the week in gaming.
1743780	1744780	All right.
1744780	1747060	What do you, uh, do you still play a lot of the new stuff?
1747060	1750700	I know the game rooms do a lot of classics for you play a lot of, do you play PlayStation
1750700	1752460	four, Xbox one, or what are you playing these days?
1752460	1757500	I have a PlayStation four, I've missed out on the destiny beta cause I was so busy with
1757500	1758500	them.
1758500	1759500	A lot of life stuff.
1759500	1764820	Oh no, you missed out and some other games and like in a more game business stuff, but
1764820	1768460	I've, I've, I've still, but we, I have a, we use still, so I play some games.
1768460	1769460	Nice.
1769460	1771660	Well, we'll get to your gaming week in a little bit here cause we're gonna get to how was
1771660	1772660	your gaming week.
1773180	1776980	No, I was just cause I went, you know, I had to go like the page cause I haven't liked
1776980	1780580	the page yet, but it does, it does bring up a one good question though.
1780580	1787020	Are you going to include a ball pit in future game room?
1787020	1791500	That was something that was suggested to us and well, there are a few things that we'll
1791500	1792500	say the word.
1792500	1794780	Maybe we can't guarantee anything about that.
1794780	1796460	I would call $17,000.
1796460	1802060	I feel if nothing else, what Dashcon brought to the world was that every convention will
1802060	1804780	be expected to have a ball pit now.
1804780	1807740	It's going to be a thing where every convention is asked, where's your ball pit?
1807740	1809060	I want my hour in the ball pit.
1809060	1811340	Have you already seen the people cosplaying the ball pit?
1811340	1812980	Oh yeah, I knew that would be a thing.
1812980	1817260	I knew that would be the, somebody, somebody like that same weekend, cause there were other,
1817260	1818620	obviously gamer X was going on.
1818620	1821340	I think there was another convention going on stream.
1821340	1826340	Not just that, some other stuff because I want to say, uh, uh, Rama or somebody had
1826340	1831860	posted a picture of somebody that was dressed as a PayPal account looking for $17,000.
1831860	1833500	Like that same weekend.
1833500	1835140	Like that's how fast the internet works.
1835140	1836140	People.
1836140	1837140	It's amazing.
1837140	1838140	All right.
1838140	1842100	Um, anyhow, let's, let's get into, uh, our gaming weeks, the types of video games that
1842100	1845740	we've been playing this week and we'll get into a week in gaming news as well.
1845740	1847220	Uh, let's start with you, dark soccer.
1847220	1849020	What types of video games you've been playing this week?
1849020	1855020	Been playing some final fantasy 14, um, last weekend while I was sick, sick Dan, um, played
1855020	1857580	through and beat mega man X.
1857580	1858580	I saw your pictures on Facebook.
1858580	1859980	We had a couple hours to kill.
1859980	1860980	It was fun.
1860980	1861980	Yeah.
1861980	1868500	Um, I've been playing a little bit of bravely D fart.
1868500	1869940	Why do you call it that?
1869940	1875320	Just because I tried to say default the other day at work and I said, D fart.
1875320	1877300	So since then it's been bravely D fart.
1877300	1878300	Okay.
1878300	1880060	You know, that game's done very well for square Enix.
1880060	1883860	There was a report that came out this week or last or something that they, they've sold
1883860	1886100	a million of that game worldwide.
1886100	1887100	Great.
1887220	1892780	Um, Dan and I are probably, we were talking about getting rid of some of our more expensive
1892780	1894700	stuff that we're not playing anymore.
1894700	1901340	Um, but he and I are actually playing on like a regular game night and he bought me a kingdom
1901340	1911020	hearts 1.5 HD remix, whatever for matching service.com edition.
1911020	1913100	So we're going to be starting that one together.
1913100	1916060	You'll probably finish it just in time for kingdom hearts 2.5, which is coming out.
1916060	1918180	Which he's ordered for me so I can get a pin.
1918180	1919180	Hooray.
1919180	1920180	That's the whole reason we got it.
1920180	1925660	So I could have a pin for my collection because pin trading, I love how you just like literally
1925660	1929100	within the same breath talked about, we're going to be getting rid of some of our stuff
1929100	1933180	cause we have a lot of stuff, but I got a pin and I bought this game cause I got a fucking
1933180	1934180	pin.
1934180	1940060	No, actually we're going to be getting rid of like a lot of our DVDs and seeing what
1940060	1941060	we can keep digital.
1941060	1947100	You know, basically trying to downsize because, um, as much as we love our games and love
1947100	1953300	our stuff, a person can only take up so much space responsibly, so that, and we want to
1953300	1954300	move.
1954300	1955300	Understandable.
1955300	1956300	Understandable.
1956300	1957660	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1957660	1959700	I played pretty much nothing.
1959700	1964380	The only thing I did get, I was hoping to be able to play a little bit more than nothing
1964380	1969220	because we had our like kind of work game conference thing.
1969220	1972420	I thought that was this week and you were hoping to place some new stuff.
1972420	1974500	Yeah, but we had a lot of no shows.
1974500	1979660	One of those being, uh, Tech Mccowie and they usually bring a demo, but they didn't have
1979660	1980660	anything.
1980660	1985740	So the only thing I got to actually see, didn't really play shame of like I got to see a trap
1985740	1989460	team, but, um, I don't know.
1989460	1990460	It's Skylanders.
1990460	1996780	I just don't give a shit about Skylanders and all I saw was like, they were like saying,
1996780	2000180	okay, yeah, see, look at these, these little trap crystals or whatever.
2000180	2005580	You put it in there and you get to, you know, you get to capture enemies and, and, but you
2005580	2010060	know, if you trap a different enemy with this, then that old enemy's gone.
2010060	2015260	So you need to buy as many as you can to be able to travel like, Oh, come the hell on.
2015260	2017420	Can you be any more obvious?
2017420	2021340	You know, it's like, seriously, let's just sell all this shit.
2021340	2022340	They'll buy it.
2022340	2025860	And it's like, come on me guys.
2025860	2027460	It's so obvious now.
2027460	2030700	But so that, that was really the only new game that I saw.
2030700	2033380	Um, they didn't even have like Ubisoft didn't have anything.
2033380	2037620	Um, you know, even sometimes they bring just dancers, sadly.
2037620	2041260	Do you think this is because with the news of your company being sold, they just are
2041260	2045860	kind of like, yes, because lame duck X, no, no, that's not why.
2045860	2046860	It's not why at all.
2046860	2050420	It's because the, the Ingram expo is the week prior.
2050420	2053500	Um, so there's a lot of reps already went off that.
2053500	2059340	Because of that, there's certain reps at these companies that call on Ingram and there's
2059340	2062260	certain reps of those companies that call on our company.
2062260	2066940	And so it was kind of that weird gray area, like, okay, well, is it this rep that's coming
2066940	2068860	out or is it this rep?
2068860	2077100	And so just a lot of them didn't come or, you know, I dunno, but I got to rep, you know,
2077100	2082660	for seven different companies because I was working the, they didn't show up booth.
2082660	2084220	Let me talk about all their games.
2084220	2093260	So like, you know, I got to do was as I was the rep for EA take to, um, Microsoft, Konami,
2093260	2096380	these companies realize that we're going to be repping them.
2096380	2098020	No, they weren't.
2098020	2102460	But thankfully Bethesda and Konami were super easy because they have nothing coming out
2102460	2103860	with the evil within Bethesda.
2103860	2104860	Yeah.
2104860	2110140	The evil within, and maybe the Ls girls online, Konami has soccer and there's the, um, there's
2110140	2113420	that don't call it team fortress three, but it's pretty much team fortress three game
2113420	2115900	that Bethesda has, but that's next year.
2115900	2117900	That's yeah, that's not this year at all.
2117900	2121980	I was only talking about stuff for the fourth quarter, but uh, yeah, so I got to do that
2121980	2122980	stuff and that was kind of fun.
2122980	2127180	I made my own trailer loop and everything and uh, there wasn't even a swag.
2127180	2129040	It was like, Oh, now there was swag.
2129040	2131740	It was giant fucking bags from Atlas.
2131740	2133280	Like these bags were ridiculous.
2133280	2136740	The mouse swag that would fit in those, they hit like they didn't even have a traditional
2136740	2137740	handle on them.
2137740	2138740	It was like a backpack.
2138740	2141100	You were wearing this big swag backpack thing.
2141100	2142100	All right.
2142100	2143100	So how's that?
2143100	2146180	I forgot one other, sure.
2146180	2147180	Sims two.
2147180	2151180	Oh, did you play, uh, they gave away the whole shebang.
2151180	2152180	Yeah.
2152180	2153180	Yep.
2153180	2154180	I forgot to grab that.
2154180	2155180	I put all the dirty stuff back in my game too.
2155180	2156180	Did you?
2156180	2157180	Yeah, I did.
2157180	2158180	It works.
2158180	2159180	All right.
2159180	2164580	Um, but I'm building a compound that my character and her cat live in.
2164580	2166340	And what do they do in the compound?
2166340	2167340	I don't know yet.
2167340	2168340	I'm still building the compound.
2168940	2173700	I spent more time building the house than I have actually playing the game.
2173700	2174700	So that's what happens.
2174700	2175700	I did.
2175700	2179220	I did download that just because it's free and I can't possibly pass up on it.
2179220	2180220	You know, free stuff.
2180220	2181220	I forgot.
2181220	2182220	But Alan grabbed it.
2182220	2185180	So I can always just use his login if I really had to play it, you know?
2185180	2186180	Yeah.
2186180	2188580	The chat room is taking this fart thing away too.
2188580	2189580	Yeah.
2189580	2190580	What now?
2190580	2193900	Everybody's putting fart in the name of game titles because of what you did with bravely
2193900	2194900	to fart.
2194900	2195900	Defart.
2195980	2198940	But, uh, farts a horizon says rage nator.
2198940	2199940	Mario fart.
2199940	2200940	He says so.
2200940	2201940	Act deaf.
2201940	2203860	I came out with final fart is fart ashy.
2203860	2206020	The fart of us act deaf.
2206020	2207020	Okay.
2207020	2208020	You guys like how are you?
2208020	2209020	My favorite.
2209020	2210460	How fucking old are we?
2210460	2213020	It's farting mama.
2213020	2215500	How fucking old are we chat?
2215500	2218740	And then I have never yelled at a chat room like this before.
2218740	2223100	This dream has brought it back to the news and linked to the article that says no fartings.
2223540	2226220	Smelling farts don't prevent cancer.
2226220	2227500	Grow up all of you.
2227500	2228500	All right.
2228500	2235780	So like, so like would that be like, for example, like kingdom farts toots point five.
2235780	2236780	All right.
2236780	2237780	I'm done.
2237780	2238780	I'm sucking.
2238780	2239780	Can't.
2239780	2240780	I can't.
2240780	2244980	Street far turn four.
2244980	2245980	I will.
2245980	2248540	I will bring those wasabi ginger chips out.
2248540	2249540	That's fine.
2249540	2251460	I'm not going to eat any of the end of you.
2251460	2252460	Rob.
2252460	2253460	Let it go.
2253460	2254460	Let it go.
2254460	2255460	All right.
2255460	2256460	Let's go to Jonas.
2256460	2257460	Our guest.
2257460	2258460	Let it blow.
2258460	2259460	Who can hopefully.
2259460	2260460	Tell me.
2260460	2261460	What?
2261460	2262460	What's up?
2262460	2263460	I think he's here.
2263460	2264460	Oh, your friend's here?
2264460	2267020	Well, do you want to give us quickly your gaming week?
2267020	2268860	Of course.
2268860	2273980	I'm technically playing three games competitively.
2273980	2277180	Just Dance 2014 because the World Cup Invitational.
2277180	2280860	Yeah, we'll let Jamie do our duty.
2280860	2281860	Go ahead.
2282260	2290100	Yeah, I'm competing on that, so I'm hopefully get the trip to Paris, France because the
2290100	2295420	top player's good to go to Paris, France with all expenses played.
2295420	2303540	Pump it at Fiesta 2 because of the United States Championships at Pacific Media Expo.
2303540	2307060	And of course, like everybody's doing is Mario Kart 8.
2307060	2309720	Yeah, I've been playing that competitively.
2309720	2315280	Won three tournaments and I'm undefeated in rounds so far, so I'm 10-0 and 3-0.
2315280	2316280	Nice.
2316280	2317280	I bet.
2317280	2321280	Does the Mario Kart get pretty competitive at your game rooms?
2321280	2322600	In game or X2, it was big.
2322600	2323600	Oh, yeah.
2323600	2325840	I guess it hasn't been out long enough for you to take it to a lot of cons, but game
2325840	2326840	rooms.
2326840	2327840	Yeah.
2327840	2328840	Zack Enemy will be the biggest test to see how big it's going to be.
2328840	2329840	All right.
2329840	2330840	Sounds like fun.
2330840	2331840	Sounds like fun.
2331840	2332840	All right.
2332840	2334680	Well, let me talk about my gaming week real quick and then we can introduce our guests
2334680	2336120	that just arrived.
2336120	2337120	My gaming week.
2337120	2340800	I played a lot of old standby stuff that I usually play, like Final Fantasy XIV stuff.
2340800	2342940	They did play a few new games.
2342940	2346040	Rogue Legacy on the PlayStation 4 just came out this past week, which I've played on the
2346040	2347520	PC before.
2347520	2350400	And obviously, I like the retro vibe this game has going on.
2350400	2356720	And it obviously recalls a lot of Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, but with the roguelike
2356720	2361680	twist of the fact that the castle randomizes every time you play the game.
2361680	2362680	And you get more...
2362680	2363680	It's Rogue Legacy.
2363680	2364680	Jonas is like, what is this game?
2364680	2365680	Rogue Legacy.
2365680	2366680	It's a PlayStation Network game.
2367240	2369440	And you can also get on PC, Steam.
2369440	2371560	And the game is hard as hell.
2371560	2375840	But the good news is that even when you die in the game, you don't die permanently because
2375840	2377940	your predecessor takes your place.
2377940	2381120	And all the gold that you collected, you can spend on upgrades.
2381120	2384420	But to get back in the castle, you'll have to give up all your change.
2384420	2387440	So whatever gold you don't spend on upgrades, you're going to lose.
2387440	2390480	So you want to buy things every time and it'll help you make your character a little more
2390480	2393200	stronger, a little more stronger, a little more stronger, until you can take on the boss
2393200	2396080	characters and go into the other areas.
2396480	2401120	And the other big twist in Rogue Legacy, your descendants all have issues.
2401120	2402360	Most of them have issues.
2402360	2403360	And that could be anything for...
2403360	2408360	I say issues very, very liberally, because some of them will just say they're gay, which
2408360	2412600	obviously isn't an issue, but it's just like that will change the ending if you happen
2412600	2414420	to beat it with a gay...
2414420	2416580	Not to be a spoiler, but that'll be something.
2416580	2421200	Some of them do crazy shit, like this person is colorblind, so the whole screen is black
2421200	2423200	and white when you play.
2423200	2427040	Or this person has vertigo, so everything is upside down.
2427040	2431840	Or this person tends to exaggerate, so whenever they take damage, the damage meter shows like
2431840	2435760	five billion is the damage they took, even though it was only like 24.
2435760	2440280	So some of them are really silly, but some of them really will screw with your gameplay.
2440280	2445320	Some of them are tinier, this person has dwarfism, or this person has gigantism, or this person
2445320	2448840	has ADHD, so they run really fast.
2448840	2450840	Or just other things like that.
2450880	2455320	Or this person has irritable bowel syndrome, so they make little fart noises when they
2455320	2458560	jump, like your little jokes in chat, right?
2458560	2460280	Like little silly things like that.
2460280	2465640	But it adds a different cool little layer to the game, the fact that it's not always
2465640	2468080	the same person you're running through the castle with.
2468080	2471880	So yeah, if you like the retro games, if you like Symphony of the Night or Roguelikes,
2471880	2476080	I think Roguelikes is really cool, and it's only like 15 bucks, it's worth checking out.
2476120	2481840	Speaking of roguelikes, this one just hit Steam this week in a pre-alpha, what do they
2481840	2483680	call it on Steam, first look?
2483680	2484680	Early Access.
2484680	2485800	Early Access, that's it.
2485800	2490720	So on Steam Early Access, and I got it specifically because we have a chatter who's called into
2490720	2494320	the show to talk about this game before, and I've heard a lot about this on Twitter, I
2494320	2498720	checked out Crypt of the Necrodancer on Steam Early Access because it just came out, which
2498720	2503320	is also a roguelike, meaning it has randomly generated dungeons and items that you find,
2503320	2504880	but here's the catch.
2504880	2506360	It's a music game.
2506360	2512680	So, as you play, you have to move with the beats of the music, because if you don't,
2512680	2516560	your character will get frozen, or you won't do the moves that you want to do.
2516560	2520160	And it's really funny because as you do it more and more in time, then the rooms start
2520160	2522640	lighting up like it's a disco and this stuff.
2522640	2527840	So what I find that it does is it forces you to think fast, because you have to move in
2527840	2531720	time with the music, you don't have time to think about, am I gonna go left or right,
2531720	2534460	or have I been down here, have I been by here, because you need to already be pushing the
2534460	2536060	button in time with the music.
2536060	2543940	So it turns Rogue into an action game, which is kind of a really cool twist on the formula.
2543940	2545700	And the fact that it's a music game, right?
2545700	2548940	Yeah, and you can load your own music, but the music that comes with the game is actually
2548940	2549940	really good.
2549940	2551940	But you can load your own MP3s if you want.
2551940	2552940	Ooh, question for this.
2552940	2554840	Here's a funny question.
2554840	2559520	Is the bar or the chair included?
2559520	2563920	There is no bar that I've seen yet, but there is a variety of weapons, there's like a shovel
2563920	2566880	and stuff, so maybe there's a hidden joke in there somewhere.
2566880	2571040	I don't know if the developers played DDR a lot and really like understood the scene
2571040	2573960	or what have you, but yeah, that would be funny.
2573960	2577080	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2577080	2580240	Some people talking about Rogue Legacy still.
2580240	2583320	Act Def says, Rogue Legacy is awesome, one of my favorite games from last year.
2583320	2588740	I like the symbolism in being gay from Rogue Legacy, it changes nothing at all.
2588740	2592640	Let's see, and Fifth Dream says, NecroDancer is amazing.
2592640	2594560	The soundtrack is great too.
2594560	2598080	So there you go, some of our comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
2598080	2601880	So yeah, I had fun playing around with Krypton the NecroDancer and I see why, I think it
2601880	2604400	was as I shared with Matt that had called in about the game before him, but I'm positive
2604400	2608080	it was him, why he really was into this, especially as a music game fan.
2608080	2609240	And I like the roguelikes.
2609240	2613320	I'm starting to think the genre is a little bit, like every game wants to be a roguelike
2613320	2616980	now, so I think it's starting to thin a little bit, but I think this was a really refreshing
2616980	2618880	twist on that idea.
2618880	2623240	So four for you, Krypton the NecroDancer, you go.
2623240	2627960	And then lastly, okay, I have to bring this up.
2627960	2633040	So I tried a new game this week, and the game I tried this week, I felt obligated to at
2633040	2638320	least try it, because I can't hate on a game until I've played it for myself.
2638320	2641640	Like I'm not gonna be that cynical bastard on the internet that hates something based
2641640	2645320	on principle, unless it's Fifty Shades of Grey, I mean let's be real, everybody fucking
2645320	2646320	hates that.
2646320	2648360	Oh, you mean Fifty Shades of Abuse?
2648360	2649360	Fifty Shades of...
2649360	2650360	Nope!
2650360	2651360	Yeah, that's what I was calling it.
2651360	2657720	Anyway, all kidding aside, I played Kim Kardashian Hollywood, which is the most popular iPhone
2657720	2658720	game right now.
2658720	2660800	Stop, you are giving me judgy stares.
2660800	2661800	Stop it.
2661800	2665440	It is the number one game on iPhone right now, and I want to know how is this game making
2665440	2667040	$700,000 a day?
2667040	2669780	They're saying $700,000 a day.
2669780	2674240	So here's the question you might be wondering whether you want to admit it or not.
2674240	2676400	Is this game really good?
2676400	2680480	And the answer is no, it's not good.
2680480	2684240	But it's not as bad as you probably think.
2684240	2687900	It's more like a Facebook game to me, it's a lot like a Facebook game, it reminded me
2687900	2692480	a lot of that Sims Facebook game they had, where you have to spend energy to do certain
2692480	2697840	tasks, and I appreciate that the game has some tongue-in-cheek humor in it.
2697840	2700480	Like I don't think the game takes itself too seriously.
2700480	2706000	Like I had a guy, okay so like the characters in the games will like write tweets, and tweets
2706000	2711600	that mention you will get you more fans, which helps you move up on the A-list or whatever.
2711600	2715740	But like, okay so there's this character I got into a fight with earlier in the game,
2715740	2720160	and he decided to write a tweet about me, and what he put in the tweet, he said, a nobody
2720160	2722780	ruins the party and I get kicked out?
2722780	2730720	How does Rob even know Kim Kardashian, total conspiracy, hashtag Illuminati, hashtag Obamacare?
2730720	2733160	And that made me laugh.
2733160	2738280	And that was the little touch that I was like, alright, so this game kinda knows its place,
2738280	2740360	like it's not that serious.
2740360	2746160	So if you want a game that's just gonna make you laugh for five minutes, it's free, don't
2746160	2749520	spend money on it, but at the same time there's really not much of a game here.
2749520	2754640	It's go to this location and pose for all these pictures by clicking this bar and spending
2754640	2755640	your energy.
2755640	2759560	Like it's a really, like game is a really loose term with this.
2759560	2762840	Like Flappy Bird was more of a fucking game than this is, okay?
2762840	2766000	Flappy Bird at least, you know, yeah, you had to flap and you had to dodge and there
2766000	2770080	was some skill involved, believe it or not, but there's no skill involved in Kim Kardashian
2770080	2771720	Hollywood, there's none.
2771720	2778840	But it's, if you read tmz.com and that type of trash, then you know what, you're probably
2778840	2781680	gonna appreciate some of the trash in this game too, and that's probably why it's doing
2781680	2783900	so popular.
2783900	2784900	So there it is.
2784900	2791960	Let's see, looking at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Blender says, can't believe
2791960	2795000	Skye passed up The Last of Us for this game.
2795000	2802640	All right, here's the problem, Blender, Last of Us, $50, Kim Kardashian, free, Last of
2802640	2808680	Us, trip to Target or wherever, Kim Kardashian, press button and download on my phone, which
2808680	2809680	I guess.
2809680	2810680	Now, now.
2810680	2811680	Press button, download on Steam.
2811680	2816240	Yeah, I know I could download it on PlayStation 4, but still, still, I didn't want to spend
2816240	2818480	all that money right now.
2818480	2821520	I will get to The Last of Us eventually, I promise.
2822280	2828000	For science people, I did it for science because it's the number one game and I felt an obligation.
2828000	2831320	You did it for the Aperture Science reason.
2831320	2832320	Because we can.
2832320	2833600	Because you can.
2833600	2837120	Because I was promised cake if I beat the game and I've yet to receive my cake.
2837120	2838840	And you ended up being baked instead.
2838840	2843320	But Dark Sakura did bring me tortilla chips, which I think we actually brought up there.
2843320	2844840	And a Mexican soda, which is good.
2844840	2848440	I did, made with actual sugar and not HFCs.
2848440	2852040	By the way, apparently donuts are now called sugar bagels.
2852040	2856120	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com is suggesting VoG Network Hollywood.
2856120	2857520	Oh, I love the idea.
2857520	2858520	I love the idea.
2858520	2860520	But it shouldn't be VoG Network Hollywood.
2860520	2862360	It should be like VoG Network Fresno.
2862360	2865120	We should call it VoG-ywood.
2865120	2866120	VoG-ywood.
2866120	2867120	VoG-ywood.
2867120	2868120	All right.
2868120	2873040	Before we get to more, we have, we're going to get to gaming news and so forth.
2873040	2876400	But Jonas, you invited a buddy of yours to come out to the show tonight.
2876400	2880600	Why don't you, why don't you introduce who you brought to the studio?
2880600	2885200	This is Diego, the second head of the teabaggers.
2885200	2886200	Okay.
2886200	2887200	There you go, Diego.
2887200	2888200	Give Diego the mic.
2888200	2889200	Hi, Diego.
2889200	2890200	How are you?
2890200	2891200	Good.
2891200	2892200	How are you doing?
2892200	2893200	Hi, good.
2893200	2894200	We've never met.
2894200	2895200	I'm Rob.
2895200	2896200	Hi, Rob.
2896200	2897200	We're doing a show.
2897200	2898200	That's Jamie.
2898200	2899200	That's Matt.
2899200	2900200	Hi, Jamie.
2900200	2901200	How you doing?
2901200	2902200	How did you meet Jonas?
2902200	2903200	I met Jonas.
2903200	2904200	Well, actually technically we met, we could have met at Paradise Island tournament back
2904200	2905200	in the day when they were still around.
2905200	2906200	And we had a tournament in Sacramento.
2906200	2907200	Right.
2907200	2908200	Okay.
2908200	2910480	So maybe, maybe we have crossed paths back in the day or whatever, one of those tournaments.
2910480	2914480	Give or take, I'd say that we must've just like literally crossed paths and just didn't
2914480	2917960	know there were multiple tournaments that were going on that time at the Paradise Island
2917960	2920000	that was across from the Arden Fair Mall.
2920000	2921000	Yeah.
2921000	2922000	Oh yeah.
2922000	2923000	I remember Paradise Island.
2923000	2925200	And me and my other friends went there for a Smash Brothers Melee tournament while he
2925200	2929760	was hosting a DDR tournament at the same time in the other parts of the room.
2929760	2937680	So, but we officially got reacquainted back in 2007, January psych anime, where he just
2937680	2942240	got into staffing and I just became a volunteer and then later upgraded to staff.
2942240	2945000	And that's when we were part of the same exact department of gaming.
2945000	2946000	There you go.
2946000	2949040	Now, do you travel to all the conventions like Jonas does or?
2949040	2950040	Yes.
2950040	2951040	I'm pretty much right behind him.
2951040	2952040	100%.
2952040	2953040	So you were at Gamer X a couple of weeks ago?
2953040	2954040	Yes, I was.
2954040	2955040	How was that?
2955040	2956040	How did you have a good time?
2956040	2957040	Wonderful.
2957040	2958520	I wish I would've gone to the first one, but it was complications with getting time off
2958520	2959520	at that time.
2959520	2960520	Sure.
2960520	2961520	I heard the first one was a blast.
2961520	2965920	The second one, which was my first one, was amazing.
2965920	2967400	I wish we could have had a bigger room.
2967400	2968400	Yeah.
2968400	2971480	That was pretty much like cutting our legs off a little bit because we didn't get to
2971480	2976680	use over 50% of our equipment and we didn't want to cause any fire hazards or have the
2976680	2980480	fire marshal come in and notice because regardless of what we did, it was pretty packed, but
2980480	2981480	it was still fun.
2981480	2982480	It was definitely fun.
2982480	2983480	Yeah.
2983480	2986440	The way they did it at Gamer X this year was different too because they had that, you know,
2986440	2990000	you guys unfortunately had like a pretty small room, but that's because they had other
2990000	2992920	rooms where they were showing other types of games, like they had the Ouya games, they
2992920	2996620	had the, you know, the sponsor games, but I say sponsor games, but yet they were showing
2996620	2999360	off indie games, which was pretty awesome because there was a lot of good stuff over
2999360	3000360	there.
3000360	3001360	It was good for what it was.
3001360	3009760	They had an entire room dedicated for Pokemon on the DS, which was amazing and as odd as
3009760	3014240	it sounds for some people, but it's still very popular Pokemon today, even with the
3014240	3020200	new game coming up, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and that's going to be pretty big
3020200	3023880	because it just all of a sudden jumped up to fame again after when it first debuted
3023880	3026720	back when the anime came out in the game in 97 or something.
3026720	3031640	Pokemon does so crazy well, it really blows my mind, like how really obsessed with those
3031640	3032640	games people get.
3032640	3033960	My roommate's one of them.
3033960	3034960	It's gotten very deep.
3034960	3035960	Yeah.
3035960	3036960	What do you play?
3036960	3041760	What types of games, like what brought you, what games do you love that made you want
3041760	3043480	to do this Game Room stuff?
3043720	3047760	Well, when I first started actually taking games seriously back in the day, I was more
3047760	3049760	into Smash Brothers.
3049760	3054040	I'd say for a while that was my game because I got into the community and in getting into
3054040	3057120	the community, that's when I pretty much was getting closer to Jonas as it is.
3057120	3060760	I didn't know his reputation on DDR in the past, what he's done.
3060760	3064600	As much as I had my reputation, although my group of people were not the best at it, we
3064600	3066760	were more of the comedy group of doing that.
3066760	3070720	So we made our stuff known as of just doing, we also did our own little videos.
3070720	3075120	We had a group called Teamscape and we did our own little videos and it's just nothing
3075120	3076120	to be taken seriously.
3076120	3079320	It's just to listen to our corny jokes and such, but we actually just traveled around
3079320	3080840	and met the high round players.
3080840	3085960	I also do a little bit of Street Fighter, fighter games all around, first person shooters.
3085960	3088400	I'm very versatile with video games and I like it.
3088400	3090940	Okay, very cool.
3090940	3094000	So are you excited for the new Smash Brothers that's coming?
3094000	3095000	Definitely, yes.
3095000	3096000	On 3DS?
3096000	3097000	Yes, yes, definitely.
3097000	3100400	Are you as pissed as I am that they still haven't revealed Ness as a character?
3100680	3103680	I'm pretty anxious to see what's going on with all that stuff.
3103680	3108360	Alright, because that's the one thing where I saw this great picture on Tumblr last week
3108360	3113320	where it says, it's just a big picture of Ness and it says, I've got that summertime,
3113320	3119880	summertime sadness because he still hasn't been announced as a character.
3119880	3122920	Oh right, I know, and he's been in all the games.
3122920	3127920	Yeah, he's a mainstay, but it's like how much do you freaking hate the Mother series, Nintendo?
3127920	3128920	It's amazing.
3129440	3132920	But it's like Nintendo just kicks it in the face every chance they get.
3132920	3135400	They just don't see good games with good characters in them.
3135400	3139280	They just don't understand Mother or online.
3139280	3141320	Fair enough, fair enough.
3141320	3144640	So what do people, we asked Jonas this a little bit, but from your perspective, what do people
3144640	3148120	have to look forward to at SacAnime from the teabaggers?
3148120	3153760	We are, we're always having different versions of games and such, we go from retro to the
3153760	3160280	latest console games that we have up to date, PS4 and Xbox One, Putting in Killer Instinct,
3160280	3162680	which has already been showed off through us.
3162680	3168120	We are hosting a pretty big event on Saturday night where they're allowing us to rent out
3168120	3171280	the rooms at the bottom where the pre-registration is.
3171280	3174400	And for that night, that Saturday night, we're going to do a couple of tournaments there
3174400	3175840	for the main events.
3175840	3178760	And one of the big ones will be definitely Mario Kart 8.
3178760	3181180	Oh nice, alright.
3181220	3184260	So yeah, because Mario Kart 8 hasn't been out, we were just mentioning it hasn't been
3184260	3188220	out long enough to really be at every single con yet, so this will be kind of probably
3188220	3190340	at the first big, big, big tournament for it.
3190340	3191340	It'll be fun.
3191340	3194700	I've dabbled with it a little bit, including at GamerX, and it is a fun game.
3194700	3196380	It is definitely a fun game.
3196380	3198060	People are liking it a lot.
3198060	3202140	And what we want to do after seeing examples through other conventions that have done it
3202140	3205700	a little bit, like we said, it hasn't been gone all the way around yet on certain conventions
3205700	3210780	or places, is we're going to try and make it a really big event, fill up this room,
3210780	3213900	get the crowd hyped, and livestream it.
3213900	3214900	Nice.
3214900	3218780	I'm going to ask you a crazy question, because I asked Jonas a crazy question about like
3218780	3220580	people that steal shit.
3220580	3223660	So I'll ask you this, and I don't even know if this is something that happens or not,
3223660	3226420	but have you ever seen a fight break out in your game room?
3226420	3227660	I've heard.
3227660	3228660	You've heard?
3228660	3229660	I've heard.
3229660	3230700	Alright, well tell us second hand what happened.
3230700	3236140	I've heard of little things, but it was a, I guess it didn't escalate that much, but
3236140	3242300	there have been cases of like maybe a splashing of water on something, but other than that,
3242300	3246500	that was probably like personal business between two people, but it was squashed very quickly,
3246500	3247980	it was taken out of the game room.
3247980	3249540	Okay, that's good.
3249540	3253980	Nothing escalated to draw a riot or something, which would have been really bad, because
3253980	3255860	we've had tie quarters a couple of times.
3255860	3256860	Yeah, yeah.
3256860	3259380	Well I was just curious, like if somebody gets way into the game and they're just like,
3259380	3263340	you know, like, you're a fucking cheater, da da da, and just like, you know, just try
3263340	3264700	to throw a punch or something.
3264700	3268620	Well, besides punching and all that, which usually doesn't seem, but as saying you're
3268620	3271660	a cheater and getting mad at a game, that's every day for a gamer.
3271660	3272660	That is true.
3272660	3274340	They get mad at every game.
3274340	3276060	Like I remember just playing Mega Man back in the day.
3276060	3277060	That almost ruined my childhood.
3277060	3283020	Like, oh my God, I can remember Mega Man 2, yeah, that really was giving me some early
3283020	3284020	gray hairs.
3284020	3289300	I was trying to get through like quick man stage, oh Jesus Christ, that just, oh wow.
3289300	3294460	Yeah that, like examples of that, of a frustration, I can see someone's frustration and practically
3294460	3298620	making me myself, like getting frustrated at such a game that I want to throw the controller
3298620	3300040	right at the damn TV.
3300040	3303580	Which is why nobody buys a Wii U, because those controllers are, you don't want to throw
3303580	3304580	those.
3304580	3305580	Right, exactly.
3305580	3306580	It's very bad, very bad idea.
3306580	3307580	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
3307580	3308580	All right.
3308580	3309580	Well, Diego, stay with us.
3309580	3312340	That's why they make those like Nerf armor things for us.
3312340	3313340	Oh yeah, right?
3313340	3314340	Right?
3314340	3315500	Nerf is Nerf or nothing.
3315500	3318260	Stay with us, we're running a little long tonight, but we're going to get to some gaming
3318260	3319260	news.
3319260	3323900	Feel free to comment on any news you want to, and good luck with SacAnime and everything
3323900	3324900	you have coming up.
3324900	3325900	It's a pleasure to be here, yeah.
3325900	3326900	Yeah, fantastic.
3326900	3327900	Good.
3327900	3328900	Glad to have you here.
3328900	3329900	You missed us earlier, unfortunately.
3329900	3332860	We're reminiscing about the good days of DDR and all that stuff, so unfortunately you missed
3332860	3333860	all that fun stuff, but.
3333860	3336700	I would just say that actually I don't have a history on DDR.
3336700	3339860	Oh, I thought, oh, because of Paradise Island and all this stuff, I thought you did.
3339860	3344020	No, actually that's definitely a rhythm music game that I've never really gotten into, sadly.
3344020	3346060	I love watching it, but I'm not into that game.
3346060	3350980	All right, well then you didn't miss shit, all right.
3350980	3353300	We need to get into some gaming news though, we're running a little long.
3353300	3354740	So I do want to keep things moving.
3354740	3356300	Really quick, some housekeeping.
3356300	3359460	Be sure to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and we're on Facebook as well,
3359460	3361440	facebook.com slash OrangeLunchRadio.
3361440	3365800	We will still be here every week with new shows, but Labor Day weekend, we will not
3365800	3366940	be here.
3366940	3368860	There's just a whole lot going on that weekend.
3368860	3372260	Obviously we've got SacAnime, right, and Dark Soccer is going to be going over to SacAnime.
3372260	3376180	I'm actually at DragonCon in Atlanta, so for those of you guys out there who are going
3376180	3378700	to be at DragonCon in Atlanta, don't forget Voice Geeks Network.
3378700	3382520	Going to be showing up on a few panels throughout the weekend, most notably Monday morning.
3382520	3384640	There will be a VOG Network panel.
3384640	3386840	More details on that as the date gets closer.
3386840	3390160	But because of all the shenanigans, Labor Day weekend, and I'm sure you guys have your
3390160	3394440	own things you participate in too out there in the listening world, we will have no show
3394440	3395700	live that Sunday.
3395700	3400400	So just be prepared for that, those of you guys that rely on us to get through your Monday
3400400	3401400	work day.
3401400	3403000	But the good news is, it's Labor Day weekend.
3403000	3405160	There is no Monday work day, woohoo.
3405160	3409520	All right, let's get into some gaming news and let's talk about it.
3409520	3412520	It's been a bit of a slower week, but as I was mentioning during Bobby's show, there's
3412520	3415600	a few big tent poles, big, big things going on, right, Loki?
3415600	3419460	Yes, one of those being EA's Access program.
3419460	3423120	It's kind of an expansion on what they used to do before, I forget what they, I think
3423120	3427640	they actually called their last program like Early Access or something, where they used
3427640	3433800	to give you early access to like different games right before they came out.
3433800	3437320	Like I remember one of the titles that they were advertising was like Madden, where you
3437320	3441400	could play it five days before there was street data on it, but you'd have to pay a
3441400	3445360	fee and then at the street data, that's when it deactivates.
3445360	3448080	So it's like, oh, you get hyped about this game and you get to play it before it comes
3448080	3449360	out and that kind of stuff.
3449360	3451140	But now this new thing is a little bit different.
3451140	3458400	It's actually gonna give you access on the Xbox One to the back catalog of EA games,
3458400	3461200	which on the Xbox One isn't that deep right now.
3461200	3463360	It's just a couple games.
3463360	3469040	But five bucks per month or $30 per year, which seems pretty reasonable, it gets you
3469040	3475540	access to right now Battlefield 4, Pagle 2, FIFA 14, and Madden 25.
3475540	3480920	And then it says apparently they're gonna be adding to the game's selection as time
3480920	3481920	goes on.
3481920	3488520	Also, it's gonna give you 10% discounts off of all EA digital Xbox One content.
3488520	3495580	And they're saying that you're gonna get access to EA, big EA releases up to five days
3495580	3499040	prior to their official debut, much like they were doing before.
3499040	3501480	So a little bit, kind of an update on that.
3501480	3509760	And then also one of the, I guess, a limited trial game, they're saying early access to
3509760	3510820	some of this.
3510820	3513800	One of the games that's not available, I guess, is Titanfall.
3513800	3518320	It's excluded from all EA access features.
3518320	3520520	So that's kind of weird.
3520520	3525920	They did say, though, that Xbox Live Gold is not required to participate in this.
3525920	3530500	But of course, if you wanna play online, then yes, you do need Xbox Live Gold.
3530500	3533680	But as of right now, it's only on Xbox One.
3533680	3538120	And apparently Sony was saying, okay, they were offered this as well, but they didn't
3538120	3544000	think it was a good value for the consumer, which, let's be honest, that's just kind of
3544000	3545480	a bunch of bullshit.
3545480	3550400	It's more of, hey, they were offering a service that had, I mean, a couple of things.
3550400	3554200	I could see the positives and negatives, but I think the negative for them was, hey, we've
3554200	3558960	got this PlayStation Now service that we're trying to get people to buy four hours of
3558960	3566800	gameplay for $4 or whatever, and we don't want some of the paid $5 to get access to
3566800	3567800	multiple games.
3567800	3568800	Or even PlayStation Plus.
3568800	3572120	I didn't even really consider the PlayStation Now, I just thought that it was more competitive
3572120	3573120	for PlayStation Plus.
3573120	3577080	Although to be fair, Games for Gold or whatever does the same thing now.
3577080	3581600	And PlayStation Plus also, they probably don't want the set president with, oh hey, we're
3581600	3586740	gonna have all these different publishers offering these free trials for $5 for back
3586740	3587740	catalog tiles and stuff.
3587740	3591560	But you know, to be honest, I don't see the problem with it.
3591560	3597280	I think it would be a good idea to offer this stuff, and everybody wants, like with cable
3597280	3599620	and stuff, they want all the cart stuff.
3599620	3603500	And that's kind of the problem where the consumers are gonna start to, I think, lose
3603500	3607860	a little bit, is it really reminds me of when Warner Brothers pulled all their movies from
3607860	3611360	Netflix because they wanted to do their own service.
3611360	3615700	And you can guarantee, I'll guarantee you, you'll never see an EA game for free on PlayStation
3615700	3616700	Plus again.
3616700	3618340	Which, I don't think we've even seen.
3618340	3621660	Wasn't Mass Effect 3 a game at one point?
3621660	3623820	I think it was at one point, Mass Effect 3 was something.
3623820	3627700	But yeah, EA does, I don't know, but yeah, I would imagine that you're not gonna see
3627700	3631340	any of these games free on any of these services.
3631340	3634180	I just, it's really not worth it, to be honest.
3634180	3638860	Now, well yeah, and for me, I'm not a huge sports games fan, so right there, that eliminates
3638860	3640580	half the titles.
3640580	3646060	And so it's just, okay, Pagel 2, which I don't need to play that for free, and Battlefield
3646060	3650880	4, which, let's be honest, we're getting to almost that game being out for a year now.
3650880	3655440	It's gonna drop in price eventually, or hell, if I haven't played it by now, I can rent
3655440	3658100	it or buy it used or something like that.
3658100	3662000	And they're thinking maybe that because it's $30 a year or something, that's gonna cut
3662000	3666920	in the used game sales, maybe so that people are less likely to want to buy used games
3666920	3668880	from EA or something, I don't know.
3668880	3674160	It might be worth it if there was a richer back catalog, especially, and it is kind of
3674160	3679200	a bummer it didn't work out with Sony, because maybe via PlayStation Now you could get access
3679200	3685360	to EA's entire PlayStation 1, 2, and 3 back catalog, which would be pretty fucking impressive.
3685360	3687240	Or it might be way more worth it.
3687240	3691820	Or even like on the Xbox 360, it would have been nice to be able to play like SSX or,
3691820	3698640	you know, anything like Battlefield 2 or, I don't know, they have a lot of the Mass
3698640	3700880	Effect games, you know, all that stuff.
3700880	3701880	That would have been worth it.
3701880	3702880	Dragon Age.
3702880	3708160	Yeah, that would have been more worth it to me, but right now, I mean, just play Madden
3708160	3714120	or FIFA, which I don't give a shit about, or Battlefield 4 and Pagel.
3714120	3719400	I mean, it's like, fuck, Pagel is pretty cheap anyways, and why would I, it just doesn't
3719400	3720400	seem worth it right now.
3720400	3722740	So obviously this is in the hands of consumers.
3722740	3724200	If you like it, get it.
3724200	3729640	If you don't like it, don't get it, you know, and that's ultimately how well this does will
3729640	3734420	have a huge impact, but the only precedent that could be set here is that if it works
3734420	3741100	for EA, then Ubisoft's gonna want one, Activision's gonna want one, and let's remember, let's
3741100	3746180	flash back a little bit, it wasn't that long ago that EA came up with a crazy idea to do
3746180	3751460	these online passes, because they think that you should pay extra money for your used games,
3751460	3755220	because they have to run those servers and stuff, and there's gonna be somehow more people
3755220	3757940	on the servers with the same amount of games.
3757940	3760740	And so this is kind of along the lines of that.
3760740	3765220	So if this works out for EA, Ubisoft's probably gonna jump in and do this kind of thing, and
3765220	3769780	I'm trying to think of who also had online passes, Deep Silver maybe, I don't know, but
3769780	3773460	THQ used to do that, Deep Silver's kind of got rid of that stuff.
3773460	3778780	I'm going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, as a person who buys an EA
3778780	3782100	sports game every year, NHL, I don't really have a need for this service.
3782100	3786500	I sadly still own all the previous NHL games for, if I ever wanted to play it, many of
3786500	3788180	the free games they're offering.
3788180	3792540	I don't, I also never really jumped on the early access ploy because I work so much and
3792540	3796540	I don't really have time to play things day of or morning of anymore, but for the person
3796540	3799220	who has time to, I can see it being worth it.
3799220	3801140	But ultimately the catalog is small right now.
3801140	3804340	I'm sure they will expand it.
3804340	3809500	If it was take two though, a rockstar game, I'd probably have to do that.
3809500	3814980	I just, it's, it's going to be very difficult if everybody wants to do their own.
3814980	3819620	That's why I kind of like that PlayStation has kind of their own PlayStation plus and
3819620	3824180	you know, Xbox has their games for gold, but I also understand where maybe the publishers,
3824180	3826180	they want their own piece of the pie.
3826180	3831620	So we have to kind of find that happy medium somewhere, you know, like how can publishers
3831620	3835860	get the amount that they feel they're entitled to, but yet the consumers don't get screwed
3835860	3838980	with having to subscribe to all these different services because everybody will lose in that
3838980	3839980	scenario.
3839980	3846300	Honestly, I mean, if I, if you're looking to, maybe if you're looking to purchase one
3846300	3851580	of these titles, like say you were interested in buying battlefield four, then yeah, maybe
3851580	3855300	it's worth it to do this because you're going to get it for probably cheaper than battlefield
3855300	3857540	four sold for right now.
3857540	3860420	And then you get access to some more games for like at least a year.
3860420	3862780	So it might be worth it to try that.
3862780	3865180	Um, I don't know.
3865180	3868820	It's not that much of an investment, but yeah, I don't like the precedent that it's, that's
3868820	3874020	because, uh, they whore the crap out of their games with like, you know, DLC and stuff.
3874020	3876100	And so I, I don't know.
3876100	3877100	All right.
3877100	3879460	Well, uh, very curious to see what you guys think of this.
3879460	3882060	I wouldn't know if anybody actually signed up for the program because this is available
3882060	3883060	now.
3883060	3884060	Right.
3884060	3885060	So you can actually sign up for it now.
3885820	3886820	Yeah.
3886820	3887820	I want to know if anybody's actually, uh, got in on this.
3887820	3892020	So let us know in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com or you can always email us participate at orange
3892020	3893860	lounge, radio.com.
3893860	3897140	Moving on to another story that came out this week, um, about a convention we've been talking
3897140	3898140	an awful lot about.
3898140	3901220	Um, just, you know, cause dark soccer and I went a couple of weeks ago, had a panel
3901220	3902220	there.
3902220	3904360	Uh, we're just talking about it with Jonas and Diego a little bit of a go, but gamer
3904360	3909100	X to, um, a little bit of fallout from that convention, unfortunately that, uh, was, was
3909100	3912900	a little bit of drama this week, but I have to mention it cause it was kind of big news.
3912940	3918380	Um, NIS America reached out to founder Matt Kahn to basically say, sorry, but that pledge
3918380	3922380	of $3,000 that we'd promised you for the con, we're not going to be able to give it to you.
3922380	3926740	Um, through, you know, I, I don't want to get too much into the details because the
3926740	3934140	epilogue to this is they work their shit out, but, uh, it still was, it was pretty big deal
3934140	3937900	because Matt actually posted the email on his Twitter.
3937900	3942500	Not everybody thought that was the most professional thing to do in the world, which in retrospect,
3942500	3944060	it probably wasn't.
3944060	3948180	But taking a step back at everything, I can see where Matt was probably incredibly frustrated
3948180	3952700	because I know he went into debt over this convention and in his, his group collectively,
3952700	3955940	I don't want to just keep saying Matt, Matt, Matt, but his group collectively, you know,
3955940	3961160	they, they spent a lot of money on that con and the hotel was not a cheap place and they
3961160	3963580	ended up, you know, going into the hole because of this.
3963580	3968580	So and from what I understand, they tried to get a ton of corporate sponsorships and
3968580	3970860	some of the companies, some companies were really cool about it.
3970860	3972540	Like 2k Ubisoft showed up, right?
3972540	3973540	Did their thing.
3973540	3974540	EA went to the first year.
3974540	3975540	Right.
3975540	3976540	Very cool.
3976540	3979220	But my understanding is some companies straight up like laughed in their face when they tried
3979220	3980980	to pitch gamer X, these companies.
3980980	3985820	So I can understand where Matt probably gets really frustrated with, Oh, so I'm going in
3985820	3989740	debt over this and these companies don't even take it seriously.
3989740	3991660	And now I'm just going to get screwed out of $3,000.
3991660	3994860	So probably that whole posting it on Twitter and shit was just out of frustration.
3994860	3997120	Like I just, I hit my breaking point, right?
3997120	4002440	So obviously in retrospect, he realized that was a bad thing to do.
4002440	4007240	And I, as America realized that maybe the way they communicated that message or how
4007240	4011880	they even got to that point in the first place probably wasn't a good thing because the epilogue
4011880	4012880	is.
4012880	4016360	And I asked, they, they, they had a lunch meeting and work their shit out and ass is
4016360	4018240	going to make good on their money.
4018240	4021080	Everybody's hugging it out and that's all good.
4021080	4025560	An interesting thing that came of this though, a very interesting, like,
4025960	4026960	So like, okay.
4026960	4028440	I mean, I don't know what the agreement was.
4028440	4032440	If they were just going to give them money for the hell of it or were they like advertising
4032440	4034640	their games at the con?
4034640	4039160	They were a sponsor because I remember one of the drinks you could get was a pretty bomb,
4039160	4040800	which is obviously a Disgaea reference.
4040800	4042480	Well, that's kind of messed up though.
4042480	4047400	If they have like their stuff there and then they're, Oh, by the way, we don't, we'll take
4047400	4048400	a free advertisement.
4048400	4049400	I thought it was weird.
4049400	4053920	They didn't have to pay upfront, but you know what I, I've never organized a con, so I don't
4053920	4057720	know how these agreements work and maybe it's just one of those things where it was like,
4057720	4062680	we can give you the money on XYZ day, usually, but usually it is upfront because I know like
4062680	4066200	a lot of co-op stuff, especially when you're doing events and stuff that you get the money
4066200	4067200	up front.
4067200	4071660	If, if you get companies straight up laughing you out the door and then this company says,
4071660	4077080	we can get you the money on this day, if you'll, if you'll put us in in advance, probably didn't
4077080	4078080	want to turn that down.
4078080	4079240	And it's like, I kind of get it.
4079240	4083280	Like maybe in retrospect, of course, everything sounds like boy would, I shouldn't have done
4083280	4084280	that.
4084280	4088240	But I mean, in the moment, if you're desperate con or no con, or I'm going to go into debt,
4088240	4092220	like you probably agreed to it again, but I didn't make that deal.
4092220	4093440	I wasn't there.
4093440	4098880	So I can't, I don't want to make it up, you know, so it is what it is.
4098880	4101080	But here's the interesting side effect that happened.
4101080	4107240	So in that 24 hour period between they sent the letter to Matt, Matt posted on Twitter
4107240	4108780	and they hug it out.
4108780	4113420	There's obviously that period of what the fuck NIS and all this stuff, right?
4113420	4118940	Devolver Digital sent out a tweet, which is interesting because Devolver Digital don't
4118940	4121740	remember seeing them at gamer X one or two, but it's very cool.
4121740	4123700	I'm not, not shading them or anything.
4123700	4128060	It's just very interesting that now Devolver Digital literally comes out of nowhere and
4128060	4135560	says, we pledged $3,000, the amount that NIS was, was supposedly failed to pay.
4135560	4142440	We pledged $3,000 for a 2015 gamer X sponsorship and challenge other game companies that have
4142440	4145220	the means to do so the same.
4145220	4148040	Four other indie developers stepped up and said, we'll do it.
4148040	4151740	And I don't have the list in front of me, but I think the makers of Thomas was alone
4151740	4152740	was one of them.
4152740	4153820	So there's a few others.
4153820	4159380	So because of this unfortunate situation, even though they've said, we're not going
4159380	4161660	to do a gamer X three, we've gone into debt, dah, dah, dah, dah.
4161660	4169260	Now they've already raised $15,000 without essentially having to do anything weird, right?
4169260	4171100	You guys haven't heard of this at all, huh?
4171100	4172500	This is news to us right now.
4172500	4176900	So, well, that's, we usually don't deliver news on this show, but there you go.
4176900	4179160	But yeah, but weird how that worked out, right?
4179160	4184180	So it now it's like maybe gamer X three will happen after all, because all of a sudden
4184180	4188100	these people are literally coming out from behind the curtain saying, you know what?
4188100	4190220	This is a great con that you guys are doing.
4190220	4191220	And you know, it's true.
4191220	4193060	Like we were getting feedback from that as well.
4193060	4196060	They said they, a lot of people were feeling kind of sad because they felt like, oh, it's
4196060	4197500	dying and it's not coming back.
4197500	4200420	And he said, it must be a way to revive this.
4200420	4202460	There must be a way for it to go on.
4202460	4205700	And as you were talking about the drama and so forth about what was going on, people getting
4205700	4208180	screwed over and sponsorships and stuff.
4208180	4212100	And Jonas was relaying this to me to also kind of telling me to like, keep it to myself
4212100	4216220	at the time, but to show that, yeah, it looks like they really just got screwed over and
4216220	4220860	just, just either way, because of all the things that all the people who promise certain
4220860	4225580	things and we're back down and said, and then I, in my mind, I can see, I can see why they
4225580	4226580	can't do this again.
4226580	4230660	I know that you're out of all these problems, but knowing this now, um, it just feels like
4230660	4232820	the name itself needs to go on.
4232820	4233820	Right.
4233820	4237180	Well, well, ironically there, they might change that and they've talked about how they probably
4237180	4238780	aren't going to call it gamer X next time.
4238780	4240380	They're probably going to call it something else.
4240380	4244100	And there have been tweets going out from the gamer X account this week, like, so what
4244100	4245700	if we moved it out of San Francisco?
4245700	4246700	What would you guys think?
4246700	4249700	Which I think a lot of people are like, yes, move it out of San Francisco.
4249700	4250700	It's too fucking expensive.
4250700	4251860	They're move it, move it, move it.
4251860	4255980	I think a lot of people are saying that, um, but then they're also saying, what should
4255980	4257180	we call it?
4257180	4262020	Because I think they want to get away from being a gay expo where they want it to be
4262020	4269500	really about the Sacramento so I can go cause I can't, a lot of people drove from soccer.
4269500	4270500	I was shocked.
4270500	4271820	How many people from SACRA at that?
4271820	4275580	I'm just saying, you know, cause the teabaggers are there.
4275580	4276580	Yeah.
4276580	4281100	I, I, well shit, I need to go to like, you know, SAC anime because I haven't, you know,
4281100	4285180	gone since it was that was the Radisson early, but I, that sounds about right.
4285180	4289980	I suggested San Jose and or anywhere along that line between, you know, anywhere in the
4289980	4294940	Bay there between, you know, down the one to one or the two 80 between, you know, near
4294940	4298180	SFO airport even or somewhere is going to be cheaper than in the city.
4298180	4303100	Um, let me put it into a little bit, maybe be possible, maybe for like an area like San
4303100	4309100	Mateo, maybe because I'm not sure who, who are all, all part of the gamer X know about
4309100	4314620	yaoi con as well, which has some of the members of the other LGBT community actually being
4314620	4315620	there too.
4315620	4316620	Right.
4316620	4320780	So yeah, it's just a suggestion of San Mateo being made possibly cheaper compared to like
4320780	4324300	San Jose, which could be extremely expensive as well.
4324300	4328620	So I, I, I'm thinking they're going to move it if they do it in another year and they're
4328620	4331740	probably going to put the feelers out there like, okay, what can $15,000 get us?
4331740	4335620	You know, and how much, you know, so, so they might, it might happen, uh, so it'd be interesting,
4335620	4337340	but then it's going to probably have a new name.
4337340	4339100	They also were tweeting, what should the new name be?
4339100	4341780	And this is funny because I tweeted back and I said, why don't you just call it?
4341780	4343240	Because the thing is everybody games, right?
4343240	4344740	So call it everybody games expo.
4344740	4346380	I think that'd be a great name, right?
4346380	4347380	E G X.
4347380	4348380	I said, there you go.
4348380	4349380	There's your name.
4349380	4350380	Well, here's the hilarious thing.
4350380	4353100	I got a tweet just randomly, I guess somebody that was searching names or whatever.
4353100	4357260	So somebody that represents Eurogamer expo tweeted me saying, Hey, we really want to
4357260	4359300	see this happen, but please don't take our name.
4359300	4360820	And I was like, Oh fuck, that's right.
4360820	4366340	Eurogamer expo is EGX whoops, but still, you know, they, they'll, they can, they can massage
4366340	4367340	that idea or whatever.
4367340	4368340	EGX or whatever.
4368340	4369340	Yeah.
4369340	4370340	Or EGE or something.
4370340	4375620	Anyway, who doesn't want to, they could do EDGE.
4375620	4376620	Everybody wants to edge.
4376620	4377620	All right.
4377620	4378620	What?
4378620	4379620	How about everybody expo?
4379620	4380620	E V E.
4380620	4381620	Eve.
4381620	4382620	Eve.
4383140	4388380	And you're going to get sued by the folks that do Eve online because, Oh God, here we
4388380	4389380	go.
4389380	4390380	All right.
4390380	4394460	Just call it, um, no name con.
4394460	4395460	That's it.
4395460	4396460	No name con.
4396460	4397460	That's it.
4397460	4398460	How about dash con?
4398460	4399460	Does anybody use that?
4399460	4400460	All right.
4400460	4401460	I vote for redacted.
4401460	4406780	Why don't they just, why don't they just call it donkey con, but I'm going to see none of
4406780	4407780	these names.
4407780	4411020	Unfortunately give that whole like, Oh, this isn't everybody open type of con.
4411020	4412020	I don't know.
4412420	4413420	Inclusive con.
4413420	4414420	Overshare con.
4414420	4415420	Registration con.
4415420	4416420	Gay rave con.
4416420	4417420	All right.
4417420	4418420	Everybody fart con.
4418420	4419420	Be quiet.
4419420	4420420	All right.
4420420	4422420	The chat room was still going on that by the way.
4422420	4423420	I know.
4423420	4424420	That's why I said that.
4424420	4430020	Anyway, so look, in all seriousness, uh, I best of luck to, you know, I'm, I'm glad they
4430020	4432780	resolved their shit within 24 hours of the NAS America.
4432780	4438620	And it's really weird how despite the unprofessionalism of NAS America and then the unprofessionalism
4438620	4444700	of, of gamer X and posting that out there, that yet something good came out of that possibly
4444700	4447020	like really fucking good came out of that possibly.
4447020	4449860	Um, I'm, I'm very interested to see what develops.
4449860	4451420	Can they just call it con?
4451420	4452420	No.
4452420	4453420	Be quiet.
4453420	4454420	All right.
4454420	4455420	Anyhow.
4455420	4461620	Akuma JP says donkey Kong only for the hung.
4461620	4462620	Wow.
4462620	4463620	Stop it.
4463620	4464620	There you go.
4464620	4466540	He is going on the right road.
4466540	4474180	Brad says, call it VOD con if I, if I had, if, if I had $3,000 to contribute to, I would
4474180	4480060	love to, but I did, I bought VIP tickets or had about a little more money than, than the
4480060	4481060	average bear.
4481060	4482420	Here's a question though.
4482420	4484900	I know you've said about $15,000.
4484900	4488660	What about the potential kickstart of what they were using?
4488660	4493060	Like in the past, wouldn't that be additional revenue to that's, that's a decision for somebody
4493060	4494060	else to make.
4494060	4496580	I mean, but believe me, they're considering all this shit.
4496580	4497580	I'm sure.
4497580	4498580	Yeah.
4498580	4502300	So I do agree on the fact that you said about, it should leave San Francisco cause it is
4502300	4506220	expensive there, but not, not straight away too far, but you know, it's still like somewhere
4506220	4507220	on the Bart line.
4507220	4508220	Right.
4508220	4509220	And the San Francisco people can still go.
4509220	4512140	You know, like, like Jonas said about maybe San Mateo, because as we've seen the yaoi cons
4512140	4514860	move around throughout the time, cause we staff there as well.
4514860	4519580	Uh, it's still kept it in a good spot in the bear that was not too far away from San Francisco.
4519580	4520580	You're right.
4520580	4521580	Keep it through the Bart lines.
4521580	4523380	Uh, but yeah, and that changed as well.
4523380	4528700	And even though it'll probably go under a new ownership or whatever or whatnot, that
4528700	4532260	to the point that, uh, it doesn't change too drastically to the point where it's completely
4532260	4536980	changed itself in like inner wise, besides maybe the name and such forth, like you're
4536980	4542140	saying that, that some fans want to see it a bit the same way as it was before, but not
4542140	4544860	an entirely drastic change, right.
4544860	4548700	But I'm just saying as an opinion, as in a fan that they might see that maybe it changed
4548700	4551300	too much or so forth, I don't know.
4551300	4555700	I, I, they've got a lot of really tough decisions to make really fast just when they thought
4555700	4560080	they were getting a break from con planning, but, um, I guess a unfortunate side effect
4560080	4562740	of being really popular and well liked in the community.
4562740	4563740	So there you go.
4563740	4564740	All right.
4564740	4567700	Well, anyhow, we got more news to get to, so let's, uh, let's keep moving.
4567700	4572300	Pina con, con Lada, really?
4572300	4574580	This is better than fart con.
4574580	4576140	It feels like they're going off that YouTube video.
4576140	4577140	What was it?
4577140	4578140	Uh, Oh yeah.
4578140	4579140	The, the, what was it?
4580140	4584300	Sorry, we can't hear Jonas cause he's not my power thirst about the gay power thirst
4584300	4585620	where they said penis colada.
4585620	4586620	Yeah.
4586620	4587620	There you go.
4587620	4588620	There's so much references in there.
4588620	4591580	Don't forget my favorite flavor gun.
4591580	4592580	New topic.
4592580	4595100	It's a Brown icon or something.
4595100	4596100	All right.
4596100	4597100	All right.
4597100	4598100	I'll just stop right there.
4598100	4599100	Yeah.
4599100	4600100	I'll just stop right there.
4600100	4601100	Anyway.
4601100	4604940	EA is doing some crap.
4604940	4605940	How's that for news?
4605940	4607940	EA is fucking up.
4607940	4608940	No, I'm kidding.
4608940	4611900	Um, they actually are shutting down Ultima forever.
4611900	4615020	It will be closed down by the end of August.
4615020	4622160	It was the spiritual successor to Ultima for, um, it was a mobile title, had the stupid
4622160	4624180	transaction crap going on.
4624180	4626820	Um, it's, they're shutting it down on August 29th.
4626820	4632700	Can we, I was going to say, can we sue them for false advertisement?
4632700	4637680	Durr wamp wamp.
4637680	4639160	It's not really forever.
4639160	4642000	Um, I have a great respect for the Ultima series.
4642000	4646340	Like I loved it on the NES and in the Commodore days and the old computers and so forth and
4646340	4651040	all that being said, good fucking re riddance to this trash cause that game was awful.
4651040	4654160	So they also shut down Lord of Ultima.
4654160	4660920	Well, the Ultima did not translate well to a mobile at all and uh, that I don't think
4660920	4666320	that was Ultima's fault as much as it was the, um, uh, fault of, uh, the game design
4666320	4670280	behind it and what, you know, EA was doing with their mobile games cause they've done
4670280	4672880	it in other games that haven't done well.
4672880	4675720	Fifth dream colon con.
4675720	4676720	Stop it.
4676720	4685000	And I just said what I was thinking Ultima not forever for the record fifth dream Decepticon
4685000	4688280	I do believe already exists as there is a Decepticon.
4688280	4693440	Yeah, of course there's also botcon and the other major transformers conventions.
4693440	4694760	All right, moving on.
4694760	4695760	Uh, Loki.
4695760	4706320	Do they have like conjugate as like a, like a grammar con anyways, I'd go, uh, Nintendo
4706320	4713880	unfortunately has posted $97 million as a loss, um, for the last quarter.
4713880	4717840	Fortunately Mario Kart eight, it did great, but it just wasn't enough.
4717840	4721360	And um, you know, they had a great attachment rate against, they're saying almost 3 million
4721360	4727640	units, um, were shipped by the end of June and you know, definitely people are buying
4727640	4728640	the title.
4728640	4731400	It's just, what else did they have come out?
4731400	4732720	I mean, not a lot else.
4732720	4736720	I mean, just wasn't, wasn't enough.
4736720	4740800	Of course, um, probably should be a little bit better through the fourth quarter.
4740800	4746600	I know they've got like a lot more games expected out and um, hopefully that sells more units.
4746600	4748440	Smash Brothers should help.
4748440	4751120	Definitely that's the, just that, that, that's a name that will go on.
4751120	4752120	Definitely.
4752120	4756680	But I mean, I understand that it's just, you know, the average mom and pop consumer, you
4756680	4763320	know, I don't know, but their kids will, they need, no one really helped the Wii or the
4763320	4765000	Wii U or both Zelda.
4765000	4771640	Well, Zelda, yes, but a legitimate Pokemon game on, I'm really surprised they haven't
4771640	4772640	gone there.
4772640	4778160	It's probably cause they haven't figured out how to be able to transfer data between 3ds
4778160	4779160	and the Wii U.
4779160	4780160	It can't be that hard.
4780160	4781160	It can't be that hard.
4781160	4782160	Do it through a Nintendo network.
4782160	4785160	Just like, just like online or DLC, it can't be that hard.
4785160	4786640	But yet for some reason, it escapes them.
4786640	4789440	They have that fucking cloud thing that people are paying for for the Pokemon now.
4789440	4793520	Cause I remember they treaded that with Pokemon revolution and then that didn't go so well.
4793520	4797320	But the reason the problem is right now is because don't they not have, their accounts
4797320	4802140	are tied to, um, they're not tied to your Nintendo account.
4802140	4804480	It's tied to your console, isn't it?
4804480	4805480	No, is it?
4805480	4809720	Um, so I think that's why they don't have a unified, you know, eShop account or anything
4809760	4811880	I feel like I've seen, can't, okay.
4811880	4818480	If the Wii can beam demos to your 3ds, then this technology cannot be that difficult for
4818480	4819480	the DS.
4819480	4822680	I mean, they, they both have a Bluetooth stuff in them, right?
4822680	4823680	That they could transmit data.
4823680	4824680	It can't be that hard.
4824680	4828240	I mean, I realized this is Nintendo, but it really can't be that hard.
4828240	4832360	Look, Mario Kart 8 kind of made us go, Oh, Nintendo really can do this shit.
4832360	4833360	Wow.
4833360	4834360	They probably already do.
4834360	4836360	They're just too afraid to actually test it out.
4836360	4837360	It might flop.
4837360	4838360	May.
4838360	4839360	Yeah, they can't.
4839360	4840360	They definitely do.
4840360	4841360	They can't afford to have a flop.
4841360	4842360	Actually.
4842360	4843360	Wait, wait.
4843360	4844360	The realization is completely obvious.
4844360	4846260	I can't believe I didn't even think about it.
4846260	4849040	You know why they haven't put a Pokemon game on the Wii U?
4849040	4852520	It's because they haven't manufactured the fucking amiibo characters that are going to
4852520	4854140	go along with it.
4854140	4858360	That is why they haven't put a Pokemon game on the Wii U because they're going to fucking
4858360	4860480	whore the shit out of that.
4860480	4866180	You think, you think Activision or Skylanders and Disney infinity, you know, horse those
4866180	4867180	characters.
4867180	4870180	You have not seen anything yet.
4870180	4872320	You have not seen anything yet.
4872320	4876860	The fans of those series, I mean, Skylanders, no one who knows who the fuck the Skylanders
4876860	4877860	are.
4877860	4881920	I mean, kids, I'm surprised that they attach themselves to like these brand new characters,
4881920	4887780	but Pokemon characters, all ages are going to eat that shit up because you got to collect
4887780	4888780	them all.
4888780	4890540	I mean, and they're going to buy all of them.
4890540	4891540	All right.
4891540	4892540	Well, here's Kaijuto in chat.
4892540	4897020	The reason why we don't have Pokemon on the Wii U is because the game is made for handheld.
4897020	4899240	That's why it's called Pocket Monsters.
4899240	4901020	It's a handheld game, not a console.
4901020	4902380	I like it where it is.
4902380	4905060	I understand that, but money talks.
4905060	4906060	You know what I mean?
4906060	4913780	Like, gee, the Pokemon stepped into a growth machine and now it's Pokemon in giant giant
4913780	4914780	world.
4914780	4917980	It's called Pocket Monsters because they collect them in Pokeballs, which fit in your fucking
4917980	4918980	pocket.
4918980	4919980	Done.
4919980	4920980	Yeah.
4920980	4923360	I'm like where, where there's a check, there's a way.
4923360	4924360	You know what I mean?
4924360	4926140	They'll, they'll figure out a way to retcon it in the story.
4926140	4931340	I do, I do appreciate the viewpoint though that, yeah, that's how Pokemon was certainly
4931340	4936140	born, but if Nintendo really needs the money and needs to do it, they could.
4936140	4938940	That's how they'll transfer data back and forth too is because they're going to have,
4938940	4944460	remember, the amiibo support for 3DS at some point, and that's how it's going to work.
4944460	4949940	That they will have a game that comes out on 3DS and on, you know, Wii U and it'll transfer
4949940	4954620	data back and forth just like they do with the 3DS versions right now and the DS versions
4954620	4955620	and all that fun stuff.
4956100	4957100	All right.
4957100	4958100	Let's move on.
4958100	4959100	Dark Sakura.
4959100	4960100	Oh, that's right.
4960100	4962100	Well, how about something about Killer Instinct?
4962100	4963100	Well.
4963100	4964100	Huh?
4964100	4967580	Oh, there was some discussion.
4967580	4971740	Killer Instinct is going to be having a retail release.
4971740	4977060	This is the Double Helix version, by the way, not the really awesome very first game as
4977060	4981020	we remember KI Gold from the N64.
4981020	4983740	They have this one that I have yet to touch.
4983860	4990620	Microsoft basically has put out the announcement that on September 23, Killer Instinct will
4990620	4997340	be available out to purchase a retail version, and it will come with the first season and
4997340	5004340	the season 2 TJ combo code for $19.99, which is a little bit better than the combo breaker
5004340	5005340	pack.
5005340	5006340	So.
5006340	5008740	There you go.
5008740	5013420	So this would be good for people that maybe don't get online all the time with their system
5013420	5016220	to be able to get the game, I guess.
5016220	5017220	Probably four.
5017220	5018220	Yeah.
5018220	5019220	It makes sense.
5019220	5023020	I mean, I think that maybe the just the online only thing didn't quite work out well for
5023020	5024020	them.
5024020	5028380	Is it also coming out holiday September, September 23rd close enough.
5028380	5031980	That might be the that might be the reason is so it can be something that shows up under
5031980	5035220	the Christmas tree or Hanukkah Bush or whatever it is.
5035220	5038060	Hanukkah Bush, probably.
5038060	5044460	I mean, that's still way, way early, even for Hanukkah and for Christmas.
5044460	5046460	This is basically like an afterthought.
5046460	5049060	I think we didn't get enough money out of this.
5049060	5052340	Let's put it out for the people who didn't want to do online purchases.
5052340	5053340	All right.
5053340	5056860	Well, let's talk about something that's coming a little bit sooner than September 23rd.
5056860	5059340	How about this week in retail?
5059340	5062780	Loki starting off with the U.S. release dates, really only two games this week, Sacred three
5062780	5067940	on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Ultra Street Fighter four on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5067940	5072860	The disc version, of course, because you could purchase the download a while ago.
5072860	5077180	So we're just in a drought until Labor Day, pretty much.
5077180	5078180	Right.
5078180	5079180	And like destiny.
5079180	5080180	Yeah.
5080180	5081180	Oh, there you go.
5081180	5086220	I guess it'll be a little while and it's going to be this is your time to catch up, people.
5086220	5088660	That's what this is.
5088660	5091780	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andereto at VOG Network
5091780	5092780	dot com.
5092780	5093780	Use the passphrase North.
5094620	5097740	Well, if you're in Japan, things are a little more exciting on the PlayStation three this
5097740	5098740	week.
5098740	5103620	Anyway, over in Japan, Lost Dimension Shin Hayarigami comes out this week as well.
5103620	5107380	And Ultra Street Fighter four gets its Japanese release this week.
5107380	5111420	So is that to look forward to on the Xbox 360, you can get Ultra Street Fighter four.
5111420	5115420	Should you actually be in Japan and have an Xbox 360 for the dozens of you out there with
5115420	5116420	one?
5116420	5118180	And then are you a unicorn?
5118180	5123700	And on the Wii U, Dragon Quest 10, the all in one package comes out this week because
5123700	5128940	over in Japan, they actually got Dragon Quest 10 on the Wii U, whereas here we're still
5128940	5129940	waiting.
5129940	5133180	Although I thought I heard something that's going to be a 3DS thing.
5133180	5134180	Do we touch on that?
5134180	5137740	I thought I heard somewhere around that, that it is going to end up make its way over here
5137740	5140440	at some point, which is exciting.
5140440	5145860	On the PlayStation Vita this week in Japan, Lost Dimension and Shin Hayarigami, which
5145860	5148300	were also on a PS3, are also out on Vita.
5148300	5149300	So that's pretty cool.
5149300	5150400	Some more stuff on the Vita.
5150400	5156900	And lastly, on the 3DS, Dragon Ball Heroes Ultimate Mission 2, Farming Simulator 14 Pocket
5156900	5164320	No. 2, Senran Kagura 2 Shinku comes out on 3DS, and Bravely Default for the sequel goes
5164320	5166460	into the Ultimate Hits edition.
5166460	5170400	Keep in mind, Bravely Default for the sequel is actually what we got over here as simply
5170400	5174540	Bravely Default, because I think Bravely Default for the sequel was an enhanced version of
5174540	5178540	the original game that they had out on Japan, so it's not like an actual sequel or anything
5178540	5179540	like that.
5179540	5185380	Not yet anyway, but I believe one is coming really soon in Japan, like this year.
5185380	5187580	So there you go, Japanese release dates.
5187580	5189740	How about the UK, Darusaka?
5189740	5190740	Only two things.
5190740	5192020	Well, sorry, three things.
5192020	5197940	On August 6th is Metrico for Vita and Road Not Taken for PlayStation 4.
5197940	5202540	And on the 8th, Ultra Street Fighter IV.
5202540	5208060	AkumaJP clarifying the Dragon Quest X question, AkumaJP says, next month, Dragon Quest X free
5208060	5213580	on new 3DS purchase, and since he's in Japan, that must be how they're pushing it forward
5213580	5214580	over there.
5214580	5215580	That's pretty cool.
5215580	5217660	I hope it makes its way over here, because I'd like to check it out.
5217660	5221580	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
5221580	5223580	But first, Loki.
5223580	5225580	Alright.
5225620	5232340	So this is kind of ridiculous, but apparently, the brand new game that was done by, was it
5232340	5237820	the guys that did the, what was it, Black Forest Games, they did the Gianna Sisters
5237820	5241780	remake, sequel, whatever you want to call that.
5241780	5248980	They had a brand new game called Diesel Stormers, and it was a kind of a dieselpunk action game.
5248980	5257780	They got a, I guess, a trademark, or their trademark blocked, because apparently, Diesel,
5257780	5261220	the fashion brand, had a problem with it.
5261220	5265260	They were saying that it's going to cause confusion.
5265260	5271740	So I don't know, it seems like there's no case, they said, in all probability, an understanding
5271740	5276460	will be reached as Black Forest has no intent to create clothing under the Diesel Stormers
5276460	5278100	brand in Diesel.
5278100	5282240	The Diesel part of Diesel Stormers refers to the liquid fuel of the same name, and not
5282240	5284440	a parody of the fashion brand.
5284440	5290940	So yeah, it's a little ridiculous, but you gotta love that trademark law and copyright
5290940	5292100	law.
5292100	5294580	I guess you gotta defend it in order to keep it.
5294580	5295580	I guess that's true.
5295580	5297460	It's a little ridiculous, though.
5297460	5299340	Do they sue gas stations, too?
5299340	5300340	I don't know.
5300340	5302340	But seriously, that's a little ridiculous.
5302340	5304340	What about that Vin guy?
5304340	5305340	Right?
5305340	5306340	Yeah.
5307220	5309900	Oh no, they settled with him out of court.
5309900	5315500	I completely forgot Diesel was even a fashion brand until they mentioned this lawsuit.
5315500	5317900	They're just tired of not being relevant anymore.
5317900	5322900	I only know because I might have underwear that says Diesel on it.
5322900	5324900	And clearly that's because of the liquid fuel, right?
5324900	5325900	Burn it, Rob.
5325900	5326900	Burn it and protest.
5326900	5327900	I'm a big fan of the game.
5327900	5328900	What can I say?
5328900	5329900	I'm very committed.
5329900	5330900	What?
5330900	5331900	What?
5332460	5333460	What?
5333460	5340860	If you put Diesel fuel on your underwear, you'd have underwear ception, Diesel ception.
5340860	5343140	You've got problems.
5343140	5346140	You hang out with me.
5346140	5347140	But how much longer?
5347140	5348140	Just kidding.
5348140	5349140	Bitch, please.
5349140	5353380	You should have seen the way her face changed when I said that.
5353380	5354380	All right.
5354380	5355700	The chat room's going with you.
5355700	5356820	Fifth Dream says, I'm confused.
5356820	5360220	This is about Vin Diesel.
5360220	5364020	Tiger Claw says, is Diesel even a real last name?
5364020	5365380	Someone went to Kevin Nash as well.
5365380	5367060	Kevin Nash used to go by Diesel.
5367060	5369260	Big Daddy Diesel.
5369260	5370260	Dungeon Buster says, good grief.
5370260	5371440	Minus the quad.
5371440	5372440	Good grief.
5372440	5374300	Another marketplace confusion lawsuit.
5374300	5375300	I don't...
5375300	5376300	It's fine.
5376300	5377300	Look.
5377300	5378300	One is underwear.
5378300	5379300	One is a game.
5379300	5380300	It's very, very different.
5380300	5381980	I don't understand.
5381980	5386700	And all three of them are flammable.
5386700	5388420	And seriously, it's like...
5388420	5390700	Especially when being warned by me.
5390700	5393660	No, it's seriously just like, uh...
5393660	5397020	Did you say that your panties get set on fire?
5397020	5399460	Was it Monster Cables and, um...
5399460	5401820	I want to say Monster Cables and Monster Energy.
5401820	5403820	They go in the rounds and sue everybody that's Monster.
5403820	5404820	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5404820	5407900	Because they sued the Monster Golf place in Folsom, right?
5407900	5408900	Yeah.
5408900	5409900	Well, the chain.
5409900	5410900	Yeah.
5410900	5411900	Yeah, yeah.
5411900	5412900	Oh, boy.
5412900	5413900	All right.
5413900	5416660	One more story for you guys here for part A. And this is about the...
5417620	5420340	Credit card that you may have heard about this week at...
5420340	5423420	Available at Evil G, which of course is the...
5423420	5427740	Our loving name for the GameStop retail chain.
5427740	5430100	And I'm gonna be honest.
5430100	5435000	This news came out, and I was actually more surprised that this wasn't already a thing.
5435000	5439500	Because GameStop is going to be bringing out their own credit card.
5439500	5443480	So a GameStop credit card is gonna come out in the next few months, and this will be something
5443480	5448560	that their employees can push for incentives, I'm sure, along with pre-orders.
5448560	5453680	If you sign up, you will get 5,000 power-up points if you're a power-up basic member.
5453680	5456880	And if you're a pro member, you get 15,000 power-up points.
5456880	5460760	And you're already pre-approved if you're a member, I guess, which seems weird because
5460760	5462480	some people have some really shitty credit.
5462480	5463480	I don't know.
5463480	5468480	But anyway, the interest rate is a low, low 26.99% APR.
5468480	5471440	Sounds like my student loan.
5471440	5478240	That means for every $100, it gets $27 in interest a year.
5478240	5480040	And of course, they calculate that by the day.
5480040	5484680	But anyway, most credit cards for reference, 13 to 15%.
5484680	5485680	So yeah, there you go.
5485680	5489520	You can get some points if you spend money with your GameStop card.
5489520	5493880	I'm gonna be honest though, as crap as this whole situation sounds and everything, there's
5493880	5499200	also a part of me that goes, well, every retail chain has a fucking card.
5499200	5500920	Sears has a card.
5500920	5501920	Surprise has a card.
5501920	5505640	The rate on our Sears card is something like 4%.
5505640	5506640	Yeah.
5506640	5510960	Well, I actually, full disclosure, I have a Sears card.
5510960	5514880	But the reason why I have one is because they had a good deal where when we bought the washer
5514880	5518000	and dryer, you don't have to pay any interest at all as long as you pay it off within like
5518000	5519440	18 months or something like that.
5519440	5524080	We got ours a long time ago when we got Dan's power tools.
5524080	5525800	Power tools.
5525800	5531080	Can I imagine like if you just pay off your, you know, if you make your payment every month,
5531080	5536640	like pay it off in full every month and you can earn points or whatever, I guess.
5536640	5542280	If you're good with credit, but here's the thing, that's the only kind of shady thing
5542280	5546520	I see here is that GameStop, what do they kind of tend to cater to?
5546520	5552120	The younger folks right in that 18 to 23 area.
5552120	5554400	Poor impulse control and no sense of responsibility.
5554400	5556960	Who are most likely to fuck up their credit.
5556960	5559820	You know, and I'm not saying, I'm sure many of you that listen to the show fall into this
5559820	5563680	age bracket, just, you know, make smart decisions with the credit.
5563680	5567800	If you're going to get something like this, you really do have to pay it off because that
5567800	5570740	shit will haunt you for a long, long time if you don't.
5570740	5574600	So just words of advice from your pals at OLR.
5574600	5576600	So shop responsibly.
5576600	5577600	That's right.
5577600	5578600	That's right.
5578600	5582560	Don't, there's, remember that's $27 for every hundred you spend.
5582560	5585320	That's like one and a half games a year.
5585320	5586320	If you don't pay it off.
5586320	5587320	Yeah.
5587320	5591680	Worse if it's someone buys a console, I'm going to buy a PS4 and Xbox One.
5591680	5594320	And keep, keep in mind that's going to be added on monthly.
5594320	5599600	So whether, even if you pay it off three months later, you're still paying them some money.
5599600	5604320	So I think the question will be here, big, big thing here.
5604320	5608400	And Bobby Black Wolf adding to this conversation, I have a best buy credit card, but all my
5608400	5611240	purchases are zero if I pay off by certain dates, like a similar thing.
5611240	5612520	So another retail chain with one.
5612520	5616580	SDG100Matt says, the sick thing is that the suckers that they're going to heavily pressure
5616580	5621760	people into getting these cards don't really know how bad 27% APR is.
5621760	5623080	That's what I kind of want to wait and see.
5623080	5626720	I want to see how GameStop pushes this.
5626720	5630120	Are they going to be preying on the week essentially?
5630120	5633200	Like what the fuck did the power up reward points get me?
5633200	5634200	What the hell is that?
5634200	5635200	Discounts, free games, magazines.
5635200	5636200	I don't know.
5636200	5637680	What does, I don't shop at GameStop.
5637680	5641160	I literally don't know anyone shop at GameStop.
5641160	5644600	You have shopped at GameStop with me there to watch.
5644600	5649340	My assumption is used game credit or deals and things like that.
5649340	5653480	For the record, they usually have really good deals on their used 3DS games.
5653480	5660080	So I've gone, but I think, you know what, I think this, I think if we really, really
5660080	5665080	are against these policies that companies are doing, we really should just say, okay,
5665080	5667520	we're not going to be a part of it anymore at all.
5667520	5673080	Not even if they have good sales, not even if it's, you know, we happen to be there or
5673080	5675400	they're the only ones who are carrying a game.
5675400	5679560	If you're going to stand against something, then including their, their little credit
5679560	5683600	thing, then tell them with your money.
5683600	5687780	So here's something else that's kind of interesting that came out about GameStop this week on
5687780	5690720	a completely different note, but something to think about when you're going to be doing
5690720	5695080	business with them is obviously GameStop huge in the business of buying back your games
5695080	5698140	and reselling, right, and all that stuff.
5698140	5703360	So in some areas it should be noted that video game trade-ins like the ones at GameStop are
5703360	5709120	treated like pawn shops with the pawn shop laws and pawn shops in some areas, one of
5709120	5712680	them being Philadelphia, have to scan fingerprints.
5712680	5717100	So there's a Philadelphia GameStop out there that is now scanning fingerprints that started
5717100	5719400	about a month ago.
5719400	5723040	Because that way if, you know, they find the fingerprints on stolen goods, then they know
5723040	5725160	either they can kind of trace it on stuff, right?
5725160	5726960	That's the thought behind it, whatever.
5726960	5728200	But here's the interesting thing.
5728200	5733680	Those scans, so when you get your finger scanned, that goes into a Leeds online database, which
5733680	5740480	is quote, the nation's largest online investigation system to recover stolen property, help stop
5740480	5744120	meth makers, reduce metal theft, and solve crimes.
5744120	5746760	I don't really have a problem with that.
5746760	5748160	It's not anything new.
5748160	5751240	They do that at my GameStop nearby.
5751240	5755760	If one, back when I was treating stuff in, they do that because they do have theft in
5755760	5760440	the area and so they want to make sure that people aren't turning in stolen goods.
5760440	5764600	Well just, if you're one of those people that, you know, the NSA is watching you masturbate
5764600	5770200	and all that stuff, then just throwing it out there, your fingerprints, you know, when
5770200	5773520	you have a driver's license, your fingerprints are already in the fucking system.
5773520	5777280	It doesn't matter.
5777280	5782400	But now, now they'll know when I sell back Onechambara, they'll know that I was playing
5782400	5783400	that.
5783400	5787440	You'll get a call from D3, why didn't you like that game?
5787440	5788440	What the fuck?
5788440	5790480	You know, we worked hard on that.
5790480	5794580	We're going to have to fire employees because you didn't like that game.
5794580	5798320	The boobs weren't big enough, unfortunately for me.
5798320	5803880	Honestly, putting the tinfoil hat aside, seriously, I think it's a good idea.
5803880	5808920	You know, when Dan was a manager, he would talk about all of these people that would
5808920	5818280	just come into the store who were clearly not all there, as in, like, clearly had stolen
5818280	5819280	items.
5819280	5823160	That's why they don't take games back if they've still got shrinkwrapping on them and all of
5823160	5824160	that.
5824160	5825160	That doesn't go far enough.
5825160	5827500	They just learn, okay, I got to rip this shrinkwrap off.
5827500	5832540	So power up rewards, basically you earn points, you can get crap.
5832540	5837420	And so, for example, some of the things you can get, for 6200 points, you can get Boba
5837420	5838420	Fett necklace.
5838420	5842320	Oddly enough, there's a ton of fucking Star Wars shit on here and I'm not sure why.
5842320	5848380	So if I sign up for my 28% APR credit card, I can get a Boba Fett necklace?
5848380	5853620	You can get for 29,500 points, you can get Boba Fett candy bowl holder.
5853620	5859100	I just want to throw out there, at least it's not Jar Jar Binks, right?
5859100	5862380	I just want to throw out there, there's other credit cards that will give you a flight to
5862380	5864780	Hawaii if you sign up for their credit card.
5864780	5866660	Do they also include a Boba Fett necklace?
5866660	5867660	They do not.
5867660	5868660	Oh my god.
5868660	5869660	So you have a tough decision to make.
5869660	5870660	Do you want Hawaii?
5870660	5872660	Or a necklace?
5872660	5877420	6,000 points, 25% off a pre-owned handheld game.
5877420	5882660	Mind you, you get 10% off anyways with your power up rewards card as it is.
5882660	5885580	12,490 points, a Millennium Falcon model.
5885580	5889340	Yeah, I don't understand why all this shit's Star Wars stuff, but I think that's just an
5889340	5890340	example.
5890340	5891340	I'm surprised it's not the Slave I.
5891340	5892340	It's still on Boba Fett.
5892340	5893340	Yeah.
5893340	5894340	It felt like a line of Boba Fett toys.
5894340	5899220	You can get Stormtrooper earrings for 7,940 points.
5899220	5900500	So yes, quality stuff.
5900500	5903420	We're a plastic Stein for 7,200 points.
5903420	5905500	Did you say Stormtrooper earrings?
5905500	5906500	Stormtrooper earrings.
5906500	5908500	What in the world?
5908500	5909500	Yeah.
5909500	5910500	Alright.
5910500	5914380	I feel like these are not the earrings you're looking for.
5914380	5917180	Star Wars Episode I, the GameStop menace.
5917180	5919060	Alright, look.
5919060	5922900	We're going to take a trip to when it wasn't so ... You know what?
5922900	5927540	The rewards program that you got points for was the Nintendo Fun Club, and that was it.
5927540	5931220	We're going to go back to a classic time in gaming history.
5931220	5934660	It's Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
5934660	5937100	hey, you little brats.
5937100	5938540	I dusted the vault today.
5938540	5943880	Trade in your games, send the money to me, and then go play this, and I'm going to go
5943880	5944880	eat tacos.
5944880	5948000	Dark Sakura, what's the classic game of the week?
5948000	5955520	Mylon's Secret Castle, or as it was known in Japan, Meikyu Kumi Kyouku Myron no Daiboken.
5955520	5956520	What?
5956520	5962280	The maze suite Mylon's Great Adventure, it was Myron.
5962280	5967920	It was an action-adventure game that came out by Hudson for Nintendo.
5967920	5974280	Actually, it was originally on Famicom on November 13th, 1986, and came out in the US
5974280	5977240	in September 1988.
5977240	5983400	The protagonist, as we all said, Mylon here, but it was Myron, lives in the land called
5983400	5987040	Hudson, where people use music to communicate.
5987040	5990760	Are there bees there?
5990760	5992160	I know, right?
5992160	5994440	Oh, actually, there were honeycombs.
5994440	5995920	I do remember that.
5995920	5996920	Yes.
5996920	6001840	Anyway, he was the only one who didn't have the ability to communicate and wondered why,
6001840	6006940	so he goes out to travel throughout the land, the land of Hudson, to find other people who
6006940	6013120	were like himself, but he stops to go to visit Queen Eliza, who lives in Castle Garland,
6013120	6018700	which is also Hudson's Secret Castle, and then he found it was being attacked, and shenanigans
6018700	6019700	ensue.
6019700	6027100	So, basically, you run and jump and shoot bubbles, and you start off on the bottom floor
6027100	6030980	of a four-story castle, and you have to work your way upwards.
6030980	6036000	You've got three main stories, the side towers, and the very top.
6036000	6041040	If you stay outside the castle too long, lightning bolts fall out of the sky.
6041040	6044880	There are also enemies, hidden items, the bubbles.
6044880	6047880	Don't stay outside or God is going to kick your ass.
6047880	6049760	The Lord.
6049760	6053720	Yes, the Lord is going to send lightning bolts down.
6053720	6058620	The bubbles are also not just a tool, they are a weapon.
6058620	6063600	You get weapon-throwing bubbles, and you can throw them at blocks to cause them to break.
6063600	6070240	Also, there's hidden items, but there are also additional routes, hidden shops, different
6070240	6071760	items you can find that way.
6071760	6076680	You also can destroy demons that inhabit certain rooms, but they do come back to life after
6076680	6078640	a while.
6078640	6083780	You've got different bosses that are larger, basically bigger demons, and you have to use
6083780	6085560	bubbles to spit at them.
6085560	6089180	I'm sorry, I'm thinking of Bubble Bobble.
6089180	6093500	They attack by jumping back and forth and throw fireballs at you.
6093500	6099280	And then when they die, they release a crystal ball, like in Castlevania.
6099280	6104480	And then Mylon gets Biggle Bubbles and he can fly them out faster.
6104480	6107780	So you have only one life.
6107780	6111040	When you lose your life, your game is over and you must start over.
6111040	6114780	But if you hold left on the control pad while pressing start at the title screen, you can
6114780	6116860	pick up where you left off.
6116860	6120000	It does not work before collecting the first crystal.
6120000	6128460	And this instruction was only in the Japanese manual, so folks in America had to figure
6128460	6132700	that shit out for ourselves.
6132700	6136540	Or import.
6136540	6141520	Or if you signed up for their credit card, they'd tell you.
6141520	6143820	So it's a really freaking difficult game.
6143820	6146540	I mean, it's fun, don't get me wrong.
6146540	6149540	It's just really difficult.
6149540	6153140	It's got some interesting tidbits to it.
6153140	6159600	So like I said, there's the left and start to start from where you left off.
6159600	6166000	Mylon actually doesn't become invincible after he's attacked, you know, when he's hit that
6166000	6169180	blinking animation.
6169180	6173580	But each room in the castle has the honeycomb that restores your life.
6173580	6178460	And extends it by one unit, so that was the honeycomb you were talking about, Rob.
6178460	6183300	It also is a little unorthodox in the way the other 2D platformers can be.
6183300	6191100	The rooms can be accessed in any order, and they don't really go like in one direction.
6191100	6196420	In each room there's only the one exit that's at a fixed spot, but it doesn't appear until
6196420	6198780	you fire a bubble where it's hidden.
6198780	6203460	And then navigating each of the rooms, you know, like I said, it's free flowing.
6203460	6205700	It goes around in different directions.
6205700	6207820	You can explore it however you want to.
6207820	6212320	Plus it also has a side quest of finding music boxes.
6212320	6216400	If you touch a music box, you go to a mini game where you attempt to pick up as many
6216400	6222940	musical notes as possible, with extra points for sharps and negative points for flats.
6222940	6229780	And basically, each time you collect a music box, you get an elf with a different instrument
6229780	6233460	each time, and the song gets more and more elaborate than they play in the background.
6233460	6234460	That's right.
6234460	6237540	This might surprise you, Darcy, I own this game, actually.
6237540	6238540	It doesn't surprise me.
6238540	6242660	I had this game, this was one of the few NES games I had, this was probably one of the
6242660	6247060	first games I actually had on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and yeah, I remember
6247060	6248060	that.
6248060	6251180	But this game was, no joke, this game was hard as hell.
6251180	6255340	I couldn't even really get past just the first couple of rooms.
6255340	6261940	GameSpot gave this game a really bad review for its control, saying that, and this is
6261940	6267780	a quote from Frank Provo of GameStop, sorry not GameStop, GameSpot, that Milon runs like
6267780	6271540	his feet are greased, his jumps are easily interrupted by nearby blocks that are adjacent
6271540	6272540	or directly above him.
6272540	6274420	He gave it a 2 out of 10.
6274420	6278860	The one thing I didn't really care for about it is that most of the shit in it is hidden.
6278860	6284400	Like there's, to progress in the game, you have to find all this hidden stuff, which,
6284440	6287240	you know, when you're younger, you don't want to be looking for that shit.
6287240	6288240	Ain't no one got time for that shit.
6288240	6289960	Ain't nobody got time for that.
6289960	6295520	Anyway, there was a Game Boy version that came out.
6295520	6305120	There was also, in 1993, there was Mira no Meikyu Kyumi Kyoku, that's almost a tongue,
6305120	6311760	which was just called Milon's May Suite, and it did come out in the U.S. as well.
6311760	6317360	There were a lot of different differences, the Game Boy version had smaller rooms, it
6317360	6324960	had less stuff, and then you had like different money between the different versions.
6324960	6331480	There was also a sequel that came out for the Super Famicom, which was only out in Japan,
6331480	6341720	called Doremi Fantasy Mira no Doki Doki Daibouken, and there were also other sequels that were
6341720	6344160	all Satellaview games.
6344160	6351360	There was BS Doremi No. 2, BS Doremi Okuno Original Sound Witch, Blue Sword Witch, and
6351360	6356080	BS Doremi Okuno Original Sound Witch Power Sound Witch.
6356080	6365200	So there were also cameos by Milon, or Miron, in the Sega Saturn Saturn Bomberman and in
6365200	6370280	Star Soldier, where there are Milon titles to be discovered, and then there's a puzzle
6370280	6378720	game that came out on the DS called Mira no Hoshizora Shabon Puzzle-Kumi Kyoku.
6378720	6386200	And then, yeah, there were also, though, it did, on the Japanese Hudson channel for PS2
6386200	6391360	and the Wii's Virtual Console, there was a re-release of this, and there's also a Nintendo
6391360	6393480	3DS Virtual Console one as well.
6393480	6396520	Came out October of 2013.
6396520	6399760	And actually, it did come out in the PAL region as well.
6399760	6402120	So there you go.
6402120	6404960	There it is, your classic game of the week, the hardest hell and hard to control, but
6404960	6406720	still relatively unique.
6406720	6410160	I'm going to eventually say Kumi Kyoku properly.
6410160	6411920	Kumi Kyoku.
6411920	6415200	Milon's Secret Castle, or Milon's Secret Castle.
6415200	6417760	Meikyu Kumi Kyoku Mira no Daibouken.
6417760	6421080	Oh god, we're seeing it in the YouTube right now.
6421080	6424240	That's that boss, I never could get past this guy, he was too hard.
6425240	6427120	Is this a speedrun or a full play?
6427120	6430080	I think it's a full play, because the guy was stuck in that one room for forever.
6430080	6431640	What is that, a giant dragon?
6431640	6434600	It's like, it looks like Kraid from Metroid.
6434600	6438120	I thought, doesn't he look like, he looks like a winged hyena.
6438120	6439760	It looks like his feet are going to tickle you.
6439760	6440760	It's like tickle tickle tickle.
6440760	6443200	He kind of looks like a winged hyena.
6443200	6444720	It looks like Bowser.
6444720	6448080	It looks like every room is the same, I can't tell it's red.
6448080	6450920	It might be, well that's the outside of the castle, now he's, oh god, I remember this
6450920	6452320	room where he flew through the little.
6452400	6455040	Now I feel like he's playing Metroid in a way, I don't know why.
6455040	6458880	Alright, anyway, sorry, this is Bionic Commander, horrible radio while we're talking about
6458880	6459880	a video here.
6459880	6462080	And Blinder, yes, it was Do Re Mi.
6462080	6466400	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6466400	6468920	Hey guys, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere.
6468920	6469920	Do Re Mi.
6469920	6470920	Faso Latido?
6470920	6471920	I was explaining.
6471920	6472920	A deer?
6472920	6473920	A female deer?
6473920	6474920	Oh fuck, wrong.
6474920	6479560	Alright, anyway, don't go anywhere guys, we've got plenty more Orange Lawn training to come.
6479560	6484160	Your answers to the Frugal Question of the Week, mailbag, phone calls, and is Jonas
6484160	6487040	going to be here for the FUs of the week?
6487040	6488520	I cannot wait.
6488520	6491520	So we'll be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6497520	6503520	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this August the 3rd of 2014, with
6503520	6508480	the 562nd episode of our show already in progress.
6508480	6514920	Joining us in the studio tonight, Jonas and Diego from the T-Baggers, which actually means
6514920	6516720	the Big Anime Game Room.
6516720	6518800	There you go, either way sounds great.
6518800	6526320	But well, did you, have you guys got, I guess your website is tabgr.org.
6526320	6529160	T-B-G-A-G-R.
6529160	6531080	You know what, acronyms, I can't do it.
6531080	6532080	T-Baggers.
6532080	6533080	T-B-A-G-R.
6533080	6534640	Okay, the Big Anime Game Room.
6534640	6539760	So it's that dot o-r-g, so somebody in our chat said, T-Bagger orgy.
6539760	6543480	Right, they're really just.
6543480	6544480	There it is.
6544480	6545480	All right, yeah, I got nothing.
6545480	6546480	I got nothing.
6546480	6547480	All right, there it is.
6547480	6548480	T-Bagger orgy, wow.
6548480	6549480	All right.
6549480	6550480	I'm going to remember that one.
6550480	6551480	That was pretty good.
6551480	6552480	All right, that could.
6552480	6553480	There you go.
6553480	6554480	That's what it became there.
6554480	6555480	Oh, wait.
6555480	6556480	All right.
6556480	6558200	We got some rapid fire news to get to.
6558200	6561280	Your emails, the Frugal Question of the Week, all coming up here.
6561280	6562720	So let's get into some news.
6562720	6563720	Some quick news.
6563800	6564800	All right.
6566400	6567400	So PlayStation Now.
6567400	6572400	We kind of talked a little bit about it when we were talking about EA saying PlayStation
6572400	6576880	Now is now in beta, open public beta, I guess.
6576880	6581920	And they've got a bunch of different plans available, I guess.
6581920	6586360	And one of those, they're talking about something in the works is actually a subscription plan
6586360	6592560	that would maybe be all-inclusive, although to be honest, based on how expensive things
6592600	6595960	are now, I would be curious to see how much that would actually cost.
6595960	6600200	Because right now, what they have it set up, and it doesn't really make any sense to me,
6600200	6601680	they've got four different options.
6601680	6606960	You can either rent a title for four hours, seven days, 30 days, or 90 days.
6606960	6612960	So for example, Darksiders, three dollars for four hours, six dollars for a week, eight
6612960	6618960	dollars for 30 days, or 15 dollars for 90 days, which that's almost the price of the
6618960	6619960	game itself.
6620200	6627000	In fact, there's even some games, I want to say, that were like $49.99 for like 90 days.
6627000	6632200	It's like, shit, just buy it either digitally or buy it used or something.
6632200	6635920	I mean, at that point, what's the point in renting it for that much time when you can
6635920	6640160	just buy it for cheaper?
6640160	6646360	They're saying the pricing structure right now, of course, has been a major contention
6646400	6652680	for a lot of people, and there will be reduced pricing on some four-hour rentals.
6652680	6656480	Ooh, thank you, that's so generous.
6656480	6660720	Also they're saying that they recommend that you have a five megabit connection in order
6660720	6664400	to be able to utilize the service.
6664400	6671120	And yeah, it's going to be coming to, right now, I think it's open to PlayStation 4 owners
6671120	6676160	in the US and Canada, but later on it'll be available for a PlayStation 3 Vita and
6676160	6681560	certain models of Sony TVs.
6681560	6685440	I gotta be honest, for this thing to be utilized a little bit more, it's going to have to be
6685440	6691000	a hell of a lot cheaper than it is right now, because that's just ridiculous.
6691000	6696680	Three dollars for four hours, fuck that, just go buy the game or go rent it somewhere else.
6696680	6701040	Bobby in chat loves to be Devil's Advocate, so here he goes, Devil's Advocate, yes, but
6701040	6705600	can I buy Darksiders for fifteen dollars and play it on my PlayStation 4?
6705600	6711840	True, you can't do that, but is really that kind of, you know, a premium price worth it
6711840	6713840	for playing an old game like that?
6713840	6718040	I would argue no, I mean it's just, if you wouldn't pay that much to bring it out of
6718040	6722400	a red box, then why, I mean the streaming thing works well, great.
6722400	6727480	I'll play your Devil's Advocacy right there, brand new Darksiders collection that's going
6727480	6733240	to be coming out, I want to say is, I think $29.99, and that should be coming out in a
6733240	6739040	couple weeks, on PlayStation 3, it's got the first two games and all the DLC.
6739040	6740760	But not the PlayStation 4.
6740760	6742400	Who gives a fuck?
6742400	6746040	You're not buying the PlayStation 4 to play the original Darksiders game.
6746040	6748240	If you want to play PS3 games, buy a PS3, I get it.
6748240	6756280	I think it would have been nice, like say, for example, I owned Darksiders on PlayStation
6756280	6760960	3, because I bought it digitally or something like that, see I was dumb enough to do that.
6760960	6763520	I should be able to play that streaming for free.
6763520	6768720	I actually deeply agree with that, because it gives digital enhanced value, because you
6768720	6774280	lose the equity of owning the physical copy of the game, that you could go to GameStop
6774280	6780120	and give your, you know, fingerprint and urine sample in order to turn the game in for money.
6780120	6781120	Yeah.
6781120	6785320	So, you know, you lose that ability when you buy something digitally, but that would be
6785360	6789640	a perk, like, oh, buy this game digitally, and you get your cross-buy of being able to
6789640	6793240	have it on the PS3, the PS4, and the PS Vita, and you know, all this stuff through the magic
6793240	6794240	of PlayStation Now.
6794240	6795240	Woo!
6795240	6796240	You know.
6796240	6800000	It just, for me, it sounds like right now PlayStation Now is not going to be a service
6800000	6803120	I'm going to utilize at all.
6803120	6805960	And that's sad, because it sounded like it had potential, but.
6805960	6807760	Well, let's wait.
6807760	6811680	I'm not ready to throw it all away yet, because it will be very interesting to see what happens
6811680	6816480	when they add the PS1 and PS2, because it will have additional features, like the trophies
6816480	6820800	at least, that weren't in the original, and it will be, I kind of hope that if they do
6820800	6823920	the subscription service, they're doing it for the PS1 and PS2 games, that's why we haven't
6823920	6824920	seen it yet.
6824920	6828520	And I hope that when they add trophies, Nintendo will go, hey, we can add trophies to our game,
6828520	6832160	or whatever their accomplishments to you, whatever they're going to call their bullshit.
6832160	6833160	Yeah.
6833160	6834160	Coins.
6834160	6835160	Stickers, yeah, coins, why not?
6835160	6836160	Why not?
6836160	6837160	Or power-ups.
6837160	6838160	Power-ups, yeah.
6838160	6839160	Alright.
6839160	6841160	What else, Loki?
6841640	6844600	Also, it's back.
6844600	6850240	Flappy Bird is back, because, you know, you probably haven't been able to play any sort
6850240	6854080	of Flappy Bird games for the last few months, you know, it's not like there's zillions of
6854080	6863560	clones out there, but yes, the official Flappy Bird is back on the Amazon Fire platform exclusively
6863560	6867120	right now with Flappy Bird's Family.
6867120	6872400	And Flappy Bird's Family, it's got some new multiplayer options.
6872400	6879480	Right now, I think it's locked into, it's now on the Amazon App Store for Android, it's
6879480	6886640	not on iTunes or Google Play, and apparently, I think they have a version out for the Fire
6886640	6893360	TV, I'm not sure about the Fire Phone, but I just don't give a shit.
6893360	6895760	I seriously don't give a shit about this game.
6895760	6896760	Who cares?
6896920	6897920	Oh, it's back.
6897920	6898920	Guess what?
6898920	6902400	Sorry that you're not gonna be able to play, you know, the Flappy Bird's Family right now
6902400	6906840	because it's exclusive on Amazon, but guess what, there's gonna be a zillion Flappy Bird's
6906840	6907840	Family clones.
6907840	6908840	You know who cares?
6908840	6909840	You know who cares?
6909840	6913840	Kim Kardashian cares, because some bird's about to steal her tiara.
6913840	6919520	Wait, isn't there like a Flappy Bird arcade game in Roseville Golf Land, a redemption
6919520	6920520	game?
6920520	6921520	Is there?
6921520	6922520	Oh, why wouldn't that surprise me at all?
6922600	6927840	I know they do Doodle Jump as one, and they do, I was just at Dave & Buster's yesterday,
6927840	6929640	so I saw a lot of this crazy redemption shit.
6929640	6930640	Fruit Ninja.
6930640	6931640	Fruit Ninja's one.
6931640	6934920	Infinity Blade is like a game, I don't think it gives tickets though.
6934920	6938320	I still like Feeding Frenzy, maybe that's just because I actually win tickets when I
6938320	6939320	play Feeding Frenzy.
6939320	6940320	Anybody?
6940320	6942840	It's alright, anyway.
6942840	6950080	And then, last but not least, they're gonna have Paper Mario in Smash Bros.
6950520	6952520	It will be a stage.
6952520	6956480	Diego perked up for a minute, what?
6956480	6957480	I had heard this.
6957480	6960720	Yeah, sadly it's gonna be a stage, because that would have been too cool, and they can't
6960720	6961720	do that.
6961720	6963880	They had me go in there, I was like, Paper Mario's a playable character, it was just
6963880	6967880	revealed.
6967880	6971160	My favorite stage will always be the Picto chat stage, and I kind of hope they bring
6971160	6974720	that back in one way or another.
6974720	6977840	That was pretty creative, everything's being drawn around you, and you can be inside the
6977840	6978840	whale.
6979000	6983560	But it wasn't accurate because balls never showed up in the stage, and that's what people
6983560	6984920	drew on Picto chat was balls.
6984920	6985920	They should have...
6985920	6988720	Of course they drew a lot of stuff when they pushed at him, I remember when that first
6988720	6989720	started up, I was like, oh it's so bad.
6989720	6993400	They should have a Mii Plaza stage, or like a Wii Sports stage.
6993400	6996920	Or a Swap Notes stage that just shuts down part way through.
6996920	6998320	How about that.
6998320	6999320	Joke, anyway.
6999320	7001160	In the meantime, you're fighting on cats.
7001160	7002160	Missing a Go stage?
7002160	7003160	A what?
7003160	7004160	He said missing those.
7004160	7007000	Everything's just glitching, and you got like nine of them.
7007000	7008480	A Pac-Man glitch stage?
7008480	7009480	Oh my goodness.
7009480	7010480	There you go.
7010480	7011480	Why not?
7011480	7012480	Pac-Man's in the game now.
7012480	7013480	We just need to have a game called Kill Screen.
7013480	7021000	I don't think it made your show roll, but there's also Galaga assists now in the game,
7021000	7022000	so...
7022000	7023000	That's kind of cool.
7023000	7024000	Yeah.
7024000	7027000	I hope it plays the little song.
7027000	7028760	Alright, some more news.
7028760	7034520	Hey, remember Awada missed E3 because he had had some medical issues, and had some, I think
7034520	7037560	he had surgery for a bile duct growth was what was going on.
7037560	7042240	Well, the good news is Nintendo did put out a little update through a spokesperson, Yoshihiro
7042240	7046480	Minagawa, who said that Awada is recovering steadily.
7046480	7049200	There's no interference with his business as president.
7049200	7053960	So just a little update, he's doing fine.
7053960	7058600	Also an update on the Wii U front, Hyrule Warriors, another game that people are looking
7058600	7064280	forward to this fall, not just, you know, the Smash Brothers or Captain Toad, but there's
7064280	7066280	Hyrule Warriors as well.
7066280	7071400	And Hyrule Warriors sadly will not have an online co-op mode, because, you know, it's
7071400	7077960	Nintendo and it's online, but there will be local co-op, because again, it's gonna get
7077960	7078960	loco!
7078960	7085400	You're gonna drink some far loco and play Hyrule Warriors.
7085400	7090720	Has this happened at one of your cons?
7090720	7093360	The Hyrule Warriors tournament, sponsored by 4 Loco.
7093360	7096980	Wow, there you go, is that still around?
7096980	7097980	They had to change it.
7097980	7099600	I think they had to take the caffeine out of it.
7099600	7101120	Right, because it was killing people.
7101120	7103120	Yeah, that's usually bad PR.
7103120	7105120	That's not a reason.
7105120	7107760	They found out what the cans latched to their hands.
7107760	7110960	I think we found the cause of death.
7110960	7116520	So anyway, there will be local co-op, and there you go, but they will say there will
7116520	7119220	be some other type of online play.
7119220	7124000	The reason why this is relevant, Dynasty Warriors always had online play, and yet this is coming
7124000	7128200	from the same people, yet, you know, just throwing it out there.
7128200	7131440	Hey, let's talk about Justice Beaver.
7131440	7136960	Hey, that is the name of the game, Justice Beaver.
7136960	7138960	Order in the court!
7138960	7145280	Gee, that's totally not a spoof on Justin Bieber.
7145280	7150720	I hope Oranja Boom comes out and punches him in the face.
7150720	7152880	That would be pretty awesome.
7152880	7160320	Anyway, Justice Beaver is a platformer game that's going to be coming out for the Wii
7160320	7161960	U and the Super Nintendo.
7161960	7165400	Yes, the Super Nintendo.
7165400	7168520	People want to make shit for old consoles, so why not?
7168520	7171640	UnderVision is the company putting this out.
7171640	7176480	The Super Nintendo will be the flagship platform, and they're trying to get a Super Nintendo
7176480	7179800	virtual console release on the Wii U eShop.
7179800	7182480	That would be kind of awesome, actually, if they could actually get a virtual console
7182480	7185280	release on the eShop, even though it's not really a classic game.
7185280	7188480	That game would be banned in Canada, I guess.
7188480	7190760	Justice Beaver, would the Canadians not take lightly to that?
7190760	7191760	I don't know.
7191760	7193560	They'd probably all laugh their ass off.
7193560	7195600	Probably, and then apologize for it.
7195600	7200840	And then the sequel, Justice Beaver Rush.
7200840	7205360	Hopefully that's the end of the game, is that Rush just, you know, kills them all.
7205360	7207680	Anyway, alright.
7207680	7208680	There it is.
7208680	7209680	That's what I've got.
7209680	7210680	Dark Sakura.
7210680	7212320	Oh, yeah.
7212320	7216640	Well, how about LittleBigPlanet 3?
7216640	7219080	Pre-orders are ready to go.
7219080	7220080	As soon as...
7220080	7223320	You could probably pre-order LittleBigPlanet 4 if you want.
7223320	7225540	GameStop's like, sure, I'll take your five bucks.
7225540	7227620	Do you want to put that on your new GameStop card?
7227620	7231740	That's how they sell the card.
7231740	7233500	You want to guarantee that you get that DLC?
7233500	7238580	Well, it looks like that if you do the order, you get a Sackboy plushie.
7238580	7243340	If you order one at Target, his comes with a Target hat.
7243340	7247700	And then the thing that interests me, a Dragon Age Inquisition costume pack, because that's
7247700	7248700	all I care about.
7248700	7251320	No, there's also other costume packs.
7251320	7253540	There's the Mythical Creatures one.
7253540	7255700	There's Hidden Animals.
7255700	7260260	There is the PlayStation's favorite costume pack that includes Journey, Jak and Daxter,
7260260	7264820	Sly Cooper, Loco Roco, Ratchet and Clank, and Tearaway.
7264820	7267580	Many of which have already been out there already.
7267580	7270620	So since Dark Sakura brought up a LittleBigPlanet plushie...
7270620	7271620	November 18th, by the way.
7271620	7272620	Thank you.
7272620	7276580	Since Dark Sakura brought up the LittleBigPlanet Sackboy plushie, can I borrow your outfit
7276580	7277580	and go to FurCon?
7277580	7283060	If you want, it's really hot.
7283060	7288700	And Dusty, there could be an infestation of Black Woodas in there and I don't even
7288700	7289700	know.
7289700	7290700	I'll fur-freeze it.
7290700	7294460	Alright, I'll beat it out in the backyard with a bat.
7294460	7297860	We don't want you to know about you beating it in the backyard, Rob.
7297860	7302740	I knew, like, the minute the words were coming out of my mouth, I was like, stop talking!
7302740	7303740	But I can't.
7303740	7304740	Because you know where...
7304740	7308620	Yes, if you really want to borrow that Dusty costume for, you know...
7308620	7310820	We'll get you some fumigation stuff, Rob.
7310820	7311820	I really...
7311820	7316020	I should take it to Dragon Con, but how am I going to get that on the plane?
7316020	7317020	Strap it to the top.
7317020	7319060	It is really large.
7319060	7320060	It is really large.
7320060	7321060	It is really large.
7321060	7324260	I'd have to take a whole other thing.
7324260	7325260	Can I continue?
7325260	7326260	Yes, yes.
7326260	7327260	Okay.
7327260	7328260	Alright, Your Highness.
7328260	7333740	So Kmart has listed a game called Captain Toad Treasure Tracker for $39.99.
7333740	7336300	Apparently, it was a mini-game.
7336300	7338500	I actually did not play this game.
7339180	7346020	Oh yeah, it was a mini-game in Super Mario 3D World, but now it's going to be its own
7346020	7348900	game, according to Kmart listings.
7348900	7351420	So who knows if this is real, because it's Kmart.
7351420	7352420	The game is real.
7352420	7353420	They talked about it at E3.
7353420	7354420	It's the price.
7354420	7358660	The price we didn't know, because that's lower than most games.
7358660	7359660	It is...
7359660	7363060	Yeah, I mean, it's lower.
7363060	7366140	I could see them doing that, because I don't think it's going to be that popular.
7366140	7370700	It is a legit listing, because I can see right now the model number is a legit Nintendo
7370700	7372860	model number.
7372860	7374420	So yeah.
7374420	7375420	So there's that.
7375420	7378260	But I would assume the price is correct.
7378260	7380780	If they've got the model number, they probably have the price.
7380780	7384020	Yeah, it's actually correct, because I was at E3 when I was playing it, and they were
7384020	7386020	saying it was $39.99.
7386020	7387020	Oh, they did.
7387020	7389700	I didn't know they gave the retail price at E3.
7389700	7394420	I think I remembered seeing something about it, and then...
7394460	7396980	I guess the news here is that Kmart is selling something.
7396980	7399980	I think I saw it and didn't pay attention to it, so that's why.
7399980	7400980	Because...
7400980	7401980	Alright, well there you go.
7401980	7402980	Oh, there's more news.
7402980	7403980	There's more news.
7403980	7404980	Yeah, why...
7404980	7408300	Okay, so all the chatters that are like, the game was announced at E3, yeah, but sorry
7408300	7411860	if we were paying attention to Splatoon or the cool stuff.
7411860	7416620	Or sorry if some of us had Job and real life stuff to worry about.
7416620	7419300	I saw the stuff on Kirby Treasure Tracker.
7419300	7422660	I just thought it looked so boring that I just didn't give a shit.
7422660	7424860	No, I didn't realize the price had already been out there.
7424860	7425860	I thought that was the new thing.
7425860	7426860	Alright, whatever.
7426860	7427860	DarkSira.
7427860	7428860	Oh, I'm sorry.
7428860	7431860	I was busy worrying about real life for a moment.
7431860	7432860	Sorry.
7432860	7436460	Another thing too, if you are a fan of Zen Pinball 2, then there is a Guardians of the
7436460	7441220	Galaxy table to be out on Jul- actually, it's already out.
7441220	7447660	It came out on July 29th for $2.99, and it's both heroes and villains from the universe,
7447660	7452340	and should be awesome, as long as it has lots and lots of Rocket Raccoon.
7452820	7458940	The movie, by the way, killed the box office, like 90 plus million, and they were only expecting
7458940	7459940	it to make 70.
7459940	7460940	Fuck you, Titanic.
7460940	7465900	So, well, I don't think it's going to go that huge, but it's doing very well for itself.
7465900	7467940	No, Dan went and saw it without me.
7467940	7469380	What a jerk.
7469380	7470380	I know, right?
7470380	7472820	Well, he better go see it again.
7472820	7474180	I'm going to go without him.
7474180	7475180	You should.
7475180	7476180	We'll go.
7476180	7477180	We can go on a date.
7477180	7478180	We're going on a date.
7478180	7479180	Let's go on a plater date.
7479180	7480180	Alright, it'll be fun.
7480180	7481180	Okay.
7481180	7482180	Because I haven't seen it yet.
7483020	7484020	I haven't seen him, so.
7484020	7485740	Then Dan can take Alan to see it.
7485740	7486740	You know what, though?
7486740	7491060	Alan and Shane went out last night to go have Mongolian, so, you know what?
7491060	7492060	Oh, really?
7492060	7493060	Yeah, there you go.
7493060	7494060	So, alright.
7494060	7495060	Moving on.
7495060	7497060	Oh, it's the FUGL Question of the Week time.
7497060	7498060	Maybe.
7498060	7500220	Here I was talking about Guardians of the Galaxy.
7500220	7503460	I almost forgot to get to Facebook and Google Plus.
7503460	7506180	You slam those words together, you get FUGL.
7506180	7507580	It's the FUGL Question of the Week.
7507580	7511100	Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and we read some
7511100	7512700	of our favorite answers here on Air.
7512700	7514820	If I'm feeling quite generous, I'll read all of them.
7514820	7518100	Well, tonight, I had to ask something about that GameStop credit card.
7518100	7522740	So, the question we asked, did you hear about the controversial new credit card at the Evil
7522740	7523740	G?
7523740	7528060	This makes us think about crazy lengths you might have gone to in the past to play the
7528060	7529660	game you want.
7529660	7535180	What's the craziest thing you've ever done to either A, get a great deal on a game, or
7535180	7538260	B, get your hands on the game at all?
7538260	7541820	Now, the weird thing about this FUGL Question of the Week is we had a lot of people that
7541820	7547740	just kind of responded to the story, and not really the question, but, okay, it's the show
7547740	7550940	where every gamer has a voice, and there are some really interesting opinions on it, so
7550940	7551940	I'll read all the answers anyway.
7551940	7553580	This is the show where nobody reads.
7553580	7554580	You have to clearly...
7554580	7555580	This is...
7555580	7558540	Did you not read the sign on the door before you came in?
7558540	7559700	This is the 2000s.
7559700	7560700	No one reads.
7560700	7561700	They assume.
7561700	7562700	All right.
7562700	7563700	No, it's fine.
7563700	7564700	I'm just giving you guys some crap.
7564700	7567420	Well, clearly, people wanted to comment on the credit card, and that's fine.
7567420	7571540	So let's start with our buddy Renee from Killer Queens from Outer Space, who did answer the
7571540	7576940	question at hand, who said, being a part-time street corner pharmaceutical representative
7576940	7582620	in order to save up enough moneys to purchase the Sega CD system and a couple of titles.
7582620	7587300	Girl, you sold weed so you could play Night Trap?
7587300	7589420	Is that what you're saying?
7589420	7592180	Is that what I'm hearing?
7592180	7595220	What is a part-time street corner pharmaceutical representative?
7595220	7596220	That is...
7596220	7597220	Is that a weed salesman?
7598020	7604140	Anyhow, AZHP says, this sounds like it's meant for the irresponsible college student who
7604140	7608780	gets their first credit card at the same time they move out but have no job, buy a whole
7608780	7612360	bunch of things on credit saying, I can make the minimum and pay it off when I get a job
7612360	7613360	at a college.
7613360	7616740	Then five years later, they realize they've got thousands of dollars in debt in addition
7616740	7619500	to their student loans and have to go bankrupt to 23 years old.
7619500	7622700	I guess if GameStop wants a piece of that pie, go for it.
7622700	7626420	It's no stinkier than any other retail-based credit card offer for Macy's, even if the
7626420	7628020	APR is higher.
7628020	7633220	Degenerate Johnny says, back to the crazy thing you did for a game, I convinced my family
7633220	7635660	to do a yearly present trade-off.
7635660	7637920	No presents for me for an entire year.
7637920	7640060	No birthday presents, no Christmas presents, et cetera.
7640060	7643900	In exchange, they would purchase an Atari Jaguar for me when it came out.
7643900	7646940	I was a big Aliens vs. Predator fan back then.
7646940	7651540	Well, and Tempest 2000 was definitely worth getting a Jaguar for as well.
7651540	7655180	All right, let's see.
7655180	7659780	Elliot B. responded, saying, I spent the majority of a family holiday in New York traipsing
7659780	7661620	around shops for a DS.
7661620	7666060	It wasn't available in the UK at that point, and even in New York, it was sold out everywhere.
7666060	7669620	Eventually I managed to find one in Times Square, and I was the coolest kid in school
7669620	7672500	until it came out in the UK three months later.
7672500	7677900	Jonathan L. said, during the PlayStation Network's sales a few months ago, I bought three months
7677900	7683740	of PlayStation Plus to get some PS3 games cheap, but I don't actually have a PS3.
7683740	7688700	I'll get one eventually, and when I do, I have some HD remakes waiting to download.
7688700	7691540	So he bought games for a system he doesn't even own.
7691540	7693020	That is going to pretty great lengths.
7693020	7698260	SG100Matt says, when the DS Lite came out, I went to several Circuit City stores, bought
7698260	7703020	a few $6 PlayStation 2 games, and returned them to Walmart for $35 each.
7703020	7708300	I ended up with about $130 in store credit after only spending 36 collectively at various
7708300	7709900	Circuit City stores.
7709900	7711980	With that store credit, I bought a DS Lite.
7712020	7716580	I understand this is a highly unethical tactic and probably illegal, but I was a young, crafty
7716580	7719460	college student and a big cheapskate.
7719460	7724020	A few more answers on the credit card front, Chigurh says, I am swamped with credit card
7724020	7727460	debt, and if I ever get out of it, I will never let it happen again.
7727460	7729740	These things are evil.
7729740	7731900	And lastly, Alan Alchemy, that's right.
7731900	7735820	My partner couldn't read the question and answered.
7735820	7736820	Way to go, Alan.
7736820	7737820	No, but you know what?
7737820	7738820	Heart, heart.
7738820	7741460	This is a good piece of feedback on the credit card issues.
7741460	7745860	Alan Alchemy says, I don't mind it because they can't pitch it to anyone who looks under
7745860	7750420	18, but this is no different from when we're harassed at Target for their card.
7750420	7754260	They're just joining the big kids table, which makes sense since video games is a multi-billion
7754260	7755460	dollar industry.
7755460	7760160	The main issue is that 18th birthday, no credit, horrible interest rate, foreshadowing of fucking
7760160	7764180	up their credit rating forever, risk angle, but that's not GameStop's problem and will
7764180	7766320	just happen on some other store's card.
7766320	7769700	The interest rate is gross, but similar to what Providian and Capital One provides for
7769700	7770980	the same demographic.
7771020	7776220	$20 up front is a pretty lame perk too, but oh well.
7776220	7782100	Well let's check out over on Google Plus and see if people actually was answering the question
7782100	7784060	or was answering the credit card feature.
7784060	7785340	Again, I'm just giving you guys crap.
7785340	7788060	I actually think the answers on the credit card front are great.
7788060	7790020	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
7790020	7793780	Let's see, we have a couple answers and they are both about the crazy questions.
7793780	7797660	So Act Def says, I think the most crazy thing I've done to get my hands on a video game
7797660	7799380	is probably overpay for one.
7799420	7803060	I wanted a copy of Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney when it first came out, but it was super rare
7803060	7810180	to get, so I paid $50 USD for a used when it actually cost $30 USD new, but it was kind
7810180	7813940	of hard to actually find a new copy at that price, so at the time I didn't mind.
7813940	7818220	Sadly, a few months later, Capcom decided to print more copies of the game, oh well.
7818220	7823500	And lastly, Retertainment says, when I was a kid, I mowed lawns to buy a Game Boy.
7823500	7827700	Due to me being a ginger, this resulted in me bursting into flames on a regular basis
7827780	7829860	due to walking outside.
7829860	7831780	Flame on!
7831780	7834100	There it is, the answers to the FUGO question of the week.
7834100	7836700	I'll pose the question in the room, does anybody want to answer?
7836700	7840220	We already talked about the credit card thing, but what was the craziest thing you ever did
7840220	7842420	to get your hands on a game?
7842420	7848140	I paid $210 USD to get the Sailor Moon S fighting game, and I ordered it COD in Alabama, which
7848140	7850140	was the only way I could get it.
7850140	7853300	I saved up for like six months.
7853300	7856420	And then my grandma drove me around to five different stores until we went to Montgomery
7856420	7859180	Wards so I could buy Killer Instinct.
7859180	7860180	Awesome.
7860180	7861180	In Alabama.
7861180	7862180	That's awesome.
7862180	7866660	I bought press kits to play games early.
7866660	7867900	Wow!
7867900	7869860	Several times.
7869860	7875380	I paid, I think $120 USD for the Motorstorm Apocalypse press kit, but I got to play the
7875380	7879540	game over a month before it came out.
7879540	7885500	I did that for DJ Hero 2, or you know, DJ Hero, the original one.
7885500	7889620	I remember I got the, I don't remember if it was the first or second one, but I got
7889620	7893620	the DJ Hero turntable, like a beta one that was wired.
7893620	7894820	I remember that.
7894820	7896420	And then I got the demo disc with that.
7896420	7897420	You used to buy that?
7897420	7898420	Worth it.
7898420	7899420	It was awesome.
7899420	7901500	You used to buy that crazy shit all the time, and I was like, how much did you spend on
7901500	7903060	that, Logie?
7903060	7908040	Anyway, I would say honestly the craziest thing I did was I imported a Japanese PlayStation
7908040	7910300	2 to play Beatmania 2DX.
7910300	7911300	That was pretty crazy.
7911300	7913940	That was a lot of money to be able to do that.
7913940	7918740	We bought the one that Game Master had, their last, which was the first model, the Japanese
7918740	7919740	PlayStation 2.
7919740	7920740	Nice.
7920740	7921740	By the way, still works.
7921740	7922740	I know, yeah.
7922740	7923740	Mine probably still works too.
7923740	7927420	I don't know if you can, it stopped working with my TV at some point.
7927420	7929460	Like some of the older games didn't work.
7929460	7932660	Jonas, Diego, anything crazy you guys did?
7932660	7933660	Might be gamer related.
7933660	7938660	When I actually purchased Iguana Girls, a Japanese PlayStation 2, because she wasn't
7938660	7943220	using, I think she wanted to sell it like with Beatmania and stuff.
7943220	7948660	In the top of buying the DDR pass for cheap, I decided to compulsively buy a lot of the
7948660	7954620	Bemani and DDR games just to keep up with the gamers at the time.
7954620	7956500	Yeah, as most music game nerds would do.
7956500	7957500	They have to have them all.
7957500	7963620	I've got to get 7th style, 8th style, 9th style, 10th style, and they have them all.
7963620	7968500	And we provided a lot of the stuff for the community, for the cons.
7968500	7973540	In addition to that, with the buying the games, we compulsively bought repair kits
7973540	7978100	for the pads too, because as much as people start stomping with heels, we have to repair
7978100	7980420	the hell out of those.
7980420	7983660	It gets pricey, but we did it for all the fans.
7983660	7985580	Alright, I did it for the fans.
7985580	7988740	Alright, Diego, any crazy purchases you made?
7988740	7992820	Yeah, also hanging out with Jonas and all, some of his friends got me into music games
7992820	7999940	and such, but when I was getting into imports, I went online and bought a Japanese Wii and
7999940	8003380	got Brawl when it was released in Japan before it came out in America.
8003380	8004380	Oh, dang.
8004380	8005380	Okay.
8005380	8007060	So we had it over here quite early and people were on that.
8007060	8010140	And the amazing thing about that is that the names are different.
8010140	8011740	Two of the names are different in Japanese.
8011740	8015860	They call Bowser Koopa, King Koopa, or just Koopa, which is amazing.
8015860	8019300	And they call Jigglypuff Purrin.
8019300	8024620	And Pokemon Trainer was, I don't know, they said it in a different tone, and Rob was called
8024620	8025620	Robot.
8025620	8026620	Okay.
8026620	8027620	Yeah.
8027620	8028620	Wow.
8028620	8032300	So we had that for about a good three to four months before it was released in America.
8032300	8033300	Huh.
8033300	8034300	Yeah.
8034300	8035300	So we're showcasing it over here.
8035300	8037060	I did that too and I wasn't even a big fan of Smash Brothers.
8037060	8038300	I just wanted to play it early.
8038300	8039740	Yeah, you just had to have it early.
8039740	8040740	That's it.
8040740	8042780	But see, I didn't buy an import system.
8042780	8048620	I put a mod chip in mine instead, which, that was scary because at the time I wasn't very
8048620	8049620	good at soldering.
8049620	8051260	I was like, I'm going to fuck this up.
8051260	8052260	I'm going to fuck this up.
8052260	8053260	I'm going to fuck this up.
8053260	8054260	And it worked!
8054260	8055260	Yay!
8055260	8058140	I've heard people who were just flimsy on that and they just screwed up their entire
8058140	8059140	Wii system.
8059140	8060500	I'm like, well, there goes the warranty.
8060500	8061500	You just screwed with it.
8061500	8062500	So.
8062500	8063500	Yeah.
8063500	8065660	By the way, you know, we have a switch on the back of our GameCube.
8065660	8066660	It's not hooked to anything.
8066660	8068260	We just have a switch on the back of our GameCube.
8068260	8069260	It's just there.
8069260	8072300	We put it there, starting to mod it, and we didn't think we'd do anything with it.
8072300	8074300	So now we just have a switch.
8074300	8078580	I miss the days of the PlayStation 1 where you just plug that little guy in the back
8078580	8079580	and bang, it's done.
8079580	8080580	I remember that.
8080580	8081580	Oh, that's fantastic.
8081580	8082580	I remember that.
8082580	8086580	And don't forget about, though, trying to sit and go through all of the hoops that you
8086580	8090260	had to jump through to get PSO to work with the Ethernet adapter.
8090260	8091260	Yes.
8091260	8092260	On the DreamCube.
8092260	8093260	And I got it.
8093260	8094260	The DreamCube?
8094260	8095260	No, the DreamCube.
8095260	8096260	The Dreamcast.
8096260	8097260	Rob.
8097260	8098260	She's the dream team.
8098260	8099260	Yeah.
8099260	8100260	Fart, Rob.
8100260	8101260	Fart.
8101260	8102260	I will.
8102260	8103260	I will.
8103260	8104260	Anyway, moving on.
8104260	8107860	Let's get back into some other news for the week.
8108140	8115020	So, Crytek hasn't been doing that great, and because of that, they actually ended up selling
8115020	8119940	off some of their titles and assets to different companies.
8119940	8124860	For example, Homefront The Revolution was actually sold to Deep Silver, the company
8124860	8130340	that was going to be publishing it, because I guess they just didn't have the money or
8130340	8131340	something.
8131340	8132340	Whatever.
8132340	8135940	But basically, they said, hey, we strongly believed in the potential of Homefront The
8135940	8140660	Revolution and trust the new team to continue the path that they have been walking for the
8140660	8144340	last few years.
8144340	8152700	And also to go along with that, Crytek also has this game called Hunt, which is a co-op
8152700	8155020	monster hunting game.
8155020	8161260	Kind of think of, I don't know, Constantine or something like that.
8161260	8167380	But this has actually moved from the original studio to now Crytek Austin.
8167380	8174940	Oh, I'm sorry, from Crytek Austin to the Frankfurt location, so shifting stuff around.
8174940	8180660	But I guess they did make a comment, though, I want to say, saying that, no, no, no, our
8180660	8184740	financial stuff's okay, but you've got to wonder if they're starting to sell assets
8184740	8190740	like that and move stuff around that maybe they're thinking of downsizing a little bit.
8191220	8196220	GameGuru in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com is asking, did someone buy TimeSplitters?
8196220	8197220	No.
8197220	8202180	No, sadly, I would have been excited about that.
8202180	8205820	I want to buy TimeSplitters, I just don't have any money.
8205820	8208820	We'd take a dollar.
8208820	8211700	That's my final offer.
8211700	8216220	Moving on to some other news, this is about Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.
8216220	8219580	For those of you that have picked this up for the 3DS, this is kind of neat.
8219620	8224020	A lot of stuff on 3DS, as you know, is region-locked, and that doesn't make the system popular with
8224020	8227860	some people, because they've got to buy the import systems, but the cool thing about Monster
8227860	8234220	Hunter 4 Ultimate is that the multiplayer mode is not going to be region-locked online
8234220	8240060	with North America and Europe, but the weird thing is, not Japanese.
8240060	8242860	So it's still region-locked for Japanese, but North America and Europe will be able
8242860	8243860	to play together.
8243860	8247940	I don't know if that's a language difference, although there's other parts of Europe where
8247940	8249260	they speak other languages than English.
8249260	8250260	I don't know.
8250260	8251260	That's kind of funny.
8251260	8255220	Yeah, I'm not sure what went into that decision, but those walls coming down with region-locking
8255220	8256220	is a good thing.
8256220	8259740	I mean, I know I have friends overseas that I would love to play World of Warcraft with
8259740	8260740	or whatever.
8260740	8263780	I mean, not that I'm really playing WoW anymore, but when I was, I would really love to play
8263780	8267100	with them, but I can't, because they can't roll characters on these servers with the
8267100	8268100	Europe game.
8268100	8269100	It's stupid.
8269100	8270260	It's so stupid.
8270260	8271940	But in Final Fantasy XIV, you can, which is great.
8271940	8273700	I can play on a Japanese server if I want.
8273700	8276020	I'll have lag, but I can do it.
8276100	8278420	I really didn't notice much lag playing on the Japanese server, by the way.
8278420	8279420	It's not that bad at all.
8279420	8280420	No.
8280420	8283620	I used to love playing with the Japanese players in Final Fantasy XIV.
8283620	8285460	Because they freaking know how to play.
8285460	8287660	Well, they used to respect the bard.
8287660	8292780	A bard couldn't get a fucking party because I had a kick-ass bard, too, so.
8292780	8295460	Well, what I have to make a quick mention.
8295460	8299420	I love playing with Japanese players, be using the little translator thingy, because they
8299420	8304100	actually will make sure everyone's ready and move forward at the same time.
8304100	8308500	Even if you were a complete stranger, you were still treated with basic respect and
8308500	8314700	your skills are incorporated into the group properly and not just the party bitch.
8314700	8316700	I'm sorry, healer.
8316700	8320020	Some of those are very well organized, especially the Japanese servers.
8320020	8323660	But they know you'll be lagging like a motherfucker, especially because that's definitely an American
8323660	8324660	right there.
8324660	8325660	And they'll wait.
8325660	8326660	But that's the thing.
8326660	8327660	They'll wait.
8327660	8328660	Yeah.
8328660	8329660	At least most of the ones I've run into.
8329660	8335020	When I played Metal Gear 4 online, as soon as you get on those servers, they kick you
8335020	8336020	out immediately.
8336020	8337020	They just ban you, kind of.
8337020	8338020	Wow.
8338020	8340060	Because they can choice ban you as a vote.
8340060	8344380	Because seeing them playing that game online, when that game came out, that was probably
8344380	8345940	the best Metal Gear Online I played.
8345940	8349700	Because in Japan, it's a game and they have the online games separate.
8349700	8351980	In America, it's just one game.
8351980	8354940	And in going there and seeing them being so organized, I said, okay, I can see why they
8354940	8357080	don't want to lose a match on that.
8357080	8361720	Because if you're lagging it up, you're holding up the team.
8361720	8362720	Yeah.
8362720	8364360	All right.
8364360	8365360	Let's move on.
8365360	8368840	I guess we'll do one more story here, or no, a couple more stories here before the mailbag.
8368840	8369840	Dark Sakura.
8369840	8373960	Well, there's one about the best game ever.
8373960	8377480	Hataful Boyfriend.
8377480	8383240	If no one has ever heard of this game, I don't know why, because it's amazing.
8383240	8388560	Basically it's a game where you get to, you're the only human left and all of the guys left
8388560	8389560	are pigeons.
8389560	8392520	So you have to date a pigeon.
8392520	8398400	You're the last human woman in the world and you have to date a pigeon.
8398400	8400920	You go to an all pigeon high school except for you.
8400920	8405400	Anyway, this game has been out for a little while, since 2011.
8406400	8411360	And yeah, this is done by, well, okay.
8411360	8415360	It was actually done by a manga artist named Hata Moa.
8415360	8420740	And the people who did Amateur Surgeon and Foul Play are going to be putting this out
8420740	8425280	through Steam for $9.99 on August 21st.
8425280	8428400	And it's awesome.
8428400	8434160	Hataful Boyfriend will have, there'll be a collector's edition called Summer of Dove
8434160	8438160	that has a copy of the game as well as the downloadable version of the soundtrack, the
8438160	8443760	digital comic by Moa, wallpapers of one of the game's pigeon heartthrobs, and a digital
8443760	8445800	version of the yearbook.
8445800	8448640	And so the world was engulfed in pudding.
8448640	8454040	So what would be the proper etiquette when you go out on a date with a pigeon, Dark Sakura?
8454040	8457720	Does the pigeon pay, or do you pay, or do you go Dutch, or what?
8457720	8459760	You regurgitate your food to the babies.
8460760	8465360	Oh my gosh, his mother birded it into their mouths.
8465360	8466360	That's a fair response.
8466360	8467360	That's a fair response.
8467360	8469360	Hey, cuckoo motherfucker.
8469360	8470360	Loki.
8470360	8476840	Yeah, it's gonna be hard to follow up, but this is kind of neat, I guess, you know, they've
8476840	8483160	been working together for a while now, but Gust, the company that puts out a lot of different
8483160	8490960	Japanese games, including the popular Atelier series, mainly on PlayStation 3, will now
8490960	8499240	become part of Koei Tecmo, and this is gonna be effective on October 1st.
8499240	8505080	And yeah, so I guess we'll see a lot more Atelier games from them, and maybe some more
8505080	8509920	of the Arto and Leeko series.
8509920	8514960	So these companies are merging and getting bigger and turning into super companies and
8514960	8515960	Voltron.
8515960	8520320	Well, they're like turning from like small companies to mid-sized small companies.
8520320	8523880	I guess Atelier wasn't really a huge, huge, huge developer, so.
8523880	8532000	Well, Gust, yeah, they weren't that huge, but hey, it's good that they'll be around.
8532000	8534880	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
8534880	8536400	Every week you guys send us emails.
8536400	8541120	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com, and DarkSakura picks some of her favorite emails
8541120	8545200	to read right here on the show, although I was gonna say, I don't think there was a big
8545200	8546200	selection this week.
8546200	8550000	We had a very quiet audience.
8550000	8555120	I guess the show we did last week was just so powerful that everybody was just blown
8555120	8557520	away by it and felt no need to email us.
8557520	8559080	I gave everybody the plague.
8559080	8560080	Alright.
8560080	8563720	Again, if you want to email us, participate at orangelaungeradio.com, but in the meantime
8563720	8565760	there's at least one email, right DarkSakura?
8566240	8568560	What's up, OrangeLounge?
8568560	8572240	Can someone remind Loki that Skeezy makes music?
8572240	8576420	Here, Loki, give my next sample a listen.
8576420	8581360	If you have a certain mood or style that you think you can describe, I'm willing to try
8581360	8582600	anything for you.
8582600	8583600	He did send us music.
8583600	8587080	See, I knew that would happen when you complain about not having music for your game.
8587080	8589600	Somebody out there would be like, I do music.
8589600	8592200	Yeah, there's, I don't know.
8592200	8596840	There's a beat, I guess, but yeah, I'll take a look.
8596840	8599960	I'll forward to the email so you can check out the MP3.
8599960	8600960	Is that it?
8600960	8601960	Um, no.
8601960	8602960	Oh.
8602960	8607080	Anyways, but I heard Rob say that he's quote too old, end quote, to be going to midnight
8607080	8612040	releases, but I'm sure you guys have some good memories of standing in line pre-holiday
8612040	8613040	season.
8613040	8616880	Could you share some midnight release moments from the past with us?
8616880	8621920	There was a time that Kristen and I bribed our way into the middle of the line to get
8621920	8626400	wheeze with donuts and coffee.
8626400	8632680	You found fans of OLR fans at, which is, which still blows me away that there's people that
8632680	8636400	recognizes out there, but you found fans of OLR standing in line at target.
8636400	8639760	We asked everyone in line, do you mind if we take this place in line and we will buy
8639760	8642320	you donuts and coffee when Krispy Kreme opens?
8642320	8644160	And they're like, sure.
8644160	8645160	Nice.
8645160	8650720	So, and then we stayed up all night writing bad fan fiction together, which was awesome.
8650760	8656280	And then there was Waiting for the Dreamcast where, um, my friend and I went over to Barnes
8656280	8659480	and Noble and got like really cheap, crappy horror books.
8659480	8666160	And we're reading about really bad vampire stuff in line at the mall sitting on the floor.
8666160	8670340	My midnight release story was when Extrofer was my roommate at the time and he really
8670340	8672760	wanted to play the Wii even more than I did.
8672760	8676360	So I said, here's the cash, you go wait in line and get the Wii and I'm going to sleep.
8676360	8677360	And I did.
8677360	8678360	And he did.
8678360	8679960	And everybody was happy.
8679960	8687880	Oh, now there was Waiting in Line to see, uh, episode one, which God, what was I thinking?
8687880	8690840	Even though it wasn't, you know, it was a movie and not a game release.
8690840	8691840	Yeah.
8691840	8696480	The coolest thing about the whole event, including the movie, were the people under the trees,
8696480	8701880	um, in full costume having a toy lightsaber duels until the cops made them stop.
8701880	8702880	Yeah.
8702880	8706280	I was at the midnight, uh, re uh, release of episode one as well.
8706280	8707280	Yeah.
8707280	8709840	I've done that for a few movies, but I don't do it for a lot of games.
8709840	8715480	The last, honestly, like the last midnight release I really remember going to for a game
8715480	8716800	was Final Fantasy 12.
8716800	8718400	It was a long time ago.
8718400	8721720	Dan did a bunch of them, but he worked at GameStop and GameCrazy.
8721720	8722720	Yeah.
8722720	8725240	Loki, any crazy midnight releases you did?
8725240	8728120	Um, I haven't done too many.
8728120	8731920	I mean, I did those for like the Grand Theft Auto games.
8731920	8737000	Um, like the only one, the last one I remember actually going to midnight release for was
8737000	8743760	San Andreas and that it wasn't that interesting to me and it was just kind of, okay, we're
8743760	8744760	waiting in line.
8744760	8745760	Okay.
8745760	8746760	They're open.
8746760	8747760	Pick up copy.
8747760	8748760	Done.
8748760	8754720	Um, the Wii stuff was fun, but at the same time I already had mine that prior that week.
8754720	8760360	So it wasn't like I was excited to get that day with the whole, I just don't have to do
8760360	8763680	it anymore because like I can't stay up late playing the game because I have to work the
8763680	8768040	next day and if I buy it on a place like Amazon or whatever, they deliver it and it's
8768040	8770560	home when I get home from work and there you go.
8770560	8771560	Yeah.
8771560	8772560	That's pretty much it.
8772560	8774000	I mean, that's what I'll do with Destiny probably.
8774000	8778100	I mean, the only time I'd say that the exception for that is like if I'm going to get a game
8778100	8784000	system day one and I really, you know, need it that, you know, ASAP, but the problem is
8784000	8791720	though nowadays, cause I would just order it for my work and just get it delivered prior
8791720	8792720	to release.
8792760	8793760	I don't know.
8793760	8798480	How about our guests, Jonas, Diego, any, um, crazy midnight stories for you guys to play
8798480	8799480	a game?
8799480	8804360	Um, well, um, I would say also for the Wii when we were, uh, me and my friends were waiting
8804360	8810120	for the Wii release, um, via Walmart and, uh, my one friend had, um, suggested that
8810120	8814240	we would bring a, uh, foldable, unfoldable table, sit down with a couple of chairs and
8814240	8820320	play magic the gathering as we waited and it worked out so well cause, uh, we were so
8820320	8824040	into our game that we forgot that time was passing by and a little bit of coffee that
8824040	8825040	helped out.
8825040	8826040	It helps out too.
8826040	8827040	Yeah.
8827040	8829840	But it was unusual cause a lot of people gathered around us and they're like, well, they thought
8829840	8834440	we were gambling and I was like, no, no, no, no, these are just these cards.
8834440	8835440	And they're like, Oh, okay.
8835440	8836440	We did.
8836440	8840000	And they were going to go tell like security like, no, wait, this is not going down.
8840000	8841000	Like kick them out of line.
8841000	8842680	Like, like you don't see chips here.
8842680	8843680	You don't see nothing.
8843680	8844680	There's nothing going on.
8844680	8845680	There's no money on the tables.
8845680	8846680	Let's just calm down.
8846680	8848360	You probably weren't even playing for Auntie, were you?
8848360	8849360	It's just magic.
8849400	8850400	I know.
8850400	8851400	All right.
8851400	8852400	Jonas?
8852400	8856400	Um, for, for midnight releases, I really don't do those kind of things.
8856400	8861080	But um, the last time I did a midnight release was with my girl, with my fiance now since
8861080	8862080	we're never got engaged.
8862080	8863080	For what game?
8863080	8864800	Um, Pokemon, um, X and Y.
8864800	8865800	There you go.
8865800	8866800	All right.
8866800	8867800	Okay.
8867800	8868800	So I didn't invite her for, for first ever midnight release.
8868800	8869880	That wasn't that long ago.
8869880	8871200	So, so, okay.
8871200	8874960	We went to midnight release and because she's like one of the only girls who actually play
8874960	8879200	Pokemon X, Y, and that line, she, she just played a lot of people and kicked everyone's
8879200	8880200	ass.
8880200	8881680	So wait, she was one of the only girls in line.
8881680	8883600	I would think there are tons of girls that play Pokemon.
8883600	8888360	Oh, well, I was in the Folsom area, but almost everybody was all male.
8888360	8889360	Wow.
8889360	8890360	All right.
8890360	8892960	Well, there are just parts of them that were female.
8892960	8893960	I guess.
8893960	8898200	Well, well, maybe it's the fact too that the women just, you know, they, they knew better
8898200	8899720	to stay home and sleep and rest.
8899720	8900720	You know what?
8900720	8902880	I think midnight releases are fun sometimes.
8902880	8904880	It's just, I'm old.
8904880	8905880	Yeah, me too.
8905880	8906880	And I like to sleep.
8906880	8907880	Me too.
8907880	8908880	It could be fun.
8908880	8909880	I mean, it was just me and my...
8909880	8910880	Get off my lawn.
8910880	8911880	All right.
8911880	8912880	But, but, but, but, but the rest of the email?
8912880	8913880	Yes.
8913880	8914880	Thanks.
8914880	8915880	Much love, ESPZ.
8915880	8918320	Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
8918320	8919320	You're welcome.
8919320	8921320	There it is.
8921320	8926480	Participate at orangelawntrader.com if you would like to take some of Dark Sakura's precious
8926480	8929840	time to have an email read here on the program.
8929840	8932000	You would take my time and my sanity.
8932000	8933000	All right.
8933000	8936480	Well, I guess it was good that our mailbag segment was a little bit shorter tonight because
8936480	8941920	after the mailbag always comes, the FUs of the week.
8955920	8957640	I have two.
8957640	8965720	The first one goes towards people who take up far, far too much personal space than they
8965720	8966720	need to.
8966720	8967720	I'm sorry.
8967720	8972800	You don't have to sit on a public bench with your legs spread out to where you're the size
8972800	8976160	of two people instead of one.
8976160	8977160	Keep them together.
8977160	8978160	No one wants to see your crotch.
8978160	8979160	I don't care who you are.
8979160	8980460	I don't care what gender you are.
8980460	8984400	I don't care if you are a scrawny little two year old.
8984440	8991840	I don't care if you are, I don't know, the biggest Bubba to have ever bubbered.
8991840	8992840	Keep it together.
8992840	8995040	Dark Sakura just doesn't care in general.
8995040	8999560	I think that if a guy is going to sit there with his legs spread out, like, come do me
8999560	9004720	now, then I should be able to sit with my legs spread out and take up more space than
9004720	9005720	possible.
9005720	9008040	But no double standards.
9008040	9009840	So men, keep your legs together.
9009840	9010840	All right.
9010840	9011840	Number two.
9011840	9012840	Number two.
9012840	9013840	The waiting.
9014840	9021240	I want to know now, I want to know, I want the world, I want the world.
9021240	9022240	All right.
9022240	9023240	Loki, how about Europe?
9023240	9024240	Here's the week.
9024240	9026920	All right, ladies, let's let's be real here.
9026920	9027920	Yeah.
9027920	9028920	Crazy sometimes.
9028920	9035520	And, and, and, and I know that you don't like it when men call you crazy, but hear me out
9035520	9036520	today.
9036520	9043520	Let's change the baby as I normally do, because he poops and my wife walks in and she goes,
9043520	9046680	you don't say my name enough.
9046680	9047680	I'm like, what?
9047680	9052360	I'm like, you know, when we're having a conversation, you don't say my name.
9052360	9055320	I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?
9055320	9057240	I say your name all the time.
9057240	9058240	How do I get your attention?
9058240	9059880	Nelly, can you go do this?
9059880	9060880	Nelly do this.
9060880	9061880	Nelly do this.
9061880	9063580	It makes no fucking sense.
9063580	9069140	Why would a woman come into the room and like have this thought in their head and complain
9069140	9070140	about this?
9070140	9072000	It makes no goddamn sense to me.
9072000	9077760	And maybe just because I'm a man, but that's why I call you crazy sometimes because you
9077760	9079480	say crazy things.
9079480	9083920	Maybe if you didn't say crazy things, I wouldn't call you crazy.
9083920	9090240	No one is around you say, baby, I love you, you ain't running games.
9090240	9095900	For the record, that is crazy.
9095900	9100800	Just saying Dan and I pride ourselves on making up weird nicknames for each other.
9100800	9106760	It's not like, you know, I don't refer, like, I don't go, Hey, you, I mean, like, I say,
9106760	9108680	I call her by her name.
9108680	9110560	Like I call my kids by their names.
9110560	9114440	I, when appropriate, I mean, like if I'm talking to you already, I'm not going to just say
9114440	9115440	your name all the time.
9115440	9117000	You know, like call her weird nicknames.
9117000	9119040	No, I don't call her weird nicknames.
9119040	9120760	You call her any fun pet names?
9120760	9121760	Nope.
9121760	9124000	No, maybe you should.
9124000	9126680	Well, no.
9126680	9132560	Make up a fun, crazy nickname and see if she likes that better.
9132560	9134200	Like you could call her Nelly Pop.
9134200	9137840	No, it's unfortunately, it'll just rub off on her kids.
9137840	9140480	Like my, my son already, he doesn't want to go to sleep.
9140480	9145000	You know, if his fan blades on the ceiling fan are facing the right direction, this is
9145000	9146000	the kind of crap.
9146000	9147000	Oh no.
9147000	9148000	So whatever.
9148000	9149000	I'm done.
9149000	9150000	All right.
9150000	9156040	Um, I don't have a whole lot of FUs of the week F F you to the fact that, um, I like
9156080	9157960	only slept for like five hours last night.
9157960	9161400	That would be my FU of the week because sleep is valuable.
9161400	9167440	Um, let me, let me, let's hear more about this sleeping for five hours a night.
9167440	9168440	You know what?
9168440	9169440	Tell me more about it.
9169440	9172440	You're the one that had the kid.
9172440	9173440	Kids.
9173440	9177720	For the record, since there seems to be a mention of this in the chat, Dan just calls
9177720	9180400	me girl and I call him boy.
9180400	9182760	That's what I call you too, girl.
9182760	9183760	Girl don't even.
9183760	9184760	All right.
9185240	9190520	I didn't know Dan and I really do have weird names for each other.
9190520	9191520	I'm not going to get into it.
9191520	9192520	What Alan and I do.
9192520	9195880	It's not none of your business, any of your businesses.
9195880	9196880	All right.
9196880	9197880	Anyhow.
9197880	9198880	Um, moving on.
9198880	9201400	Diego, do you have any FUs?
9201400	9202400	See FUs.
9202400	9206320	Uh, well one that comes to mind, I just said just one because my one, uh, since like me
9206320	9209600	and Jonas do a lot of conventional work and such, and we always influence, especially
9209600	9215040	at Fanime, we influence the, the three, uh, the three standard rule law of, uh, taking
9215040	9220880	it, taking at least one shower, uh, please using some sort of deodorant and by golly
9220880	9225720	drink as much water and food as you can because all these kids running around don't do that.
9225720	9229360	And, and, and for the fact of being illiterate and such forth, or screaming at the top of
9229360	9233240	your lungs when you're doing a tournament and they, they, they, they're staring at you
9233240	9235320	and saying, did you call my name yet?
9235320	9236320	Yes.
9236320	9237760	I, is there a Jason?
9237760	9238760	Jason?
9238920	9239920	Jason here.
9239920	9240920	Jason.
9240920	9241920	Just an example.
9241920	9242920	Let's just put it out there.
9242920	9243920	Just an example.
9243920	9244920	Jason.
9244920	9245920	Jason.
9245920	9247640	And about five, five, 10 minutes later after I disqualified this kid, he comes up, Hey,
9247640	9251800	and I, I literally know where this kid was staying the whole time and he comes like, had
9251800	9252800	I been called yet?
9252800	9255240	I said, are you fucking serious?
9255240	9258920	All Diego, all Jason wants is for you to say his name.
9258920	9260920	No one is around you.
9260920	9262920	Say baby, I love you.
9262920	9264920	If you ain't running game.
9264920	9265920	Say my name.
9265920	9266920	Say my name.
9266920	9272640	Jason's standing in front of me lately.
9272640	9273640	You're hired.
9273640	9275640	You're on the megaphone.
9275640	9280800	I still can't, I still can't hear you lately, Mr. Jason's disqualified when I didn't hear
9280800	9281800	my name then.
9281800	9283440	No, you're still disqualified.
9283440	9285120	It's not going on the wish list.
9285120	9287120	You got to get the fuck out of here.
9287120	9289120	I don't know.
9289120	9290120	I try to improv there.
9290120	9291120	I guess I tried.
9291120	9292120	I tried.
9292120	9293120	Good night, everybody.
9293120	9300560	This week, oh, you just, you just won OLR for the evening.
9300560	9301560	Congratulations.
9301560	9302560	All right.
9302560	9305440	Well I would say, how can we follow that FU of the week?
9305440	9309800	But then I remember Jonas is here for the first time in seven years.
9309800	9310800	Let's hear it.
9310800	9311800	Seven years worth of FUs.
9311800	9314800	Well, I'll keep it short.
9314800	9318920	I mean, I'm more calm nowadays for the past after seven years, but okay.
9318920	9319920	All right.
9319920	9325320	From the big FU to the person who stained my Wii U, it went from-
9325320	9326320	Wait, wait, wait.
9326320	9327800	Who stained your Wii U?
9327800	9328800	No, no, no.
9328800	9329800	Wii controller.
9329800	9330800	Wii remote controller.
9330800	9331800	Okay.
9331800	9332800	I don't even want to know what got on it.
9332800	9333800	Wait, what?
9333800	9335600	What was the stain?
9335600	9336640	Okay.
9336640	9340100	This happened at one of the events.
9340100	9344960	It was white at 10 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, it was like clear white, cleaned
9344960	9345960	up.
9345960	9349440	I come back 11 o'clock, it was brown stained.
9349440	9350440	The Wii strap.
9350440	9352200	Oh, the strap.
9352200	9355760	And we had to clean that up because someone pointed out how nasty it was.
9355760	9359800	I'm like- Oh my God, so somebody tried to put it in
9359800	9360800	their butt?
9360800	9361920	Like how does it- No, no, no.
9361920	9364200	Someone like sweat grease basically.
9364200	9370080	I have some coworkers that the controllers are like, how the fuck is there like wax built
9370080	9371620	up on this shit?
9371620	9374080	What are you guys like sweating like motor oil or something?
9374080	9375080	I don't know.
9375080	9376080	Maybe, maybe.
9376080	9377080	Let's see.
9377720	9378720	Let's see.
9378720	9382600	Another fuck you to like the whole story with the standing situation.
9382600	9388080	Now for those who want to play the B-Money games in Sacramento, you might as well play
9388080	9396720	them as soon as possible because we have unfortunately with the unknown audit, we have to take those
9396720	9400880	games out before, actually with less than 20 days.
9400880	9404920	Get ready to drive to Miggle where it's twice as far and costs twice as much.
9404920	9408960	And sadly, that was actually the place where I can actually practice form a freestyle for
9408960	9411120	the United States Championships for Pump It Up.
9411120	9413600	I'm like, fuck, how am I supposed to practice now?
9413600	9417480	And people are expecting me to be competing with two routines if possible.
9417480	9423560	Yes, I still freestyle, just came back out of nowhere, but unfortunately with what just
9423560	9425640	happened it's going to be a lot tougher to deal with.
9425640	9428720	Well, people have been demanding Dr. Dick to come back too.
9428720	9430240	So someday, someday.
9430240	9431240	I know.
9431240	9432240	It's raining midroutine.
9432240	9433240	Yep.
9433240	9434240	Someday, someday.
9434240	9438480	Very, like 2% of our listeners get that joke, get that, that's it.
9438480	9443120	A critical fuck you, and hopefully this gets into people's heads, fuck you to those who
9443120	9449040	are trying to bring illegal like ROMs and stuff or even requesting it to the game rooms
9449040	9450840	or even like hack stuff.
9450840	9457520	FYI, you guys, there's actual companies like Nintendo, Sony watching these conventions.
9457520	9462520	You don't want conventions to get shut down or get sued, you all know the strict legal
9462520	9463520	laws of these things.
9463800	9466440	And we don't want to be held responsible for that.
9466440	9469520	Let's say this happens, let's say a really good event like Gamer X.
9469520	9475880	Yeah, where 2K and Ubisoft are present, it's like, in Gearbox, let's play a pirated version
9475880	9476880	of Rayman.
9476880	9477880	Yeah, let's not do that, yo.
9477880	9478880	Let's not.
9478880	9482920	Like, I know this is a big issue with like the Project M community, it's like, look,
9482920	9485040	it's a modern game, we can't do that.
9485040	9486040	Right, right.
9486040	9490040	Because even Nintendo said don't bring that to us, we can't have that.
9490560	9494040	Again, we just don't want these conventions to get in trouble because it hurts the industry,
9494040	9495640	it hurts us, it hurts the community.
9495640	9498360	You can go up to your hotel room and play all the Project M you want.
9498360	9499360	Yes, exactly.
9499360	9501360	Take it out of public sight.
9502360	9503360	Alright.
9503360	9506160	Um, I think that's about it for now.
9506160	9507160	Alright, for now.
9507160	9509160	For now, alright.
9509160	9511360	There it is, folks, the FUs of the week.
9511360	9514560	It was a little bit longer tonight, but you know, Jonas was here, that was gonna happen.
9514560	9518560	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to your calls.
9519080	9522080	If you want to call in and say FU, but then I can just hang up on you, but if you have
9522080	9526880	something you want to actually talk about, whether we missed it or whether there's a
9526880	9531480	new story that you want to give an opinion on, perhaps the whole EA Pass thing that we
9531480	9536360	talked about earlier in the show or, you know, you want to talk to us about the Evil G's
9536360	9538840	credit card or whatever, we can talk about that.
9538840	9543160	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, but first, we have a couple
9543160	9544160	more stories.
9544160	9545160	Loki.
9545280	9551360	So, Monopoly has had several, several themed versions of their game, including a Super
9551360	9554720	Mario Bros. version and World of Warcraft version.
9554720	9560400	Well, now there's gonna be the Legend of Zelda edition that's gonna be coming out on September
9560400	9569960	15th and, um, it is all Hyrule themed and they've got, uh, you know, all sorts of cool
9569960	9570960	game pieces.
9570960	9572520	There's like a Triforce in there.
9572520	9573520	I'm trying to see.
9573520	9574520	This picture is so tiny.
9574880	9579160	Soon to be seen in convention board game rooms everywhere across America, right?
9579160	9580160	Yes.
9580160	9585720	And, um, you know, apparently, I'm trying to see here, uh, oh, here we go.
9585720	9593280	The choice is that you'll have a bow, a hook, shot, boomerang, Triforce, or shield, um,
9593280	9600440	are gonna be available and, uh, also, I guess, if you want to shop at the Evil G, they also
9600440	9609520	have an Ocarina of Time as well and, uh, six power cards that tweak the gameplay and some
9609520	9613240	sort of lithograph of the Hyrule map if you want to purchase it from the Evil G.
9613240	9620400	So, all right, looks kind of neat, I guess.
9620400	9622320	I would like to get my hands on that, actually.
9622320	9623320	I have that.
9623320	9626120	There was a Mario Monopoly not that long ago that I have, like, it was like Nintendo or
9626120	9627120	something, so.
9627120	9628120	Yeah, both.
9628120	9629120	Yeah.
9629120	9630120	So, why not?
9630800	9631800	All right.
9631800	9632800	Well, one more story for you guys.
9632800	9636800	This is a little bit of a warning to those of you that downloaded The Sims 2 by EA.
9636800	9642560	Heads up, Dar Sakura, Loki, those of you that, uh, got your free Sims 2, it has come to people's
9642560	9649640	attention that, uh, Sims 2 contained Securom, which you might remember from a long time
9649640	9650640	ago, right?
9650640	9651640	Yeah.
9651640	9652640	We talked about this on the show before.
9652640	9660160	Securom was a pretty intrusive form of, um, uh, anti, uh, or the copy protection scheme
9660160	9663760	that they would have in the game there that had the potential to screw up other games
9663760	9664760	on your computer.
9664760	9669080	Uh, it would bury itself in your registry and it's a real pain in the ass to get out.
9669080	9673640	So, just a heads up, if you installed Sims 2, your computer probably has Securom in it
9673640	9674640	now.
9674640	9675640	Um, you can get rid of it.
9675640	9679220	There's, uh, you know, just Google it if you want a how to remove Securom, although look
9679220	9683380	for instructions, not for software, because the software probably has viruses.
9683380	9685180	So, there's instructions out there.
9685180	9690140	Um, other games that have the, uh, Securom, if you didn't know, BioShock, Mass Effect,
9690140	9693580	Spore, which is a huge one, because this is a big part of the reason why people pirated
9693580	9699100	Spore back when it came out, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, Dragon Age 2, Final Fantasy 7
9699100	9704260	on PC, the re-release, um, so there you go, so, uh, you might want to check your registry,
9704260	9707740	see if Securom's there, unless you don't care, if you don't care, then there you go, but,
9707740	9710820	uh, if you do care, and you want to get that shit off your computer, you might need to
9710820	9717980	look into that, so, there it goes, so, you'll have to, uh, quarantine Sims 2 like it was
9717980	9722700	an Ebola virus or something, or, or, send it back to where it came, to, to, to its homeland
9722700	9723700	or something, I don't know.
9723700	9727460	Alright, uh, there it is, 1-877-GAMO-L-R, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd
9727460	9731980	like to give us a call, and, uh, we can talk about whatever's on your mind, while we wait
9731980	9733860	for the calls to come in, if any come in at all.
9733860	9736860	For, for the record, Avast caught it, like, right away.
9737260	9738260	Oh, good.
9738260	9739260	Yeah.
9739260	9740260	So, don't worry about it.
9740260	9741260	That's good.
9741260	9742260	There you go.
9742260	9749220	Um, let's see, uh, I'm looking in our chat here, over at live.vognetware.com, um, cause,
9749220	9754180	Kossen says, this is why you quarantine Origin, I always mispronounce his name, sorry, oh
9754180	9757500	no, as my Vista partition has been corrupted, how will I live?
9757500	9763420	Hey, that's what happened with Spore on my computer, our Vista, I think it's a joke.
9763460	9766860	Uh, alright, uh, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
9766860	9771100	Sure, this is pretty exciting, um, there's gonna be a brand new adventure, point and
9771100	9777300	click adventure game called Randall's Monday, and why is it even more awesome?
9777300	9781820	Because Randall, or I should say, the actor Jeff Anderson, Randall from Clerks, will be
9781820	9783140	doing the voice of Randall.
9783140	9786020	I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
9786020	9789620	Uh, I believe that would have been Dante.
9789620	9792060	I thought they both said it.
9792060	9793060	No.
9793700	9800340	Um, so, I'll probably have to get that game, cause it looks pretty awesome.
9800340	9805100	And I'll just pretend it's Randall from Clerks, even if it's not really Randall from Clerks.
9805100	9807820	Randall from Clerks was the one that said, this job would be great if it wasn't for the
9807820	9809540	fucking customers, right?
9809540	9810540	Yeah.
9810540	9811540	There you go.
9811540	9816260	But you hate people, but I love gatherings, isn't it ironic?
9816260	9819860	Oh, that's such a good movie, I wonder if they ever will make a Clerks 3.
9819860	9821260	I hope they do.
9821500	9827380	I heard something where like, Miramax rejected the script, or rejected it or something.
9827380	9830660	Or whatever, the Weinstein company or whoever does these movies now.
9830660	9836500	Uh, 1877 game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, meanwhile I do have a few tweets
9836500	9838460	I could read here.
9838460	9844260	One of the tweets is from SSG100Matt, who says, the folks at Overclocked Remix have
9844260	9849820	released a Game Boy 25th anniversary album, and of course it's free, and you can check
9849820	9854540	that out at gameboy25.ocremix.com.
9854540	9855540	Wait, free?
9855540	9856540	Mm-hmm.
9856540	9857540	I like free.
9857540	9860020	That's OC Remix album, they do a lot of stuff for free.
9860020	9863540	And yes, the Game Boy is 25 years old, are you okay?
9863540	9865540	Okay, read it.
9865540	9868340	What is this you're going to show me?
9868340	9872420	I had to show it to somebody.
9872420	9877140	You guys have problems, stop interrupting the radio show through Tumblr posts.
9878140	9886860	All right, uh, let's see, 13Forever, 13CrossForever, 13XForever says, as I can't call in, you and
9886860	9892580	any listener with at least passing interest in JRPGs should research Kiss Case series
9892580	9894460	and buy Trails in the Sky.
9894460	9896900	I'm not familiar with this one, Logan, you heard of this one?
9896900	9900700	Trails in the Sky is, I think, one of those games that was built with RPG Maker, and they
9900700	9904920	actually have that part of the RPG Maker Humble Bundle, if I remember correctly.
9904920	9907440	So yes, I'm a little familiar with it.
9907440	9908440	Supposed to be pretty good.
9908440	9911960	I don't know, Jamie would know she bought that Humble Bundle.
9911960	9914200	I did, but I haven't touched it yet.
9914200	9920600	I bet I have it, I probably purchased it at some point, it's probably on my Steam library
9920600	9924680	or something, I don't even know if it's on Steam or something, but I've got so many games.
9924680	9929480	Dartitsuya tweets us and says, on the whole Scandia controversy, some people were suggesting
9929480	9931240	a Kickstarter, so stay tuned.
9931240	9933200	What's a Kickstarter going to do in that situation?
9933200	9937520	Open a Zone Arcade, that's a lofty goal.
9937520	9941960	On the topic of that, it has been done for arcades before, I'm not sure if anybody has
9941960	9945160	heard about the Super Arcade on Kickstarter.
9945160	9946160	I don't think so.
9946160	9947160	Tell me more.
9947160	9951160	Okay, so the idea of what happened with Super Arcade when they did the Kickstarter was to
9951160	9956560	keep the arcade running because the guy was using all his financial assets to make sure
9956560	9962720	it runs, and to renovate to make it even look better for a wide variety of audiences.
9962760	9967000	Right now, they're currently in the assembly, like reassembling the whole location.
9967000	9973000	I think the idea of a Kickstarter would be great, but before even doing that, before
9973000	9977280	the Kickstarter, they had to figure out the location, whether it may be in the Thomas
9977280	9984720	area or even Elk Grove, or just a location where it actually suits everybody.
9984720	9985720	Or those who are-
9985720	9989800	Downtown, sell booze, that's a great formula.
9989840	9993480	Actually, downtown is kind of a hit and miss at the moment, because the reason why is because
9993480	9995880	currently the arena is being-
9995880	10000600	Oh, shit, yeah, and it's going to jack all the prices up downtown, too.
10000600	10006280	Yeah, it's going to jack up the prices downtown, and it may also make operations a lot difficult
10006280	10007280	because of parking.
10007280	10008280	Yeah, makes sense.
10008280	10010640	I think everybody remembered Nickel Arcade.
10010640	10014960	Oh, God, yeah, see, I remember that, that was what I was going to say, downtown is not
10014960	10016960	a good place for an arcade.
10017800	10021200	All right, maybe Roseville, I don't know, they used to, speaking of Nickel Arcades,
10021200	10022200	they used to have NickelMania and Rose-
10022200	10023200	Citrus Heights?
10023200	10024200	Who knows?
10024200	10025760	I mean, not bad, I mean, no.
10025760	10031120	But regardless, I mean, yes, there needs to be an arcade location, like at least known
10031120	10036960	soon before the scramble, or the location the arcade's going to be at.
10036960	10037960	Right, right.
10037960	10041320	Like, the arcade machines will be sold to other places, or will be kept still in the
10041320	10043920	Sacramento area for another location to keep-
10044880	10046880	It'll be interesting to see what develops with that.
10046880	10048720	Oh, yeah, the old Birdcage.
10048720	10050200	The old Birdcage Arcade.
10050200	10055360	All right, 1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give
10055360	10056680	us a call.
10056680	10063000	We keep talking about all this local drama, but there is a whole world out there of people.
10063000	10066540	And Dartasuya in our chat room, following up, saying, yeah, they're just discussing
10066540	10069040	it at the moment, but I'm keeping an ear out.
10069040	10071880	Let's see.
10072320	10074800	There's some folks talking about the Clerks 3 thing in chat.
10074800	10080520	SHO 100 Matt says, Kevin Smith is going to, but nobody ever got paid for Clerks 2, so
10080520	10083640	he's sorting out the legal stuff for the Weinstein's for that first.
10083640	10085600	So maybe they'll work it out, who knows.
10085600	10087040	We do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.
10087040	10089200	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10089200	10091200	This is Rageinator.
10091200	10093200	Hey, Rageinator, what's up, buddy?
10093200	10095200	Excuse me.
10095520	10103640	Now, just a little bit of news, that beer is repeating.
10103640	10109400	You know how for the past few weeks, I've been promoting or passing along information
10109400	10114240	about the free games that have been given away by PC Gamer?
10114240	10115720	We love free things.
10115720	10116720	Yeah.
10117240	10126240	Well, the promotion is more or less in its, quote, unquote, final week.
10126240	10136240	It's like they're essentially recapping the bundle that they've been giving away.
10136240	10142240	This is essentially the last chance to get any games that you may have missed.
10142760	10146760	And there's one or two gems in there.
10146760	10149760	They're actually quite good.
10149760	10154760	One of which is Dino D-Day, which obviously appeared for a while.
10154760	10165760	It's basically, imagine a PlayStation 2 era Medal of Honor game, but both sides,
10166280	10173280	from human characters, you also have dinosaurs, the choice of playing as a dinosaur as well.
10173280	10174280	Wait, wait, wait.
10174280	10175280	You can play as a dinosaur?
10175280	10176280	Yeah.
10176280	10178280	Or a human.
10178280	10180280	It's like Jurassic Park on the Genesis.
10180280	10182280	That was cool.
10182280	10189280	Basically, well, like I said, in terms of graphics, it looks exactly like a PlayStation
10189280	10197800	2 era Medal of Honor game, and kind of plays like one or two, just with the inclusion
10197800	10198800	of dinosaurs.
10198800	10199800	All right.
10199800	10202280	I think everybody perked up when you said that dinosaurs were involved, so tell us one
10202280	10204280	more time where we can grab this.
10204280	10217280	PC Gamer, I believe on top of the websites, there's like a scrolling banner, and you just
10218280	10229280	mentioned the increasing giveaway, and there's another really good one, which is a constant
10229280	10233280	shooter called Really Big Sky.
10233280	10234280	Oh, yeah.
10234280	10235280	I have that game.
10235280	10236280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10236280	10243280	Yeah, that's really fun, and I forget what else there is in there.
10243280	10247280	It's a total of five games all together.
10247280	10253280	And here's the thing, Really Big Sky has trading cards in it, so hypothetically, you could
10253280	10257280	grab this free game and then sell the trading cards, and you'd have like a dollar.
10257280	10259280	Yeah, exactly.
10259280	10267280	And at Dafta, I see in a chat that at Dafta is asking what the website is.
10267280	10275280	It's PC Gamer, PC Gamer, gamer.com.
10275280	10279280	And there's also this website called Google, and you put PC Gamer into it, and you're likely
10279280	10281280	to get that as the first result, I think.
10281280	10283280	It's a pretty big banner that you can click on.
10283280	10285280	I actually redeemed all of these.
10285280	10288280	I already had Gun Monkey, well, except for Gun Monkeys, because I already had Gun Monkeys,
10288280	10291280	and I actually have two copies of Gun Monkeys.
10291280	10292280	Wait, wait, wait.
10292280	10293280	Monkeys with guns?
10293280	10295280	Yes, it's like Smash Brothers.
10295280	10296280	Cool.
10296280	10297280	What the heck?
10297280	10299280	But with Monkeys and Guns.
10299280	10302280	Let's talk more about the Gun Monkeys.
10302280	10304280	First off, why don't you give a monkey a gun?
10304280	10307280	I don't know, you want a copy of the game, I have an extra Steam Key, because each one
10307280	10310280	you redeem, including this, if you get it for free, you get two.
10310280	10312280	Hell yeah, if Monkeys with Guns are involved, I want it.
10312280	10313280	I want Monkeys with Guns.
10313280	10316280	That's like Planet of the Apes again in the movie, right?
10316280	10317280	Do you know what?
10317280	10318280	This game is officially a virus.
10318280	10325280	PC Gamer.com, go to the free Steam Key thing, you just have to like bundle stars and stuff,
10325280	10329280	but the thing is, you can always unsubscribe.
10329280	10331280	Yeah, like, key, unlike.
10331280	10333280	Done.
10333280	10340280	Yeah, you also have to bring your email address, but if you really don't want to bring an actual
10340280	10345280	email address that you use, you can make up an email address, like you can put in, you
10345280	10353280	know, fart.fartataol.com.
10353280	10357280	To be fair though, I mean, bundle stars, and there's a lot of other services out there
10357280	10361280	like that, they'll do a lot of these Steam bundles, and they're really, really cheap,
10361280	10366280	but then again, they're also really, really like, I mean, if you're looking to build up
10366280	10371280	your Steam library and you don't give a shit what's in there, bundle stars is the way to
10371280	10372280	go.
10372280	10375280	Like, for example, they have this one bundle here that's $3.49 and you get like eight games
10375280	10376280	with it.
10376280	10379280	Yeah, but what games are they?
10379280	10382280	You know, push space barf to change the color of your screen?
10382280	10387280	I don't know, they have decent games like vector, which is sort of like, it's a free
10387280	10388280	running game.
10388280	10392280	They have, this is actually a bad example, this one doesn't have a lot of cool stuff
10392280	10396280	in there, but there's actually some other ones that were pretty sweet that I've gotten
10396280	10398280	before, there was like a racing one.
10398280	10403280	Here you go, reboot 6.0, it's $2.99, you get postal, underground, block land, which is
10403280	10407280	actually pretty cool, it's like a cross between Lego and a first person shooter.
10407280	10408280	Oh, that's cool.
10409280	10414280	They have Steel Storm, Rock of Ages, and Expeditions Conquistador, so not bad.
10414280	10418280	I would have gotten that, except they have most of those games.
10418280	10420280	So, you know, $2.99 though?
10420280	10430280	Yeah, honestly, after the fact I saw the Hokies during the bundle stars group, I joined just
10430280	10441280	a sheer curiosity, and my only, although I'm in the minority here, my only problem with
10441280	10450280	buying games from the stars, or even buying games from Amazon or Google games or whatever,
10450280	10457280	is that I'm probably one of the few people out there that does not have a debit card
10457280	10466280	or credit card or what have you, and even when I had a Playstation 3 or an Xbox 360,
10466280	10476280	how I put paper stuff is through PSN cards or points cards or now Steam cards.
10476280	10480280	Well, Raginator GameStop's got a deal for you.
10480280	10482280	Look out.
10482280	10490280	Yeah, Raginator, they can ask with a chainsaw, they go to GameStop.
10490280	10495280	Wow. All right, Raginator, I gotta let you go so we can try to get some more calls, but
10495280	10498280	have fun with the dinosaurs and monkeys with guns, okay?
10498280	10500280	Have a nice night.
10500280	10501280	All right, bye.
10501280	10506280	All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call.
10506280	10511280	Maybe you know animals doing crazy things in video games that you want to share with us.
10511280	10514280	Jurassic Park, the movie, the fighting game.
10514280	10515280	Was that actually a thing?
10515280	10517280	No, but I wish it was.
10517280	10524280	They have Jurassic World next year. We'll probably get some game tie-ins with that, at least I can hope.
10524280	10528280	I still remember the Jurassic Park game on Super Nintendo because it was kind of at the height of the goons.
10528280	10531280	Even the Genesis one was crazy. They're good in different ways.
10531280	10535280	They were totally different, but the Super Nintendo one had the first person super pixelated.
10535280	10536280	Oh, yes, I remember that.
10536280	10541280	Like when the velociraptors would literally jump out from behind shit and scary.
10541280	10542280	Crazy little things like that.
10542280	10545280	I still like the Sega one. You still sit down.
10545280	10547280	Oh, yeah, that's right, the mechanic.
10547280	10548280	Was that a side-scroller?
10548280	10549280	No, it was a shooting game.
10549280	10550280	The arcade.
10550280	10553280	That one was great, yeah, definitely.
10553280	10559280	Which, by the way, I totally forgot what I was going to say, never mind.
10559280	10560280	All right, fair enough.
10560280	10562280	One last chance if you want to give us a call.
10562280	10564280	Every gamer has a voice, but only if you use it.
10564280	10568280	1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10568280	10571280	Tigerclaw reminding us that Chris Pratt is in Jurassic World.
10571280	10576280	Well, that guy's headed straight for the A-list between Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World.
10576280	10578280	I'm sure he's going to do really well, and people love their parks and rec.
10578280	10582280	So that guy making good moves, good career choices.
10582280	10585280	So he's just destined to star in some flop in a couple of years.
10585280	10590280	Like, remember when Halle Berry won the Oscar, and then she did Catwoman?
10590280	10592280	Not a good career move.
10592280	10597280	I'm sorry, there's one thing I care about, one thing that has to happen in my lifetime.
10597280	10598280	What?
10598280	10602280	An actual, for real, wonderfully well done Deadpool movie.
10602280	10606280	Well, you know, that footage online, it's possible.
10606280	10608280	Yeah, that was pretty cool.
10608280	10609280	I know.
10609280	10610280	Very cool.
10610280	10612280	So, how about a Wonder Woman movie?
10612280	10614280	That's what I want to see.
10614280	10618280	If we can have Guardians of the Galaxy, we can have a solo Wonder Woman movie.
10618280	10624280	Should we be doing that after the whole Marvel, or is it the Batman and Superman movie?
10624280	10626280	Don't call it a Justice League movie, but it kind of is.
10626280	10632280	For the record, I think that Gal Gadot is absolutely gorgeous.
10632280	10634280	And I would go see it just for her.
10634280	10637280	We briefly, you know, because you weren't here last week actually,
10637280	10641280	and since we aren't getting a lot of calls tonight, it's a good time for me to kind of ask you about this.
10641280	10645280	Surely you saw the costume. I'm curious on your thoughts, because I was kind of like,
10645280	10650280	Well, okay. I didn't hate it, but I was very much like, she does look like Xena.
10650280	10653280	Everyone was like, it's all brown, it's all brown.
10653280	10657280	And I'm like, so is everything around her. It could be lighting.
10657280	10661280	I mean, I didn't get a really good high-res picture, so I could tell.
10661280	10664280	But I mean, it could very well have just been lighting.
10664280	10666280	She could have been drenched in blood.
10666280	10668280	The blood of her enemies.
10668280	10669280	Perhaps.
10669280	10672280	Although, I have to say that I did like the style.
10672280	10678280	I like the sword and all that, but she's got to have a lasso that makes people tell the truth at some point.
10678280	10681280	I mean, it's Wonder Woman.
10681280	10684280	Well, you know about how the character came across, right?
10684280	10685280	What do you mean?
10685280	10688280	The guy who created Wonder Woman was a fetishist.
10688280	10689280	Oh, lord.
10689280	10690280	No, seriously.
10690280	10691280	Wow.
10691280	10696280	The lasso had to relate it back to the whole lie detector test.
10696280	10701280	And any time that she was, her weakness is being bound by a man.
10701280	10702280	Wow.
10702280	10704280	And she loses her abilities.
10704280	10705280	Huh.
10705280	10708280	I don't remember Linda Carter doing that.
10708280	10713280	This was the early iteration, and there was a lot of tying people up in Wonder Woman.
10713280	10714280	Bound by a man.
10714280	10716280	Interesting. Very interesting.
10716280	10720280	Alright. Well, that is, and Dungeon Buster is pointing out the lasso is there.
10720280	10722280	It's right next to her sword hand on her hip.
10722280	10723280	Oh, good. I missed that.
10723280	10726280	I guess I didn't see, I just saw the little Twitter picture. I didn't see the, oh.
10726280	10728280	So that's good. I'm glad to hear it.
10728280	10731280	Alright. Well, that's, I guess, going to do it.
10731280	10735280	We're not getting any of the calls tonight, so our audience is just being shy.
10735280	10736280	I see how it is.
10736280	10738280	If you want to email us, you sure can.
10738280	10743280	You can send an email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
10743280	10745280	But for now, we're going to wrap up here in studio.
10745280	10747280	We're on our way out tonight.
10747280	10748280	I want to say thanks to our guests.
10748280	10750280	Diego, great to meet you.
10750280	10751280	Oh, it's a pleasure. Definitely.
10751280	10755280	And best of luck with SacAnime coming up in a few weeks.
10755280	10760280	I'm sorry I can't go myself, but DarkSakura will go and tell me all about the fabulous teabagging going on there.
10760280	10762280	Fabulous teabagging.
10762280	10763280	That's right.
10763280	10770280	Maybe, you know, she participated in a cosplay tournament at GamerX, so maybe she'll do one of your gaming tournaments.
10770280	10772280	Oh, wow. That would be really nice.
10772280	10773280	There you go.
10773280	10776280	She can kick somebody's ass at Tekken. I don't know if that's a thing you guys do.
10776280	10777280	Oh, that'd be good.
10777280	10783280	It's been ages since I was at my legendary level of skill in Tekken 3.
10783280	10785280	Do you like how I'm volunteering for stuff, too?
10785280	10788280	Wow, that's amazing. We have our own little Tekken player in our group, too.
10788280	10793280	And he goes under the name Heisenberg, I guess, but he just took that off of...
10793280	10797280	My last regular ongoing Tekken playing was in Tekken 4.
10797280	10798280	Oh, 4, yeah.
10798280	10802280	But my regular wasn't... They changed all of Jin's moves for 4.
10802280	10803280	Oh, damn.
10803280	10806280	And he was my regular in 3, so...
10806280	10807280	Yeah.
10807280	10808280	Him and Julia.
10808280	10812280	I like the one that did the capoeira dancing because you could just button mash.
10812280	10814280	Yeah, you could just button mash. It was great.
10814280	10818280	However, if you actually could play him without mashing, oh my god, even better.
10818280	10819280	Yeah.
10819280	10820280	Oh, yes.
10820280	10822280	Seriously. It's like watching... You don't know what you're watching.
10822280	10824280	It's just like suddenly there's feet.
10824280	10825280	Yeah.
10825280	10827280	Yeah, but it'll be good to see you there.
10827280	10829280	And the second one is just getting bigger.
10829280	10832280	And we want to make this one the best one possible.
10832280	10834280	And I think you would agree, Jonas, right?
10834280	10839280	Oh, yeah. Especially with the new change in the direction of things, as well.
10839280	10845280	Like new generation of systems and the higher demand of new games coming out.
10845280	10849280	I'll bust out the Homestuck cosplay again.
10849280	10850280	All right.
10850280	10851280	I'm one of them.
10851280	10852280	No, it's cool.
10852280	10857280	Actually, speaking on the Homestuck topic of things.
10857280	10861280	Surprisingly, I know people are sometimes concerned, like convention people can criticize Homestuck,
10861280	10865280	but for us game rooms, we're actually 100% welcoming the Homestuck crew
10865280	10868280	because a lot of them actually play our games, especially the Just Dance section.
10868280	10873280	This is as long as they don't get Ben Nye all over the controllers.
10873280	10875280	We'll make sure of that.
10875280	10877280	Emperor of Husky is in chat right now saying,
10877280	10880280	I hope to see Dark Sakura at SacAnime.
10880280	10882280	Oh, is it Wendell?
10882280	10884280	I love you, Wendell.
10884280	10885280	You're in demand.
10885280	10886280	I want to go.
10886280	10889280	All right, if my costume still fits me, I'll wear it.
10889280	10890280	All right.
10890280	10892280	My costume is actually just a slight bit too big for me,
10892280	10895280	and I hope to have a little bit less by the time.
10895280	10896280	There you go.
10896280	10897280	Take it in.
10897280	10899280	Easier to take it in than let it out.
10899280	10900280	I can't sew for shit.
10900280	10902280	I hear that.
10902280	10904280	Awesome.
10904280	10909280	I would say I'm almost sad that I'm going to Dragon Con, but to be honest, I'm really not.
10909280	10915280	I'm fucking excited for Dragon Con, but I'm sad that they have to be the same weekend.
10915280	10918280	That's a pain in the butt.
10918280	10920280	Diego, now it's tradition here at OLR.
10920280	10923280	We always ask everybody to give their final thought, like Jerry Springer style.
10923280	10928280	Do you have a final thought, a final note for our listeners tonight?
10928280	10933280	Final thought?
10933280	10936280	Do you have another song parody you'd like to build out for us?
10936280	10940280	I don't know. Whenever I hear a song itself, I usually try to change the lyrics around the spot.
10940280	10941280	Fair enough.
10941280	10947280	Final thought is listen when your name's called out when I'm running a tournament.
10947280	10948280	That's right.
10948280	10951280	Pay attention. Be smart.
10951280	10956280	I don't know. Just try not to be like the typical con goer, but that's not going to change.
10956280	10959280	Your final thought is when I talk, you listen.
10959280	10960280	I hope so.
10960280	10961280	When anyone does so.
10961280	10962280	It feels bad.
10962280	10968280	Like we list up so many people and about a fourth of those people just drop out because they don't show up or something.
10968280	10972280	I'm like, well, oh, well, let's just go on to the next bracket.
10972280	10974280	Let's go on to the next pairing.
10974280	10976280	It's OK. It's just that's not going to stop us.
10976280	10978280	And we can satisfy the majority.
10978280	10979280	We did our job.
10979280	10981280	That's the whole thing.
10981280	10983280	All right. Thanks again for being here, buddy.
10983280	10985280	Well, you're welcome back any time.
10985280	10990280	Jonas, it's so good to see you again after years and years and years and years, far too long.
10990280	10992280	Thank you for gracing us with your presence tonight.
10992280	10994280	Best of luck teabagging at SacAnime.
10994280	10995280	Oh, definitely.
10995280	10997280	Your teabag orgy and all that stuff.
10997280	10999280	I love that. I love that.
10999280	11001280	I hope to see you guys at a future con.
11001280	11003280	And yeah, come back any time.
11003280	11004280	Oh, definitely.
11004280	11005280	Now you know where we're at.
11005280	11007280	Yeah, that's actually one of my final thoughts.
11007280	11010280	We could probably bring some of our other crew members here.
11010280	11013280	Right now, it's just me and Diego right now.
11013280	11017280	And we wanted to give this a big test after like seven years of not being in the show.
11017280	11018280	So I was like, OK.
11018280	11019280	All right.
11019280	11022280	And we thought, OK, this would be a great opportunity to network and stuff.
11022280	11023280	All right. Sounds good.
11023280	11026280	Next time, though, we've got to hook up some games to the TV and get playing during the show.
11026280	11029280	So I'll let you guys choose what to bring.
11029280	11030280	Oh, cool. Awesome.
11030280	11031280	All right.
11031280	11032280	Thank you again for being here.
11032280	11034280	A final thought from you, sir.
11034280	11037280	That was actually my final thought was like to be continued, like, OK,
11037280	11041280	we're going to have new people in the show to actually speak their mind of things.
11041280	11044280	As you can see, you saw how Diego I was talking to.
11044280	11046280	He had a couple of laughs.
11046280	11048280	Where every gamer has a voice.
11048280	11049280	Oh, yeah.
11049280	11050280	Bring me more gamers.
11050280	11051280	Lend me their voices.
11051280	11057280	And of course, minus that part, that's actually two little things to discuss.
11057280	11059280	Make sure you guys have the hygiene, of course.
11059280	11060280	Make sure shower.
11060280	11062280	I don't want to see another brown stain.
11062280	11066280	And if I may add, it's not just acts bathe.
11066280	11068280	Yes, please.
11068280	11074280	And of course, of course, with my Facebook message being blown up over this whole San Diego Comic Con,
11074280	11078280	with the sexual harassment incident with the cosplayer.
11078280	11081280	Everybody, please get concrete information.
11081280	11085280	Don't go spreading the wrong information because it all caused more confusion.
11085280	11087280	And don't listen to the girl's mom.
11087280	11090280	I think that goes for anything.
11090280	11092280	Like, don't fucking spread rumors.
11092280	11093280	Stop it.
11093280	11094280	Yeah, pretty much.
11094280	11095280	I will tell you this.
11095280	11099280	There's a reason I reposted things is because when they were still looking for apparently the person.
11099280	11100280	Sure.
11100280	11106280	When you spread the information like that, there is a chance that in the legitimate cases, people will have witnesses.
11106280	11107280	It's spreading awareness.
11107280	11113280	However, when the final word came out, there were still people going,
11113280	11114280	Oh, I bet that's not true.
11114280	11115280	I bet that's not true.
11115280	11117280	And no, it was true.
11117280	11127280	So I still, my personal thought on this, I still don't really believe the whole story yet because we don't have the whole story.
11127280	11131280	I just, I know the authorities were looking for a certain person so they could ask some questions.
11131280	11132280	They could do their job.
11132280	11137280	I hope they are able to do their job and figure out a very ugly situation.
11137280	11140280	Anyhow, thanks again guys for being here.
11140280	11141280	Really appreciate it.
11141280	11144280	Loki, since you're over there, we'll see you next week.
11144280	11146280	Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
11146280	11150280	Um, no.
11150280	11151280	I don't know.
11151280	11156280	I'm very jealous that Vanguard V has a pretty awesome title theme.
11156280	11159280	Wish I could find one of those for free.
11159280	11161280	That's why it's awesome it's not free.
11161280	11162280	Anyway, my...
11162280	11164280	They're never going to hit their Kickstarter goal, by the way.
11164280	11167280	There's no way they're going to make a hundred and...
11167280	11168280	That's too bad.
11168280	11169280	Yeah, it's not going to happen.
11169280	11170280	I'm sad.
11170280	11175280	As always, I just want to say, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lunch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
11175280	11177280	Help spread the word about Orange Lunch Radio.
11177280	11181280	Because, you know, we don't have big magazines or huge million dollar websites backing us.
11181280	11183280	We never have for the past twelve years.
11183280	11185280	So tell a friend or fifty about the show.
11185280	11188280	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
11188280	11189280	And that's all we ask.
11189280	11192280	My final thought tonight otherwise is...
11192280	11194280	I'm craving some more of that apple soda.
11194280	11195280	That was really good.
11195280	11197280	Apple soda, who would have thought?
11197280	11199280	The El Forastero.
11199280	11200280	Yeah, right, right.
11200280	11202280	Just tell everybody where I live, Dark Sakura.
11202280	11203280	Alright, just kidding.
11203280	11206280	There are five of them in freakin' town, Rob.
11206280	11207280	Fair enough, fair enough.
11207280	11214280	And they're almost indistinguishable from at Alberto's, Carolina's, and all of the other places that are technically all...
11214280	11216280	were part of the same chain and then split apart.
11216280	11218280	I was going to say, probably all owned by the same person.
11218280	11219280	No, no, it's actually true.
11219280	11221280	They all started off as at Alberto's and then started splitting off.
11221280	11222280	Wow.
11222280	11223280	Yep.
11223280	11225280	Jeez.
11225280	11226280	Shut up, really?
11226280	11227280	That's what happened?
11227280	11229280	Alberto was married to somebody that...
11229280	11231280	Give Diego a mic, give Diego a mic.
11231280	11232280	There's a Beto's by my house, by the way.
11232280	11233280	Oh, yeah.
11233280	11236280	Alberto was married to some chick and then they divorced and such.
11236280	11241280	And then she made something called Beto's, which is off the corner of El Camino and Howe.
11241280	11242280	And then it's still on El Camino.
11242280	11243280	There's one in Citrus Heights now.
11243280	11244280	Beto's?
11244280	11245280	Yeah.
11245280	11246280	That's her branch.
11246280	11248280	So she took that little thing, except changed the name.
11248280	11250280	They sell the same things.
11250280	11253280	There's some telenovela shit going on with all these different taquerias.
11253280	11254280	There's some going on.
11254280	11255280	Alright.
11255280	11256280	Wow.
11256280	11257280	Alright.
11257280	11258280	There you go.
11258280	11261280	Last but not least, Dark Sakura, your final thought for our listeners tonight.
11262280	11263280	Bravely defart.
11268280	11270280	That'll do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11270280	11272280	Thanks again for listening, everybody.
11272280	11273280	Be nice to each other.
11273280	11274280	Bathe, please.
11274280	11276280	And we'll see you next week.
11276280	11277280	Bye.
