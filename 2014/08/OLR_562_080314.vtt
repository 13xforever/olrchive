WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.400
This week, a new service starting up means another one is shutting down, but one single

00:17.400 --> 00:20.200
game ending means that many more are becoming available.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.240
It's a new month, and a new story about EA's decisions makes it to the top.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.280
We'll explain all the changes that are in store on the show, where every gamer has a

00:26.280 --> 00:27.280
voice.

00:27.280 --> 00:34.680
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.680 --> 00:36.440
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.440 --> 00:45.120
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this August 3rd, 2014, with the 562nd episode of our program.

00:45.120 --> 00:49.200
My name is Rob Roberts, joining over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming

00:49.200 --> 00:53.280
culture, and the gamer lifestyle, hopefully hiccup-free this week, thank you very much,

00:53.280 --> 00:54.720
with my co-host.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.960
Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.440
Can't talk, I have a milkshake.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.700
Speaking of sick, you were out sick last week.

01:02.700 --> 01:03.700
I had the plague.

01:03.700 --> 01:08.800
I think you and I had a similar thing, because I was here on the show, and I did the show

01:08.800 --> 01:12.080
anyway, and I had hiccups, and then I was feeling really sniffly, and sure enough, I

01:12.080 --> 01:13.080
missed work on Tuesday.

01:13.080 --> 01:17.340
I didn't have sniffly things, my stomach felt like rocks were in it, and I ended up having

01:17.340 --> 01:24.000
to eat very, very plain, plain chicken broth and rice, because every time I would eat something,

01:24.000 --> 01:25.840
it would cause immediate reflux.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.840
You.

01:26.840 --> 01:27.840
So, yeah.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.960
I think mine was a case of gastritis.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.680
Happy place, video games, yay.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.120
I have chocolate milkshake this week.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.120
There you go.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.120
Is it bringing all the boys to the yard?

01:35.120 --> 01:36.120
Mm.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.120
All right.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.880
Well, I know who it did bring to the studio.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.440
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.440
Hello.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.400
Hi, Loki, how are you?

01:43.400 --> 01:44.400
Doing fine.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.680
So, a little bit before we went live tonight, we did a little taste test, and I think a

01:47.680 --> 01:52.600
lot of your friends and people on YouTube and Facebook are talking about this contest

01:52.600 --> 01:57.360
that's happening for the second year, and that's the whole Lay's Do A Flavor contest

01:57.360 --> 02:01.040
where they have the crazy chip flavors, and last year, what, they had chicken and waffles,

02:01.040 --> 02:02.040
which was amazing.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.200
Sriracha, the garlic bread one, right?

02:04.200 --> 02:06.160
You mean the spicy ketchup one?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.160
Yes.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.400
So, this year, and I just had Loki and Dark Soccer, I tried these before the show, and

02:10.400 --> 02:11.720
I'm curious what you thought, Loki.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.780
We had wasabi ginger, which you refused to touch it.

02:14.780 --> 02:19.180
I don't like wasabi or ginger, so this wouldn't have been good.

02:19.180 --> 02:23.500
And then there was cappuccino, which I think is way better than people are giving it credit

02:23.500 --> 02:24.500
for.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.740
They taste like Taco Bell cinnamon twists to me.

02:26.740 --> 02:27.740
It's kind of meh.

02:27.740 --> 02:30.220
All right, and then there was bacon mac and cheese.

02:30.220 --> 02:31.220
That was really good.

02:31.220 --> 02:32.220
Of course.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.220
That was really good.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.220
Of course, because bacon.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.220
It was really cheesy.

02:35.220 --> 02:37.260
No, the thing is, I didn't even taste the bacon in it.

02:37.260 --> 02:38.260
I like this show.

02:38.260 --> 02:41.620
All right, and then my favorite reaction I saw to you all night, mango salsa.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.620
Oh, that was nasty.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.620
Where you literally went through it.

02:43.620 --> 02:44.620
It wasn't bad.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.180
It was absolutely nasty.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.420
It was not bad.

02:47.660 --> 02:51.620
All right, we're going to the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the

02:51.620 --> 02:55.540
Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

02:55.540 --> 02:57.060
right after the Bobby Blackall show.

02:57.060 --> 03:00.620
It is the show where every gamer has a voice and you guys can join in in our live chat

03:00.620 --> 03:02.500
room, live.vognetwork.com.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.180
And you know, every gamer has a voice, even when they're wrong, such as Brad from Pod

03:06.180 --> 03:09.020
Culture, who says the chicken and waffles one was nasty.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.580
You're entitled to your wrong opinion.

03:10.580 --> 03:12.580
Those were the best.

03:12.580 --> 03:16.340
Okay, maybe you all don't agree with me.

03:16.340 --> 03:17.340
That's fine.

03:17.340 --> 03:18.340
Everybody gets to have a voice.

03:18.340 --> 03:22.180
Hey, we've got a voice here in studio tonight that we haven't heard from in years and years

03:22.180 --> 03:27.740
and years, but thanks to the magic of running into each other at conventions, we've got

03:27.740 --> 03:29.980
him back on the show tonight and I'm hoping his mic works.

03:29.980 --> 03:33.620
Say hello everybody to Jonas back on the show tonight.

03:33.620 --> 03:34.620
Hello.

03:34.620 --> 03:35.620
Hey Jonas, how are you doing?

03:35.620 --> 03:36.620
I've been doing great.

03:36.620 --> 03:41.260
I know it's been seven years since the last time we met.

03:41.260 --> 03:43.300
Has it really been seven years since you've been on the show?

03:43.300 --> 03:44.300
Yeah, I think so.

03:44.300 --> 03:50.300
Because I remember I came to the show before SacAnime of 2007 because you've heard it better

03:50.300 --> 03:53.340
and I was like, oh, I'll stop by the Orange Dance Radio to talk.

03:53.340 --> 03:56.140
You're a little quiet, so just make sure that mic gets a little closer to your mouth.

03:56.140 --> 03:57.140
Can you all hear me now?

03:57.140 --> 03:58.140
Yes, we can.

03:58.140 --> 03:59.140
Okay.

03:59.140 --> 04:04.020
Yeah, it's been seven years because I remember me, I guess I was talking to one of you guys

04:04.020 --> 04:07.460
to have a panel at SacAnime on July 2nd.

04:07.460 --> 04:08.460
Oh, that's right.

04:08.460 --> 04:10.620
Yeah, we had one years and years ago.

04:10.620 --> 04:13.540
I don't know why we haven't had one since, it never is hooked up.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.020
That was the same year I bought the Dalek.

04:15.020 --> 04:19.100
Oh, and SacAnime's Dragon Con weekend now, which VOG does a lot of stuff with Dragon

04:19.100 --> 04:20.580
Con, so I go out to Atlanta now.

04:20.580 --> 04:22.380
And maybe they're cosplaying, by the way.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.380
Awesome.

04:23.380 --> 04:26.920
Yeah, I know the SacAnime weekend is usually tough for summer because it's the same time

04:26.920 --> 04:30.500
as Dragon Con, as mentioned, as well as PAX.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:31.820 --> 04:33.800
And that's where we went in 2008.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.220
That's probably how we kind of lost touch because we went there the next year.

04:36.220 --> 04:40.060
Well, it's fantastic to have you back on the show and believe it or not, we have some new

04:40.060 --> 04:41.620
listeners since 2007.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.020
Oh, that's great.

04:43.740 --> 04:48.420
Not everybody knows you, but we all met playing DDR, which if you don't know the history of

04:48.420 --> 04:53.300
Orange Lawn Radio, Dark Soccer, Loki, myself, we all met at Roseville Golf Land or Milpitas

04:53.300 --> 04:58.420
Golf Land or some, insert golf land here, playing Dance Dance Revolution and the old

04:58.420 --> 05:00.420
school music games.

05:00.420 --> 05:03.820
And this was born of that community, really, and Jonas, you were a part of that community

05:03.820 --> 05:04.820
as well, right?

05:04.820 --> 05:05.820
Correct.

05:05.820 --> 05:09.580
So I have to ask you, do you still dabble in the foot stomping and all this?

05:10.020 --> 05:17.900
DDR, not so much, but whether it's DDR or ITG, it's kind of out of touch a little bit.

05:17.900 --> 05:21.740
Only because DDR is only in Japan now because of the future installments.

05:21.740 --> 05:22.740
Right.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.620
You know what's funny though?

05:24.620 --> 05:29.580
I was at Milpitas Golf Land yesterday, and that's the first time I've been there in probably

05:29.580 --> 05:30.580
like six or seven years.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.480
It's been a very long time, right?

05:32.480 --> 05:37.920
And so I went there and I remember the first place I ever saw DDR, ever saw the game.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.920
You can thank that for this show, that weekend for this show, because I remember going into

05:42.920 --> 05:47.120
the back arcade and there was like a mini tournament going on and people dancing crazy

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
on the machine.

05:48.120 --> 05:53.480
And I was like, these hams up there doing that stuff, I'm like, I want to do that.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.880
I know I'm white, but the arrows will tell me how to do it.

05:55.880 --> 06:00.540
Well, see, that's the thing is the first time I saw DDR was actually at Fanime.

06:00.540 --> 06:05.060
They had a fourth mix there and I was like, wow, that looks really cool.

06:05.060 --> 06:10.900
And then I ended up buying the soundtrack and like, just then later on importing, you

06:10.900 --> 06:11.900
know, mixes.

06:11.900 --> 06:12.900
The music was very special.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.420
I think it's a good way to put it.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.620
It was a very special time.

06:15.620 --> 06:16.620
It was cool.

06:16.620 --> 06:17.620
I don't know.

06:17.620 --> 06:18.620
It was.

06:18.620 --> 06:27.380
Just rewind back to Anime Expo 2000, with the third mix machine and the chair.

06:27.380 --> 06:28.380
Okay.

06:28.380 --> 06:32.620
The first time you and I ever met was at Milpitas Golf Land in that same back arcade playing

06:32.620 --> 06:33.620
Para Para Paradise.

06:33.620 --> 06:34.620
Yes.

06:35.180 --> 06:39.100
That was the whole time when I lived at Melrose Place and, you know, that whole thing was

06:39.100 --> 06:40.100
going on.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.100
And then that was like the first time we met.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.100
Right.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.540
So you were living at Melrose Place after that.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.540
Oh, was it?

06:44.540 --> 06:45.540
Oh, it's all a blur.

06:45.540 --> 06:46.540
It's all a blur.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.540
Anyway, let's not talk about those theatrics.

06:48.540 --> 06:54.060
What my point that I wanted to talk about with the whole, um, uh, the back arcade and

06:54.060 --> 06:57.140
everything that happened there, I went to Milpitas Golf Land only to discover that back

06:57.140 --> 06:58.140
arcade gone.

06:58.140 --> 06:59.140
What?

06:59.140 --> 07:00.140
Gone.

07:00.140 --> 07:01.140
It's the laser tag arena.

07:01.140 --> 07:04.380
Now they converted the back arcade to a laser tag arena.

07:05.140 --> 07:10.060
I want to find whoever made that decision and smack them in the nose with, with, with

07:10.060 --> 07:12.620
a used a low.

07:12.620 --> 07:16.660
Here's the, it's the sad reality of arcade star soccer at the front arcade, nothing but

07:16.660 --> 07:17.900
ticket spitters.

07:17.900 --> 07:26.260
And in the back corner, you've got your initial DS, your racing games, and then beat me to

07:26.260 --> 07:29.420
the X, Technica in the groove.

07:29.420 --> 07:30.420
That's it.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.420
Your little, your little corner.

07:31.420 --> 07:32.940
We need to just open the moneycade.

07:33.500 --> 07:38.980
I know, but it would, it would sadly probably flop actually, um, that's something that could

07:38.980 --> 07:42.220
actually work based on the situation with shenanigans.

07:42.220 --> 07:43.220
Okay.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.220
Okay.

07:44.220 --> 07:47.260
So literally you walked in here like two minutes before we're live tonight and you're telling

07:47.260 --> 07:51.900
us here that locally Scandi, I don't, I don't know if we're contributing to drama or gossip,

07:51.900 --> 07:57.180
but Oh, well, so the Scandi here locally, which has a bunch of these Bemani machines,

07:57.180 --> 07:58.180
which we're loving.

07:58.180 --> 07:59.180
They're not going to have these machines anymore.

07:59.260 --> 08:05.260
Um, because, okay, the con, what happened was, um, when, when, I think it was after

08:05.260 --> 08:09.580
United States Pump Festival, for those who are not aware, it was the United States Championships

08:09.580 --> 08:11.580
for Pump It Up, which is still going on.

08:11.580 --> 08:17.060
And it's going to happen in November again at Pacific Media Expo, um, shenanigans decided

08:17.060 --> 08:22.980
to put their machines, um, in Scandia as like a partnership thing, which includes converting

08:22.980 --> 08:32.660
the DDR supernova one into a dual, um, switched, um, DDR extreme plus, um, the, in the groove

08:32.660 --> 08:38.260
two with like the simple theme, like the Pump It Up pro to Pump It Up, um, fiesta two, which

08:38.260 --> 08:45.660
is the latest one, as well as all the Bemani stuff like 2DX, pop in music, DJ Max Technica

08:45.660 --> 08:48.380
and upgraded in, um, maximum tune.

08:48.380 --> 08:49.380
Wow.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.780
And okay.

08:50.780 --> 08:54.140
And of course, um, Street Fighter 4 arcade edition.

08:54.140 --> 08:55.940
Oh yeah.

08:55.940 --> 09:02.140
But so this is, it's leaving, it's, it's going away because there's a disagreement between

09:02.140 --> 09:03.140
the two.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.940
I don't even know what it is because I just read the thing too.

09:05.940 --> 09:09.220
Apparently it's like an audit or whatever done by the owner.

09:09.220 --> 09:14.460
But he even like, you know, Sean was just like, listen, I, it's more important to me,

09:14.460 --> 09:19.340
you know, that these games are there for the community there to use them because he's all

09:19.340 --> 09:23.820
well, I'll even leave them there for free, allow you bring in whatever revenue you want

09:23.820 --> 09:28.980
and I'll leave them there for free and is, but you know, cause these people, you know,

09:28.980 --> 09:33.140
are coming here to play these games and it's really important to keep that going and there's,

09:33.140 --> 09:34.740
they're saying, well, no.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.740
Okay.

09:35.740 --> 09:41.980
I look, look, message to Scandia, Sacramento, you know, I, I, hi, I'm Rob and this is Loki

09:41.980 --> 09:42.980
and Dark Sakura.

09:42.980 --> 09:47.020
We have a podcast with dozens and dozens of listeners, so we're really important.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.020
Okay.

09:48.700 --> 09:52.140
Please don't get rid of these, these machines cause it's like the whole reason to go to

09:52.140 --> 09:53.500
the arcade right now.

09:53.500 --> 09:59.380
Like our, I hate, it pains me, I hurt, I ache when I see these other once great arcades

09:59.380 --> 10:04.220
like Milpitas Golf Land and stuff and golf lands in general go the way of the redemption

10:04.220 --> 10:05.220
scene.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.660
But Chuck E Cheese does this too, not to pick on Golf Land, but everything's going the way

10:07.660 --> 10:09.260
of the redemption machine.

10:09.260 --> 10:15.740
Like actual video games that are, that, that contribute to music and you know, the enrichment

10:15.740 --> 10:20.340
of that and making people excited about music and wanting to possibly play a real instrument,

10:20.340 --> 10:21.340
you know, that type of thing.

10:21.340 --> 10:22.700
This is a great thing for the community.

10:22.700 --> 10:26.180
So please think twice about what you're doing cause it would suck.

10:26.180 --> 10:27.180
So.

10:27.180 --> 10:30.180
Well, I mean, to be fair, I think Scandia has tried a lot of weird shit.

10:30.180 --> 10:35.940
I mean, look at, was it the Scandia Screamer, this giant thing that's just an eyesore, you

10:35.940 --> 10:40.960
know, or, or they're like shooting gallery or just like, you know, all sorts of weird

10:40.960 --> 10:45.460
stuff that they have there that it seems like money making ideas that they thought, you

10:45.500 --> 10:49.140
know, I don't know if that does make a lot of money for them, the Scandia Screamer or

10:49.140 --> 10:50.140
whatever.

10:50.140 --> 10:51.140
It's, I don't know.

10:51.140 --> 10:53.340
I'll be a weird screamer when they truck those machines out of there.

10:53.340 --> 10:54.340
All right.

10:54.340 --> 10:55.340
Anyway.

10:55.340 --> 10:56.740
Um, so on the, on the happier things.

10:56.740 --> 11:01.380
So I ran into you at gamer X, which if you guys saw the videos over at VOG network, you

11:01.380 --> 11:03.320
guys saw where I was interviewing Jonas.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.840
So some, some stuff you've done in the past few years, since you got more involved with

11:06.840 --> 11:12.980
SAC anime and all this, you actually do the game rooms at anime cons, right?

11:12.980 --> 11:13.980
Correct.

11:13.980 --> 11:15.340
And how does that, how did you get into that?

11:15.420 --> 11:21.980
How did, how did you go from gamer guy who likes to play DDR to, I'm now putting together

11:21.980 --> 11:23.660
all these gaming rooms at expos.

11:23.660 --> 11:24.660
How did you get into that?

11:24.660 --> 11:25.660
Okay.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.540
Um, I'll try to keep this as like short as possible.

11:27.540 --> 11:31.340
Like as, as, as, as short as possible because it's a really, really long story.

11:31.340 --> 11:32.340
It's all right.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.340
It's a three hour show, but yeah.

11:33.340 --> 11:34.340
Give us, give us a cliff notes.

11:34.340 --> 11:37.740
Cause I know it started like when, you know, this history, let's say like go to orange

11:37.740 --> 11:41.380
house radio and stuff and then suddenly I'm starting to do tournaments because I thought

11:41.380 --> 11:43.340
the tournament C would have died in paradise Island.

11:44.340 --> 11:51.100
Cause you know, like what kind of term has happened like past, um, the shaft tournament?

11:51.100 --> 11:52.100
Not a lot.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.100
Yeah.

11:53.100 --> 11:58.100
Shaft probably killed DDR for a lot of people, but yeah.

11:58.100 --> 12:02.020
But so I decided, okay, I start with the whole tournaments with paradise Island.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.020
Let's see how this works.

12:03.020 --> 12:06.980
And I didn't know it would go that, that a decent size.

12:06.980 --> 12:12.580
And so we did three shows and then of course paradise Island shut down for unknown reasons.

12:12.820 --> 12:17.940
Um, of course, give my involvement, give my hands on like game development with in the

12:17.940 --> 12:20.500
group too, because they liked some of my step charts at the time.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.500
Right.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.600
And it was fun experience, but unfortunately my contract didn't renewed from pump it up

12:24.600 --> 12:25.600
pro too.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.100
Cause I was working at pumping a pro as well.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.440
Oh, I didn't realize that.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.440
Very cool.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.440
Yeah.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.780
So when people heard my name working on these things, they thought, well, let's bring this

12:32.780 --> 12:33.780
guy along.

12:33.780 --> 12:35.260
So you did some of the steps for pumping a pro?

12:35.260 --> 12:36.260
Some.

12:36.260 --> 12:37.260
Yeah.

12:37.260 --> 12:38.260
That's like what Shane did for DDR ultra mix and that stuff.

12:38.260 --> 12:39.260
You guys should fight.

12:39.940 --> 12:44.940
Hey, he had some awesome steps back when, God, when I was trying to put that, uh, statement

12:44.940 --> 12:52.980
in a cabinet in it, um, yes, once again, let's dredge up the bad memories of that thousand

12:52.980 --> 12:53.980
dollars.

12:53.980 --> 12:58.520
It costs me to buy the parts and everything for that machine, which they ended up not

12:58.520 --> 12:59.520
doing anyways.

12:59.520 --> 13:03.100
And all I want to do is be reimbursed a thousand dollars for those parts.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.660
So they reimburse me and then they sent me tax forms.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.460
And they charged me $300 in taxes.

13:09.460 --> 13:10.460
What?

13:10.460 --> 13:12.340
Yes, exactly.

13:12.340 --> 13:14.140
Because it was like, I don't know.

13:14.140 --> 13:15.140
It was stupid.

13:15.140 --> 13:16.140
All right.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.140
Stop making it about you.

13:17.140 --> 13:20.620
I'm sorry, but no, but he had a, some pretty awesome, he had a, I forget what song it was

13:20.620 --> 13:23.980
now, but he had some pretty awesome double step charts for that.

13:23.980 --> 13:24.980
All right.

13:24.980 --> 13:25.980
Anyway, so, okay.

13:25.980 --> 13:29.540
So you, you got more involved with, with even some of the game making and so forth.

13:29.540 --> 13:33.220
But then how did you get into your first anime con?

13:33.780 --> 13:39.660
Well, I did go to Fanime Con 2005 as my first con, but I think it was AOD 2006.

13:39.660 --> 13:43.420
I just went like with a few friends of mine, but they couldn't make it to the next day.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.460
So it was like, okay, I had to figure out a hotel place.

13:45.460 --> 13:50.580
And some people found out that I actually did some game development and, but for those

13:50.580 --> 13:55.380
who are part of the anime con scene in 2007, there were some people talking about some

13:55.380 --> 13:58.580
issues behind the scenes that people were not aware of.

13:58.580 --> 14:02.740
Whether the room where people stealing money or whatever, like I said, I don't know that

14:02.980 --> 14:05.540
70 year old drama though, 70 year old drama.

14:05.540 --> 14:12.300
But anyways, they probably drama at anime conventions, get out, get out, Jonas, get

14:12.300 --> 14:13.300
out.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.820
There's a lot of politics stuff, but there's some stuff I can't say, just fair enough.

14:15.820 --> 14:16.820
Fair enough.

14:16.820 --> 14:17.820
I understand.

14:17.820 --> 14:20.780
I'm just saying like, they said, okay, this guy might be a future leader of certain things

14:20.780 --> 14:23.860
because I guess I just brought on one random sack anime.

14:23.860 --> 14:28.420
I brought my DDR, DDR pads, like a hard pads because they're running a DDR tournament,

14:28.420 --> 14:29.980
but they're going to use soft pads.

14:29.980 --> 14:32.500
Was it because you were the only sucker willing to do it then?

14:33.220 --> 14:36.820
I just thought, okay, I paid a badge for a sack anime at one point.

14:36.820 --> 14:40.980
And I thought, okay, the tournament is like, I have hard pads, we could just probably use

14:40.980 --> 14:41.980
that possibly.

14:41.980 --> 14:42.980
Oh, okay.

14:42.980 --> 14:45.240
And then one successfully led to another.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.940
And of course, since some people found that some people there actually competed in one

14:48.940 --> 14:54.460
of our tournaments and then I guess the word got spread far that I did the game development.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.540
They said, bring this guy in.

14:56.540 --> 14:59.220
I was like, okay, I'll give this a shot and stuff.

14:59.220 --> 15:04.540
So then this grew into something like, I'm assuming you were doing Fanime kind of regularly

15:04.540 --> 15:07.460
and then you started dabbling in other conventions too?

15:07.460 --> 15:10.680
Yes, we didn't start doing other conventions.

15:10.680 --> 15:17.260
We didn't do some other conventions until 2009 where we got the gig with Fanime Con.

15:17.260 --> 15:22.340
With numerous people, because some of the group members that joined in 2007 were also

15:22.340 --> 15:23.440
friends of mine.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.980
So we thought, okay, we could form a group and start just doing sack anime stuff.

15:27.060 --> 15:31.900
And then in 2009, we grew into more than just sack anime, then Fanime Con, then all these

15:31.900 --> 15:37.140
other people who want to run conventions, start-up conventions, or even GamerX just

15:37.140 --> 15:38.140
contacted us.

15:38.140 --> 15:39.140
Like, you want to do game rooms?

15:39.140 --> 15:40.140
Like, sure.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.780
Because you guys like now have this whole little organization, right?

15:42.780 --> 15:44.780
Because you guys have a Facebook page, right?

15:44.780 --> 15:45.780
Correct.

15:45.780 --> 15:46.780
What's it called?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.240
If people want to go check it out and like it and all that?

15:48.240 --> 15:56.180
The name is The Big Anime Game Room, aka Teabagger.

15:56.180 --> 16:01.500
So you're here representing teabaggers, all right, that's fair, all right.

16:01.500 --> 16:05.920
You sound like my mother talking about politics.

16:05.920 --> 16:10.380
Those teabaggers are at it again, Rob.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.540
So gross, those teabaggers do.

16:12.540 --> 16:15.540
I can't stand that woman in Alaska, she's so stupid.

16:15.540 --> 16:16.540
Anyway.

16:16.540 --> 16:21.460
Oh boy, the initials was unexpected, it just happened.

16:21.460 --> 16:22.460
You're with teabaggers?

16:22.460 --> 16:24.100
All right, fair enough.

16:24.100 --> 16:28.300
Okay, so The Big Anime Game Room, which is teabaggers.

16:28.300 --> 16:32.300
So how did the teabaggers, so you guys just get approached by different cons because you've

16:32.300 --> 16:37.100
done a big one like Fatime and SacAnime, which is like SacAnime has gotten huge just in like

16:37.100 --> 16:40.100
this, you know, six or seven years I've been kind of seeing it.

16:40.100 --> 16:45.820
And so these other conventions, like you said, GamerX, they come to you now.

16:45.820 --> 16:48.820
How do you set up for a convention like this?

16:48.820 --> 16:52.220
How do you know like what games you're going to bring to a con?

16:52.220 --> 16:56.220
Like is there a science to it, or is it just, this is what we have available, let's just

16:56.220 --> 16:59.620
kind of throw it all out there, randomize things, or do you actually go like, because

16:59.620 --> 17:02.620
I'm going to this convention, we should bring this, this, that we should make sure there's

17:02.620 --> 17:07.220
DDR, we should, like, how do you kind of choose what goes to what convention?

17:07.220 --> 17:11.060
We actually, it's not just a group of, again, by the way, it's not just a group of just

17:11.060 --> 17:13.580
being random games.

17:13.580 --> 17:18.480
Since based on like my background with the competitive scene and our staff members actually

17:18.480 --> 17:22.400
have background with the competitive scene of Aether Weathers from Smash and other games,

17:22.400 --> 17:27.280
we actually do some research, like, and analysis of human behavior to see what games people

17:27.280 --> 17:28.280
like.

17:28.280 --> 17:32.600
Like, at first, we didn't think like, for example, we didn't think like Just Dance would

17:32.600 --> 17:36.360
be big, and Just Dance 3 had some songs that we actually liked.

17:36.360 --> 17:40.940
So we give it a shot at an event called Yaoi Con and we didn't expect it to be that big.

17:40.940 --> 17:44.400
And later on, the popularity of Just Dance and the conventions became much bigger than

17:44.400 --> 17:45.400
we expected.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.440
I wouldn't have thought that Just Dance was a huge convention game, but it makes sense.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.440
It actually makes a lot of sense.

17:50.440 --> 17:55.280
Aren't they, like, talking about adding Just Dance to, like, MLG or something like that?

17:55.280 --> 17:58.240
I think, I think, I feel like we had a story like that not that long ago.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.240
Yeah.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.240
It actually exists, so.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.240
Wow.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.240
Okay.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.340
Because of, um, Electronic Sports World Cup in Europe.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.640
They're actually hosting a world championship right now.

18:07.640 --> 18:13.660
So, okay, so you kind of have to keep a pulse on, like, what games, and you might not necessarily

18:13.660 --> 18:16.780
be right that this game is going to be a huge thing at conventions.

18:16.780 --> 18:22.420
Like, have you ever found that there's a game that you didn't bring, but somebody else brought

18:22.420 --> 18:26.580
it, and, like, suddenly everybody's playing that, and you were like, shit, we didn't think

18:26.580 --> 18:28.580
to bring that?

18:28.580 --> 18:34.220
Um, that was, that was just, yeah, that was the story of Just Dance when, um, we didn't

18:34.220 --> 18:39.700
know, she wasn't a staffer at the time, Patricia, um, she, they said, okay, let's bring Just,

18:39.700 --> 18:40.700
she had the idea of Just Dance.

18:40.700 --> 18:44.420
This is before she became part of the gaming group.

18:44.420 --> 18:47.660
So we give, still we decided to give her the shot and see how it works, but it actually

18:47.660 --> 18:50.140
turned out, we exceeded our expectations.

18:50.140 --> 18:51.140
Wow.

18:51.140 --> 18:52.140
Um.

18:52.140 --> 18:55.540
And since we do, there was tournaments, we actually have suggestions of what people,

18:55.540 --> 18:56.540
what people actually want.

18:56.540 --> 18:57.540
I see.

18:57.540 --> 18:59.380
It's like, you get through your Facebook page and stuff?

18:59.380 --> 19:00.380
Yeah.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.340
From Facebook or emails too, like direct emails.

19:02.340 --> 19:05.060
And I see your website's actually getting pimped in our chat room right now.

19:05.060 --> 19:10.620
Dungeon Buster says the big anime game room, www.tbagr.org.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.140
Fifth Dream says, just remember, teabagger orgy.

19:13.140 --> 19:14.140
Yeah.

19:14.140 --> 19:15.140
Perfect.

19:15.140 --> 19:16.140
Teabagger orgy.

19:16.140 --> 19:21.140
Boy, if we named the shows there, there would be right there.

19:21.140 --> 19:23.340
Uh, that'll be Horde House this week.

19:23.340 --> 19:27.500
Um, so, okay, uh, I want to get to the really good stuff.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.780
So I, I, somebody's had to try to steal your shit before, right?

19:31.780 --> 19:34.060
Have you ever had people try to steal your shit?

19:34.060 --> 19:38.620
Yes, we had, we have, which this is why we had to increase our security purposes as well

19:38.620 --> 19:43.420
as the community getting involved and to making sure that no one steals crap from the game

19:43.420 --> 19:49.860
room because if somebody steals a agreement, it affects not just one con, but the entire

19:49.860 --> 19:53.700
area and also ruins the trust between the community itself.

19:53.700 --> 19:58.260
Do you ever like, I mean, this might be a really weird question, but I'm always curious

19:58.260 --> 20:01.980
like kind of what makes people tick in that regard because I'm sure you've had to have

20:01.980 --> 20:05.260
as the leader of this organization, you've probably had to have these awkward conversations

20:05.260 --> 20:07.180
with people that have tried to steal shit.

20:07.180 --> 20:10.400
And have you ever been able to figure out like, why, why do people, why do people try

20:10.400 --> 20:11.400
to steal?

20:11.400 --> 20:16.020
Is it just that they want a free game or do they, are they trying to hurt you guys hurt

20:16.020 --> 20:17.020
the convention?

20:17.020 --> 20:18.300
Are they addicted to stealing?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.300
Like, I don't even know if you have an answer for this.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.860
I'm just kind of rambling, but what's the reason?

20:22.860 --> 20:27.320
There's a lot of answers, but the direct answer is usually personal issues happening.

20:27.320 --> 20:32.420
Some people, this is why we don't really discuss about drama and conventions, but some

20:32.420 --> 20:36.120
people's like, oh, they didn't win a tournament, so they're going to try doing, whether it's

20:36.120 --> 20:40.840
they didn't win a tournament, they think a certain price is too large.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.880
Let's say they saw something in the dealer's room.

20:42.880 --> 20:49.880
Oh, it's too expensive for them to buy or, or they've never seen, they've never seen

20:49.880 --> 20:56.620
a quote this game or so they want us to, you know, the intentions of stealing.

20:56.620 --> 21:01.020
So it's acting out like a dog pees on the carpet to act out when the dog doesn't get

21:01.020 --> 21:02.020
his way.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.020
Correct.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.020
That, that, that's okay.

21:04.020 --> 21:05.020
Okay.

21:05.020 --> 21:06.020
So that's okay.

21:06.020 --> 21:07.020
So it's very animalistic.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.020
What do these people do?

21:08.020 --> 21:09.020
Yeah.

21:09.020 --> 21:12.580
But we always track them down, make sure that it doesn't happen because, you know, because

21:12.580 --> 21:15.500
it does more damage than actual trying to help.

21:15.500 --> 21:19.960
Now going to the flip side of things and talking about something a little more positive, I'm

21:19.960 --> 21:25.200
sure you guys get like some donations too, and people that like contribute as well to

21:25.200 --> 21:26.200
what you guys are doing.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.440
Do you ever get any like really cool, like, Oh my God, somebody's contributing like this

21:29.440 --> 21:31.960
rare game import that everybody's going to want to play.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.280
Do you ever kind of get that kind of stuff?

21:33.280 --> 21:36.840
We get, we actually sometimes get that because I remember the first, let's, here's a good

21:36.840 --> 21:42.400
example of like gamer X one where they got sponsorships from Microsoft and so, or an

21:42.400 --> 21:47.960
EEA to get like battlefield copies to people who participate, who win the determines.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.360
Because companies will fund it if you give them like the right reason to, for them to

21:51.360 --> 21:53.440
come up with an approach.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.440
Okay.

21:54.960 --> 22:00.760
And sometimes like some other groups or what we call proxy, like let's say I'm like orange,

22:00.760 --> 22:04.640
like you're orange and orange and I'm like teabag or we can proxy each other to build

22:04.640 --> 22:08.880
relationships or another group, like let's say mission star podcast at one conventions

22:08.880 --> 22:11.800
where they wanted to do a raffle in the, in the game room.

22:11.800 --> 22:12.880
It's like, well, let that happen.

22:12.880 --> 22:13.880
See how things go.

22:13.880 --> 22:14.880
Okay.

22:14.880 --> 22:19.280
So they bring not only new ideas, but it also gives us a more, a more better understanding

22:19.280 --> 22:21.840
of what other communities do too.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.240
We should look into that.

22:23.240 --> 22:27.440
See if we can get some free games and get a little voice of geeks network and, and teabag

22:27.440 --> 22:28.440
or magic going on here.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.880
It'd be a lot of fun to look into that for the future.

22:31.880 --> 22:32.880
Okay.

22:32.880 --> 22:33.880
Very cool.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.480
So you, you just wrapped up a gamer X two.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.480
That's where we ran into each other.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.560
How'd that convention go for you?

22:38.560 --> 22:39.560
Was it fun?

22:39.560 --> 22:40.560
It was fun.

22:40.560 --> 22:46.120
I know that a lot of the information has been posted online, whether it's from, from polygon

22:46.120 --> 22:51.800
for those who have read and it's, but it's kind of unfortunate though for us.

22:51.800 --> 22:58.840
That gamer X two is, is in hiatus right now based on the news that we've read, right?

22:58.840 --> 23:02.040
Cause yeah, yeah, it's going to, that's a convention you don't get to do next year.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.800
Maybe I don't know what actually we're going to touch on this a little later.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.240
There's a very interesting, very interesting gamer X developments this week.

23:07.240 --> 23:10.640
We're going to get into a little later, so I'll put that on hold a little bit, but, uh,

23:10.640 --> 23:14.160
we don't know what's going to happen and it's going to be how I mean, but, but you're, you're,

23:14.160 --> 23:18.980
you're a straight guy that, you know, and, and we heard a lot of these, these talks from

23:18.980 --> 23:22.580
straight guys who went to gamer X that were pretty impressed with the convention that

23:22.580 --> 23:24.420
they were just kind of like, yeah, it was cool.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.420
It was really chill.

23:25.420 --> 23:26.860
Did you kind of walk out of there with the same attitude?

23:26.860 --> 23:28.260
Like this was different.

23:28.260 --> 23:29.260
Of course.

23:29.260 --> 23:31.460
I mean, like I said, Oh, sorry.

23:31.460 --> 23:35.980
Um, like I mentioned to some of the people, this is going to be an article that's going

23:35.980 --> 23:41.600
to be written soon that one of the biggest reasons why we wanted to try, um, gamer X

23:41.600 --> 23:46.620
and gamer X two was to show that there's more to gaming than just like straight people as

23:46.620 --> 23:50.300
well as for us, like get teabaggers and stuff.

23:50.300 --> 23:51.660
We do not discriminate at all.

23:51.660 --> 23:58.100
Well, if you're going to call yourself teabagger, you have to have a little bit of, you obviously

23:58.100 --> 24:02.100
have a little bit of, you know, I, I don't, anyway, I, I, that's, that, no, that's great.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.100
That's, that's fantastic.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.540
I think that's the perfect attitude.

24:04.540 --> 24:08.780
Because, um, even though we deal game room, sometimes, you know, the people that go to

24:08.780 --> 24:14.940
all these events sometimes show some social inactivity or negative comments that even

24:14.940 --> 24:18.240
though it doesn't hurt, even though it's not, we didn't have nothing to do with it,

24:18.240 --> 24:20.460
it could affect us too.

24:20.460 --> 24:26.140
If it's that person once said the, the, the forbidden words to other, right?

24:26.140 --> 24:30.140
Like the T word or F word and the things that I get it, like somebody in your game room

24:30.140 --> 24:33.940
says something, then that's not going to be posted on Facebook.

24:33.940 --> 24:38.700
That such and such person said it's going to be, Oh, that game room at gamer X was so

24:38.700 --> 24:42.380
awful because they used all these slurs type of thing that is not going to fall on the

24:42.380 --> 24:44.300
individual who said it's going to fall on you.

24:44.300 --> 24:45.300
It sucks.

24:45.300 --> 24:48.700
So you have to kind of create an environment where that doesn't happen.

24:48.700 --> 24:49.700
Right?

24:49.700 --> 24:50.700
Yeah.

24:50.700 --> 24:51.700
Yes.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.580
Um, yeah, this is a one, one challenge that happened at gamer X too.

24:53.580 --> 24:54.580
Yeah.

24:54.580 --> 24:58.300
And this is something that was really hard to figure because we're, again, we're trying

24:58.300 --> 25:02.980
to be, we're trying to figure out the behavior of like, what can we do to make people happy?

25:02.980 --> 25:03.980
Right.

25:03.980 --> 25:08.620
And one of the Just Dance tournaments, I guess this one person, I'll just say person, I can't,

25:08.620 --> 25:10.420
I can't, it's hard for me to identify.

25:10.420 --> 25:11.420
Right.

25:11.420 --> 25:16.020
Um, some, like one of the attendees said, she said that, but the girl got, I mean, that

25:16.020 --> 25:19.220
person got upset and said, is it she?

25:19.220 --> 25:20.220
Okay.

25:20.220 --> 25:21.220
So it was, it was misgendered.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.220
The person was misgendered.

25:22.220 --> 25:23.220
Correct.

25:23.220 --> 25:24.220
Okay.

25:24.220 --> 25:25.220
Right.

25:25.220 --> 25:26.840
Which is not the environment, like, you know, gamer X is trying to create an environment

25:26.840 --> 25:31.620
where people can be who they, who they identify as and you know, who they, who they are.

25:31.620 --> 25:34.820
So yeah, I can, I can, yeah, if somebody gets misgendered, that's a big no-no, especially

25:34.820 --> 25:35.820
at a con like that.

25:35.820 --> 25:36.820
Yeah.

25:36.820 --> 25:39.300
But we did clear it up to her just to make sure she feels better over the matter.

25:39.300 --> 25:43.460
It was just an unfortunate sight cause it, the Just Dance room was so, the tournament

25:43.460 --> 25:48.220
was so big that everybody heard it like, and she heard it too, like right in front of a

25:48.220 --> 25:49.220
bunch of people.

25:49.220 --> 25:53.140
Um, hopefully, I don't know if, if they had one of those stickers, I know those helped

25:53.140 --> 25:54.140
a lot.

25:54.140 --> 25:57.240
Like when, you know, it's like, well, how do I, you know, what, what gender does this

25:57.240 --> 25:58.240
person prefer?

25:58.240 --> 26:00.420
Then you can, you know, you can see the sticker.

26:00.420 --> 26:01.420
So yeah.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.180
But I think at the end she was okay with it.

26:03.180 --> 26:06.540
Like it was like, it was not done with ill intentions or anything like that.

26:06.540 --> 26:07.540
Okay.

26:07.540 --> 26:08.540
Okay.

26:08.780 --> 26:10.620
So what, what about what's coming up?

26:10.620 --> 26:12.340
You've got other conventions coming up, right?

26:12.340 --> 26:15.620
You're doing, um, SacAnime, this coming, right?

26:15.620 --> 26:18.980
Um, FYI, I know some people are wondering, what's the tournaments and stuff.

26:18.980 --> 26:23.020
We will release the tournament list this week also.

26:23.020 --> 26:30.420
And we're asking, we're going to make it a special announcement for additional PopRise.

26:30.420 --> 26:37.340
If the, if two objectives actually follow, if, if people can bring, bring teabag to 500

26:37.340 --> 26:43.880
likes or a certain post that to like like 50 likes on an actual post, we'll offer a

26:43.880 --> 26:45.860
special bonus to a certain tournament.

26:45.860 --> 26:50.640
So this is like a Kickstarter only you want people's social, social involvement, not their

26:50.640 --> 26:51.640
money necessarily.

26:51.640 --> 26:56.100
It's social involvement because with new games coming out, they want to see like the competition

26:56.100 --> 27:01.260
still rise up while still teaching the people who are not in the competency to be competitive

27:01.260 --> 27:02.980
and to enjoy the game at its fullest.

27:02.980 --> 27:03.980
Okay.

27:03.980 --> 27:04.980
All right.

27:04.980 --> 27:06.580
So it's not just getting like 500,000 likes.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.020
Oh, and whore it out.

27:08.020 --> 27:10.860
It's more like connect, connected to community.

27:10.860 --> 27:11.860
Yeah.

27:11.860 --> 27:16.340
It helps you get a bigger voice when it comes to, um, you know, what, what do people want

27:16.340 --> 27:18.140
to play and really see the cons and stuff.

27:18.140 --> 27:19.740
It's a win, win all around.

27:19.740 --> 27:20.740
Yeah.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.740
Correct.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.740
Cool.

27:22.740 --> 27:23.740
Uh, quickly, any other cons that you've got coming up?

27:23.740 --> 27:28.340
I got to get into gaming news for the week, but, um, I know SacAnime is coming up.

27:28.340 --> 27:32.140
Um, SnafuCon, the Reno event.

27:32.140 --> 27:33.520
Oh, okay.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.380
It's coming up soon in October.

27:35.380 --> 27:39.620
One of our, one of our partners, crew members who brings like the old school games that

27:39.620 --> 27:41.220
you bought, like the Sega Genesis and everything.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.220
Yeah.

27:42.220 --> 27:43.220
I know.

27:43.220 --> 27:46.140
Cause I know you're playing, I saw you playing like Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic.

27:46.140 --> 27:47.140
Yeah.

27:47.140 --> 27:49.580
Uh, Jeremy from Koopa Club and I were throwing down on Sonic.

27:49.580 --> 27:50.580
It was Sonic three.

27:50.580 --> 27:51.580
Yeah.

27:51.580 --> 27:52.580
It was Sonic and Knuckles attached to Sonic three.

27:52.580 --> 27:55.740
What was the only thing that was open that we could find because your game room was so

27:55.740 --> 27:56.740
popular.

27:56.740 --> 27:57.740
We couldn't.

27:57.740 --> 27:58.740
So that happened to be open at the moment.

27:58.740 --> 27:59.740
We were like, yeah, let's do this.

27:59.740 --> 28:02.700
So we had a lot of fun playing that I had more fun cause I won.

28:02.700 --> 28:03.700
Awesome.

28:03.700 --> 28:04.700
Yeah.

28:05.020 --> 28:08.860
Um, yeah, I got to thank Abe who actually brought the equipment there and he was actually

28:08.860 --> 28:10.980
the manager of the SnafuCon game room.

28:10.980 --> 28:14.180
So it happens in October, so stay tuned for that.

28:14.180 --> 28:15.180
All right.

28:15.180 --> 28:16.180
Um, yeah.

28:16.180 --> 28:23.380
And just one, um, to clarify things, if people don't see, if people don't see a game that

28:23.380 --> 28:26.060
they want to play badly, just ask us.

28:26.060 --> 28:28.800
Not all games can be shown because of the high demand that everybody wants to play every

28:28.800 --> 28:30.300
game possible.

28:30.300 --> 28:34.460
So you can always ask if we have this game and we'll assist you guys as much as possible.

28:35.220 --> 28:36.220
All right.

28:36.220 --> 28:37.220
Very cool.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.220
Well, um, again, check them out on Facebook.

28:38.220 --> 28:43.960
Uh, just, just remember teabagger, the big anime game room, because if they get to 500

28:43.960 --> 28:47.260
likes, they're going to bring more prizes to SAK anime.

28:47.260 --> 28:50.700
And even though you might not live in Sacramento, you might live somewhere in California or

28:50.700 --> 28:55.200
hell Nevada, it sounds like in probably Oregon soon where these guys are going to be.

28:55.200 --> 28:59.940
So, um, best of luck to you as your thing grows and grows, uh, your, your organization.

28:59.940 --> 29:03.780
And um, yeah, uh, stick, stick with us and talk about the week in gaming.

29:03.780 --> 29:04.780
All right.

29:04.780 --> 29:07.060
What do you, uh, do you still play a lot of the new stuff?

29:07.060 --> 29:10.700
I know the game rooms do a lot of classics for you play a lot of, do you play PlayStation

29:10.700 --> 29:12.460
four, Xbox one, or what are you playing these days?

29:12.460 --> 29:17.500
I have a PlayStation four, I've missed out on the destiny beta cause I was so busy with

29:17.500 --> 29:18.500
them.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.500
A lot of life stuff.

29:19.500 --> 29:24.820
Oh no, you missed out and some other games and like in a more game business stuff, but

29:24.820 --> 29:28.460
I've, I've, I've still, but we, I have a, we use still, so I play some games.

29:28.460 --> 29:29.460
Nice.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.660
Well, we'll get to your gaming week in a little bit here cause we're gonna get to how was

29:31.660 --> 29:32.660
your gaming week.

29:33.180 --> 29:36.980
No, I was just cause I went, you know, I had to go like the page cause I haven't liked

29:36.980 --> 29:40.580
the page yet, but it does, it does bring up a one good question though.

29:40.580 --> 29:47.020
Are you going to include a ball pit in future game room?

29:47.020 --> 29:51.500
That was something that was suggested to us and well, there are a few things that we'll

29:51.500 --> 29:52.500
say the word.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.780
Maybe we can't guarantee anything about that.

29:54.780 --> 29:56.460
I would call $17,000.

29:56.460 --> 30:02.060
I feel if nothing else, what Dashcon brought to the world was that every convention will

30:02.060 --> 30:04.780
be expected to have a ball pit now.

30:04.780 --> 30:07.740
It's going to be a thing where every convention is asked, where's your ball pit?

30:07.740 --> 30:09.060
I want my hour in the ball pit.

30:09.060 --> 30:11.340
Have you already seen the people cosplaying the ball pit?

30:11.340 --> 30:12.980
Oh yeah, I knew that would be a thing.

30:12.980 --> 30:17.260
I knew that would be the, somebody, somebody like that same weekend, cause there were other,

30:17.260 --> 30:18.620
obviously gamer X was going on.

30:18.620 --> 30:21.340
I think there was another convention going on stream.

30:21.340 --> 30:26.340
Not just that, some other stuff because I want to say, uh, uh, Rama or somebody had

30:26.340 --> 30:31.860
posted a picture of somebody that was dressed as a PayPal account looking for $17,000.

30:31.860 --> 30:33.500
Like that same weekend.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.140
Like that's how fast the internet works.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.140
People.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.140
It's amazing.

30:37.140 --> 30:38.140
All right.

30:38.140 --> 30:42.100
Um, anyhow, let's, let's get into, uh, our gaming weeks, the types of video games that

30:42.100 --> 30:45.740
we've been playing this week and we'll get into a week in gaming news as well.

30:45.740 --> 30:47.220
Uh, let's start with you, dark soccer.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.020
What types of video games you've been playing this week?

30:49.020 --> 30:55.020
Been playing some final fantasy 14, um, last weekend while I was sick, sick Dan, um, played

30:55.020 --> 30:57.580
through and beat mega man X.

30:57.580 --> 30:58.580
I saw your pictures on Facebook.

30:58.580 --> 30:59.980
We had a couple hours to kill.

30:59.980 --> 31:00.980
It was fun.

31:00.980 --> 31:01.980
Yeah.

31:01.980 --> 31:08.500
Um, I've been playing a little bit of bravely D fart.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.940
Why do you call it that?

31:09.940 --> 31:15.320
Just because I tried to say default the other day at work and I said, D fart.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.300
So since then it's been bravely D fart.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.300
Okay.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.060
You know, that game's done very well for square Enix.

31:20.060 --> 31:23.860
There was a report that came out this week or last or something that they, they've sold

31:23.860 --> 31:26.100
a million of that game worldwide.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.100
Great.

31:27.220 --> 31:32.780
Um, Dan and I are probably, we were talking about getting rid of some of our more expensive

31:32.780 --> 31:34.700
stuff that we're not playing anymore.

31:34.700 --> 31:41.340
Um, but he and I are actually playing on like a regular game night and he bought me a kingdom

31:41.340 --> 31:51.020
hearts 1.5 HD remix, whatever for matching service.com edition.

31:51.020 --> 31:53.100
So we're going to be starting that one together.

31:53.100 --> 31:56.060
You'll probably finish it just in time for kingdom hearts 2.5, which is coming out.

31:56.060 --> 31:58.180
Which he's ordered for me so I can get a pin.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.180
Hooray.

31:59.180 --> 32:00.180
That's the whole reason we got it.

32:00.180 --> 32:05.660
So I could have a pin for my collection because pin trading, I love how you just like literally

32:05.660 --> 32:09.100
within the same breath talked about, we're going to be getting rid of some of our stuff

32:09.100 --> 32:13.180
cause we have a lot of stuff, but I got a pin and I bought this game cause I got a fucking

32:13.180 --> 32:14.180
pin.

32:14.180 --> 32:20.060
No, actually we're going to be getting rid of like a lot of our DVDs and seeing what

32:20.060 --> 32:21.060
we can keep digital.

32:21.060 --> 32:27.100
You know, basically trying to downsize because, um, as much as we love our games and love

32:27.100 --> 32:33.300
our stuff, a person can only take up so much space responsibly, so that, and we want to

32:33.300 --> 32:34.300
move.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.300
Understandable.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.300
Understandable.

32:36.300 --> 32:37.660
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

32:37.660 --> 32:39.700
I played pretty much nothing.

32:39.700 --> 32:44.380
The only thing I did get, I was hoping to be able to play a little bit more than nothing

32:44.380 --> 32:49.220
because we had our like kind of work game conference thing.

32:49.220 --> 32:52.420
I thought that was this week and you were hoping to place some new stuff.

32:52.420 --> 32:54.500
Yeah, but we had a lot of no shows.

32:54.500 --> 32:59.660
One of those being, uh, Tech Mccowie and they usually bring a demo, but they didn't have

32:59.660 --> 33:00.660
anything.

33:00.660 --> 33:05.740
So the only thing I got to actually see, didn't really play shame of like I got to see a trap

33:05.740 --> 33:09.460
team, but, um, I don't know.

33:09.460 --> 33:10.460
It's Skylanders.

33:10.460 --> 33:16.780
I just don't give a shit about Skylanders and all I saw was like, they were like saying,

33:16.780 --> 33:20.180
okay, yeah, see, look at these, these little trap crystals or whatever.

33:20.180 --> 33:25.580
You put it in there and you get to, you know, you get to capture enemies and, and, but you

33:25.580 --> 33:30.060
know, if you trap a different enemy with this, then that old enemy's gone.

33:30.060 --> 33:35.260
So you need to buy as many as you can to be able to travel like, Oh, come the hell on.

33:35.260 --> 33:37.420
Can you be any more obvious?

33:37.420 --> 33:41.340
You know, it's like, seriously, let's just sell all this shit.

33:41.340 --> 33:42.340
They'll buy it.

33:42.340 --> 33:45.860
And it's like, come on me guys.

33:45.860 --> 33:47.460
It's so obvious now.

33:47.460 --> 33:50.700
But so that, that was really the only new game that I saw.

33:50.700 --> 33:53.380
Um, they didn't even have like Ubisoft didn't have anything.

33:53.380 --> 33:57.620
Um, you know, even sometimes they bring just dancers, sadly.

33:57.620 --> 34:01.260
Do you think this is because with the news of your company being sold, they just are

34:01.260 --> 34:05.860
kind of like, yes, because lame duck X, no, no, that's not why.

34:05.860 --> 34:06.860
It's not why at all.

34:06.860 --> 34:10.420
It's because the, the Ingram expo is the week prior.

34:10.420 --> 34:13.500
Um, so there's a lot of reps already went off that.

34:13.500 --> 34:19.340
Because of that, there's certain reps at these companies that call on Ingram and there's

34:19.340 --> 34:22.260
certain reps of those companies that call on our company.

34:22.260 --> 34:26.940
And so it was kind of that weird gray area, like, okay, well, is it this rep that's coming

34:26.940 --> 34:28.860
out or is it this rep?

34:28.860 --> 34:37.100
And so just a lot of them didn't come or, you know, I dunno, but I got to rep, you know,

34:37.100 --> 34:42.660
for seven different companies because I was working the, they didn't show up booth.

34:42.660 --> 34:44.220
Let me talk about all their games.

34:44.220 --> 34:53.260
So like, you know, I got to do was as I was the rep for EA take to, um, Microsoft, Konami,

34:53.260 --> 34:56.380
these companies realize that we're going to be repping them.

34:56.380 --> 34:58.020
No, they weren't.

34:58.020 --> 35:02.460
But thankfully Bethesda and Konami were super easy because they have nothing coming out

35:02.460 --> 35:03.860
with the evil within Bethesda.

35:03.860 --> 35:04.860
Yeah.

35:04.860 --> 35:10.140
The evil within, and maybe the Ls girls online, Konami has soccer and there's the, um, there's

35:10.140 --> 35:13.420
that don't call it team fortress three, but it's pretty much team fortress three game

35:13.420 --> 35:15.900
that Bethesda has, but that's next year.

35:15.900 --> 35:17.900
That's yeah, that's not this year at all.

35:17.900 --> 35:21.980
I was only talking about stuff for the fourth quarter, but uh, yeah, so I got to do that

35:21.980 --> 35:22.980
stuff and that was kind of fun.

35:22.980 --> 35:27.180
I made my own trailer loop and everything and uh, there wasn't even a swag.

35:27.180 --> 35:29.040
It was like, Oh, now there was swag.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.740
It was giant fucking bags from Atlas.

35:31.740 --> 35:33.280
Like these bags were ridiculous.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.740
The mouse swag that would fit in those, they hit like they didn't even have a traditional

35:36.740 --> 35:37.740
handle on them.

35:37.740 --> 35:38.740
It was like a backpack.

35:38.740 --> 35:41.100
You were wearing this big swag backpack thing.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.100
All right.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.100
So how's that?

35:43.100 --> 35:46.180
I forgot one other, sure.

35:46.180 --> 35:47.180
Sims two.

35:47.180 --> 35:51.180
Oh, did you play, uh, they gave away the whole shebang.

35:51.180 --> 35:52.180
Yeah.

35:52.180 --> 35:53.180
Yep.

35:53.180 --> 35:54.180
I forgot to grab that.

35:54.180 --> 35:55.180
I put all the dirty stuff back in my game too.

35:55.180 --> 35:56.180
Did you?

35:56.180 --> 35:57.180
Yeah, I did.

35:57.180 --> 35:58.180
It works.

35:58.180 --> 35:59.180
All right.

35:59.180 --> 36:04.580
Um, but I'm building a compound that my character and her cat live in.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.340
And what do they do in the compound?

36:06.340 --> 36:07.340
I don't know yet.

36:07.340 --> 36:08.340
I'm still building the compound.

36:08.940 --> 36:13.700
I spent more time building the house than I have actually playing the game.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.700
So that's what happens.

36:14.700 --> 36:15.700
I did.

36:15.700 --> 36:19.220
I did download that just because it's free and I can't possibly pass up on it.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.220
You know, free stuff.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.220
I forgot.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.220
But Alan grabbed it.

36:22.220 --> 36:25.180
So I can always just use his login if I really had to play it, you know?

36:25.180 --> 36:26.180
Yeah.

36:26.180 --> 36:28.580
The chat room is taking this fart thing away too.

36:28.580 --> 36:29.580
Yeah.

36:29.580 --> 36:30.580
What now?

36:30.580 --> 36:33.900
Everybody's putting fart in the name of game titles because of what you did with bravely

36:33.900 --> 36:34.900
to fart.

36:34.900 --> 36:35.900
Defart.

36:35.980 --> 36:38.940
But, uh, farts a horizon says rage nator.

36:38.940 --> 36:39.940
Mario fart.

36:39.940 --> 36:40.940
He says so.

36:40.940 --> 36:41.940
Act deaf.

36:41.940 --> 36:43.860
I came out with final fart is fart ashy.

36:43.860 --> 36:46.020
The fart of us act deaf.

36:46.020 --> 36:47.020
Okay.

36:47.020 --> 36:48.020
You guys like how are you?

36:48.020 --> 36:49.020
My favorite.

36:49.020 --> 36:50.460
How fucking old are we?

36:50.460 --> 36:53.020
It's farting mama.

36:53.020 --> 36:55.500
How fucking old are we chat?

36:55.500 --> 36:58.740
And then I have never yelled at a chat room like this before.

36:58.740 --> 37:03.100
This dream has brought it back to the news and linked to the article that says no fartings.

37:03.540 --> 37:06.220
Smelling farts don't prevent cancer.

37:06.220 --> 37:07.500
Grow up all of you.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.500
All right.

37:08.500 --> 37:15.780
So like, so like would that be like, for example, like kingdom farts toots point five.

37:15.780 --> 37:16.780
All right.

37:16.780 --> 37:17.780
I'm done.

37:17.780 --> 37:18.780
I'm sucking.

37:18.780 --> 37:19.780
Can't.

37:19.780 --> 37:20.780
I can't.

37:20.780 --> 37:24.980
Street far turn four.

37:24.980 --> 37:25.980
I will.

37:25.980 --> 37:28.540
I will bring those wasabi ginger chips out.

37:28.540 --> 37:29.540
That's fine.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.460
I'm not going to eat any of the end of you.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.460
Rob.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.460
Let it go.

37:33.460 --> 37:34.460
Let it go.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.460
All right.

37:35.460 --> 37:36.460
Let's go to Jonas.

37:36.460 --> 37:37.460
Our guest.

37:37.460 --> 37:38.460
Let it blow.

37:38.460 --> 37:39.460
Who can hopefully.

37:39.460 --> 37:40.460
Tell me.

37:40.460 --> 37:41.460
What?

37:41.460 --> 37:42.460
What's up?

37:42.460 --> 37:43.460
I think he's here.

37:43.460 --> 37:44.460
Oh, your friend's here?

37:44.460 --> 37:47.020
Well, do you want to give us quickly your gaming week?

37:47.020 --> 37:48.860
Of course.

37:48.860 --> 37:53.980
I'm technically playing three games competitively.

37:53.980 --> 37:57.180
Just Dance 2014 because the World Cup Invitational.

37:57.180 --> 38:00.860
Yeah, we'll let Jamie do our duty.

38:00.860 --> 38:01.860
Go ahead.

38:02.260 --> 38:10.100
Yeah, I'm competing on that, so I'm hopefully get the trip to Paris, France because the

38:10.100 --> 38:15.420
top player's good to go to Paris, France with all expenses played.

38:15.420 --> 38:23.540
Pump it at Fiesta 2 because of the United States Championships at Pacific Media Expo.

38:23.540 --> 38:27.060
And of course, like everybody's doing is Mario Kart 8.

38:27.060 --> 38:29.720
Yeah, I've been playing that competitively.

38:29.720 --> 38:35.280
Won three tournaments and I'm undefeated in rounds so far, so I'm 10-0 and 3-0.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.280
Nice.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.280
I bet.

38:37.280 --> 38:41.280
Does the Mario Kart get pretty competitive at your game rooms?

38:41.280 --> 38:42.600
In game or X2, it was big.

38:42.600 --> 38:43.600
Oh, yeah.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.840
I guess it hasn't been out long enough for you to take it to a lot of cons, but game

38:45.840 --> 38:46.840
rooms.

38:46.840 --> 38:47.840
Yeah.

38:47.840 --> 38:48.840
Zack Enemy will be the biggest test to see how big it's going to be.

38:48.840 --> 38:49.840
All right.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.840
Sounds like fun.

38:50.840 --> 38:51.840
Sounds like fun.

38:51.840 --> 38:52.840
All right.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.680
Well, let me talk about my gaming week real quick and then we can introduce our guests

38:54.680 --> 38:56.120
that just arrived.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.120
My gaming week.

38:57.120 --> 39:00.800
I played a lot of old standby stuff that I usually play, like Final Fantasy XIV stuff.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.940
They did play a few new games.

39:02.940 --> 39:06.040
Rogue Legacy on the PlayStation 4 just came out this past week, which I've played on the

39:06.040 --> 39:07.520
PC before.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.400
And obviously, I like the retro vibe this game has going on.

39:10.400 --> 39:16.720
And it obviously recalls a lot of Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, but with the roguelike

39:16.720 --> 39:21.680
twist of the fact that the castle randomizes every time you play the game.

39:21.680 --> 39:22.680
And you get more...

39:22.680 --> 39:23.680
It's Rogue Legacy.

39:23.680 --> 39:24.680
Jonas is like, what is this game?

39:24.680 --> 39:25.680
Rogue Legacy.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.680
It's a PlayStation Network game.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.440
And you can also get on PC, Steam.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.560
And the game is hard as hell.

39:31.560 --> 39:35.840
But the good news is that even when you die in the game, you don't die permanently because

39:35.840 --> 39:37.940
your predecessor takes your place.

39:37.940 --> 39:41.120
And all the gold that you collected, you can spend on upgrades.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.420
But to get back in the castle, you'll have to give up all your change.

39:44.420 --> 39:47.440
So whatever gold you don't spend on upgrades, you're going to lose.

39:47.440 --> 39:50.480
So you want to buy things every time and it'll help you make your character a little more

39:50.480 --> 39:53.200
stronger, a little more stronger, a little more stronger, until you can take on the boss

39:53.200 --> 39:56.080
characters and go into the other areas.

39:56.480 --> 40:01.120
And the other big twist in Rogue Legacy, your descendants all have issues.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.360
Most of them have issues.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.360
And that could be anything for...

40:03.360 --> 40:08.360
I say issues very, very liberally, because some of them will just say they're gay, which

40:08.360 --> 40:12.600
obviously isn't an issue, but it's just like that will change the ending if you happen

40:12.600 --> 40:14.420
to beat it with a gay...

40:14.420 --> 40:16.580
Not to be a spoiler, but that'll be something.

40:16.580 --> 40:21.200
Some of them do crazy shit, like this person is colorblind, so the whole screen is black

40:21.200 --> 40:23.200
and white when you play.

40:23.200 --> 40:27.040
Or this person has vertigo, so everything is upside down.

40:27.040 --> 40:31.840
Or this person tends to exaggerate, so whenever they take damage, the damage meter shows like

40:31.840 --> 40:35.760
five billion is the damage they took, even though it was only like 24.

40:35.760 --> 40:40.280
So some of them are really silly, but some of them really will screw with your gameplay.

40:40.280 --> 40:45.320
Some of them are tinier, this person has dwarfism, or this person has gigantism, or this person

40:45.320 --> 40:48.840
has ADHD, so they run really fast.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.840
Or just other things like that.

40:50.880 --> 40:55.320
Or this person has irritable bowel syndrome, so they make little fart noises when they

40:55.320 --> 40:58.560
jump, like your little jokes in chat, right?

40:58.560 --> 41:00.280
Like little silly things like that.

41:00.280 --> 41:05.640
But it adds a different cool little layer to the game, the fact that it's not always

41:05.640 --> 41:08.080
the same person you're running through the castle with.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.880
So yeah, if you like the retro games, if you like Symphony of the Night or Roguelikes,

41:11.880 --> 41:16.080
I think Roguelikes is really cool, and it's only like 15 bucks, it's worth checking out.

41:16.120 --> 41:21.840
Speaking of roguelikes, this one just hit Steam this week in a pre-alpha, what do they

41:21.840 --> 41:23.680
call it on Steam, first look?

41:23.680 --> 41:24.680
Early Access.

41:24.680 --> 41:25.800
Early Access, that's it.

41:25.800 --> 41:30.720
So on Steam Early Access, and I got it specifically because we have a chatter who's called into

41:30.720 --> 41:34.320
the show to talk about this game before, and I've heard a lot about this on Twitter, I

41:34.320 --> 41:38.720
checked out Crypt of the Necrodancer on Steam Early Access because it just came out, which

41:38.720 --> 41:43.320
is also a roguelike, meaning it has randomly generated dungeons and items that you find,

41:43.320 --> 41:44.880
but here's the catch.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.360
It's a music game.

41:46.360 --> 41:52.680
So, as you play, you have to move with the beats of the music, because if you don't,

41:52.680 --> 41:56.560
your character will get frozen, or you won't do the moves that you want to do.

41:56.560 --> 42:00.160
And it's really funny because as you do it more and more in time, then the rooms start

42:00.160 --> 42:02.640
lighting up like it's a disco and this stuff.

42:02.640 --> 42:07.840
So what I find that it does is it forces you to think fast, because you have to move in

42:07.840 --> 42:11.720
time with the music, you don't have time to think about, am I gonna go left or right,

42:11.720 --> 42:14.460
or have I been down here, have I been by here, because you need to already be pushing the

42:14.460 --> 42:16.060
button in time with the music.

42:16.060 --> 42:23.940
So it turns Rogue into an action game, which is kind of a really cool twist on the formula.

42:23.940 --> 42:25.700
And the fact that it's a music game, right?

42:25.700 --> 42:28.940
Yeah, and you can load your own music, but the music that comes with the game is actually

42:28.940 --> 42:29.940
really good.

42:29.940 --> 42:31.940
But you can load your own MP3s if you want.

42:31.940 --> 42:32.940
Ooh, question for this.

42:32.940 --> 42:34.840
Here's a funny question.

42:34.840 --> 42:39.520
Is the bar or the chair included?

42:39.520 --> 42:43.920
There is no bar that I've seen yet, but there is a variety of weapons, there's like a shovel

42:43.920 --> 42:46.880
and stuff, so maybe there's a hidden joke in there somewhere.

42:46.880 --> 42:51.040
I don't know if the developers played DDR a lot and really like understood the scene

42:51.040 --> 42:53.960
or what have you, but yeah, that would be funny.

42:53.960 --> 42:57.080
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

42:57.080 --> 43:00.240
Some people talking about Rogue Legacy still.

43:00.240 --> 43:03.320
Act Def says, Rogue Legacy is awesome, one of my favorite games from last year.

43:03.320 --> 43:08.740
I like the symbolism in being gay from Rogue Legacy, it changes nothing at all.

43:08.740 --> 43:12.640
Let's see, and Fifth Dream says, NecroDancer is amazing.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.560
The soundtrack is great too.

43:14.560 --> 43:18.080
So there you go, some of our comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

43:18.080 --> 43:21.880
So yeah, I had fun playing around with Krypton the NecroDancer and I see why, I think it

43:21.880 --> 43:24.400
was as I shared with Matt that had called in about the game before him, but I'm positive

43:24.400 --> 43:28.080
it was him, why he really was into this, especially as a music game fan.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.240
And I like the roguelikes.

43:29.240 --> 43:33.320
I'm starting to think the genre is a little bit, like every game wants to be a roguelike

43:33.320 --> 43:36.980
now, so I think it's starting to thin a little bit, but I think this was a really refreshing

43:36.980 --> 43:38.880
twist on that idea.

43:38.880 --> 43:43.240
So four for you, Krypton the NecroDancer, you go.

43:43.240 --> 43:47.960
And then lastly, okay, I have to bring this up.

43:47.960 --> 43:53.040
So I tried a new game this week, and the game I tried this week, I felt obligated to at

43:53.040 --> 43:58.320
least try it, because I can't hate on a game until I've played it for myself.

43:58.320 --> 44:01.640
Like I'm not gonna be that cynical bastard on the internet that hates something based

44:01.640 --> 44:05.320
on principle, unless it's Fifty Shades of Grey, I mean let's be real, everybody fucking

44:05.320 --> 44:06.320
hates that.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.360
Oh, you mean Fifty Shades of Abuse?

44:08.360 --> 44:09.360
Fifty Shades of...

44:09.360 --> 44:10.360
Nope!

44:10.360 --> 44:11.360
Yeah, that's what I was calling it.

44:11.360 --> 44:17.720
Anyway, all kidding aside, I played Kim Kardashian Hollywood, which is the most popular iPhone

44:17.720 --> 44:18.720
game right now.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.800
Stop, you are giving me judgy stares.

44:20.800 --> 44:21.800
Stop it.

44:21.800 --> 44:25.440
It is the number one game on iPhone right now, and I want to know how is this game making

44:25.440 --> 44:27.040
$700,000 a day?

44:27.040 --> 44:29.780
They're saying $700,000 a day.

44:29.780 --> 44:34.240
So here's the question you might be wondering whether you want to admit it or not.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.400
Is this game really good?

44:36.400 --> 44:40.480
And the answer is no, it's not good.

44:40.480 --> 44:44.240
But it's not as bad as you probably think.

44:44.240 --> 44:47.900
It's more like a Facebook game to me, it's a lot like a Facebook game, it reminded me

44:47.900 --> 44:52.480
a lot of that Sims Facebook game they had, where you have to spend energy to do certain

44:52.480 --> 44:57.840
tasks, and I appreciate that the game has some tongue-in-cheek humor in it.

44:57.840 --> 45:00.480
Like I don't think the game takes itself too seriously.

45:00.480 --> 45:06.000
Like I had a guy, okay so like the characters in the games will like write tweets, and tweets

45:06.000 --> 45:11.600
that mention you will get you more fans, which helps you move up on the A-list or whatever.

45:11.600 --> 45:15.740
But like, okay so there's this character I got into a fight with earlier in the game,

45:15.740 --> 45:20.160
and he decided to write a tweet about me, and what he put in the tweet, he said, a nobody

45:20.160 --> 45:22.780
ruins the party and I get kicked out?

45:22.780 --> 45:30.720
How does Rob even know Kim Kardashian, total conspiracy, hashtag Illuminati, hashtag Obamacare?

45:30.720 --> 45:33.160
And that made me laugh.

45:33.160 --> 45:38.280
And that was the little touch that I was like, alright, so this game kinda knows its place,

45:38.280 --> 45:40.360
like it's not that serious.

45:40.360 --> 45:46.160
So if you want a game that's just gonna make you laugh for five minutes, it's free, don't

45:46.160 --> 45:49.520
spend money on it, but at the same time there's really not much of a game here.

45:49.520 --> 45:54.640
It's go to this location and pose for all these pictures by clicking this bar and spending

45:54.640 --> 45:55.640
your energy.

45:55.640 --> 45:59.560
Like it's a really, like game is a really loose term with this.

45:59.560 --> 46:02.840
Like Flappy Bird was more of a fucking game than this is, okay?

46:02.840 --> 46:06.000
Flappy Bird at least, you know, yeah, you had to flap and you had to dodge and there

46:06.000 --> 46:10.080
was some skill involved, believe it or not, but there's no skill involved in Kim Kardashian

46:10.080 --> 46:11.720
Hollywood, there's none.

46:11.720 --> 46:18.840
But it's, if you read tmz.com and that type of trash, then you know what, you're probably

46:18.840 --> 46:21.680
gonna appreciate some of the trash in this game too, and that's probably why it's doing

46:21.680 --> 46:23.900
so popular.

46:23.900 --> 46:24.900
So there it is.

46:24.900 --> 46:31.960
Let's see, looking at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Blender says, can't believe

46:31.960 --> 46:35.000
Skye passed up The Last of Us for this game.

46:35.000 --> 46:42.640
All right, here's the problem, Blender, Last of Us, $50, Kim Kardashian, free, Last of

46:42.640 --> 46:48.680
Us, trip to Target or wherever, Kim Kardashian, press button and download on my phone, which

46:48.680 --> 46:49.680
I guess.

46:49.680 --> 46:50.680
Now, now.

46:50.680 --> 46:51.680
Press button, download on Steam.

46:51.680 --> 46:56.240
Yeah, I know I could download it on PlayStation 4, but still, still, I didn't want to spend

46:56.240 --> 46:58.480
all that money right now.

46:58.480 --> 47:01.520
I will get to The Last of Us eventually, I promise.

47:02.280 --> 47:08.000
For science people, I did it for science because it's the number one game and I felt an obligation.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.320
You did it for the Aperture Science reason.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.320
Because we can.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.600
Because you can.

47:13.600 --> 47:17.120
Because I was promised cake if I beat the game and I've yet to receive my cake.

47:17.120 --> 47:18.840
And you ended up being baked instead.

47:18.840 --> 47:23.320
But Dark Sakura did bring me tortilla chips, which I think we actually brought up there.

47:23.320 --> 47:24.840
And a Mexican soda, which is good.

47:24.840 --> 47:28.440
I did, made with actual sugar and not HFCs.

47:28.440 --> 47:32.040
By the way, apparently donuts are now called sugar bagels.

47:32.040 --> 47:36.120
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com is suggesting VoG Network Hollywood.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.520
Oh, I love the idea.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.520
I love the idea.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.520
But it shouldn't be VoG Network Hollywood.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.360
It should be like VoG Network Fresno.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.120
We should call it VoG-ywood.

47:45.120 --> 47:46.120
VoG-ywood.

47:46.120 --> 47:47.120
VoG-ywood.

47:47.120 --> 47:48.120
All right.

47:48.120 --> 47:53.040
Before we get to more, we have, we're going to get to gaming news and so forth.

47:53.040 --> 47:56.400
But Jonas, you invited a buddy of yours to come out to the show tonight.

47:56.400 --> 48:00.600
Why don't you, why don't you introduce who you brought to the studio?

48:00.600 --> 48:05.200
This is Diego, the second head of the teabaggers.

48:05.200 --> 48:06.200
Okay.

48:06.200 --> 48:07.200
There you go, Diego.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.200
Give Diego the mic.

48:08.200 --> 48:09.200
Hi, Diego.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.200
How are you?

48:10.200 --> 48:11.200
Good.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.200
How are you doing?

48:12.200 --> 48:13.200
Hi, good.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.200
We've never met.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.200
I'm Rob.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.200
Hi, Rob.

48:16.200 --> 48:17.200
We're doing a show.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.200
That's Jamie.

48:18.200 --> 48:19.200
That's Matt.

48:19.200 --> 48:20.200
Hi, Jamie.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.200
How you doing?

48:21.200 --> 48:22.200
How did you meet Jonas?

48:22.200 --> 48:23.200
I met Jonas.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.200
Well, actually technically we met, we could have met at Paradise Island tournament back

48:24.200 --> 48:25.200
in the day when they were still around.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.200
And we had a tournament in Sacramento.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.200
Right.

48:27.200 --> 48:28.200
Okay.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.480
So maybe, maybe we have crossed paths back in the day or whatever, one of those tournaments.

48:30.480 --> 48:34.480
Give or take, I'd say that we must've just like literally crossed paths and just didn't

48:34.480 --> 48:37.960
know there were multiple tournaments that were going on that time at the Paradise Island

48:37.960 --> 48:40.000
that was across from the Arden Fair Mall.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Yeah.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Oh yeah.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
I remember Paradise Island.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.200
And me and my other friends went there for a Smash Brothers Melee tournament while he

48:45.200 --> 48:49.760
was hosting a DDR tournament at the same time in the other parts of the room.

48:49.760 --> 48:57.680
So, but we officially got reacquainted back in 2007, January psych anime, where he just

48:57.680 --> 49:02.240
got into staffing and I just became a volunteer and then later upgraded to staff.

49:02.240 --> 49:05.000
And that's when we were part of the same exact department of gaming.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
There you go.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.040
Now, do you travel to all the conventions like Jonas does or?

49:09.040 --> 49:10.040
Yes.

49:10.040 --> 49:11.040
I'm pretty much right behind him.

49:11.040 --> 49:12.040
100%.

49:12.040 --> 49:13.040
So you were at Gamer X a couple of weeks ago?

49:13.040 --> 49:14.040
Yes, I was.

49:14.040 --> 49:15.040
How was that?

49:15.040 --> 49:16.040
How did you have a good time?

49:16.040 --> 49:17.040
Wonderful.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.520
I wish I would've gone to the first one, but it was complications with getting time off

49:18.520 --> 49:19.520
at that time.

49:19.520 --> 49:20.520
Sure.

49:20.520 --> 49:21.520
I heard the first one was a blast.

49:21.520 --> 49:25.920
The second one, which was my first one, was amazing.

49:25.920 --> 49:27.400
I wish we could have had a bigger room.

49:27.400 --> 49:28.400
Yeah.

49:28.400 --> 49:31.480
That was pretty much like cutting our legs off a little bit because we didn't get to

49:31.480 --> 49:36.680
use over 50% of our equipment and we didn't want to cause any fire hazards or have the

49:36.680 --> 49:40.480
fire marshal come in and notice because regardless of what we did, it was pretty packed, but

49:40.480 --> 49:41.480
it was still fun.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.480
It was definitely fun.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.480
Yeah.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.440
The way they did it at Gamer X this year was different too because they had that, you know,

49:46.440 --> 49:50.000
you guys unfortunately had like a pretty small room, but that's because they had other

49:50.000 --> 49:52.920
rooms where they were showing other types of games, like they had the Ouya games, they

49:52.920 --> 49:56.620
had the, you know, the sponsor games, but I say sponsor games, but yet they were showing

49:56.620 --> 49:59.360
off indie games, which was pretty awesome because there was a lot of good stuff over

49:59.360 --> 50:00.360
there.

50:00.360 --> 50:01.360
It was good for what it was.

50:01.360 --> 50:09.760
They had an entire room dedicated for Pokemon on the DS, which was amazing and as odd as

50:09.760 --> 50:14.240
it sounds for some people, but it's still very popular Pokemon today, even with the

50:14.240 --> 50:20.200
new game coming up, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and that's going to be pretty big

50:20.200 --> 50:23.880
because it just all of a sudden jumped up to fame again after when it first debuted

50:23.880 --> 50:26.720
back when the anime came out in the game in 97 or something.

50:26.720 --> 50:31.640
Pokemon does so crazy well, it really blows my mind, like how really obsessed with those

50:31.640 --> 50:32.640
games people get.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.960
My roommate's one of them.

50:33.960 --> 50:34.960
It's gotten very deep.

50:34.960 --> 50:35.960
Yeah.

50:35.960 --> 50:36.960
What do you play?

50:36.960 --> 50:41.760
What types of games, like what brought you, what games do you love that made you want

50:41.760 --> 50:43.480
to do this Game Room stuff?

50:43.720 --> 50:47.760
Well, when I first started actually taking games seriously back in the day, I was more

50:47.760 --> 50:49.760
into Smash Brothers.

50:49.760 --> 50:54.040
I'd say for a while that was my game because I got into the community and in getting into

50:54.040 --> 50:57.120
the community, that's when I pretty much was getting closer to Jonas as it is.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.760
I didn't know his reputation on DDR in the past, what he's done.

51:00.760 --> 51:04.600
As much as I had my reputation, although my group of people were not the best at it, we

51:04.600 --> 51:06.760
were more of the comedy group of doing that.

51:06.760 --> 51:10.720
So we made our stuff known as of just doing, we also did our own little videos.

51:10.720 --> 51:15.120
We had a group called Teamscape and we did our own little videos and it's just nothing

51:15.120 --> 51:16.120
to be taken seriously.

51:16.120 --> 51:19.320
It's just to listen to our corny jokes and such, but we actually just traveled around

51:19.320 --> 51:20.840
and met the high round players.

51:20.840 --> 51:25.960
I also do a little bit of Street Fighter, fighter games all around, first person shooters.

51:25.960 --> 51:28.400
I'm very versatile with video games and I like it.

51:28.400 --> 51:30.940
Okay, very cool.

51:30.940 --> 51:34.000
So are you excited for the new Smash Brothers that's coming?

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Definitely, yes.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
On 3DS?

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Yes, yes, definitely.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.400
Are you as pissed as I am that they still haven't revealed Ness as a character?

51:40.680 --> 51:43.680
I'm pretty anxious to see what's going on with all that stuff.

51:43.680 --> 51:48.360
Alright, because that's the one thing where I saw this great picture on Tumblr last week

51:48.360 --> 51:53.320
where it says, it's just a big picture of Ness and it says, I've got that summertime,

51:53.320 --> 51:59.880
summertime sadness because he still hasn't been announced as a character.

51:59.880 --> 52:02.920
Oh right, I know, and he's been in all the games.

52:02.920 --> 52:07.920
Yeah, he's a mainstay, but it's like how much do you freaking hate the Mother series, Nintendo?

52:07.920 --> 52:08.920
It's amazing.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.920
But it's like Nintendo just kicks it in the face every chance they get.

52:12.920 --> 52:15.400
They just don't see good games with good characters in them.

52:15.400 --> 52:19.280
They just don't understand Mother or online.

52:19.280 --> 52:21.320
Fair enough, fair enough.

52:21.320 --> 52:24.640
So what do people, we asked Jonas this a little bit, but from your perspective, what do people

52:24.640 --> 52:28.120
have to look forward to at SacAnime from the teabaggers?

52:28.120 --> 52:33.760
We are, we're always having different versions of games and such, we go from retro to the

52:33.760 --> 52:40.280
latest console games that we have up to date, PS4 and Xbox One, Putting in Killer Instinct,

52:40.280 --> 52:42.680
which has already been showed off through us.

52:42.680 --> 52:48.120
We are hosting a pretty big event on Saturday night where they're allowing us to rent out

52:48.120 --> 52:51.280
the rooms at the bottom where the pre-registration is.

52:51.280 --> 52:54.400
And for that night, that Saturday night, we're going to do a couple of tournaments there

52:54.400 --> 52:55.840
for the main events.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.760
And one of the big ones will be definitely Mario Kart 8.

52:58.760 --> 53:01.180
Oh nice, alright.

53:01.220 --> 53:04.260
So yeah, because Mario Kart 8 hasn't been out, we were just mentioning it hasn't been

53:04.260 --> 53:08.220
out long enough to really be at every single con yet, so this will be kind of probably

53:08.220 --> 53:10.340
at the first big, big, big tournament for it.

53:10.340 --> 53:11.340
It'll be fun.

53:11.340 --> 53:14.700
I've dabbled with it a little bit, including at GamerX, and it is a fun game.

53:14.700 --> 53:16.380
It is definitely a fun game.

53:16.380 --> 53:18.060
People are liking it a lot.

53:18.060 --> 53:22.140
And what we want to do after seeing examples through other conventions that have done it

53:22.140 --> 53:25.700
a little bit, like we said, it hasn't been gone all the way around yet on certain conventions

53:25.700 --> 53:30.780
or places, is we're going to try and make it a really big event, fill up this room,

53:30.780 --> 53:33.900
get the crowd hyped, and livestream it.

53:33.900 --> 53:34.900
Nice.

53:34.900 --> 53:38.780
I'm going to ask you a crazy question, because I asked Jonas a crazy question about like

53:38.780 --> 53:40.580
people that steal shit.

53:40.580 --> 53:43.660
So I'll ask you this, and I don't even know if this is something that happens or not,

53:43.660 --> 53:46.420
but have you ever seen a fight break out in your game room?

53:46.420 --> 53:47.660
I've heard.

53:47.660 --> 53:48.660
You've heard?

53:48.660 --> 53:49.660
I've heard.

53:49.660 --> 53:50.700
Alright, well tell us second hand what happened.

53:50.700 --> 53:56.140
I've heard of little things, but it was a, I guess it didn't escalate that much, but

53:56.140 --> 54:02.300
there have been cases of like maybe a splashing of water on something, but other than that,

54:02.300 --> 54:06.500
that was probably like personal business between two people, but it was squashed very quickly,

54:06.500 --> 54:07.980
it was taken out of the game room.

54:07.980 --> 54:09.540
Okay, that's good.

54:09.540 --> 54:13.980
Nothing escalated to draw a riot or something, which would have been really bad, because

54:13.980 --> 54:15.860
we've had tie quarters a couple of times.

54:15.860 --> 54:16.860
Yeah, yeah.

54:16.860 --> 54:19.380
Well I was just curious, like if somebody gets way into the game and they're just like,

54:19.380 --> 54:23.340
you know, like, you're a fucking cheater, da da da, and just like, you know, just try

54:23.340 --> 54:24.700
to throw a punch or something.

54:24.700 --> 54:28.620
Well, besides punching and all that, which usually doesn't seem, but as saying you're

54:28.620 --> 54:31.660
a cheater and getting mad at a game, that's every day for a gamer.

54:31.660 --> 54:32.660
That is true.

54:32.660 --> 54:34.340
They get mad at every game.

54:34.340 --> 54:36.060
Like I remember just playing Mega Man back in the day.

54:36.060 --> 54:37.060
That almost ruined my childhood.

54:37.060 --> 54:43.020
Like, oh my God, I can remember Mega Man 2, yeah, that really was giving me some early

54:43.020 --> 54:44.020
gray hairs.

54:44.020 --> 54:49.300
I was trying to get through like quick man stage, oh Jesus Christ, that just, oh wow.

54:49.300 --> 54:54.460
Yeah that, like examples of that, of a frustration, I can see someone's frustration and practically

54:54.460 --> 54:58.620
making me myself, like getting frustrated at such a game that I want to throw the controller

54:58.620 --> 55:00.040
right at the damn TV.

55:00.040 --> 55:03.580
Which is why nobody buys a Wii U, because those controllers are, you don't want to throw

55:03.580 --> 55:04.580
those.

55:04.580 --> 55:05.580
Right, exactly.

55:05.580 --> 55:06.580
It's very bad, very bad idea.

55:06.580 --> 55:07.580
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

55:07.580 --> 55:08.580
All right.

55:08.580 --> 55:09.580
Well, Diego, stay with us.

55:09.580 --> 55:12.340
That's why they make those like Nerf armor things for us.

55:12.340 --> 55:13.340
Oh yeah, right?

55:13.340 --> 55:14.340
Right?

55:14.340 --> 55:15.500
Nerf is Nerf or nothing.

55:15.500 --> 55:18.260
Stay with us, we're running a little long tonight, but we're going to get to some gaming

55:18.260 --> 55:19.260
news.

55:19.260 --> 55:23.900
Feel free to comment on any news you want to, and good luck with SacAnime and everything

55:23.900 --> 55:24.900
you have coming up.

55:24.900 --> 55:25.900
It's a pleasure to be here, yeah.

55:25.900 --> 55:26.900
Yeah, fantastic.

55:26.900 --> 55:27.900
Good.

55:27.900 --> 55:28.900
Glad to have you here.

55:28.900 --> 55:29.900
You missed us earlier, unfortunately.

55:29.900 --> 55:32.860
We're reminiscing about the good days of DDR and all that stuff, so unfortunately you missed

55:32.860 --> 55:33.860
all that fun stuff, but.

55:33.860 --> 55:36.700
I would just say that actually I don't have a history on DDR.

55:36.700 --> 55:39.860
Oh, I thought, oh, because of Paradise Island and all this stuff, I thought you did.

55:39.860 --> 55:44.020
No, actually that's definitely a rhythm music game that I've never really gotten into, sadly.

55:44.020 --> 55:46.060
I love watching it, but I'm not into that game.

55:46.060 --> 55:50.980
All right, well then you didn't miss shit, all right.

55:50.980 --> 55:53.300
We need to get into some gaming news though, we're running a little long.

55:53.300 --> 55:54.740
So I do want to keep things moving.

55:54.740 --> 55:56.300
Really quick, some housekeeping.

55:56.300 --> 55:59.460
Be sure to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and we're on Facebook as well,

55:59.460 --> 56:01.440
facebook.com slash OrangeLunchRadio.

56:01.440 --> 56:05.800
We will still be here every week with new shows, but Labor Day weekend, we will not

56:05.800 --> 56:06.940
be here.

56:06.940 --> 56:08.860
There's just a whole lot going on that weekend.

56:08.860 --> 56:12.260
Obviously we've got SacAnime, right, and Dark Soccer is going to be going over to SacAnime.

56:12.260 --> 56:16.180
I'm actually at DragonCon in Atlanta, so for those of you guys out there who are going

56:16.180 --> 56:18.700
to be at DragonCon in Atlanta, don't forget Voice Geeks Network.

56:18.700 --> 56:22.520
Going to be showing up on a few panels throughout the weekend, most notably Monday morning.

56:22.520 --> 56:24.640
There will be a VOG Network panel.

56:24.640 --> 56:26.840
More details on that as the date gets closer.

56:26.840 --> 56:30.160
But because of all the shenanigans, Labor Day weekend, and I'm sure you guys have your

56:30.160 --> 56:34.440
own things you participate in too out there in the listening world, we will have no show

56:34.440 --> 56:35.700
live that Sunday.

56:35.700 --> 56:40.400
So just be prepared for that, those of you guys that rely on us to get through your Monday

56:40.400 --> 56:41.400
work day.

56:41.400 --> 56:43.000
But the good news is, it's Labor Day weekend.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.160
There is no Monday work day, woohoo.

56:45.160 --> 56:49.520
All right, let's get into some gaming news and let's talk about it.

56:49.520 --> 56:52.520
It's been a bit of a slower week, but as I was mentioning during Bobby's show, there's

56:52.520 --> 56:55.600
a few big tent poles, big, big things going on, right, Loki?

56:55.600 --> 56:59.460
Yes, one of those being EA's Access program.

56:59.460 --> 57:03.120
It's kind of an expansion on what they used to do before, I forget what they, I think

57:03.120 --> 57:07.640
they actually called their last program like Early Access or something, where they used

57:07.640 --> 57:13.800
to give you early access to like different games right before they came out.

57:13.800 --> 57:17.320
Like I remember one of the titles that they were advertising was like Madden, where you

57:17.320 --> 57:21.400
could play it five days before there was street data on it, but you'd have to pay a

57:21.400 --> 57:25.360
fee and then at the street data, that's when it deactivates.

57:25.360 --> 57:28.080
So it's like, oh, you get hyped about this game and you get to play it before it comes

57:28.080 --> 57:29.360
out and that kind of stuff.

57:29.360 --> 57:31.140
But now this new thing is a little bit different.

57:31.140 --> 57:38.400
It's actually gonna give you access on the Xbox One to the back catalog of EA games,

57:38.400 --> 57:41.200
which on the Xbox One isn't that deep right now.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.360
It's just a couple games.

57:43.360 --> 57:49.040
But five bucks per month or $30 per year, which seems pretty reasonable, it gets you

57:49.040 --> 57:55.540
access to right now Battlefield 4, Pagle 2, FIFA 14, and Madden 25.

57:55.540 --> 58:00.920
And then it says apparently they're gonna be adding to the game's selection as time

58:00.920 --> 58:01.920
goes on.

58:01.920 --> 58:08.520
Also, it's gonna give you 10% discounts off of all EA digital Xbox One content.

58:08.520 --> 58:15.580
And they're saying that you're gonna get access to EA, big EA releases up to five days

58:15.580 --> 58:19.040
prior to their official debut, much like they were doing before.

58:19.040 --> 58:21.480
So a little bit, kind of an update on that.

58:21.480 --> 58:29.760
And then also one of the, I guess, a limited trial game, they're saying early access to

58:29.760 --> 58:30.820
some of this.

58:30.820 --> 58:33.800
One of the games that's not available, I guess, is Titanfall.

58:33.800 --> 58:38.320
It's excluded from all EA access features.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.520
So that's kind of weird.

58:40.520 --> 58:45.920
They did say, though, that Xbox Live Gold is not required to participate in this.

58:45.920 --> 58:50.500
But of course, if you wanna play online, then yes, you do need Xbox Live Gold.

58:50.500 --> 58:53.680
But as of right now, it's only on Xbox One.

58:53.680 --> 58:58.120
And apparently Sony was saying, okay, they were offered this as well, but they didn't

58:58.120 --> 59:04.000
think it was a good value for the consumer, which, let's be honest, that's just kind of

59:04.000 --> 59:05.480
a bunch of bullshit.

59:05.480 --> 59:10.400
It's more of, hey, they were offering a service that had, I mean, a couple of things.

59:10.400 --> 59:14.200
I could see the positives and negatives, but I think the negative for them was, hey, we've

59:14.200 --> 59:18.960
got this PlayStation Now service that we're trying to get people to buy four hours of

59:18.960 --> 59:26.800
gameplay for $4 or whatever, and we don't want some of the paid $5 to get access to

59:26.800 --> 59:27.800
multiple games.

59:27.800 --> 59:28.800
Or even PlayStation Plus.

59:28.800 --> 59:32.120
I didn't even really consider the PlayStation Now, I just thought that it was more competitive

59:32.120 --> 59:33.120
for PlayStation Plus.

59:33.120 --> 59:37.080
Although to be fair, Games for Gold or whatever does the same thing now.

59:37.080 --> 59:41.600
And PlayStation Plus also, they probably don't want the set president with, oh hey, we're

59:41.600 --> 59:46.740
gonna have all these different publishers offering these free trials for $5 for back

59:46.740 --> 59:47.740
catalog tiles and stuff.

59:47.740 --> 59:51.560
But you know, to be honest, I don't see the problem with it.

59:51.560 --> 59:57.280
I think it would be a good idea to offer this stuff, and everybody wants, like with cable

59:57.280 --> 59:59.620
and stuff, they want all the cart stuff.

59:59.620 --> 01:00:03.500
And that's kind of the problem where the consumers are gonna start to, I think, lose

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.860
a little bit, is it really reminds me of when Warner Brothers pulled all their movies from

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.360
Netflix because they wanted to do their own service.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:15.700
And you can guarantee, I'll guarantee you, you'll never see an EA game for free on PlayStation

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.700
Plus again.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.340
Which, I don't think we've even seen.

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.660
Wasn't Mass Effect 3 a game at one point?

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.820
I think it was at one point, Mass Effect 3 was something.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:27.700
But yeah, EA does, I don't know, but yeah, I would imagine that you're not gonna see

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:31.340
any of these games free on any of these services.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.180
I just, it's really not worth it, to be honest.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.860
Now, well yeah, and for me, I'm not a huge sports games fan, so right there, that eliminates

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:40.580
half the titles.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:46.060
And so it's just, okay, Pagel 2, which I don't need to play that for free, and Battlefield

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:50.880
4, which, let's be honest, we're getting to almost that game being out for a year now.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.440
It's gonna drop in price eventually, or hell, if I haven't played it by now, I can rent

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.100
it or buy it used or something like that.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.000
And they're thinking maybe that because it's $30 a year or something, that's gonna cut

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.920
in the used game sales, maybe so that people are less likely to want to buy used games

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.880
from EA or something, I don't know.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:14.160
It might be worth it if there was a richer back catalog, especially, and it is kind of

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.200
a bummer it didn't work out with Sony, because maybe via PlayStation Now you could get access

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:25.360
to EA's entire PlayStation 1, 2, and 3 back catalog, which would be pretty fucking impressive.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.240
Or it might be way more worth it.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:31.820
Or even like on the Xbox 360, it would have been nice to be able to play like SSX or,

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:38.640
you know, anything like Battlefield 2 or, I don't know, they have a lot of the Mass

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.880
Effect games, you know, all that stuff.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.880
That would have been worth it.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.880
Dragon Age.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:48.160
Yeah, that would have been more worth it to me, but right now, I mean, just play Madden

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:54.120
or FIFA, which I don't give a shit about, or Battlefield 4 and Pagel.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:59.400
I mean, it's like, fuck, Pagel is pretty cheap anyways, and why would I, it just doesn't

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.400
seem worth it right now.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.740
So obviously this is in the hands of consumers.

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.200
If you like it, get it.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.640
If you don't like it, don't get it, you know, and that's ultimately how well this does will

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:14.420
have a huge impact, but the only precedent that could be set here is that if it works

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:21.100
for EA, then Ubisoft's gonna want one, Activision's gonna want one, and let's remember, let's

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:26.180
flash back a little bit, it wasn't that long ago that EA came up with a crazy idea to do

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:31.460
these online passes, because they think that you should pay extra money for your used games,

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.220
because they have to run those servers and stuff, and there's gonna be somehow more people

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.940
on the servers with the same amount of games.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.740
And so this is kind of along the lines of that.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:45.220
So if this works out for EA, Ubisoft's probably gonna jump in and do this kind of thing, and

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:49.780
I'm trying to think of who also had online passes, Deep Silver maybe, I don't know, but

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.460
THQ used to do that, Deep Silver's kind of got rid of that stuff.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:58.780
I'm going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, as a person who buys an EA

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.100
sports game every year, NHL, I don't really have a need for this service.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.500
I sadly still own all the previous NHL games for, if I ever wanted to play it, many of

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.180
the free games they're offering.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:12.540
I don't, I also never really jumped on the early access ploy because I work so much and

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:16.540
I don't really have time to play things day of or morning of anymore, but for the person

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:19.220
who has time to, I can see it being worth it.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.140
But ultimately the catalog is small right now.

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.340
I'm sure they will expand it.

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:29.500
If it was take two though, a rockstar game, I'd probably have to do that.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:34.980
I just, it's, it's going to be very difficult if everybody wants to do their own.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:39.620
That's why I kind of like that PlayStation has kind of their own PlayStation plus and

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:44.180
you know, Xbox has their games for gold, but I also understand where maybe the publishers,

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.180
they want their own piece of the pie.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:51.620
So we have to kind of find that happy medium somewhere, you know, like how can publishers

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:55.860
get the amount that they feel they're entitled to, but yet the consumers don't get screwed

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.980
with having to subscribe to all these different services because everybody will lose in that

01:03:58.980 --> 01:03:59.980
scenario.

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:06.300
Honestly, I mean, if I, if you're looking to, maybe if you're looking to purchase one

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:11.580
of these titles, like say you were interested in buying battlefield four, then yeah, maybe

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:15.300
it's worth it to do this because you're going to get it for probably cheaper than battlefield

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.540
four sold for right now.

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:20.420
And then you get access to some more games for like at least a year.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.780
So it might be worth it to try that.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.180
Um, I don't know.

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:28.820
It's not that much of an investment, but yeah, I don't like the precedent that it's, that's

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:34.020
because, uh, they whore the crap out of their games with like, you know, DLC and stuff.

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:36.100
And so I, I don't know.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.100
All right.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.460
Well, uh, very curious to see what you guys think of this.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.060
I wouldn't know if anybody actually signed up for the program because this is available

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.060
now.

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.060
Right.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.060
So you can actually sign up for it now.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:46.820
Yeah.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.820
I want to know if anybody's actually, uh, got in on this.

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:52.020
So let us know in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com or you can always email us participate at orange

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.860
lounge, radio.com.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:57.140
Moving on to another story that came out this week, um, about a convention we've been talking

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.140
an awful lot about.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.220
Um, just, you know, cause dark soccer and I went a couple of weeks ago, had a panel

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.220
there.

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:04.360
Uh, we're just talking about it with Jonas and Diego a little bit of a go, but gamer

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.100
X to, um, a little bit of fallout from that convention, unfortunately that, uh, was, was

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:12.900
a little bit of drama this week, but I have to mention it cause it was kind of big news.

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:18.380
Um, NIS America reached out to founder Matt Kahn to basically say, sorry, but that pledge

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.380
of $3,000 that we'd promised you for the con, we're not going to be able to give it to you.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:26.740
Um, through, you know, I, I don't want to get too much into the details because the

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:34.140
epilogue to this is they work their shit out, but, uh, it still was, it was pretty big deal

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:37.900
because Matt actually posted the email on his Twitter.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:42.500
Not everybody thought that was the most professional thing to do in the world, which in retrospect,

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.060
it probably wasn't.

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:48.180
But taking a step back at everything, I can see where Matt was probably incredibly frustrated

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:52.700
because I know he went into debt over this convention and in his, his group collectively,

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.940
I don't want to just keep saying Matt, Matt, Matt, but his group collectively, you know,

01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:01.160
they, they spent a lot of money on that con and the hotel was not a cheap place and they

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.580
ended up, you know, going into the hole because of this.

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:08.580
So and from what I understand, they tried to get a ton of corporate sponsorships and

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.860
some of the companies, some companies were really cool about it.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.540
Like 2k Ubisoft showed up, right?

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.540
Did their thing.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.540
EA went to the first year.

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.540
Right.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:16.540
Very cool.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.220
But my understanding is some companies straight up like laughed in their face when they tried

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.980
to pitch gamer X, these companies.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:25.820
So I can understand where Matt probably gets really frustrated with, Oh, so I'm going in

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.740
debt over this and these companies don't even take it seriously.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.660
And now I'm just going to get screwed out of $3,000.

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:34.860
So probably that whole posting it on Twitter and shit was just out of frustration.

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.120
Like I just, I hit my breaking point, right?

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:42.440
So obviously in retrospect, he realized that was a bad thing to do.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.240
And I, as America realized that maybe the way they communicated that message or how

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.880
they even got to that point in the first place probably wasn't a good thing because the epilogue

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.880
is.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.360
And I asked, they, they, they had a lunch meeting and work their shit out and ass is

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.240
going to make good on their money.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.080
Everybody's hugging it out and that's all good.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.560
An interesting thing that came of this though, a very interesting, like,

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.960
So like, okay.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.440
I mean, I don't know what the agreement was.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.440
If they were just going to give them money for the hell of it or were they like advertising

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.640
their games at the con?

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.160
They were a sponsor because I remember one of the drinks you could get was a pretty bomb,

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.800
which is obviously a Disgaea reference.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.480
Well, that's kind of messed up though.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.400
If they have like their stuff there and then they're, Oh, by the way, we don't, we'll take

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.400
a free advertisement.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.400
I thought it was weird.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.920
They didn't have to pay upfront, but you know what I, I've never organized a con, so I don't

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.720
know how these agreements work and maybe it's just one of those things where it was like,

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.680
we can give you the money on XYZ day, usually, but usually it is upfront because I know like

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.200
a lot of co-op stuff, especially when you're doing events and stuff that you get the money

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.200
up front.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.660
If, if you get companies straight up laughing you out the door and then this company says,

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:57.080
we can get you the money on this day, if you'll, if you'll put us in in advance, probably didn't

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.080
want to turn that down.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.240
And it's like, I kind of get it.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.280
Like maybe in retrospect, of course, everything sounds like boy would, I shouldn't have done

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280
that.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.240
But I mean, in the moment, if you're desperate con or no con, or I'm going to go into debt,

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.220
like you probably agreed to it again, but I didn't make that deal.

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.440
I wasn't there.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:18.880
So I can't, I don't want to make it up, you know, so it is what it is.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.080
But here's the interesting side effect that happened.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:27.240
So in that 24 hour period between they sent the letter to Matt, Matt posted on Twitter

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.780
and they hug it out.

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:33.420
There's obviously that period of what the fuck NIS and all this stuff, right?

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:38.940
Devolver Digital sent out a tweet, which is interesting because Devolver Digital don't

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:41.740
remember seeing them at gamer X one or two, but it's very cool.

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.700
I'm not, not shading them or anything.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.060
It's just very interesting that now Devolver Digital literally comes out of nowhere and

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:55.560
says, we pledged $3,000, the amount that NIS was, was supposedly failed to pay.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:09:02.440
We pledged $3,000 for a 2015 gamer X sponsorship and challenge other game companies that have

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.220
the means to do so the same.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.040
Four other indie developers stepped up and said, we'll do it.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.740
And I don't have the list in front of me, but I think the makers of Thomas was alone

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:12.740
was one of them.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:13.820
So there's a few others.

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:19.380
So because of this unfortunate situation, even though they've said, we're not going

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:21.660
to do a gamer X three, we've gone into debt, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:29.260
Now they've already raised $15,000 without essentially having to do anything weird, right?

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:31.100
You guys haven't heard of this at all, huh?

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.500
This is news to us right now.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:36.900
So, well, that's, we usually don't deliver news on this show, but there you go.

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.160
But yeah, but weird how that worked out, right?

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:44.180
So it now it's like maybe gamer X three will happen after all, because all of a sudden

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:48.100
these people are literally coming out from behind the curtain saying, you know what?

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.220
This is a great con that you guys are doing.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.220
And you know, it's true.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.060
Like we were getting feedback from that as well.

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.060
They said they, a lot of people were feeling kind of sad because they felt like, oh, it's

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.500
dying and it's not coming back.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.420
And he said, it must be a way to revive this.

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.460
There must be a way for it to go on.

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:05.700
And as you were talking about the drama and so forth about what was going on, people getting

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.180
screwed over and sponsorships and stuff.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:12.100
And Jonas was relaying this to me to also kind of telling me to like, keep it to myself

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.220
at the time, but to show that, yeah, it looks like they really just got screwed over and

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.860
just, just either way, because of all the things that all the people who promise certain

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:25.580
things and we're back down and said, and then I, in my mind, I can see, I can see why they

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.580
can't do this again.

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:30.660
I know that you're out of all these problems, but knowing this now, um, it just feels like

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.820
the name itself needs to go on.

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.820
Right.

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:37.180
Well, well, ironically there, they might change that and they've talked about how they probably

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:38.780
aren't going to call it gamer X next time.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.380
They're probably going to call it something else.

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:44.100
And there have been tweets going out from the gamer X account this week, like, so what

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:45.700
if we moved it out of San Francisco?

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.700
What would you guys think?

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.700
Which I think a lot of people are like, yes, move it out of San Francisco.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:50.700
It's too fucking expensive.

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.860
They're move it, move it, move it.

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:55.980
I think a lot of people are saying that, um, but then they're also saying, what should

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.180
we call it?

01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:02.020
Because I think they want to get away from being a gay expo where they want it to be

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:09.500
really about the Sacramento so I can go cause I can't, a lot of people drove from soccer.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.500
I was shocked.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.820
How many people from SACRA at that?

01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:15.580
I'm just saying, you know, cause the teabaggers are there.

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:16.580
Yeah.

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:21.100
I, I, well shit, I need to go to like, you know, SAC anime because I haven't, you know,

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:25.180
gone since it was that was the Radisson early, but I, that sounds about right.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:29.980
I suggested San Jose and or anywhere along that line between, you know, anywhere in the

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:34.940
Bay there between, you know, down the one to one or the two 80 between, you know, near

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:38.180
SFO airport even or somewhere is going to be cheaper than in the city.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:43.100
Um, let me put it into a little bit, maybe be possible, maybe for like an area like San

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:49.100
Mateo, maybe because I'm not sure who, who are all, all part of the gamer X know about

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:54.620
yaoi con as well, which has some of the members of the other LGBT community actually being

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.620
there too.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.620
Right.

01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.780
So yeah, it's just a suggestion of San Mateo being made possibly cheaper compared to like

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.300
San Jose, which could be extremely expensive as well.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:08.620
So I, I, I'm thinking they're going to move it if they do it in another year and they're

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.740
probably going to put the feelers out there like, okay, what can $15,000 get us?

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:15.620
You know, and how much, you know, so, so they might, it might happen, uh, so it'd be interesting,

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.340
but then it's going to probably have a new name.

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.100
They also were tweeting, what should the new name be?

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.780
And this is funny because I tweeted back and I said, why don't you just call it?

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.240
Because the thing is everybody games, right?

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.740
So call it everybody games expo.

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.380
I think that'd be a great name, right?

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.380
E G X.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:28.380
I said, there you go.

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:29.380
There's your name.

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.380
Well, here's the hilarious thing.

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.100
I got a tweet just randomly, I guess somebody that was searching names or whatever.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:37.260
So somebody that represents Eurogamer expo tweeted me saying, Hey, we really want to

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:39.300
see this happen, but please don't take our name.

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.820
And I was like, Oh fuck, that's right.

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:46.340
Eurogamer expo is EGX whoops, but still, you know, they, they'll, they can, they can massage

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.340
that idea or whatever.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.340
EGX or whatever.

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.340
Yeah.

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.340
Or EGE or something.

01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:55.620
Anyway, who doesn't want to, they could do EDGE.

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:56.620
Everybody wants to edge.

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.620
All right.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:58.620
What?

01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.620
How about everybody expo?

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:00.620
E V E.

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:01.620
Eve.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:02.620
Eve.

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:08.380
And you're going to get sued by the folks that do Eve online because, Oh God, here we

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.380
go.

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:10.380
All right.

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:14.460
Just call it, um, no name con.

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.460
That's it.

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:16.460
No name con.

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.460
That's it.

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.460
How about dash con?

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.460
Does anybody use that?

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.460
All right.

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:21.460
I vote for redacted.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:26.780
Why don't they just, why don't they just call it donkey con, but I'm going to see none of

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:27.780
these names.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:31.020
Unfortunately give that whole like, Oh, this isn't everybody open type of con.

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.020
I don't know.

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.420
Inclusive con.

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:34.420
Overshare con.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:35.420
Registration con.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:36.420
Gay rave con.

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.420
All right.

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:38.420
Everybody fart con.

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:39.420
Be quiet.

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:40.420
All right.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.420
The chat room was still going on that by the way.

01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:43.420
I know.

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:44.420
That's why I said that.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:50.020
Anyway, so look, in all seriousness, uh, I best of luck to, you know, I'm, I'm glad they

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.780
resolved their shit within 24 hours of the NAS America.

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:58.620
And it's really weird how despite the unprofessionalism of NAS America and then the unprofessionalism

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:04.700
of, of gamer X and posting that out there, that yet something good came out of that possibly

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.020
like really fucking good came out of that possibly.

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.860
Um, I'm, I'm very interested to see what develops.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:11.420
Can they just call it con?

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.420
No.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.420
Be quiet.

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.420
All right.

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.420
Anyhow.

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:21.620
Akuma JP says donkey Kong only for the hung.

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:22.620
Wow.

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:23.620
Stop it.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:24.620
There you go.

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:26.540
He is going on the right road.

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:34.180
Brad says, call it VOD con if I, if I had, if, if I had $3,000 to contribute to, I would

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:40.060
love to, but I did, I bought VIP tickets or had about a little more money than, than the

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.060
average bear.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.420
Here's a question though.

01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.900
I know you've said about $15,000.

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.660
What about the potential kickstart of what they were using?

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:53.060
Like in the past, wouldn't that be additional revenue to that's, that's a decision for somebody

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:54.060
else to make.

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:56.580
I mean, but believe me, they're considering all this shit.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.580
I'm sure.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.580
Yeah.

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:02.300
So I do agree on the fact that you said about, it should leave San Francisco cause it is

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:06.220
expensive there, but not, not straight away too far, but you know, it's still like somewhere

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.220
on the Bart line.

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.220
Right.

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.220
And the San Francisco people can still go.

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.140
You know, like, like Jonas said about maybe San Mateo, because as we've seen the yaoi cons

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.860
move around throughout the time, cause we staff there as well.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:19.580
Uh, it's still kept it in a good spot in the bear that was not too far away from San Francisco.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.580
You're right.

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:21.580
Keep it through the Bart lines.

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.380
Uh, but yeah, and that changed as well.

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:28.700
And even though it'll probably go under a new ownership or whatever or whatnot, that

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:32.260
to the point that, uh, it doesn't change too drastically to the point where it's completely

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:36.980
changed itself in like inner wise, besides maybe the name and such forth, like you're

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:42.140
saying that, that some fans want to see it a bit the same way as it was before, but not

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.860
an entirely drastic change, right.

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:48.700
But I'm just saying as an opinion, as in a fan that they might see that maybe it changed

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:51.300
too much or so forth, I don't know.

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:55.700
I, I, they've got a lot of really tough decisions to make really fast just when they thought

01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:00.080
they were getting a break from con planning, but, um, I guess a unfortunate side effect

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.740
of being really popular and well liked in the community.

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:03.740
So there you go.

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:04.740
All right.

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:07.700
Well, anyhow, we got more news to get to, so let's, uh, let's keep moving.

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:12.300
Pina con, con Lada, really?

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.580
This is better than fart con.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.140
It feels like they're going off that YouTube video.

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:17.140
What was it?

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.140
Uh, Oh yeah.

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.140
The, the, what was it?

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:24.300
Sorry, we can't hear Jonas cause he's not my power thirst about the gay power thirst

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.620
where they said penis colada.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:26.620
Yeah.

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.620
There you go.

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:28.620
There's so much references in there.

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:31.580
Don't forget my favorite flavor gun.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.580
New topic.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.100
It's a Brown icon or something.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.100
All right.

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.100
All right.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.100
I'll just stop right there.

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.100
Yeah.

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.100
I'll just stop right there.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.100
Anyway.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:44.940
EA is doing some crap.

01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:45.940
How's that for news?

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.940
EA is fucking up.

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:48.940
No, I'm kidding.

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.900
Um, they actually are shutting down Ultima forever.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:55.020
It will be closed down by the end of August.

01:16:55.020 --> 01:17:02.160
It was the spiritual successor to Ultima for, um, it was a mobile title, had the stupid

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.180
transaction crap going on.

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.820
Um, it's, they're shutting it down on August 29th.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:12.700
Can we, I was going to say, can we sue them for false advertisement?

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:17.680
Durr wamp wamp.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.160
It's not really forever.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.000
Um, I have a great respect for the Ultima series.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.340
Like I loved it on the NES and in the Commodore days and the old computers and so forth and

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:31.040
all that being said, good fucking re riddance to this trash cause that game was awful.

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.160
So they also shut down Lord of Ultima.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:40.920
Well, the Ultima did not translate well to a mobile at all and uh, that I don't think

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:46.320
that was Ultima's fault as much as it was the, um, uh, fault of, uh, the game design

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.280
behind it and what, you know, EA was doing with their mobile games cause they've done

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.880
it in other games that haven't done well.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.720
Fifth dream colon con.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.720
Stop it.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:05.000
And I just said what I was thinking Ultima not forever for the record fifth dream Decepticon

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.280
I do believe already exists as there is a Decepticon.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:13.440
Yeah, of course there's also botcon and the other major transformers conventions.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.760
All right, moving on.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:15.760
Uh, Loki.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:26.320
Do they have like conjugate as like a, like a grammar con anyways, I'd go, uh, Nintendo

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:33.880
unfortunately has posted $97 million as a loss, um, for the last quarter.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.840
Fortunately Mario Kart eight, it did great, but it just wasn't enough.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.360
And um, you know, they had a great attachment rate against, they're saying almost 3 million

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:47.640
units, um, were shipped by the end of June and you know, definitely people are buying

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.640
the title.

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.400
It's just, what else did they have come out?

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.720
I mean, not a lot else.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.720
I mean, just wasn't, wasn't enough.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.800
Of course, um, probably should be a little bit better through the fourth quarter.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:06.600
I know they've got like a lot more games expected out and um, hopefully that sells more units.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.440
Smash Brothers should help.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.120
Definitely that's the, just that, that, that's a name that will go on.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.120
Definitely.

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.680
But I mean, I understand that it's just, you know, the average mom and pop consumer, you

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:23.320
know, I don't know, but their kids will, they need, no one really helped the Wii or the

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.000
Wii U or both Zelda.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.640
Well, Zelda, yes, but a legitimate Pokemon game on, I'm really surprised they haven't

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.640
gone there.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:38.160
It's probably cause they haven't figured out how to be able to transfer data between 3ds

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.160
and the Wii U.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.160
It can't be that hard.

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.160
It can't be that hard.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.160
Do it through a Nintendo network.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.160
Just like, just like online or DLC, it can't be that hard.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.640
But yet for some reason, it escapes them.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.440
They have that fucking cloud thing that people are paying for for the Pokemon now.

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.520
Cause I remember they treaded that with Pokemon revolution and then that didn't go so well.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:57.320
But the reason the problem is right now is because don't they not have, their accounts

01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:02.140
are tied to, um, they're not tied to your Nintendo account.

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.480
It's tied to your console, isn't it?

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.480
No, is it?

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:09.720
Um, so I think that's why they don't have a unified, you know, eShop account or anything

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.880
I feel like I've seen, can't, okay.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:18.480
If the Wii can beam demos to your 3ds, then this technology cannot be that difficult for

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:19.480
the DS.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.680
I mean, they, they both have a Bluetooth stuff in them, right?

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.680
That they could transmit data.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.680
It can't be that hard.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.240
I mean, I realized this is Nintendo, but it really can't be that hard.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:32.360
Look, Mario Kart 8 kind of made us go, Oh, Nintendo really can do this shit.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360
Wow.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360
They probably already do.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.360
They're just too afraid to actually test it out.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360
It might flop.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360
May.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.360
Yeah, they can't.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.360
They definitely do.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.360
They can't afford to have a flop.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.360
Actually.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.360
Wait, wait.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.360
The realization is completely obvious.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.260
I can't believe I didn't even think about it.

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:49.040
You know why they haven't put a Pokemon game on the Wii U?

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:52.520
It's because they haven't manufactured the fucking amiibo characters that are going to

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.140
go along with it.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:58.360
That is why they haven't put a Pokemon game on the Wii U because they're going to fucking

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.480
whore the shit out of that.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:06.180
You think, you think Activision or Skylanders and Disney infinity, you know, horse those

01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:07.180
characters.

01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:10.180
You have not seen anything yet.

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.320
You have not seen anything yet.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.860
The fans of those series, I mean, Skylanders, no one who knows who the fuck the Skylanders

01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:17.860
are.

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:21.920
I mean, kids, I'm surprised that they attach themselves to like these brand new characters,

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:27.780
but Pokemon characters, all ages are going to eat that shit up because you got to collect

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:28.780
them all.

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.540
I mean, and they're going to buy all of them.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:31.540
All right.

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:32.540
Well, here's Kaijuto in chat.

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:37.020
The reason why we don't have Pokemon on the Wii U is because the game is made for handheld.

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.240
That's why it's called Pocket Monsters.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.020
It's a handheld game, not a console.

01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.380
I like it where it is.

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:45.060
I understand that, but money talks.

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.060
You know what I mean?

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:53.780
Like, gee, the Pokemon stepped into a growth machine and now it's Pokemon in giant giant

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:54.780
world.

01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.980
It's called Pocket Monsters because they collect them in Pokeballs, which fit in your fucking

01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:58.980
pocket.

01:21:58.980 --> 01:21:59.980
Done.

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:00.980
Yeah.

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:03.360
I'm like where, where there's a check, there's a way.

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.360
You know what I mean?

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.140
They'll, they'll figure out a way to retcon it in the story.

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:11.340
I do, I do appreciate the viewpoint though that, yeah, that's how Pokemon was certainly

01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:16.140
born, but if Nintendo really needs the money and needs to do it, they could.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.940
That's how they'll transfer data back and forth too is because they're going to have,

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:24.460
remember, the amiibo support for 3DS at some point, and that's how it's going to work.

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:29.940
That they will have a game that comes out on 3DS and on, you know, Wii U and it'll transfer

01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:34.620
data back and forth just like they do with the 3DS versions right now and the DS versions

01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:35.620
and all that fun stuff.

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:37.100
All right.

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:38.100
Let's move on.

01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:39.100
Dark Sakura.

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.100
Oh, that's right.

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:42.100
Well, how about something about Killer Instinct?

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:43.100
Well.

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.100
Huh?

01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.580
Oh, there was some discussion.

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:51.740
Killer Instinct is going to be having a retail release.

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:57.060
This is the Double Helix version, by the way, not the really awesome very first game as

01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:01.020
we remember KI Gold from the N64.

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:03.740
They have this one that I have yet to touch.

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:10.620
Microsoft basically has put out the announcement that on September 23, Killer Instinct will

01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:17.340
be available out to purchase a retail version, and it will come with the first season and

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:24.340
the season 2 TJ combo code for $19.99, which is a little bit better than the combo breaker

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:25.340
pack.

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.340
So.

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.740
There you go.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:33.420
So this would be good for people that maybe don't get online all the time with their system

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:36.220
to be able to get the game, I guess.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.220
Probably four.

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:38.220
Yeah.

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.220
It makes sense.

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:43.020
I mean, I think that maybe the just the online only thing didn't quite work out well for

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.020
them.

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:48.380
Is it also coming out holiday September, September 23rd close enough.

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:51.980
That might be the that might be the reason is so it can be something that shows up under

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:55.220
the Christmas tree or Hanukkah Bush or whatever it is.

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.060
Hanukkah Bush, probably.

01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:04.460
I mean, that's still way, way early, even for Hanukkah and for Christmas.

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:06.460
This is basically like an afterthought.

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:09.060
I think we didn't get enough money out of this.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:12.340
Let's put it out for the people who didn't want to do online purchases.

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.340
All right.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:16.860
Well, let's talk about something that's coming a little bit sooner than September 23rd.

01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.340
How about this week in retail?

01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:22.780
Loki starting off with the U.S. release dates, really only two games this week, Sacred three

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:27.940
on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Ultra Street Fighter four on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:32.860
The disc version, of course, because you could purchase the download a while ago.

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:37.180
So we're just in a drought until Labor Day, pretty much.

01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:38.180
Right.

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.180
And like destiny.

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:40.180
Yeah.

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:41.180
Oh, there you go.

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:46.220
I guess it'll be a little while and it's going to be this is your time to catch up, people.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:48.660
That's what this is.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:51.780
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andereto at VOG Network

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:52.780
dot com.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.780
Use the passphrase North.

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.740
Well, if you're in Japan, things are a little more exciting on the PlayStation three this

01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:58.740
week.

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:03.620
Anyway, over in Japan, Lost Dimension Shin Hayarigami comes out this week as well.

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:07.380
And Ultra Street Fighter four gets its Japanese release this week.

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:11.420
So is that to look forward to on the Xbox 360, you can get Ultra Street Fighter four.

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:15.420
Should you actually be in Japan and have an Xbox 360 for the dozens of you out there with

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:16.420
one?

01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:18.180
And then are you a unicorn?

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:23.700
And on the Wii U, Dragon Quest 10, the all in one package comes out this week because

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:28.940
over in Japan, they actually got Dragon Quest 10 on the Wii U, whereas here we're still

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:29.940
waiting.

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:33.180
Although I thought I heard something that's going to be a 3DS thing.

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.180
Do we touch on that?

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:37.740
I thought I heard somewhere around that, that it is going to end up make its way over here

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:40.440
at some point, which is exciting.

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:45.860
On the PlayStation Vita this week in Japan, Lost Dimension and Shin Hayarigami, which

01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:48.300
were also on a PS3, are also out on Vita.

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.300
So that's pretty cool.

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.400
Some more stuff on the Vita.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:56.900
And lastly, on the 3DS, Dragon Ball Heroes Ultimate Mission 2, Farming Simulator 14 Pocket

01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:04.320
No. 2, Senran Kagura 2 Shinku comes out on 3DS, and Bravely Default for the sequel goes

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.460
into the Ultimate Hits edition.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:10.400
Keep in mind, Bravely Default for the sequel is actually what we got over here as simply

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.540
Bravely Default, because I think Bravely Default for the sequel was an enhanced version of

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:18.540
the original game that they had out on Japan, so it's not like an actual sequel or anything

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:19.540
like that.

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:25.380
Not yet anyway, but I believe one is coming really soon in Japan, like this year.

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.580
So there you go, Japanese release dates.

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.740
How about the UK, Darusaka?

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:30.740
Only two things.

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.020
Well, sorry, three things.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:37.940
On August 6th is Metrico for Vita and Road Not Taken for PlayStation 4.

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:42.540
And on the 8th, Ultra Street Fighter IV.

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:48.060
AkumaJP clarifying the Dragon Quest X question, AkumaJP says, next month, Dragon Quest X free

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:53.580
on new 3DS purchase, and since he's in Japan, that must be how they're pushing it forward

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.580
over there.

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.580
That's pretty cool.

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:57.660
I hope it makes its way over here, because I'd like to check it out.

01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:01.580
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:03.580
But first, Loki.

01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:05.580
Alright.

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:12.340
So this is kind of ridiculous, but apparently, the brand new game that was done by, was it

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:17.820
the guys that did the, what was it, Black Forest Games, they did the Gianna Sisters

01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:21.780
remake, sequel, whatever you want to call that.

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:28.980
They had a brand new game called Diesel Stormers, and it was a kind of a dieselpunk action game.

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:37.780
They got a, I guess, a trademark, or their trademark blocked, because apparently, Diesel,

01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:41.220
the fashion brand, had a problem with it.

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:45.260
They were saying that it's going to cause confusion.

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:51.740
So I don't know, it seems like there's no case, they said, in all probability, an understanding

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:56.460
will be reached as Black Forest has no intent to create clothing under the Diesel Stormers

01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:58.100
brand in Diesel.

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:02.240
The Diesel part of Diesel Stormers refers to the liquid fuel of the same name, and not

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.440
a parody of the fashion brand.

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:10.940
So yeah, it's a little ridiculous, but you gotta love that trademark law and copyright

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.100
law.

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.580
I guess you gotta defend it in order to keep it.

01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:15.580
I guess that's true.

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.460
It's a little ridiculous, though.

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.340
Do they sue gas stations, too?

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.340
I don't know.

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.340
But seriously, that's a little ridiculous.

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:24.340
What about that Vin guy?

01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.340
Right?

01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.340
Yeah.

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:29.900
Oh no, they settled with him out of court.

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:35.500
I completely forgot Diesel was even a fashion brand until they mentioned this lawsuit.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.900
They're just tired of not being relevant anymore.

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:42.900
I only know because I might have underwear that says Diesel on it.

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:44.900
And clearly that's because of the liquid fuel, right?

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:45.900
Burn it, Rob.

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:46.900
Burn it and protest.

01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:47.900
I'm a big fan of the game.

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:48.900
What can I say?

01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:49.900
I'm very committed.

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:50.900
What?

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:51.900
What?

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:53.460
What?

01:28:53.460 --> 01:29:00.860
If you put Diesel fuel on your underwear, you'd have underwear ception, Diesel ception.

01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.140
You've got problems.

01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:06.140
You hang out with me.

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.140
But how much longer?

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.140
Just kidding.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:09.140
Bitch, please.

01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:13.380
You should have seen the way her face changed when I said that.

01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:14.380
All right.

01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:15.700
The chat room's going with you.

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:16.820
Fifth Dream says, I'm confused.

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:20.220
This is about Vin Diesel.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:24.020
Tiger Claw says, is Diesel even a real last name?

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:25.380
Someone went to Kevin Nash as well.

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:27.060
Kevin Nash used to go by Diesel.

01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:29.260
Big Daddy Diesel.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:30.260
Dungeon Buster says, good grief.

01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:31.440
Minus the quad.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.440
Good grief.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.300
Another marketplace confusion lawsuit.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:35.300
I don't...

01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:36.300
It's fine.

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:37.300
Look.

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:38.300
One is underwear.

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:39.300
One is a game.

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:40.300
It's very, very different.

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:41.980
I don't understand.

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:46.700
And all three of them are flammable.

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.420
And seriously, it's like...

01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:50.700
Especially when being warned by me.

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.660
No, it's seriously just like, uh...

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:57.020
Did you say that your panties get set on fire?

01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:59.460
Was it Monster Cables and, um...

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:01.820
I want to say Monster Cables and Monster Energy.

01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:03.820
They go in the rounds and sue everybody that's Monster.

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:04.820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:07.900
Because they sued the Monster Golf place in Folsom, right?

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:08.900
Yeah.

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:09.900
Well, the chain.

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:10.900
Yeah.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.900
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.900
Oh, boy.

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:13.900
All right.

01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:16.660
One more story for you guys here for part A. And this is about the...

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:20.340
Credit card that you may have heard about this week at...

01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:23.420
Available at Evil G, which of course is the...

01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:27.740
Our loving name for the GameStop retail chain.

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:30.100
And I'm gonna be honest.

01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:35.000
This news came out, and I was actually more surprised that this wasn't already a thing.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.500
Because GameStop is going to be bringing out their own credit card.

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:43.480
So a GameStop credit card is gonna come out in the next few months, and this will be something

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:48.560
that their employees can push for incentives, I'm sure, along with pre-orders.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.680
If you sign up, you will get 5,000 power-up points if you're a power-up basic member.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.880
And if you're a pro member, you get 15,000 power-up points.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:00.760
And you're already pre-approved if you're a member, I guess, which seems weird because

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.480
some people have some really shitty credit.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.480
I don't know.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:08.480
But anyway, the interest rate is a low, low 26.99% APR.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.440
Sounds like my student loan.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:18.240
That means for every $100, it gets $27 in interest a year.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.040
And of course, they calculate that by the day.

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:24.680
But anyway, most credit cards for reference, 13 to 15%.

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:25.680
So yeah, there you go.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.520
You can get some points if you spend money with your GameStop card.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.880
I'm gonna be honest though, as crap as this whole situation sounds and everything, there's

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:39.200
also a part of me that goes, well, every retail chain has a fucking card.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.920
Sears has a card.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:41.920
Surprise has a card.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.640
The rate on our Sears card is something like 4%.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:46.640
Yeah.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.960
Well, I actually, full disclosure, I have a Sears card.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.880
But the reason why I have one is because they had a good deal where when we bought the washer

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.000
and dryer, you don't have to pay any interest at all as long as you pay it off within like

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.440
18 months or something like that.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.080
We got ours a long time ago when we got Dan's power tools.

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.800
Power tools.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:11.080
Can I imagine like if you just pay off your, you know, if you make your payment every month,

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:16.640
like pay it off in full every month and you can earn points or whatever, I guess.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:22.280
If you're good with credit, but here's the thing, that's the only kind of shady thing

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:26.520
I see here is that GameStop, what do they kind of tend to cater to?

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:32.120
The younger folks right in that 18 to 23 area.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.400
Poor impulse control and no sense of responsibility.

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.960
Who are most likely to fuck up their credit.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.820
You know, and I'm not saying, I'm sure many of you that listen to the show fall into this

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:43.680
age bracket, just, you know, make smart decisions with the credit.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:47.800
If you're going to get something like this, you really do have to pay it off because that

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.740
shit will haunt you for a long, long time if you don't.

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:54.600
So just words of advice from your pals at OLR.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.600
So shop responsibly.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:57.600
That's right.

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.600
That's right.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:02.560
Don't, there's, remember that's $27 for every hundred you spend.

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:05.320
That's like one and a half games a year.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:06.320
If you don't pay it off.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.320
Yeah.

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:11.680
Worse if it's someone buys a console, I'm going to buy a PS4 and Xbox One.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.320
And keep, keep in mind that's going to be added on monthly.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:19.600
So whether, even if you pay it off three months later, you're still paying them some money.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:24.320
So I think the question will be here, big, big thing here.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:28.400
And Bobby Black Wolf adding to this conversation, I have a best buy credit card, but all my

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:31.240
purchases are zero if I pay off by certain dates, like a similar thing.

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.520
So another retail chain with one.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:36.580
SDG100Matt says, the sick thing is that the suckers that they're going to heavily pressure

01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:41.760
people into getting these cards don't really know how bad 27% APR is.

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.080
That's what I kind of want to wait and see.

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.720
I want to see how GameStop pushes this.

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.120
Are they going to be preying on the week essentially?

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:53.200
Like what the fuck did the power up reward points get me?

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.200
What the hell is that?

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:55.200
Discounts, free games, magazines.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.200
I don't know.

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.680
What does, I don't shop at GameStop.

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:01.160
I literally don't know anyone shop at GameStop.

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:04.600
You have shopped at GameStop with me there to watch.

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.340
My assumption is used game credit or deals and things like that.

01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:13.480
For the record, they usually have really good deals on their used 3DS games.

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:20.080
So I've gone, but I think, you know what, I think this, I think if we really, really

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:25.080
are against these policies that companies are doing, we really should just say, okay,

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.520
we're not going to be a part of it anymore at all.

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:33.080
Not even if they have good sales, not even if it's, you know, we happen to be there or

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.400
they're the only ones who are carrying a game.

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:39.560
If you're going to stand against something, then including their, their little credit

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:43.600
thing, then tell them with your money.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.780
So here's something else that's kind of interesting that came out about GameStop this week on

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.720
a completely different note, but something to think about when you're going to be doing

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:55.080
business with them is obviously GameStop huge in the business of buying back your games

01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:58.140
and reselling, right, and all that stuff.

01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:03.360
So in some areas it should be noted that video game trade-ins like the ones at GameStop are

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:09.120
treated like pawn shops with the pawn shop laws and pawn shops in some areas, one of

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.680
them being Philadelphia, have to scan fingerprints.

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:17.100
So there's a Philadelphia GameStop out there that is now scanning fingerprints that started

01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:19.400
about a month ago.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.040
Because that way if, you know, they find the fingerprints on stolen goods, then they know

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.160
either they can kind of trace it on stuff, right?

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.960
That's the thought behind it, whatever.

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:28.200
But here's the interesting thing.

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:33.680
Those scans, so when you get your finger scanned, that goes into a Leeds online database, which

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:40.480
is quote, the nation's largest online investigation system to recover stolen property, help stop

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.120
meth makers, reduce metal theft, and solve crimes.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.760
I don't really have a problem with that.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.160
It's not anything new.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:51.240
They do that at my GameStop nearby.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.760
If one, back when I was treating stuff in, they do that because they do have theft in

01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.440
the area and so they want to make sure that people aren't turning in stolen goods.

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.600
Well just, if you're one of those people that, you know, the NSA is watching you masturbate

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:10.200
and all that stuff, then just throwing it out there, your fingerprints, you know, when

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:13.520
you have a driver's license, your fingerprints are already in the fucking system.

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:17.280
It doesn't matter.

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.400
But now, now they'll know when I sell back Onechambara, they'll know that I was playing

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.400
that.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:27.440
You'll get a call from D3, why didn't you like that game?

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:28.440
What the fuck?

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.480
You know, we worked hard on that.

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.580
We're going to have to fire employees because you didn't like that game.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.320
The boobs weren't big enough, unfortunately for me.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:43.880
Honestly, putting the tinfoil hat aside, seriously, I think it's a good idea.

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:48.920
You know, when Dan was a manager, he would talk about all of these people that would

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:58.280
just come into the store who were clearly not all there, as in, like, clearly had stolen

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.280
items.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.160
That's why they don't take games back if they've still got shrinkwrapping on them and all of

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.160
that.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.160
That doesn't go far enough.

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.500
They just learn, okay, I got to rip this shrinkwrap off.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:12.540
So power up rewards, basically you earn points, you can get crap.

01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:17.420
And so, for example, some of the things you can get, for 6200 points, you can get Boba

01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:18.420
Fett necklace.

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:22.320
Oddly enough, there's a ton of fucking Star Wars shit on here and I'm not sure why.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:28.380
So if I sign up for my 28% APR credit card, I can get a Boba Fett necklace?

01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:33.620
You can get for 29,500 points, you can get Boba Fett candy bowl holder.

01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:39.100
I just want to throw out there, at least it's not Jar Jar Binks, right?

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:42.380
I just want to throw out there, there's other credit cards that will give you a flight to

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:44.780
Hawaii if you sign up for their credit card.

01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.660
Do they also include a Boba Fett necklace?

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.660
They do not.

01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:48.660
Oh my god.

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:49.660
So you have a tough decision to make.

01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:50.660
Do you want Hawaii?

01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:52.660
Or a necklace?

01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:57.420
6,000 points, 25% off a pre-owned handheld game.

01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:02.660
Mind you, you get 10% off anyways with your power up rewards card as it is.

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:05.580
12,490 points, a Millennium Falcon model.

01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:09.340
Yeah, I don't understand why all this shit's Star Wars stuff, but I think that's just an

01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.340
example.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.340
I'm surprised it's not the Slave I.

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:12.340
It's still on Boba Fett.

01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:13.340
Yeah.

01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:14.340
It felt like a line of Boba Fett toys.

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:19.220
You can get Stormtrooper earrings for 7,940 points.

01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:20.500
So yes, quality stuff.

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:23.420
We're a plastic Stein for 7,200 points.

01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.500
Did you say Stormtrooper earrings?

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.500
Stormtrooper earrings.

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.500
What in the world?

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:29.500
Yeah.

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:30.500
Alright.

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:34.380
I feel like these are not the earrings you're looking for.

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:37.180
Star Wars Episode I, the GameStop menace.

01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:39.060
Alright, look.

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:42.900
We're going to take a trip to when it wasn't so ... You know what?

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:47.540
The rewards program that you got points for was the Nintendo Fun Club, and that was it.

01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:51.220
We're going to go back to a classic time in gaming history.

01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:54.660
It's Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.100
hey, you little brats.

01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:58.540
I dusted the vault today.

01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:03.880
Trade in your games, send the money to me, and then go play this, and I'm going to go

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:04.880
eat tacos.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:08.000
Dark Sakura, what's the classic game of the week?

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:15.520
Mylon's Secret Castle, or as it was known in Japan, Meikyu Kumi Kyouku Myron no Daiboken.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.520
What?

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:22.280
The maze suite Mylon's Great Adventure, it was Myron.

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:27.920
It was an action-adventure game that came out by Hudson for Nintendo.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:34.280
Actually, it was originally on Famicom on November 13th, 1986, and came out in the US

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:37.240
in September 1988.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:43.400
The protagonist, as we all said, Mylon here, but it was Myron, lives in the land called

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.040
Hudson, where people use music to communicate.

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:50.760
Are there bees there?

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.160
I know, right?

01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.440
Oh, actually, there were honeycombs.

01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:55.920
I do remember that.

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.920
Yes.

01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.840
Anyway, he was the only one who didn't have the ability to communicate and wondered why,

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:06.940
so he goes out to travel throughout the land, the land of Hudson, to find other people who

01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:13.120
were like himself, but he stops to go to visit Queen Eliza, who lives in Castle Garland,

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.700
which is also Hudson's Secret Castle, and then he found it was being attacked, and shenanigans

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:19.700
ensue.

01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:27.100
So, basically, you run and jump and shoot bubbles, and you start off on the bottom floor

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.980
of a four-story castle, and you have to work your way upwards.

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:36.000
You've got three main stories, the side towers, and the very top.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.040
If you stay outside the castle too long, lightning bolts fall out of the sky.

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.880
There are also enemies, hidden items, the bubbles.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:47.880
Don't stay outside or God is going to kick your ass.

01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.760
The Lord.

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:53.720
Yes, the Lord is going to send lightning bolts down.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.620
The bubbles are also not just a tool, they are a weapon.

01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:03.600
You get weapon-throwing bubbles, and you can throw them at blocks to cause them to break.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:10.240
Also, there's hidden items, but there are also additional routes, hidden shops, different

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.760
items you can find that way.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.680
You also can destroy demons that inhabit certain rooms, but they do come back to life after

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.640
a while.

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:23.780
You've got different bosses that are larger, basically bigger demons, and you have to use

01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:25.560
bubbles to spit at them.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.180
I'm sorry, I'm thinking of Bubble Bobble.

01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:33.500
They attack by jumping back and forth and throw fireballs at you.

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:39.280
And then when they die, they release a crystal ball, like in Castlevania.

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:44.480
And then Mylon gets Biggle Bubbles and he can fly them out faster.

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.780
So you have only one life.

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:51.040
When you lose your life, your game is over and you must start over.

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:54.780
But if you hold left on the control pad while pressing start at the title screen, you can

01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.860
pick up where you left off.

01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:00.000
It does not work before collecting the first crystal.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:08.460
And this instruction was only in the Japanese manual, so folks in America had to figure

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:12.700
that shit out for ourselves.

01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:16.540
Or import.

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:21.520
Or if you signed up for their credit card, they'd tell you.

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.820
So it's a really freaking difficult game.

01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:26.540
I mean, it's fun, don't get me wrong.

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:29.540
It's just really difficult.

01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:33.140
It's got some interesting tidbits to it.

01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:39.600
So like I said, there's the left and start to start from where you left off.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:46.000
Mylon actually doesn't become invincible after he's attacked, you know, when he's hit that

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.180
blinking animation.

01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:53.580
But each room in the castle has the honeycomb that restores your life.

01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:58.460
And extends it by one unit, so that was the honeycomb you were talking about, Rob.

01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:03.300
It also is a little unorthodox in the way the other 2D platformers can be.

01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:11.100
The rooms can be accessed in any order, and they don't really go like in one direction.

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:16.420
In each room there's only the one exit that's at a fixed spot, but it doesn't appear until

01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:18.780
you fire a bubble where it's hidden.

01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:23.460
And then navigating each of the rooms, you know, like I said, it's free flowing.

01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:25.700
It goes around in different directions.

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.820
You can explore it however you want to.

01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:32.320
Plus it also has a side quest of finding music boxes.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:36.400
If you touch a music box, you go to a mini game where you attempt to pick up as many

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:42.940
musical notes as possible, with extra points for sharps and negative points for flats.

01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:49.780
And basically, each time you collect a music box, you get an elf with a different instrument

01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:53.460
each time, and the song gets more and more elaborate than they play in the background.

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:54.460
That's right.

01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:57.540
This might surprise you, Darcy, I own this game, actually.

01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:58.540
It doesn't surprise me.

01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:02.660
I had this game, this was one of the few NES games I had, this was probably one of the

01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:07.060
first games I actually had on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and yeah, I remember

01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:08.060
that.

01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:11.180
But this game was, no joke, this game was hard as hell.

01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:15.340
I couldn't even really get past just the first couple of rooms.

01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:21.940
GameSpot gave this game a really bad review for its control, saying that, and this is

01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:27.780
a quote from Frank Provo of GameStop, sorry not GameStop, GameSpot, that Milon runs like

01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:31.540
his feet are greased, his jumps are easily interrupted by nearby blocks that are adjacent

01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:32.540
or directly above him.

01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:34.420
He gave it a 2 out of 10.

01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:38.860
The one thing I didn't really care for about it is that most of the shit in it is hidden.

01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:44.400
Like there's, to progress in the game, you have to find all this hidden stuff, which,

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.240
you know, when you're younger, you don't want to be looking for that shit.

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.240
Ain't no one got time for that shit.

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.960
Ain't nobody got time for that.

01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:55.520
Anyway, there was a Game Boy version that came out.

01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:05.120
There was also, in 1993, there was Mira no Meikyu Kyumi Kyoku, that's almost a tongue,

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:11.760
which was just called Milon's May Suite, and it did come out in the U.S. as well.

01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:17.360
There were a lot of different differences, the Game Boy version had smaller rooms, it

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:24.960
had less stuff, and then you had like different money between the different versions.

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:31.480
There was also a sequel that came out for the Super Famicom, which was only out in Japan,

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:41.720
called Doremi Fantasy Mira no Doki Doki Daibouken, and there were also other sequels that were

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:44.160
all Satellaview games.

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:51.360
There was BS Doremi No. 2, BS Doremi Okuno Original Sound Witch, Blue Sword Witch, and

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:56.080
BS Doremi Okuno Original Sound Witch Power Sound Witch.

01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:05.200
So there were also cameos by Milon, or Miron, in the Sega Saturn Saturn Bomberman and in

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:10.280
Star Soldier, where there are Milon titles to be discovered, and then there's a puzzle

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:18.720
game that came out on the DS called Mira no Hoshizora Shabon Puzzle-Kumi Kyoku.

01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:26.200
And then, yeah, there were also, though, it did, on the Japanese Hudson channel for PS2

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:31.360
and the Wii's Virtual Console, there was a re-release of this, and there's also a Nintendo

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.480
3DS Virtual Console one as well.

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.520
Came out October of 2013.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:39.760
And actually, it did come out in the PAL region as well.

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:42.120
So there you go.

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:44.960
There it is, your classic game of the week, the hardest hell and hard to control, but

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:46.720
still relatively unique.

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:50.160
I'm going to eventually say Kumi Kyoku properly.

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.920
Kumi Kyoku.

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:55.200
Milon's Secret Castle, or Milon's Secret Castle.

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.760
Meikyu Kumi Kyoku Mira no Daibouken.

01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:01.080
Oh god, we're seeing it in the YouTube right now.

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.240
That's that boss, I never could get past this guy, he was too hard.

01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:07.120
Is this a speedrun or a full play?

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:10.080
I think it's a full play, because the guy was stuck in that one room for forever.

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:11.640
What is that, a giant dragon?

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:14.600
It's like, it looks like Kraid from Metroid.

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:18.120
I thought, doesn't he look like, he looks like a winged hyena.

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:19.760
It looks like his feet are going to tickle you.

01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:20.760
It's like tickle tickle tickle.

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:23.200
He kind of looks like a winged hyena.

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:24.720
It looks like Bowser.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:28.080
It looks like every room is the same, I can't tell it's red.

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.920
It might be, well that's the outside of the castle, now he's, oh god, I remember this

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.320
room where he flew through the little.

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.040
Now I feel like he's playing Metroid in a way, I don't know why.

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:38.880
Alright, anyway, sorry, this is Bionic Commander, horrible radio while we're talking about

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:39.880
a video here.

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:42.080
And Blinder, yes, it was Do Re Mi.

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.400
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.920
Hey guys, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere.

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:49.920
Do Re Mi.

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:50.920
Faso Latido?

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:51.920
I was explaining.

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:52.920
A deer?

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.920
A female deer?

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.920
Oh fuck, wrong.

01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.560
Alright, anyway, don't go anywhere guys, we've got plenty more Orange Lawn training to come.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:04.160
Your answers to the Frugal Question of the Week, mailbag, phone calls, and is Jonas

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:07.040
going to be here for the FUs of the week?

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.520
I cannot wait.

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:11.520
So we'll be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:23.520
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this August the 3rd of 2014, with

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:28.480
the 562nd episode of our show already in progress.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:34.920
Joining us in the studio tonight, Jonas and Diego from the T-Baggers, which actually means

01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:36.720
the Big Anime Game Room.

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:38.800
There you go, either way sounds great.

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:46.320
But well, did you, have you guys got, I guess your website is tabgr.org.

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.160
T-B-G-A-G-R.

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.080
You know what, acronyms, I can't do it.

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:52.080
T-Baggers.

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:53.080
T-B-A-G-R.

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:54.640
Okay, the Big Anime Game Room.

01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:59.760
So it's that dot o-r-g, so somebody in our chat said, T-Bagger orgy.

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.480
Right, they're really just.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.480
There it is.

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.480
All right, yeah, I got nothing.

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:06.480
I got nothing.

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:07.480
All right, there it is.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.480
T-Bagger orgy, wow.

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:09.480
All right.

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.480
I'm going to remember that one.

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.480
That was pretty good.

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.480
All right, that could.

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:13.480
There you go.

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:14.480
That's what it became there.

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.480
Oh, wait.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480
All right.

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.200
We got some rapid fire news to get to.

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:21.280
Your emails, the Frugal Question of the Week, all coming up here.

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.720
So let's get into some news.

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:23.720
Some quick news.

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:24.800
All right.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.400
So PlayStation Now.

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:32.400
We kind of talked a little bit about it when we were talking about EA saying PlayStation

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.880
Now is now in beta, open public beta, I guess.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.920
And they've got a bunch of different plans available, I guess.

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:46.360
And one of those, they're talking about something in the works is actually a subscription plan

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:52.560
that would maybe be all-inclusive, although to be honest, based on how expensive things

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:55.960
are now, I would be curious to see how much that would actually cost.

01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:00.200
Because right now, what they have it set up, and it doesn't really make any sense to me,

01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.680
they've got four different options.

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:06.960
You can either rent a title for four hours, seven days, 30 days, or 90 days.

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:12.960
So for example, Darksiders, three dollars for four hours, six dollars for a week, eight

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.960
dollars for 30 days, or 15 dollars for 90 days, which that's almost the price of the

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:19.960
game itself.

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:27.000
In fact, there's even some games, I want to say, that were like $49.99 for like 90 days.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.200
It's like, shit, just buy it either digitally or buy it used or something.

01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:35.920
I mean, at that point, what's the point in renting it for that much time when you can

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:40.160
just buy it for cheaper?

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:46.360
They're saying the pricing structure right now, of course, has been a major contention

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:52.680
for a lot of people, and there will be reduced pricing on some four-hour rentals.

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:56.480
Ooh, thank you, that's so generous.

01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:00.720
Also they're saying that they recommend that you have a five megabit connection in order

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.400
to be able to utilize the service.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:11.120
And yeah, it's going to be coming to, right now, I think it's open to PlayStation 4 owners

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:16.160
in the US and Canada, but later on it'll be available for a PlayStation 3 Vita and

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:21.560
certain models of Sony TVs.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.440
I gotta be honest, for this thing to be utilized a little bit more, it's going to have to be

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:31.000
a hell of a lot cheaper than it is right now, because that's just ridiculous.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.680
Three dollars for four hours, fuck that, just go buy the game or go rent it somewhere else.

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:41.040
Bobby in chat loves to be Devil's Advocate, so here he goes, Devil's Advocate, yes, but

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:45.600
can I buy Darksiders for fifteen dollars and play it on my PlayStation 4?

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:51.840
True, you can't do that, but is really that kind of, you know, a premium price worth it

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.840
for playing an old game like that?

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:58.040
I would argue no, I mean it's just, if you wouldn't pay that much to bring it out of

01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:02.400
a red box, then why, I mean the streaming thing works well, great.

01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:07.480
I'll play your Devil's Advocacy right there, brand new Darksiders collection that's going

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:13.240
to be coming out, I want to say is, I think $29.99, and that should be coming out in a

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:19.040
couple weeks, on PlayStation 3, it's got the first two games and all the DLC.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:20.760
But not the PlayStation 4.

01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.400
Who gives a fuck?

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:26.040
You're not buying the PlayStation 4 to play the original Darksiders game.

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:28.240
If you want to play PS3 games, buy a PS3, I get it.

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:36.280
I think it would have been nice, like say, for example, I owned Darksiders on PlayStation

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:40.960
3, because I bought it digitally or something like that, see I was dumb enough to do that.

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:43.520
I should be able to play that streaming for free.

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:48.720
I actually deeply agree with that, because it gives digital enhanced value, because you

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:54.280
lose the equity of owning the physical copy of the game, that you could go to GameStop

01:52:54.280 --> 01:53:00.120
and give your, you know, fingerprint and urine sample in order to turn the game in for money.

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:01.120
Yeah.

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:05.320
So, you know, you lose that ability when you buy something digitally, but that would be

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.640
a perk, like, oh, buy this game digitally, and you get your cross-buy of being able to

01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:13.240
have it on the PS3, the PS4, and the PS Vita, and you know, all this stuff through the magic

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.240
of PlayStation Now.

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:15.240
Woo!

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:16.240
You know.

01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:20.000
It just, for me, it sounds like right now PlayStation Now is not going to be a service

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.120
I'm going to utilize at all.

01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.960
And that's sad, because it sounded like it had potential, but.

01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:27.760
Well, let's wait.

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:31.680
I'm not ready to throw it all away yet, because it will be very interesting to see what happens

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:36.480
when they add the PS1 and PS2, because it will have additional features, like the trophies

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:40.800
at least, that weren't in the original, and it will be, I kind of hope that if they do

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:43.920
the subscription service, they're doing it for the PS1 and PS2 games, that's why we haven't

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:44.920
seen it yet.

01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:48.520
And I hope that when they add trophies, Nintendo will go, hey, we can add trophies to our game,

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.160
or whatever their accomplishments to you, whatever they're going to call their bullshit.

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:53.160
Yeah.

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:54.160
Coins.

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.160
Stickers, yeah, coins, why not?

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.160
Why not?

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.160
Or power-ups.

01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:58.160
Power-ups, yeah.

01:53:58.160 --> 01:53:59.160
Alright.

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.160
What else, Loki?

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:04.600
Also, it's back.

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:10.240
Flappy Bird is back, because, you know, you probably haven't been able to play any sort

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:14.080
of Flappy Bird games for the last few months, you know, it's not like there's zillions of

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:23.560
clones out there, but yes, the official Flappy Bird is back on the Amazon Fire platform exclusively

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:27.120
right now with Flappy Bird's Family.

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:32.400
And Flappy Bird's Family, it's got some new multiplayer options.

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:39.480
Right now, I think it's locked into, it's now on the Amazon App Store for Android, it's

01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:46.640
not on iTunes or Google Play, and apparently, I think they have a version out for the Fire

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:53.360
TV, I'm not sure about the Fire Phone, but I just don't give a shit.

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:55.760
I seriously don't give a shit about this game.

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:56.760
Who cares?

01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:57.920
Oh, it's back.

01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:58.920
Guess what?

01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:02.400
Sorry that you're not gonna be able to play, you know, the Flappy Bird's Family right now

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:06.840
because it's exclusive on Amazon, but guess what, there's gonna be a zillion Flappy Bird's

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:07.840
Family clones.

01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:08.840
You know who cares?

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:09.840
You know who cares?

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.840
Kim Kardashian cares, because some bird's about to steal her tiara.

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:19.520
Wait, isn't there like a Flappy Bird arcade game in Roseville Golf Land, a redemption

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.520
game?

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:21.520
Is there?

01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:22.520
Oh, why wouldn't that surprise me at all?

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:27.840
I know they do Doodle Jump as one, and they do, I was just at Dave & Buster's yesterday,

01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:29.640
so I saw a lot of this crazy redemption shit.

01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:30.640
Fruit Ninja.

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:31.640
Fruit Ninja's one.

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:34.920
Infinity Blade is like a game, I don't think it gives tickets though.

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.320
I still like Feeding Frenzy, maybe that's just because I actually win tickets when I

01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.320
play Feeding Frenzy.

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:40.320
Anybody?

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:42.840
It's alright, anyway.

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:50.080
And then, last but not least, they're gonna have Paper Mario in Smash Bros.

01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:52.520
It will be a stage.

01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:56.480
Diego perked up for a minute, what?

01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.480
I had heard this.

01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:00.720
Yeah, sadly it's gonna be a stage, because that would have been too cool, and they can't

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:01.720
do that.

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.880
They had me go in there, I was like, Paper Mario's a playable character, it was just

01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:07.880
revealed.

01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:11.160
My favorite stage will always be the Picto chat stage, and I kind of hope they bring

01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:14.720
that back in one way or another.

01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:17.840
That was pretty creative, everything's being drawn around you, and you can be inside the

01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:18.840
whale.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.560
But it wasn't accurate because balls never showed up in the stage, and that's what people

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:24.920
drew on Picto chat was balls.

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:25.920
They should have...

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:28.720
Of course they drew a lot of stuff when they pushed at him, I remember when that first

01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:29.720
started up, I was like, oh it's so bad.

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:33.400
They should have a Mii Plaza stage, or like a Wii Sports stage.

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:36.920
Or a Swap Notes stage that just shuts down part way through.

01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:38.320
How about that.

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.320
Joke, anyway.

01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.160
In the meantime, you're fighting on cats.

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.160
Missing a Go stage?

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.160
A what?

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:44.160
He said missing those.

01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:47.000
Everything's just glitching, and you got like nine of them.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.480
A Pac-Man glitch stage?

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:49.480
Oh my goodness.

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:50.480
There you go.

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:51.480
Why not?

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.480
Pac-Man's in the game now.

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:53.480
We just need to have a game called Kill Screen.

01:56:53.480 --> 01:57:01.000
I don't think it made your show roll, but there's also Galaga assists now in the game,

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
so...

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000
That's kind of cool.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Yeah.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000
I hope it plays the little song.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.760
Alright, some more news.

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:14.520
Hey, remember Awada missed E3 because he had had some medical issues, and had some, I think

01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:17.560
he had surgery for a bile duct growth was what was going on.

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:22.240
Well, the good news is Nintendo did put out a little update through a spokesperson, Yoshihiro

01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.480
Minagawa, who said that Awada is recovering steadily.

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:29.200
There's no interference with his business as president.

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.960
So just a little update, he's doing fine.

01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:38.600
Also an update on the Wii U front, Hyrule Warriors, another game that people are looking

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:44.280
forward to this fall, not just, you know, the Smash Brothers or Captain Toad, but there's

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:46.280
Hyrule Warriors as well.

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:51.400
And Hyrule Warriors sadly will not have an online co-op mode, because, you know, it's

01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:57.960
Nintendo and it's online, but there will be local co-op, because again, it's gonna get

01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:58.960
loco!

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:05.400
You're gonna drink some far loco and play Hyrule Warriors.

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:10.720
Has this happened at one of your cons?

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.360
The Hyrule Warriors tournament, sponsored by 4 Loco.

01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:16.980
Wow, there you go, is that still around?

01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:17.980
They had to change it.

01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:19.600
I think they had to take the caffeine out of it.

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.120
Right, because it was killing people.

01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:23.120
Yeah, that's usually bad PR.

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:25.120
That's not a reason.

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:27.760
They found out what the cans latched to their hands.

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:30.960
I think we found the cause of death.

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:36.520
So anyway, there will be local co-op, and there you go, but they will say there will

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:39.220
be some other type of online play.

01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:44.000
The reason why this is relevant, Dynasty Warriors always had online play, and yet this is coming

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.200
from the same people, yet, you know, just throwing it out there.

01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:51.440
Hey, let's talk about Justice Beaver.

01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:56.960
Hey, that is the name of the game, Justice Beaver.

01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:58.960
Order in the court!

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:05.280
Gee, that's totally not a spoof on Justin Bieber.

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:10.720
I hope Oranja Boom comes out and punches him in the face.

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:12.880
That would be pretty awesome.

01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:20.320
Anyway, Justice Beaver is a platformer game that's going to be coming out for the Wii

01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:21.960
U and the Super Nintendo.

01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:25.400
Yes, the Super Nintendo.

01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:28.520
People want to make shit for old consoles, so why not?

01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:31.640
UnderVision is the company putting this out.

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:36.480
The Super Nintendo will be the flagship platform, and they're trying to get a Super Nintendo

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:39.800
virtual console release on the Wii U eShop.

01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:42.480
That would be kind of awesome, actually, if they could actually get a virtual console

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:45.280
release on the eShop, even though it's not really a classic game.

01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:48.480
That game would be banned in Canada, I guess.

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:50.760
Justice Beaver, would the Canadians not take lightly to that?

01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:51.760
I don't know.

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:53.560
They'd probably all laugh their ass off.

01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.600
Probably, and then apologize for it.

01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:00.840
And then the sequel, Justice Beaver Rush.

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:05.360
Hopefully that's the end of the game, is that Rush just, you know, kills them all.

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:07.680
Anyway, alright.

02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:08.680
There it is.

02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:09.680
That's what I've got.

02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:10.680
Dark Sakura.

02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:12.320
Oh, yeah.

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:16.640
Well, how about LittleBigPlanet 3?

02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:19.080
Pre-orders are ready to go.

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.080
As soon as...

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:23.320
You could probably pre-order LittleBigPlanet 4 if you want.

02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:25.540
GameStop's like, sure, I'll take your five bucks.

02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:27.620
Do you want to put that on your new GameStop card?

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:31.740
That's how they sell the card.

02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:33.500
You want to guarantee that you get that DLC?

02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:38.580
Well, it looks like that if you do the order, you get a Sackboy plushie.

02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:43.340
If you order one at Target, his comes with a Target hat.

02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:47.700
And then the thing that interests me, a Dragon Age Inquisition costume pack, because that's

02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:48.700
all I care about.

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:51.320
No, there's also other costume packs.

02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:53.540
There's the Mythical Creatures one.

02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:55.700
There's Hidden Animals.

02:00:55.700 --> 02:01:00.260
There is the PlayStation's favorite costume pack that includes Journey, Jak and Daxter,

02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:04.820
Sly Cooper, Loco Roco, Ratchet and Clank, and Tearaway.

02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:07.580
Many of which have already been out there already.

02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:10.620
So since Dark Sakura brought up a LittleBigPlanet plushie...

02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:11.620
November 18th, by the way.

02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.620
Thank you.

02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:16.580
Since Dark Sakura brought up the LittleBigPlanet Sackboy plushie, can I borrow your outfit

02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:17.580
and go to FurCon?

02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:23.060
If you want, it's really hot.

02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:28.700
And Dusty, there could be an infestation of Black Woodas in there and I don't even

02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.700
know.

02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:30.700
I'll fur-freeze it.

02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:34.460
Alright, I'll beat it out in the backyard with a bat.

02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:37.860
We don't want you to know about you beating it in the backyard, Rob.

02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:42.740
I knew, like, the minute the words were coming out of my mouth, I was like, stop talking!

02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:43.740
But I can't.

02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:44.740
Because you know where...

02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:48.620
Yes, if you really want to borrow that Dusty costume for, you know...

02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:50.820
We'll get you some fumigation stuff, Rob.

02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:51.820
I really...

02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:56.020
I should take it to Dragon Con, but how am I going to get that on the plane?

02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:57.020
Strap it to the top.

02:01:57.020 --> 02:01:59.060
It is really large.

02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.060
It is really large.

02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:01.060
It is really large.

02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:04.260
I'd have to take a whole other thing.

02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:05.260
Can I continue?

02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:06.260
Yes, yes.

02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:07.260
Okay.

02:02:07.260 --> 02:02:08.260
Alright, Your Highness.

02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:13.740
So Kmart has listed a game called Captain Toad Treasure Tracker for $39.99.

02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:16.300
Apparently, it was a mini-game.

02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:18.500
I actually did not play this game.

02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:26.020
Oh yeah, it was a mini-game in Super Mario 3D World, but now it's going to be its own

02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:28.900
game, according to Kmart listings.

02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.420
So who knows if this is real, because it's Kmart.

02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:32.420
The game is real.

02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:33.420
They talked about it at E3.

02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:34.420
It's the price.

02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:38.660
The price we didn't know, because that's lower than most games.

02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:39.660
It is...

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:43.060
Yeah, I mean, it's lower.

02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:46.140
I could see them doing that, because I don't think it's going to be that popular.

02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:50.700
It is a legit listing, because I can see right now the model number is a legit Nintendo

02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:52.860
model number.

02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:54.420
So yeah.

02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:55.420
So there's that.

02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:58.260
But I would assume the price is correct.

02:02:58.260 --> 02:03:00.780
If they've got the model number, they probably have the price.

02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:04.020
Yeah, it's actually correct, because I was at E3 when I was playing it, and they were

02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:06.020
saying it was $39.99.

02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:07.020
Oh, they did.

02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:09.700
I didn't know they gave the retail price at E3.

02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:14.420
I think I remembered seeing something about it, and then...

02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:16.980
I guess the news here is that Kmart is selling something.

02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:19.980
I think I saw it and didn't pay attention to it, so that's why.

02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:20.980
Because...

02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:21.980
Alright, well there you go.

02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:22.980
Oh, there's more news.

02:03:22.980 --> 02:03:23.980
There's more news.

02:03:23.980 --> 02:03:24.980
Yeah, why...

02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:28.300
Okay, so all the chatters that are like, the game was announced at E3, yeah, but sorry

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:31.860
if we were paying attention to Splatoon or the cool stuff.

02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:36.620
Or sorry if some of us had Job and real life stuff to worry about.

02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:39.300
I saw the stuff on Kirby Treasure Tracker.

02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:42.660
I just thought it looked so boring that I just didn't give a shit.

02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:44.860
No, I didn't realize the price had already been out there.

02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:45.860
I thought that was the new thing.

02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:46.860
Alright, whatever.

02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:47.860
DarkSira.

02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:48.860
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:51.860
I was busy worrying about real life for a moment.

02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:52.860
Sorry.

02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:56.460
Another thing too, if you are a fan of Zen Pinball 2, then there is a Guardians of the

02:03:56.460 --> 02:04:01.220
Galaxy table to be out on Jul- actually, it's already out.

02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:07.660
It came out on July 29th for $2.99, and it's both heroes and villains from the universe,

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:12.340
and should be awesome, as long as it has lots and lots of Rocket Raccoon.

02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:18.940
The movie, by the way, killed the box office, like 90 plus million, and they were only expecting

02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:19.940
it to make 70.

02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:20.940
Fuck you, Titanic.

02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:25.900
So, well, I don't think it's going to go that huge, but it's doing very well for itself.

02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:27.940
No, Dan went and saw it without me.

02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:29.380
What a jerk.

02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:30.380
I know, right?

02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:32.820
Well, he better go see it again.

02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:34.180
I'm going to go without him.

02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:35.180
You should.

02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:36.180
We'll go.

02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:37.180
We can go on a date.

02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:38.180
We're going on a date.

02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:39.180
Let's go on a plater date.

02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:40.180
Alright, it'll be fun.

02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:41.180
Okay.

02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:42.180
Because I haven't seen it yet.

02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:44.020
I haven't seen him, so.

02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:45.740
Then Dan can take Alan to see it.

02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:46.740
You know what, though?

02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:51.060
Alan and Shane went out last night to go have Mongolian, so, you know what?

02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:52.060
Oh, really?

02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:53.060
Yeah, there you go.

02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:54.060
So, alright.

02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:55.060
Moving on.

02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:57.060
Oh, it's the FUGL Question of the Week time.

02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:58.060
Maybe.

02:04:58.060 --> 02:05:00.220
Here I was talking about Guardians of the Galaxy.

02:05:00.220 --> 02:05:03.460
I almost forgot to get to Facebook and Google Plus.

02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:06.180
You slam those words together, you get FUGL.

02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:07.580
It's the FUGL Question of the Week.

02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:11.100
Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and we read some

02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:12.700
of our favorite answers here on Air.

02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:14.820
If I'm feeling quite generous, I'll read all of them.

02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:18.100
Well, tonight, I had to ask something about that GameStop credit card.

02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:22.740
So, the question we asked, did you hear about the controversial new credit card at the Evil

02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:23.740
G?

02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:28.060
This makes us think about crazy lengths you might have gone to in the past to play the

02:05:28.060 --> 02:05:29.660
game you want.

02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:35.180
What's the craziest thing you've ever done to either A, get a great deal on a game, or

02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:38.260
B, get your hands on the game at all?

02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:41.820
Now, the weird thing about this FUGL Question of the Week is we had a lot of people that

02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:47.740
just kind of responded to the story, and not really the question, but, okay, it's the show

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:50.940
where every gamer has a voice, and there are some really interesting opinions on it, so

02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:51.940
I'll read all the answers anyway.

02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:53.580
This is the show where nobody reads.

02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:54.580
You have to clearly...

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:55.580
This is...

02:05:55.580 --> 02:05:58.540
Did you not read the sign on the door before you came in?

02:05:58.540 --> 02:05:59.700
This is the 2000s.

02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:00.700
No one reads.

02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:01.700
They assume.

02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:02.700
All right.

02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:03.700
No, it's fine.

02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:04.700
I'm just giving you guys some crap.

02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:07.420
Well, clearly, people wanted to comment on the credit card, and that's fine.

02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:11.540
So let's start with our buddy Renee from Killer Queens from Outer Space, who did answer the

02:06:11.540 --> 02:06:16.940
question at hand, who said, being a part-time street corner pharmaceutical representative

02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:22.620
in order to save up enough moneys to purchase the Sega CD system and a couple of titles.

02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:27.300
Girl, you sold weed so you could play Night Trap?

02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:29.420
Is that what you're saying?

02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:32.180
Is that what I'm hearing?

02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:35.220
What is a part-time street corner pharmaceutical representative?

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:36.220
That is...

02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:37.220
Is that a weed salesman?

02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:44.140
Anyhow, AZHP says, this sounds like it's meant for the irresponsible college student who

02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:48.780
gets their first credit card at the same time they move out but have no job, buy a whole

02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:52.360
bunch of things on credit saying, I can make the minimum and pay it off when I get a job

02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:53.360
at a college.

02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:56.740
Then five years later, they realize they've got thousands of dollars in debt in addition

02:06:56.740 --> 02:06:59.500
to their student loans and have to go bankrupt to 23 years old.

02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:02.700
I guess if GameStop wants a piece of that pie, go for it.

02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:06.420
It's no stinkier than any other retail-based credit card offer for Macy's, even if the

02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:08.020
APR is higher.

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:13.220
Degenerate Johnny says, back to the crazy thing you did for a game, I convinced my family

02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:15.660
to do a yearly present trade-off.

02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.920
No presents for me for an entire year.

02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:20.060
No birthday presents, no Christmas presents, et cetera.

02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:23.900
In exchange, they would purchase an Atari Jaguar for me when it came out.

02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:26.940
I was a big Aliens vs. Predator fan back then.

02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:31.540
Well, and Tempest 2000 was definitely worth getting a Jaguar for as well.

02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:35.180
All right, let's see.

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:39.780
Elliot B. responded, saying, I spent the majority of a family holiday in New York traipsing

02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:41.620
around shops for a DS.

02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:46.060
It wasn't available in the UK at that point, and even in New York, it was sold out everywhere.

02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:49.620
Eventually I managed to find one in Times Square, and I was the coolest kid in school

02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:52.500
until it came out in the UK three months later.

02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:57.900
Jonathan L. said, during the PlayStation Network's sales a few months ago, I bought three months

02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:03.740
of PlayStation Plus to get some PS3 games cheap, but I don't actually have a PS3.

02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:08.700
I'll get one eventually, and when I do, I have some HD remakes waiting to download.

02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:11.540
So he bought games for a system he doesn't even own.

02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:13.020
That is going to pretty great lengths.

02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:18.260
SG100Matt says, when the DS Lite came out, I went to several Circuit City stores, bought

02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:23.020
a few $6 PlayStation 2 games, and returned them to Walmart for $35 each.

02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:28.300
I ended up with about $130 in store credit after only spending 36 collectively at various

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:29.900
Circuit City stores.

02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:31.980
With that store credit, I bought a DS Lite.

02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:36.580
I understand this is a highly unethical tactic and probably illegal, but I was a young, crafty

02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:39.460
college student and a big cheapskate.

02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:44.020
A few more answers on the credit card front, Chigurh says, I am swamped with credit card

02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:47.460
debt, and if I ever get out of it, I will never let it happen again.

02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:49.740
These things are evil.

02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:51.900
And lastly, Alan Alchemy, that's right.

02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:55.820
My partner couldn't read the question and answered.

02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:56.820
Way to go, Alan.

02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:57.820
No, but you know what?

02:08:57.820 --> 02:08:58.820
Heart, heart.

02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:01.460
This is a good piece of feedback on the credit card issues.

02:09:01.460 --> 02:09:05.860
Alan Alchemy says, I don't mind it because they can't pitch it to anyone who looks under

02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:10.420
18, but this is no different from when we're harassed at Target for their card.

02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:14.260
They're just joining the big kids table, which makes sense since video games is a multi-billion

02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:15.460
dollar industry.

02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:20.160
The main issue is that 18th birthday, no credit, horrible interest rate, foreshadowing of fucking

02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:24.180
up their credit rating forever, risk angle, but that's not GameStop's problem and will

02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:26.320
just happen on some other store's card.

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:29.700
The interest rate is gross, but similar to what Providian and Capital One provides for

02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:30.980
the same demographic.

02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:36.220
$20 up front is a pretty lame perk too, but oh well.

02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:42.100
Well let's check out over on Google Plus and see if people actually was answering the question

02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:44.060
or was answering the credit card feature.

02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:45.340
Again, I'm just giving you guys crap.

02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:48.060
I actually think the answers on the credit card front are great.

02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:50.020
It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:53.780
Let's see, we have a couple answers and they are both about the crazy questions.

02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:57.660
So Act Def says, I think the most crazy thing I've done to get my hands on a video game

02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:59.380
is probably overpay for one.

02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:03.060
I wanted a copy of Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney when it first came out, but it was super rare

02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:10.180
to get, so I paid $50 USD for a used when it actually cost $30 USD new, but it was kind

02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:13.940
of hard to actually find a new copy at that price, so at the time I didn't mind.

02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:18.220
Sadly, a few months later, Capcom decided to print more copies of the game, oh well.

02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:23.500
And lastly, Retertainment says, when I was a kid, I mowed lawns to buy a Game Boy.

02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:27.700
Due to me being a ginger, this resulted in me bursting into flames on a regular basis

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:29.860
due to walking outside.

02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:31.780
Flame on!

02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:34.100
There it is, the answers to the FUGO question of the week.

02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:36.700
I'll pose the question in the room, does anybody want to answer?

02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:40.220
We already talked about the credit card thing, but what was the craziest thing you ever did

02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:42.420
to get your hands on a game?

02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:48.140
I paid $210 USD to get the Sailor Moon S fighting game, and I ordered it COD in Alabama, which

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:50.140
was the only way I could get it.

02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:53.300
I saved up for like six months.

02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:56.420
And then my grandma drove me around to five different stores until we went to Montgomery

02:10:56.420 --> 02:10:59.180
Wards so I could buy Killer Instinct.

02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:00.180
Awesome.

02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:01.180
In Alabama.

02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.180
That's awesome.

02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:06.660
I bought press kits to play games early.

02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:07.900
Wow!

02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:09.860
Several times.

02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:15.380
I paid, I think $120 USD for the Motorstorm Apocalypse press kit, but I got to play the

02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:19.540
game over a month before it came out.

02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:25.500
I did that for DJ Hero 2, or you know, DJ Hero, the original one.

02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:29.620
I remember I got the, I don't remember if it was the first or second one, but I got

02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:33.620
the DJ Hero turntable, like a beta one that was wired.

02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:34.820
I remember that.

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.420
And then I got the demo disc with that.

02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:37.420
You used to buy that?

02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:38.420
Worth it.

02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:39.420
It was awesome.

02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:41.500
You used to buy that crazy shit all the time, and I was like, how much did you spend on

02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:43.060
that, Logie?

02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:48.040
Anyway, I would say honestly the craziest thing I did was I imported a Japanese PlayStation

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:50.300
2 to play Beatmania 2DX.

02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:51.300
That was pretty crazy.

02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:53.940
That was a lot of money to be able to do that.

02:11:53.940 --> 02:11:58.740
We bought the one that Game Master had, their last, which was the first model, the Japanese

02:11:58.740 --> 02:11:59.740
PlayStation 2.

02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:00.740
Nice.

02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:01.740
By the way, still works.

02:12:01.740 --> 02:12:02.740
I know, yeah.

02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:03.740
Mine probably still works too.

02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:07.420
I don't know if you can, it stopped working with my TV at some point.

02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:09.460
Like some of the older games didn't work.

02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:12.660
Jonas, Diego, anything crazy you guys did?

02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:13.660
Might be gamer related.

02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:18.660
When I actually purchased Iguana Girls, a Japanese PlayStation 2, because she wasn't

02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:23.220
using, I think she wanted to sell it like with Beatmania and stuff.

02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:28.660
In the top of buying the DDR pass for cheap, I decided to compulsively buy a lot of the

02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:34.620
Bemani and DDR games just to keep up with the gamers at the time.

02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:36.500
Yeah, as most music game nerds would do.

02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:37.500
They have to have them all.

02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:43.620
I've got to get 7th style, 8th style, 9th style, 10th style, and they have them all.

02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:48.500
And we provided a lot of the stuff for the community, for the cons.

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:53.540
In addition to that, with the buying the games, we compulsively bought repair kits

02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:58.100
for the pads too, because as much as people start stomping with heels, we have to repair

02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:00.420
the hell out of those.

02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:03.660
It gets pricey, but we did it for all the fans.

02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:05.580
Alright, I did it for the fans.

02:13:05.580 --> 02:13:08.740
Alright, Diego, any crazy purchases you made?

02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:12.820
Yeah, also hanging out with Jonas and all, some of his friends got me into music games

02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:19.940
and such, but when I was getting into imports, I went online and bought a Japanese Wii and

02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:23.380
got Brawl when it was released in Japan before it came out in America.

02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:24.380
Oh, dang.

02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:25.380
Okay.

02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:27.060
So we had it over here quite early and people were on that.

02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:30.140
And the amazing thing about that is that the names are different.

02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:31.740
Two of the names are different in Japanese.

02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:35.860
They call Bowser Koopa, King Koopa, or just Koopa, which is amazing.

02:13:35.860 --> 02:13:39.300
And they call Jigglypuff Purrin.

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:44.620
And Pokemon Trainer was, I don't know, they said it in a different tone, and Rob was called

02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:45.620
Robot.

02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:46.620
Okay.

02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:47.620
Yeah.

02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:48.620
Wow.

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:52.300
So we had that for about a good three to four months before it was released in America.

02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:53.300
Huh.

02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.300
Yeah.

02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:55.300
So we're showcasing it over here.

02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.060
I did that too and I wasn't even a big fan of Smash Brothers.

02:13:57.060 --> 02:13:58.300
I just wanted to play it early.

02:13:58.300 --> 02:13:59.740
Yeah, you just had to have it early.

02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:00.740
That's it.

02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:02.780
But see, I didn't buy an import system.

02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:08.620
I put a mod chip in mine instead, which, that was scary because at the time I wasn't very

02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:09.620
good at soldering.

02:14:09.620 --> 02:14:11.260
I was like, I'm going to fuck this up.

02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:12.260
I'm going to fuck this up.

02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:13.260
I'm going to fuck this up.

02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:14.260
And it worked!

02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:15.260
Yay!

02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:18.140
I've heard people who were just flimsy on that and they just screwed up their entire

02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:19.140
Wii system.

02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:20.500
I'm like, well, there goes the warranty.

02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:21.500
You just screwed with it.

02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:22.500
So.

02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:23.500
Yeah.

02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:25.660
By the way, you know, we have a switch on the back of our GameCube.

02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:26.660
It's not hooked to anything.

02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:28.260
We just have a switch on the back of our GameCube.

02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:29.260
It's just there.

02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:32.300
We put it there, starting to mod it, and we didn't think we'd do anything with it.

02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:34.300
So now we just have a switch.

02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:38.580
I miss the days of the PlayStation 1 where you just plug that little guy in the back

02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:39.580
and bang, it's done.

02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:40.580
I remember that.

02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:41.580
Oh, that's fantastic.

02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:42.580
I remember that.

02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:46.580
And don't forget about, though, trying to sit and go through all of the hoops that you

02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:50.260
had to jump through to get PSO to work with the Ethernet adapter.

02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:51.260
Yes.

02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:52.260
On the DreamCube.

02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:53.260
And I got it.

02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:54.260
The DreamCube?

02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:55.260
No, the DreamCube.

02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:56.260
The Dreamcast.

02:14:56.260 --> 02:14:57.260
Rob.

02:14:57.260 --> 02:14:58.260
She's the dream team.

02:14:58.260 --> 02:14:59.260
Yeah.

02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:00.260
Fart, Rob.

02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:01.260
Fart.

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:02.260
I will.

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:03.260
I will.

02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:04.260
Anyway, moving on.

02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:07.860
Let's get back into some other news for the week.

02:15:08.140 --> 02:15:15.020
So, Crytek hasn't been doing that great, and because of that, they actually ended up selling

02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:19.940
off some of their titles and assets to different companies.

02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:24.860
For example, Homefront The Revolution was actually sold to Deep Silver, the company

02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:30.340
that was going to be publishing it, because I guess they just didn't have the money or

02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:31.340
something.

02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:32.340
Whatever.

02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:35.940
But basically, they said, hey, we strongly believed in the potential of Homefront The

02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:40.660
Revolution and trust the new team to continue the path that they have been walking for the

02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:44.340
last few years.

02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:52.700
And also to go along with that, Crytek also has this game called Hunt, which is a co-op

02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:55.020
monster hunting game.

02:15:55.020 --> 02:16:01.260
Kind of think of, I don't know, Constantine or something like that.

02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:07.380
But this has actually moved from the original studio to now Crytek Austin.

02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:14.940
Oh, I'm sorry, from Crytek Austin to the Frankfurt location, so shifting stuff around.

02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:20.660
But I guess they did make a comment, though, I want to say, saying that, no, no, no, our

02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:24.740
financial stuff's okay, but you've got to wonder if they're starting to sell assets

02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:30.740
like that and move stuff around that maybe they're thinking of downsizing a little bit.

02:16:31.220 --> 02:16:36.220
GameGuru in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com is asking, did someone buy TimeSplitters?

02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:37.220
No.

02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:42.180
No, sadly, I would have been excited about that.

02:16:42.180 --> 02:16:45.820
I want to buy TimeSplitters, I just don't have any money.

02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:48.820
We'd take a dollar.

02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:51.700
That's my final offer.

02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:56.220
Moving on to some other news, this is about Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.

02:16:56.220 --> 02:16:59.580
For those of you that have picked this up for the 3DS, this is kind of neat.

02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:04.020
A lot of stuff on 3DS, as you know, is region-locked, and that doesn't make the system popular with

02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:07.860
some people, because they've got to buy the import systems, but the cool thing about Monster

02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:14.220
Hunter 4 Ultimate is that the multiplayer mode is not going to be region-locked online

02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:20.060
with North America and Europe, but the weird thing is, not Japanese.

02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:22.860
So it's still region-locked for Japanese, but North America and Europe will be able

02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:23.860
to play together.

02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:27.940
I don't know if that's a language difference, although there's other parts of Europe where

02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:29.260
they speak other languages than English.

02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:30.260
I don't know.

02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:31.260
That's kind of funny.

02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:35.220
Yeah, I'm not sure what went into that decision, but those walls coming down with region-locking

02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:36.220
is a good thing.

02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:39.740
I mean, I know I have friends overseas that I would love to play World of Warcraft with

02:17:39.740 --> 02:17:40.740
or whatever.

02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:43.780
I mean, not that I'm really playing WoW anymore, but when I was, I would really love to play

02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:47.100
with them, but I can't, because they can't roll characters on these servers with the

02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:48.100
Europe game.

02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:49.100
It's stupid.

02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:50.260
It's so stupid.

02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:51.940
But in Final Fantasy XIV, you can, which is great.

02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:53.700
I can play on a Japanese server if I want.

02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:56.020
I'll have lag, but I can do it.

02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:58.420
I really didn't notice much lag playing on the Japanese server, by the way.

02:17:58.420 --> 02:17:59.420
It's not that bad at all.

02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:00.420
No.

02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:03.620
I used to love playing with the Japanese players in Final Fantasy XIV.

02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:05.460
Because they freaking know how to play.

02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:07.660
Well, they used to respect the bard.

02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:12.780
A bard couldn't get a fucking party because I had a kick-ass bard, too, so.

02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:15.460
Well, what I have to make a quick mention.

02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:19.420
I love playing with Japanese players, be using the little translator thingy, because they

02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:24.100
actually will make sure everyone's ready and move forward at the same time.

02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:28.500
Even if you were a complete stranger, you were still treated with basic respect and

02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:34.700
your skills are incorporated into the group properly and not just the party bitch.

02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:36.700
I'm sorry, healer.

02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:40.020
Some of those are very well organized, especially the Japanese servers.

02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:43.660
But they know you'll be lagging like a motherfucker, especially because that's definitely an American

02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:44.660
right there.

02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:45.660
And they'll wait.

02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:46.660
But that's the thing.

02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:47.660
They'll wait.

02:18:47.660 --> 02:18:48.660
Yeah.

02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:49.660
At least most of the ones I've run into.

02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:55.020
When I played Metal Gear 4 online, as soon as you get on those servers, they kick you

02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:56.020
out immediately.

02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:57.020
They just ban you, kind of.

02:18:57.020 --> 02:18:58.020
Wow.

02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:00.060
Because they can choice ban you as a vote.

02:19:00.060 --> 02:19:04.380
Because seeing them playing that game online, when that game came out, that was probably

02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:05.940
the best Metal Gear Online I played.

02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:09.700
Because in Japan, it's a game and they have the online games separate.

02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:11.980
In America, it's just one game.

02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:14.940
And in going there and seeing them being so organized, I said, okay, I can see why they

02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:17.080
don't want to lose a match on that.

02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:21.720
Because if you're lagging it up, you're holding up the team.

02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:22.720
Yeah.

02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:24.360
All right.

02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:25.360
Let's move on.

02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:28.840
I guess we'll do one more story here, or no, a couple more stories here before the mailbag.

02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:29.840
Dark Sakura.

02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:33.960
Well, there's one about the best game ever.

02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:37.480
Hataful Boyfriend.

02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:43.240
If no one has ever heard of this game, I don't know why, because it's amazing.

02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:48.560
Basically it's a game where you get to, you're the only human left and all of the guys left

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:49.560
are pigeons.

02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:52.520
So you have to date a pigeon.

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:58.400
You're the last human woman in the world and you have to date a pigeon.

02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:00.920
You go to an all pigeon high school except for you.

02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:05.400
Anyway, this game has been out for a little while, since 2011.

02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:11.360
And yeah, this is done by, well, okay.

02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:15.360
It was actually done by a manga artist named Hata Moa.

02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:20.740
And the people who did Amateur Surgeon and Foul Play are going to be putting this out

02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:25.280
through Steam for $9.99 on August 21st.

02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:28.400
And it's awesome.

02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:34.160
Hataful Boyfriend will have, there'll be a collector's edition called Summer of Dove

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:38.160
that has a copy of the game as well as the downloadable version of the soundtrack, the

02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:43.760
digital comic by Moa, wallpapers of one of the game's pigeon heartthrobs, and a digital

02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:45.800
version of the yearbook.

02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:48.640
And so the world was engulfed in pudding.

02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:54.040
So what would be the proper etiquette when you go out on a date with a pigeon, Dark Sakura?

02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:57.720
Does the pigeon pay, or do you pay, or do you go Dutch, or what?

02:20:57.720 --> 02:20:59.760
You regurgitate your food to the babies.

02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:05.360
Oh my gosh, his mother birded it into their mouths.

02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:06.360
That's a fair response.

02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:07.360
That's a fair response.

02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:09.360
Hey, cuckoo motherfucker.

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:10.360
Loki.

02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:16.840
Yeah, it's gonna be hard to follow up, but this is kind of neat, I guess, you know, they've

02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:23.160
been working together for a while now, but Gust, the company that puts out a lot of different

02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:30.960
Japanese games, including the popular Atelier series, mainly on PlayStation 3, will now

02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:39.240
become part of Koei Tecmo, and this is gonna be effective on October 1st.

02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:45.080
And yeah, so I guess we'll see a lot more Atelier games from them, and maybe some more

02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:49.920
of the Arto and Leeko series.

02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:54.960
So these companies are merging and getting bigger and turning into super companies and

02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:55.960
Voltron.

02:21:55.960 --> 02:22:00.320
Well, they're like turning from like small companies to mid-sized small companies.

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:03.880
I guess Atelier wasn't really a huge, huge, huge developer, so.

02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:12.000
Well, Gust, yeah, they weren't that huge, but hey, it's good that they'll be around.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.880
Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.400
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:21.120
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com, and DarkSakura picks some of her favorite emails

02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:25.200
to read right here on the show, although I was gonna say, I don't think there was a big

02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:26.200
selection this week.

02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:30.000
We had a very quiet audience.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:35.120
I guess the show we did last week was just so powerful that everybody was just blown

02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:37.520
away by it and felt no need to email us.

02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:39.080
I gave everybody the plague.

02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:40.080
Alright.

02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:43.720
Again, if you want to email us, participate at orangelaungeradio.com, but in the meantime

02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:45.760
there's at least one email, right DarkSakura?

02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:48.560
What's up, OrangeLounge?

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:52.240
Can someone remind Loki that Skeezy makes music?

02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:56.420
Here, Loki, give my next sample a listen.

02:22:56.420 --> 02:23:01.360
If you have a certain mood or style that you think you can describe, I'm willing to try

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:02.600
anything for you.

02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:03.600
He did send us music.

02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:07.080
See, I knew that would happen when you complain about not having music for your game.

02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:09.600
Somebody out there would be like, I do music.

02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:12.200
Yeah, there's, I don't know.

02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:16.840
There's a beat, I guess, but yeah, I'll take a look.

02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:19.960
I'll forward to the email so you can check out the MP3.

02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:20.960
Is that it?

02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:21.960
Um, no.

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:22.960
Oh.

02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:27.080
Anyways, but I heard Rob say that he's quote too old, end quote, to be going to midnight

02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:32.040
releases, but I'm sure you guys have some good memories of standing in line pre-holiday

02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:33.040
season.

02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:36.880
Could you share some midnight release moments from the past with us?

02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:41.920
There was a time that Kristen and I bribed our way into the middle of the line to get

02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:46.400
wheeze with donuts and coffee.

02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:52.680
You found fans of OLR fans at, which is, which still blows me away that there's people that

02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:56.400
recognizes out there, but you found fans of OLR standing in line at target.

02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:59.760
We asked everyone in line, do you mind if we take this place in line and we will buy

02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:02.320
you donuts and coffee when Krispy Kreme opens?

02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:04.160
And they're like, sure.

02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:05.160
Nice.

02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:10.720
So, and then we stayed up all night writing bad fan fiction together, which was awesome.

02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:16.280
And then there was Waiting for the Dreamcast where, um, my friend and I went over to Barnes

02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:19.480
and Noble and got like really cheap, crappy horror books.

02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:26.160
And we're reading about really bad vampire stuff in line at the mall sitting on the floor.

02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:30.340
My midnight release story was when Extrofer was my roommate at the time and he really

02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:32.760
wanted to play the Wii even more than I did.

02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:36.360
So I said, here's the cash, you go wait in line and get the Wii and I'm going to sleep.

02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:37.360
And I did.

02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:38.360
And he did.

02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:39.960
And everybody was happy.

02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:47.880
Oh, now there was Waiting in Line to see, uh, episode one, which God, what was I thinking?

02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:50.840
Even though it wasn't, you know, it was a movie and not a game release.

02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:51.840
Yeah.

02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:56.480
The coolest thing about the whole event, including the movie, were the people under the trees,

02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:01.880
um, in full costume having a toy lightsaber duels until the cops made them stop.

02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:02.880
Yeah.

02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:06.280
I was at the midnight, uh, re uh, release of episode one as well.

02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:07.280
Yeah.

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:09.840
I've done that for a few movies, but I don't do it for a lot of games.

02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:15.480
The last, honestly, like the last midnight release I really remember going to for a game

02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:16.800
was Final Fantasy 12.

02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:18.400
It was a long time ago.

02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:21.720
Dan did a bunch of them, but he worked at GameStop and GameCrazy.

02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:22.720
Yeah.

02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:25.240
Loki, any crazy midnight releases you did?

02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:28.120
Um, I haven't done too many.

02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:31.920
I mean, I did those for like the Grand Theft Auto games.

02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:37.000
Um, like the only one, the last one I remember actually going to midnight release for was

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:43.760
San Andreas and that it wasn't that interesting to me and it was just kind of, okay, we're

02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:44.760
waiting in line.

02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:45.760
Okay.

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:46.760
They're open.

02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:47.760
Pick up copy.

02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:48.760
Done.

02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:54.720
Um, the Wii stuff was fun, but at the same time I already had mine that prior that week.

02:25:54.720 --> 02:26:00.360
So it wasn't like I was excited to get that day with the whole, I just don't have to do

02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:03.680
it anymore because like I can't stay up late playing the game because I have to work the

02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:08.040
next day and if I buy it on a place like Amazon or whatever, they deliver it and it's

02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:10.560
home when I get home from work and there you go.

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:11.560
Yeah.

02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:12.560
That's pretty much it.

02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:14.000
I mean, that's what I'll do with Destiny probably.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:18.100
I mean, the only time I'd say that the exception for that is like if I'm going to get a game

02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:24.000
system day one and I really, you know, need it that, you know, ASAP, but the problem is

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:31.720
though nowadays, cause I would just order it for my work and just get it delivered prior

02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:32.720
to release.

02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:33.760
I don't know.

02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:38.480
How about our guests, Jonas, Diego, any, um, crazy midnight stories for you guys to play

02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:39.480
a game?

02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:44.360
Um, well, um, I would say also for the Wii when we were, uh, me and my friends were waiting

02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:50.120
for the Wii release, um, via Walmart and, uh, my one friend had, um, suggested that

02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.240
we would bring a, uh, foldable, unfoldable table, sit down with a couple of chairs and

02:26:54.240 --> 02:27:00.320
play magic the gathering as we waited and it worked out so well cause, uh, we were so

02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:04.040
into our game that we forgot that time was passing by and a little bit of coffee that

02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:05.040
helped out.

02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:06.040
It helps out too.

02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:07.040
Yeah.

02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:09.840
But it was unusual cause a lot of people gathered around us and they're like, well, they thought

02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:14.440
we were gambling and I was like, no, no, no, no, these are just these cards.

02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:15.440
And they're like, Oh, okay.

02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:16.440
We did.

02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:20.000
And they were going to go tell like security like, no, wait, this is not going down.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Like kick them out of line.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.680
Like, like you don't see chips here.

02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:23.680
You don't see nothing.

02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:24.680
There's nothing going on.

02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:25.680
There's no money on the tables.

02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:26.680
Let's just calm down.

02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:28.360
You probably weren't even playing for Auntie, were you?

02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:29.360
It's just magic.

02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:30.400
I know.

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:31.400
All right.

02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:32.400
Jonas?

02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:36.400
Um, for, for midnight releases, I really don't do those kind of things.

02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:41.080
But um, the last time I did a midnight release was with my girl, with my fiance now since

02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:42.080
we're never got engaged.

02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:43.080
For what game?

02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:44.800
Um, Pokemon, um, X and Y.

02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:45.800
There you go.

02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:46.800
All right.

02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:47.800
Okay.

02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:48.800
So I didn't invite her for, for first ever midnight release.

02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:49.880
That wasn't that long ago.

02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:51.200
So, so, okay.

02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:54.960
We went to midnight release and because she's like one of the only girls who actually play

02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:59.200
Pokemon X, Y, and that line, she, she just played a lot of people and kicked everyone's

02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:00.200
ass.

02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:01.680
So wait, she was one of the only girls in line.

02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:03.600
I would think there are tons of girls that play Pokemon.

02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:08.360
Oh, well, I was in the Folsom area, but almost everybody was all male.

02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:09.360
Wow.

02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:10.360
All right.

02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:12.960
Well, there are just parts of them that were female.

02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:13.960
I guess.

02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:18.200
Well, well, maybe it's the fact too that the women just, you know, they, they knew better

02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:19.720
to stay home and sleep and rest.

02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:20.720
You know what?

02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:22.880
I think midnight releases are fun sometimes.

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:24.880
It's just, I'm old.

02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:25.880
Yeah, me too.

02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:26.880
And I like to sleep.

02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:27.880
Me too.

02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:28.880
It could be fun.

02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:29.880
I mean, it was just me and my...

02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:30.880
Get off my lawn.

02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:31.880
All right.

02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:32.880
But, but, but, but, but the rest of the email?

02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:33.880
Yes.

02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:34.880
Thanks.

02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:35.880
Much love, ESPZ.

02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:38.320
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:39.320
You're welcome.

02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:41.320
There it is.

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:46.480
Participate at orangelawntrader.com if you would like to take some of Dark Sakura's precious

02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:49.840
time to have an email read here on the program.

02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:52.000
You would take my time and my sanity.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000
All right.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:56.480
Well, I guess it was good that our mailbag segment was a little bit shorter tonight because

02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:01.920
after the mailbag always comes, the FUs of the week.

02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:17.640
I have two.

02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:25.720
The first one goes towards people who take up far, far too much personal space than they

02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:26.720
need to.

02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:27.720
I'm sorry.

02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:32.800
You don't have to sit on a public bench with your legs spread out to where you're the size

02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:36.160
of two people instead of one.

02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:37.160
Keep them together.

02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:38.160
No one wants to see your crotch.

02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:39.160
I don't care who you are.

02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:40.460
I don't care what gender you are.

02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:44.400
I don't care if you are a scrawny little two year old.

02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:51.840
I don't care if you are, I don't know, the biggest Bubba to have ever bubbered.

02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:52.840
Keep it together.

02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:55.040
Dark Sakura just doesn't care in general.

02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:59.560
I think that if a guy is going to sit there with his legs spread out, like, come do me

02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:04.720
now, then I should be able to sit with my legs spread out and take up more space than

02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:05.720
possible.

02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:08.040
But no double standards.

02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:09.840
So men, keep your legs together.

02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:10.840
All right.

02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:11.840
Number two.

02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:12.840
Number two.

02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:13.840
The waiting.

02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:21.240
I want to know now, I want to know, I want the world, I want the world.

02:30:21.240 --> 02:30:22.240
All right.

02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:23.240
Loki, how about Europe?

02:30:23.240 --> 02:30:24.240
Here's the week.

02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:26.920
All right, ladies, let's let's be real here.

02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:27.920
Yeah.

02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:28.920
Crazy sometimes.

02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:35.520
And, and, and, and I know that you don't like it when men call you crazy, but hear me out

02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:36.520
today.

02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:43.520
Let's change the baby as I normally do, because he poops and my wife walks in and she goes,

02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:46.680
you don't say my name enough.

02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:47.680
I'm like, what?

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:52.360
I'm like, you know, when we're having a conversation, you don't say my name.

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:55.320
I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?

02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:57.240
I say your name all the time.

02:30:57.240 --> 02:30:58.240
How do I get your attention?

02:30:58.240 --> 02:30:59.880
Nelly, can you go do this?

02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:00.880
Nelly do this.

02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:01.880
Nelly do this.

02:31:01.880 --> 02:31:03.580
It makes no fucking sense.

02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:09.140
Why would a woman come into the room and like have this thought in their head and complain

02:31:09.140 --> 02:31:10.140
about this?

02:31:10.140 --> 02:31:12.000
It makes no goddamn sense to me.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:17.760
And maybe just because I'm a man, but that's why I call you crazy sometimes because you

02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:19.480
say crazy things.

02:31:19.480 --> 02:31:23.920
Maybe if you didn't say crazy things, I wouldn't call you crazy.

02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:30.240
No one is around you say, baby, I love you, you ain't running games.

02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:35.900
For the record, that is crazy.

02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:40.800
Just saying Dan and I pride ourselves on making up weird nicknames for each other.

02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:46.760
It's not like, you know, I don't refer, like, I don't go, Hey, you, I mean, like, I say,

02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:48.680
I call her by her name.

02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:50.560
Like I call my kids by their names.

02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:54.440
I, when appropriate, I mean, like if I'm talking to you already, I'm not going to just say

02:31:54.440 --> 02:31:55.440
your name all the time.

02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:57.000
You know, like call her weird nicknames.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.040
No, I don't call her weird nicknames.

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:00.760
You call her any fun pet names?

02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:01.760
Nope.

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:04.000
No, maybe you should.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.680
Well, no.

02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:12.560
Make up a fun, crazy nickname and see if she likes that better.

02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:14.200
Like you could call her Nelly Pop.

02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:17.840
No, it's unfortunately, it'll just rub off on her kids.

02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:20.480
Like my, my son already, he doesn't want to go to sleep.

02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:25.000
You know, if his fan blades on the ceiling fan are facing the right direction, this is

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
the kind of crap.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Oh no.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000
So whatever.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.000
I'm done.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.000
All right.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.040
Um, I don't have a whole lot of FUs of the week F F you to the fact that, um, I like

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:37.960
only slept for like five hours last night.

02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:41.400
That would be my FU of the week because sleep is valuable.

02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:47.440
Um, let me, let me, let's hear more about this sleeping for five hours a night.

02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:48.440
You know what?

02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:49.440
Tell me more about it.

02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:52.440
You're the one that had the kid.

02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:53.440
Kids.

02:32:53.440 --> 02:32:57.720
For the record, since there seems to be a mention of this in the chat, Dan just calls

02:32:57.720 --> 02:33:00.400
me girl and I call him boy.

02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:02.760
That's what I call you too, girl.

02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:03.760
Girl don't even.

02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:04.760
All right.

02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:10.520
I didn't know Dan and I really do have weird names for each other.

02:33:10.520 --> 02:33:11.520
I'm not going to get into it.

02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:12.520
What Alan and I do.

02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:15.880
It's not none of your business, any of your businesses.

02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:16.880
All right.

02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:17.880
Anyhow.

02:33:17.880 --> 02:33:18.880
Um, moving on.

02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:21.400
Diego, do you have any FUs?

02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:22.400
See FUs.

02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:26.320
Uh, well one that comes to mind, I just said just one because my one, uh, since like me

02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:29.600
and Jonas do a lot of conventional work and such, and we always influence, especially

02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:35.040
at Fanime, we influence the, the three, uh, the three standard rule law of, uh, taking

02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:40.880
it, taking at least one shower, uh, please using some sort of deodorant and by golly

02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:45.720
drink as much water and food as you can because all these kids running around don't do that.

02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:49.360
And, and, and for the fact of being illiterate and such forth, or screaming at the top of

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:53.240
your lungs when you're doing a tournament and they, they, they, they're staring at you

02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:55.320
and saying, did you call my name yet?

02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:56.320
Yes.

02:33:56.320 --> 02:33:57.760
I, is there a Jason?

02:33:57.760 --> 02:33:58.760
Jason?

02:33:58.920 --> 02:33:59.920
Jason here.

02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:00.920
Jason.

02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:01.920
Just an example.

02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:02.920
Let's just put it out there.

02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:03.920
Just an example.

02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:04.920
Jason.

02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:05.920
Jason.

02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:07.640
And about five, five, 10 minutes later after I disqualified this kid, he comes up, Hey,

02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:11.800
and I, I literally know where this kid was staying the whole time and he comes like, had

02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:12.800
I been called yet?

02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:15.240
I said, are you fucking serious?

02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:18.920
All Diego, all Jason wants is for you to say his name.

02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:20.920
No one is around you.

02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:22.920
Say baby, I love you.

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:24.920
If you ain't running game.

02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:25.920
Say my name.

02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:26.920
Say my name.

02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:32.640
Jason's standing in front of me lately.

02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:33.640
You're hired.

02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:35.640
You're on the megaphone.

02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:40.800
I still can't, I still can't hear you lately, Mr. Jason's disqualified when I didn't hear

02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:41.800
my name then.

02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:43.440
No, you're still disqualified.

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:45.120
It's not going on the wish list.

02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:47.120
You got to get the fuck out of here.

02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:49.120
I don't know.

02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:50.120
I try to improv there.

02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:51.120
I guess I tried.

02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:52.120
I tried.

02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:53.120
Good night, everybody.

02:34:53.120 --> 02:35:00.560
This week, oh, you just, you just won OLR for the evening.

02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:01.560
Congratulations.

02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:02.560
All right.

02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:05.440
Well I would say, how can we follow that FU of the week?

02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:09.800
But then I remember Jonas is here for the first time in seven years.

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:10.800
Let's hear it.

02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:11.800
Seven years worth of FUs.

02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:14.800
Well, I'll keep it short.

02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:18.920
I mean, I'm more calm nowadays for the past after seven years, but okay.

02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:19.920
All right.

02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:25.320
From the big FU to the person who stained my Wii U, it went from-

02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:26.320
Wait, wait, wait.

02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:27.800
Who stained your Wii U?

02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:28.800
No, no, no.

02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:29.800
Wii controller.

02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:30.800
Wii remote controller.

02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:31.800
Okay.

02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:32.800
I don't even want to know what got on it.

02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:33.800
Wait, what?

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:35.600
What was the stain?

02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:36.640
Okay.

02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:40.100
This happened at one of the events.

02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:44.960
It was white at 10 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, it was like clear white, cleaned

02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:45.960
up.

02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:49.440
I come back 11 o'clock, it was brown stained.

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:50.440
The Wii strap.

02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:52.200
Oh, the strap.

02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:55.760
And we had to clean that up because someone pointed out how nasty it was.

02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:59.800
I'm like- Oh my God, so somebody tried to put it in

02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:00.800
their butt?

02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:01.920
Like how does it- No, no, no.

02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:04.200
Someone like sweat grease basically.

02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:10.080
I have some coworkers that the controllers are like, how the fuck is there like wax built

02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:11.620
up on this shit?

02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:14.080
What are you guys like sweating like motor oil or something?

02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:15.080
I don't know.

02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:16.080
Maybe, maybe.

02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:17.080
Let's see.

02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:18.720
Let's see.

02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:22.600
Another fuck you to like the whole story with the standing situation.

02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:28.080
Now for those who want to play the B-Money games in Sacramento, you might as well play

02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:36.720
them as soon as possible because we have unfortunately with the unknown audit, we have to take those

02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:40.880
games out before, actually with less than 20 days.

02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:44.920
Get ready to drive to Miggle where it's twice as far and costs twice as much.

02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:48.960
And sadly, that was actually the place where I can actually practice form a freestyle for

02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:51.120
the United States Championships for Pump It Up.

02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:53.600
I'm like, fuck, how am I supposed to practice now?

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:57.480
And people are expecting me to be competing with two routines if possible.

02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:03.560
Yes, I still freestyle, just came back out of nowhere, but unfortunately with what just

02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:05.640
happened it's going to be a lot tougher to deal with.

02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:08.720
Well, people have been demanding Dr. Dick to come back too.

02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:10.240
So someday, someday.

02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:11.240
I know.

02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:12.240
It's raining midroutine.

02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:13.240
Yep.

02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:14.240
Someday, someday.

02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:18.480
Very, like 2% of our listeners get that joke, get that, that's it.

02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:23.120
A critical fuck you, and hopefully this gets into people's heads, fuck you to those who

02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:29.040
are trying to bring illegal like ROMs and stuff or even requesting it to the game rooms

02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:30.840
or even like hack stuff.

02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:37.520
FYI, you guys, there's actual companies like Nintendo, Sony watching these conventions.

02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:42.520
You don't want conventions to get shut down or get sued, you all know the strict legal

02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:43.520
laws of these things.

02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:46.440
And we don't want to be held responsible for that.

02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:49.520
Let's say this happens, let's say a really good event like Gamer X.

02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:55.880
Yeah, where 2K and Ubisoft are present, it's like, in Gearbox, let's play a pirated version

02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:56.880
of Rayman.

02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:57.880
Yeah, let's not do that, yo.

02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:58.880
Let's not.

02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:02.920
Like, I know this is a big issue with like the Project M community, it's like, look,

02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:05.040
it's a modern game, we can't do that.

02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:06.040
Right, right.

02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:10.040
Because even Nintendo said don't bring that to us, we can't have that.

02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:14.040
Again, we just don't want these conventions to get in trouble because it hurts the industry,

02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:15.640
it hurts us, it hurts the community.

02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:18.360
You can go up to your hotel room and play all the Project M you want.

02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:19.360
Yes, exactly.

02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:21.360
Take it out of public sight.

02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:23.360
Alright.

02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:26.160
Um, I think that's about it for now.

02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:27.160
Alright, for now.

02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:29.160
For now, alright.

02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:31.360
There it is, folks, the FUs of the week.

02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:34.560
It was a little bit longer tonight, but you know, Jonas was here, that was gonna happen.

02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:38.560
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to your calls.

02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:42.080
If you want to call in and say FU, but then I can just hang up on you, but if you have

02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:46.880
something you want to actually talk about, whether we missed it or whether there's a

02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:51.480
new story that you want to give an opinion on, perhaps the whole EA Pass thing that we

02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:56.360
talked about earlier in the show or, you know, you want to talk to us about the Evil G's

02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:58.840
credit card or whatever, we can talk about that.

02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:03.160
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, but first, we have a couple

02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:04.160
more stories.

02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:05.160
Loki.

02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:11.360
So, Monopoly has had several, several themed versions of their game, including a Super

02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:14.720
Mario Bros. version and World of Warcraft version.

02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:20.400
Well, now there's gonna be the Legend of Zelda edition that's gonna be coming out on September

02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:29.960
15th and, um, it is all Hyrule themed and they've got, uh, you know, all sorts of cool

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:30.960
game pieces.

02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:32.520
There's like a Triforce in there.

02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:33.520
I'm trying to see.

02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:34.520
This picture is so tiny.

02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:39.160
Soon to be seen in convention board game rooms everywhere across America, right?

02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:40.160
Yes.

02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:45.720
And, um, you know, apparently, I'm trying to see here, uh, oh, here we go.

02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:53.280
The choice is that you'll have a bow, a hook, shot, boomerang, Triforce, or shield, um,

02:39:53.280 --> 02:40:00.440
are gonna be available and, uh, also, I guess, if you want to shop at the Evil G, they also

02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:09.520
have an Ocarina of Time as well and, uh, six power cards that tweak the gameplay and some

02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:13.240
sort of lithograph of the Hyrule map if you want to purchase it from the Evil G.

02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:20.400
So, all right, looks kind of neat, I guess.

02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:22.320
I would like to get my hands on that, actually.

02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:23.320
I have that.

02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:26.120
There was a Mario Monopoly not that long ago that I have, like, it was like Nintendo or

02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:27.120
something, so.

02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:28.120
Yeah, both.

02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:29.120
Yeah.

02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:30.120
So, why not?

02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:31.800
All right.

02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:32.800
Well, one more story for you guys.

02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:36.800
This is a little bit of a warning to those of you that downloaded The Sims 2 by EA.

02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:42.560
Heads up, Dar Sakura, Loki, those of you that, uh, got your free Sims 2, it has come to people's

02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:49.640
attention that, uh, Sims 2 contained Securom, which you might remember from a long time

02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:50.640
ago, right?

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:51.640
Yeah.

02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:52.640
We talked about this on the show before.

02:40:52.640 --> 02:41:00.160
Securom was a pretty intrusive form of, um, uh, anti, uh, or the copy protection scheme

02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:03.760
that they would have in the game there that had the potential to screw up other games

02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:04.760
on your computer.

02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:09.080
Uh, it would bury itself in your registry and it's a real pain in the ass to get out.

02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:13.640
So, just a heads up, if you installed Sims 2, your computer probably has Securom in it

02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:14.640
now.

02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:15.640
Um, you can get rid of it.

02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:19.220
There's, uh, you know, just Google it if you want a how to remove Securom, although look

02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:23.380
for instructions, not for software, because the software probably has viruses.

02:41:23.380 --> 02:41:25.180
So, there's instructions out there.

02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:30.140
Um, other games that have the, uh, Securom, if you didn't know, BioShock, Mass Effect,

02:41:30.140 --> 02:41:33.580
Spore, which is a huge one, because this is a big part of the reason why people pirated

02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:39.100
Spore back when it came out, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, Dragon Age 2, Final Fantasy 7

02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:44.260
on PC, the re-release, um, so there you go, so, uh, you might want to check your registry,

02:41:44.260 --> 02:41:47.740
see if Securom's there, unless you don't care, if you don't care, then there you go, but,

02:41:47.740 --> 02:41:50.820
uh, if you do care, and you want to get that shit off your computer, you might need to

02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:57.980
look into that, so, there it goes, so, you'll have to, uh, quarantine Sims 2 like it was

02:41:57.980 --> 02:42:02.700
an Ebola virus or something, or, or, send it back to where it came, to, to, to its homeland

02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:03.700
or something, I don't know.

02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:07.460
Alright, uh, there it is, 1-877-GAMO-L-R, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd

02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:11.980
like to give us a call, and, uh, we can talk about whatever's on your mind, while we wait

02:42:11.980 --> 02:42:13.860
for the calls to come in, if any come in at all.

02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:16.860
For, for the record, Avast caught it, like, right away.

02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:18.260
Oh, good.

02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:19.260
Yeah.

02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:20.260
So, don't worry about it.

02:42:20.260 --> 02:42:21.260
That's good.

02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:22.260
There you go.

02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:29.220
Um, let's see, uh, I'm looking in our chat here, over at live.vognetware.com, um, cause,

02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:34.180
Kossen says, this is why you quarantine Origin, I always mispronounce his name, sorry, oh

02:42:34.180 --> 02:42:37.500
no, as my Vista partition has been corrupted, how will I live?

02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:43.420
Hey, that's what happened with Spore on my computer, our Vista, I think it's a joke.

02:42:43.460 --> 02:42:46.860
Uh, alright, uh, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

02:42:46.860 --> 02:42:51.100
Sure, this is pretty exciting, um, there's gonna be a brand new adventure, point and

02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:57.300
click adventure game called Randall's Monday, and why is it even more awesome?

02:42:57.300 --> 02:43:01.820
Because Randall, or I should say, the actor Jeff Anderson, Randall from Clerks, will be

02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:03.140
doing the voice of Randall.

02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:06.020
I wasn't even supposed to be here today.

02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:09.620
Uh, I believe that would have been Dante.

02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:12.060
I thought they both said it.

02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:13.060
No.

02:43:13.700 --> 02:43:20.340
Um, so, I'll probably have to get that game, cause it looks pretty awesome.

02:43:20.340 --> 02:43:25.100
And I'll just pretend it's Randall from Clerks, even if it's not really Randall from Clerks.

02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:27.820
Randall from Clerks was the one that said, this job would be great if it wasn't for the

02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:29.540
fucking customers, right?

02:43:29.540 --> 02:43:30.540
Yeah.

02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:31.540
There you go.

02:43:31.540 --> 02:43:36.260
But you hate people, but I love gatherings, isn't it ironic?

02:43:36.260 --> 02:43:39.860
Oh, that's such a good movie, I wonder if they ever will make a Clerks 3.

02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:41.260
I hope they do.

02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:47.380
I heard something where like, Miramax rejected the script, or rejected it or something.

02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:50.660
Or whatever, the Weinstein company or whoever does these movies now.

02:43:50.660 --> 02:43:56.500
Uh, 1877 game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, meanwhile I do have a few tweets

02:43:56.500 --> 02:43:58.460
I could read here.

02:43:58.460 --> 02:44:04.260
One of the tweets is from SSG100Matt, who says, the folks at Overclocked Remix have

02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:09.820
released a Game Boy 25th anniversary album, and of course it's free, and you can check

02:44:09.820 --> 02:44:14.540
that out at gameboy25.ocremix.com.

02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:15.540
Wait, free?

02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:16.540
Mm-hmm.

02:44:16.540 --> 02:44:17.540
I like free.

02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:20.020
That's OC Remix album, they do a lot of stuff for free.

02:44:20.020 --> 02:44:23.540
And yes, the Game Boy is 25 years old, are you okay?

02:44:23.540 --> 02:44:25.540
Okay, read it.

02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:28.340
What is this you're going to show me?

02:44:28.340 --> 02:44:32.420
I had to show it to somebody.

02:44:32.420 --> 02:44:37.140
You guys have problems, stop interrupting the radio show through Tumblr posts.

02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:46.860
All right, uh, let's see, 13Forever, 13CrossForever, 13XForever says, as I can't call in, you and

02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:52.580
any listener with at least passing interest in JRPGs should research Kiss Case series

02:44:52.580 --> 02:44:54.460
and buy Trails in the Sky.

02:44:54.460 --> 02:44:56.900
I'm not familiar with this one, Logan, you heard of this one?

02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:00.700
Trails in the Sky is, I think, one of those games that was built with RPG Maker, and they

02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:04.920
actually have that part of the RPG Maker Humble Bundle, if I remember correctly.

02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:07.440
So yes, I'm a little familiar with it.

02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:08.440
Supposed to be pretty good.

02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:11.960
I don't know, Jamie would know she bought that Humble Bundle.

02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:14.200
I did, but I haven't touched it yet.

02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:20.600
I bet I have it, I probably purchased it at some point, it's probably on my Steam library

02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:24.680
or something, I don't even know if it's on Steam or something, but I've got so many games.

02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:29.480
Dartitsuya tweets us and says, on the whole Scandia controversy, some people were suggesting

02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:31.240
a Kickstarter, so stay tuned.

02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:33.200
What's a Kickstarter going to do in that situation?

02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:37.520
Open a Zone Arcade, that's a lofty goal.

02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:41.960
On the topic of that, it has been done for arcades before, I'm not sure if anybody has

02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:45.160
heard about the Super Arcade on Kickstarter.

02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:46.160
I don't think so.

02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:47.160
Tell me more.

02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:51.160
Okay, so the idea of what happened with Super Arcade when they did the Kickstarter was to

02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:56.560
keep the arcade running because the guy was using all his financial assets to make sure

02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:02.720
it runs, and to renovate to make it even look better for a wide variety of audiences.

02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:07.000
Right now, they're currently in the assembly, like reassembling the whole location.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:13.000
I think the idea of a Kickstarter would be great, but before even doing that, before

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.280
the Kickstarter, they had to figure out the location, whether it may be in the Thomas

02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:24.720
area or even Elk Grove, or just a location where it actually suits everybody.

02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:25.720
Or those who are-

02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:29.800
Downtown, sell booze, that's a great formula.

02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:33.480
Actually, downtown is kind of a hit and miss at the moment, because the reason why is because

02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:35.880
currently the arena is being-

02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:40.600
Oh, shit, yeah, and it's going to jack all the prices up downtown, too.

02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:46.280
Yeah, it's going to jack up the prices downtown, and it may also make operations a lot difficult

02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:47.280
because of parking.

02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:48.280
Yeah, makes sense.

02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:50.640
I think everybody remembered Nickel Arcade.

02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:54.960
Oh, God, yeah, see, I remember that, that was what I was going to say, downtown is not

02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:56.960
a good place for an arcade.

02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:01.200
All right, maybe Roseville, I don't know, they used to, speaking of Nickel Arcades,

02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:02.200
they used to have NickelMania and Rose-

02:47:02.200 --> 02:47:03.200
Citrus Heights?

02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:04.200
Who knows?

02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:05.760
I mean, not bad, I mean, no.

02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:11.120
But regardless, I mean, yes, there needs to be an arcade location, like at least known

02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:16.960
soon before the scramble, or the location the arcade's going to be at.

02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:17.960
Right, right.

02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:21.320
Like, the arcade machines will be sold to other places, or will be kept still in the

02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:23.920
Sacramento area for another location to keep-

02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:26.880
It'll be interesting to see what develops with that.

02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:28.720
Oh, yeah, the old Birdcage.

02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:30.200
The old Birdcage Arcade.

02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:35.360
All right, 1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give

02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:36.680
us a call.

02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:43.000
We keep talking about all this local drama, but there is a whole world out there of people.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:46.540
And Dartasuya in our chat room, following up, saying, yeah, they're just discussing

02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:49.040
it at the moment, but I'm keeping an ear out.

02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:51.880
Let's see.

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:54.800
There's some folks talking about the Clerks 3 thing in chat.

02:47:54.800 --> 02:48:00.520
SHO 100 Matt says, Kevin Smith is going to, but nobody ever got paid for Clerks 2, so

02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:03.640
he's sorting out the legal stuff for the Weinstein's for that first.

02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:05.600
So maybe they'll work it out, who knows.

02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:07.040
We do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:09.200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:11.200
This is Rageinator.

02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:13.200
Hey, Rageinator, what's up, buddy?

02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:15.200
Excuse me.

02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:23.640
Now, just a little bit of news, that beer is repeating.

02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:29.400
You know how for the past few weeks, I've been promoting or passing along information

02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:34.240
about the free games that have been given away by PC Gamer?

02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:35.720
We love free things.

02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:36.720
Yeah.

02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:46.240
Well, the promotion is more or less in its, quote, unquote, final week.

02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:56.240
It's like they're essentially recapping the bundle that they've been giving away.

02:48:56.240 --> 02:49:02.240
This is essentially the last chance to get any games that you may have missed.

02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:06.760
And there's one or two gems in there.

02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:09.760
They're actually quite good.

02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:14.760
One of which is Dino D-Day, which obviously appeared for a while.

02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:25.760
It's basically, imagine a PlayStation 2 era Medal of Honor game, but both sides,

02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:33.280
from human characters, you also have dinosaurs, the choice of playing as a dinosaur as well.

02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:34.280
Wait, wait, wait.

02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:35.280
You can play as a dinosaur?

02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:36.280
Yeah.

02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:38.280
Or a human.

02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:40.280
It's like Jurassic Park on the Genesis.

02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:42.280
That was cool.

02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:49.280
Basically, well, like I said, in terms of graphics, it looks exactly like a PlayStation

02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:57.800
2 era Medal of Honor game, and kind of plays like one or two, just with the inclusion

02:49:57.800 --> 02:49:58.800
of dinosaurs.

02:49:58.800 --> 02:49:59.800
All right.

02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:02.280
I think everybody perked up when you said that dinosaurs were involved, so tell us one

02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:04.280
more time where we can grab this.

02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:17.280
PC Gamer, I believe on top of the websites, there's like a scrolling banner, and you just

02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:29.280
mentioned the increasing giveaway, and there's another really good one, which is a constant

02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:33.280
shooter called Really Big Sky.

02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:34.280
Oh, yeah.

02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:35.280
I have that game.

02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:36.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:43.280
Yeah, that's really fun, and I forget what else there is in there.

02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:47.280
It's a total of five games all together.

02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:53.280
And here's the thing, Really Big Sky has trading cards in it, so hypothetically, you could

02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:57.280
grab this free game and then sell the trading cards, and you'd have like a dollar.

02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:59.280
Yeah, exactly.

02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:07.280
And at Dafta, I see in a chat that at Dafta is asking what the website is.

02:51:07.280 --> 02:51:15.280
It's PC Gamer, PC Gamer, gamer.com.

02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:19.280
And there's also this website called Google, and you put PC Gamer into it, and you're likely

02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:21.280
to get that as the first result, I think.

02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:23.280
It's a pretty big banner that you can click on.

02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:25.280
I actually redeemed all of these.

02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:28.280
I already had Gun Monkey, well, except for Gun Monkeys, because I already had Gun Monkeys,

02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:31.280
and I actually have two copies of Gun Monkeys.

02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:32.280
Wait, wait, wait.

02:51:32.280 --> 02:51:33.280
Monkeys with guns?

02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:35.280
Yes, it's like Smash Brothers.

02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:36.280
Cool.

02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:37.280
What the heck?

02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:39.280
But with Monkeys and Guns.

02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:42.280
Let's talk more about the Gun Monkeys.

02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:44.280
First off, why don't you give a monkey a gun?

02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:47.280
I don't know, you want a copy of the game, I have an extra Steam Key, because each one

02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:50.280
you redeem, including this, if you get it for free, you get two.

02:51:50.280 --> 02:51:52.280
Hell yeah, if Monkeys with Guns are involved, I want it.

02:51:52.280 --> 02:51:53.280
I want Monkeys with Guns.

02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:56.280
That's like Planet of the Apes again in the movie, right?

02:51:56.280 --> 02:51:57.280
Do you know what?

02:51:57.280 --> 02:51:58.280
This game is officially a virus.

02:51:58.280 --> 02:52:05.280
PC Gamer.com, go to the free Steam Key thing, you just have to like bundle stars and stuff,

02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:09.280
but the thing is, you can always unsubscribe.

02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:11.280
Yeah, like, key, unlike.

02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:13.280
Done.

02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:20.280
Yeah, you also have to bring your email address, but if you really don't want to bring an actual

02:52:20.280 --> 02:52:25.280
email address that you use, you can make up an email address, like you can put in, you

02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:33.280
know, fart.fartataol.com.

02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:37.280
To be fair though, I mean, bundle stars, and there's a lot of other services out there

02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:41.280
like that, they'll do a lot of these Steam bundles, and they're really, really cheap,

02:52:41.280 --> 02:52:46.280
but then again, they're also really, really like, I mean, if you're looking to build up

02:52:46.280 --> 02:52:51.280
your Steam library and you don't give a shit what's in there, bundle stars is the way to

02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:52.280
go.

02:52:52.280 --> 02:52:55.280
Like, for example, they have this one bundle here that's $3.49 and you get like eight games

02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:56.280
with it.

02:52:56.280 --> 02:52:59.280
Yeah, but what games are they?

02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:02.280
You know, push space barf to change the color of your screen?

02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:07.280
I don't know, they have decent games like vector, which is sort of like, it's a free

02:53:07.280 --> 02:53:08.280
running game.

02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:12.280
They have, this is actually a bad example, this one doesn't have a lot of cool stuff

02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:16.280
in there, but there's actually some other ones that were pretty sweet that I've gotten

02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:18.280
before, there was like a racing one.

02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:23.280
Here you go, reboot 6.0, it's $2.99, you get postal, underground, block land, which is

02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:27.280
actually pretty cool, it's like a cross between Lego and a first person shooter.

02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:28.280
Oh, that's cool.

02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:34.280
They have Steel Storm, Rock of Ages, and Expeditions Conquistador, so not bad.

02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:38.280
I would have gotten that, except they have most of those games.

02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:40.280
So, you know, $2.99 though?

02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:50.280
Yeah, honestly, after the fact I saw the Hokies during the bundle stars group, I joined just

02:53:50.280 --> 02:54:01.280
a sheer curiosity, and my only, although I'm in the minority here, my only problem with

02:54:01.280 --> 02:54:10.280
buying games from the stars, or even buying games from Amazon or Google games or whatever,

02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:17.280
is that I'm probably one of the few people out there that does not have a debit card

02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:26.280
or credit card or what have you, and even when I had a Playstation 3 or an Xbox 360,

02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:36.280
how I put paper stuff is through PSN cards or points cards or now Steam cards.

02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:40.280
Well, Raginator GameStop's got a deal for you.

02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:42.280
Look out.

02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:50.280
Yeah, Raginator, they can ask with a chainsaw, they go to GameStop.

02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:55.280
Wow. All right, Raginator, I gotta let you go so we can try to get some more calls, but

02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:58.280
have fun with the dinosaurs and monkeys with guns, okay?

02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:00.280
Have a nice night.

02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:01.280
All right, bye.

02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:06.280
All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call.

02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:11.280
Maybe you know animals doing crazy things in video games that you want to share with us.

02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:14.280
Jurassic Park, the movie, the fighting game.

02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:15.280
Was that actually a thing?

02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:17.280
No, but I wish it was.

02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:24.280
They have Jurassic World next year. We'll probably get some game tie-ins with that, at least I can hope.

02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:28.280
I still remember the Jurassic Park game on Super Nintendo because it was kind of at the height of the goons.

02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:31.280
Even the Genesis one was crazy. They're good in different ways.

02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:35.280
They were totally different, but the Super Nintendo one had the first person super pixelated.

02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:36.280
Oh, yes, I remember that.

02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:41.280
Like when the velociraptors would literally jump out from behind shit and scary.

02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:42.280
Crazy little things like that.

02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:45.280
I still like the Sega one. You still sit down.

02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:47.280
Oh, yeah, that's right, the mechanic.

02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:48.280
Was that a side-scroller?

02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:49.280
No, it was a shooting game.

02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:50.280
The arcade.

02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:53.280
That one was great, yeah, definitely.

02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:59.280
Which, by the way, I totally forgot what I was going to say, never mind.

02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:00.280
All right, fair enough.

02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:02.280
One last chance if you want to give us a call.

02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:04.280
Every gamer has a voice, but only if you use it.

02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:08.280
1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:11.280
Tigerclaw reminding us that Chris Pratt is in Jurassic World.

02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:16.280
Well, that guy's headed straight for the A-list between Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World.

02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:18.280
I'm sure he's going to do really well, and people love their parks and rec.

02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:22.280
So that guy making good moves, good career choices.

02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:25.280
So he's just destined to star in some flop in a couple of years.

02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:30.280
Like, remember when Halle Berry won the Oscar, and then she did Catwoman?

02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:32.280
Not a good career move.

02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:37.280
I'm sorry, there's one thing I care about, one thing that has to happen in my lifetime.

02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:38.280
What?

02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:42.280
An actual, for real, wonderfully well done Deadpool movie.

02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:46.280
Well, you know, that footage online, it's possible.

02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:48.280
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:49.280
I know.

02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:50.280
Very cool.

02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:52.280
So, how about a Wonder Woman movie?

02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:54.280
That's what I want to see.

02:56:54.280 --> 02:56:58.280
If we can have Guardians of the Galaxy, we can have a solo Wonder Woman movie.

02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:04.280
Should we be doing that after the whole Marvel, or is it the Batman and Superman movie?

02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:06.280
Don't call it a Justice League movie, but it kind of is.

02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:12.280
For the record, I think that Gal Gadot is absolutely gorgeous.

02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:14.280
And I would go see it just for her.

02:57:14.280 --> 02:57:17.280
We briefly, you know, because you weren't here last week actually,

02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:21.280
and since we aren't getting a lot of calls tonight, it's a good time for me to kind of ask you about this.

02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:25.280
Surely you saw the costume. I'm curious on your thoughts, because I was kind of like,

02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:30.280
Well, okay. I didn't hate it, but I was very much like, she does look like Xena.

02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:33.280
Everyone was like, it's all brown, it's all brown.

02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:37.280
And I'm like, so is everything around her. It could be lighting.

02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:41.280
I mean, I didn't get a really good high-res picture, so I could tell.

02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:44.280
But I mean, it could very well have just been lighting.

02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:46.280
She could have been drenched in blood.

02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:48.280
The blood of her enemies.

02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:49.280
Perhaps.

02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:52.280
Although, I have to say that I did like the style.

02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:58.280
I like the sword and all that, but she's got to have a lasso that makes people tell the truth at some point.

02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:01.280
I mean, it's Wonder Woman.

02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:04.280
Well, you know about how the character came across, right?

02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:05.280
What do you mean?

02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:08.280
The guy who created Wonder Woman was a fetishist.

02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:09.280
Oh, lord.

02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:10.280
No, seriously.

02:58:10.280 --> 02:58:11.280
Wow.

02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:16.280
The lasso had to relate it back to the whole lie detector test.

02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:21.280
And any time that she was, her weakness is being bound by a man.

02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:22.280
Wow.

02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:24.280
And she loses her abilities.

02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:25.280
Huh.

02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:28.280
I don't remember Linda Carter doing that.

02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:33.280
This was the early iteration, and there was a lot of tying people up in Wonder Woman.

02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:34.280
Bound by a man.

02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:36.280
Interesting. Very interesting.

02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:40.280
Alright. Well, that is, and Dungeon Buster is pointing out the lasso is there.

02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:42.280
It's right next to her sword hand on her hip.

02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:43.280
Oh, good. I missed that.

02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:46.280
I guess I didn't see, I just saw the little Twitter picture. I didn't see the, oh.

02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:48.280
So that's good. I'm glad to hear it.

02:58:48.280 --> 02:58:51.280
Alright. Well, that's, I guess, going to do it.

02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:55.280
We're not getting any of the calls tonight, so our audience is just being shy.

02:58:55.280 --> 02:58:56.280
I see how it is.

02:58:56.280 --> 02:58:58.280
If you want to email us, you sure can.

02:58:58.280 --> 02:59:03.280
You can send an email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:05.280
But for now, we're going to wrap up here in studio.

02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:07.280
We're on our way out tonight.

02:59:07.280 --> 02:59:08.280
I want to say thanks to our guests.

02:59:08.280 --> 02:59:10.280
Diego, great to meet you.

02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:11.280
Oh, it's a pleasure. Definitely.

02:59:11.280 --> 02:59:15.280
And best of luck with SacAnime coming up in a few weeks.

02:59:15.280 --> 02:59:20.280
I'm sorry I can't go myself, but DarkSakura will go and tell me all about the fabulous teabagging going on there.

02:59:20.280 --> 02:59:22.280
Fabulous teabagging.

02:59:22.280 --> 02:59:23.280
That's right.

02:59:23.280 --> 02:59:30.280
Maybe, you know, she participated in a cosplay tournament at GamerX, so maybe she'll do one of your gaming tournaments.

02:59:30.280 --> 02:59:32.280
Oh, wow. That would be really nice.

02:59:32.280 --> 02:59:33.280
There you go.

02:59:33.280 --> 02:59:36.280
She can kick somebody's ass at Tekken. I don't know if that's a thing you guys do.

02:59:36.280 --> 02:59:37.280
Oh, that'd be good.

02:59:37.280 --> 02:59:43.280
It's been ages since I was at my legendary level of skill in Tekken 3.

02:59:43.280 --> 02:59:45.280
Do you like how I'm volunteering for stuff, too?

02:59:45.280 --> 02:59:48.280
Wow, that's amazing. We have our own little Tekken player in our group, too.

02:59:48.280 --> 02:59:53.280
And he goes under the name Heisenberg, I guess, but he just took that off of...

02:59:53.280 --> 02:59:57.280
My last regular ongoing Tekken playing was in Tekken 4.

02:59:57.280 --> 02:59:58.280
Oh, 4, yeah.

02:59:58.280 --> 03:00:02.280
But my regular wasn't... They changed all of Jin's moves for 4.

03:00:02.280 --> 03:00:03.280
Oh, damn.

03:00:03.280 --> 03:00:06.280
And he was my regular in 3, so...

03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:07.280
Yeah.

03:00:07.280 --> 03:00:08.280
Him and Julia.

03:00:08.280 --> 03:00:12.280
I like the one that did the capoeira dancing because you could just button mash.

03:00:12.280 --> 03:00:14.280
Yeah, you could just button mash. It was great.

03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:18.280
However, if you actually could play him without mashing, oh my god, even better.

03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:19.280
Yeah.

03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:20.280
Oh, yes.

03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:22.280
Seriously. It's like watching... You don't know what you're watching.

03:00:22.280 --> 03:00:24.280
It's just like suddenly there's feet.

03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:25.280
Yeah.

03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:27.280
Yeah, but it'll be good to see you there.

03:00:27.280 --> 03:00:29.280
And the second one is just getting bigger.

03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:32.280
And we want to make this one the best one possible.

03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:34.280
And I think you would agree, Jonas, right?

03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:39.280
Oh, yeah. Especially with the new change in the direction of things, as well.

03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:45.280
Like new generation of systems and the higher demand of new games coming out.

03:00:45.280 --> 03:00:49.280
I'll bust out the Homestuck cosplay again.

03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:50.280
All right.

03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:51.280
I'm one of them.

03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:52.280
No, it's cool.

03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:57.280
Actually, speaking on the Homestuck topic of things.

03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:01.280
Surprisingly, I know people are sometimes concerned, like convention people can criticize Homestuck,

03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:05.280
but for us game rooms, we're actually 100% welcoming the Homestuck crew

03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:08.280
because a lot of them actually play our games, especially the Just Dance section.

03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:13.280
This is as long as they don't get Ben Nye all over the controllers.

03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:15.280
We'll make sure of that.

03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:17.280
Emperor of Husky is in chat right now saying,

03:01:17.280 --> 03:01:20.280
I hope to see Dark Sakura at SacAnime.

03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:22.280
Oh, is it Wendell?

03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:24.280
I love you, Wendell.

03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:25.280
You're in demand.

03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:26.280
I want to go.

03:01:26.280 --> 03:01:29.280
All right, if my costume still fits me, I'll wear it.

03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:30.280
All right.

03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:32.280
My costume is actually just a slight bit too big for me,

03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:35.280
and I hope to have a little bit less by the time.

03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:36.280
There you go.

03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:37.280
Take it in.

03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:39.280
Easier to take it in than let it out.

03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:40.280
I can't sew for shit.

03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:42.280
I hear that.

03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:44.280
Awesome.

03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:49.280
I would say I'm almost sad that I'm going to Dragon Con, but to be honest, I'm really not.

03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:55.280
I'm fucking excited for Dragon Con, but I'm sad that they have to be the same weekend.

03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:58.280
That's a pain in the butt.

03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:00.280
Diego, now it's tradition here at OLR.

03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:03.280
We always ask everybody to give their final thought, like Jerry Springer style.

03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:08.280
Do you have a final thought, a final note for our listeners tonight?

03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:13.280
Final thought?

03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:16.280
Do you have another song parody you'd like to build out for us?

03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:20.280
I don't know. Whenever I hear a song itself, I usually try to change the lyrics around the spot.

03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:21.280
Fair enough.

03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:27.280
Final thought is listen when your name's called out when I'm running a tournament.

03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:28.280
That's right.

03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:31.280
Pay attention. Be smart.

03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:36.280
I don't know. Just try not to be like the typical con goer, but that's not going to change.

03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:39.280
Your final thought is when I talk, you listen.

03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:40.280
I hope so.

03:02:40.280 --> 03:02:41.280
When anyone does so.

03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:42.280
It feels bad.

03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:48.280
Like we list up so many people and about a fourth of those people just drop out because they don't show up or something.

03:02:48.280 --> 03:02:52.280
I'm like, well, oh, well, let's just go on to the next bracket.

03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:54.280
Let's go on to the next pairing.

03:02:54.280 --> 03:02:56.280
It's OK. It's just that's not going to stop us.

03:02:56.280 --> 03:02:58.280
And we can satisfy the majority.

03:02:58.280 --> 03:02:59.280
We did our job.

03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:01.280
That's the whole thing.

03:03:01.280 --> 03:03:03.280
All right. Thanks again for being here, buddy.

03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:05.280
Well, you're welcome back any time.

03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:10.280
Jonas, it's so good to see you again after years and years and years and years, far too long.

03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:12.280
Thank you for gracing us with your presence tonight.

03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:14.280
Best of luck teabagging at SacAnime.

03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:15.280
Oh, definitely.

03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:17.280
Your teabag orgy and all that stuff.

03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:19.280
I love that. I love that.

03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:21.280
I hope to see you guys at a future con.

03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:23.280
And yeah, come back any time.

03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:24.280
Oh, definitely.

03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:25.280
Now you know where we're at.

03:03:25.280 --> 03:03:27.280
Yeah, that's actually one of my final thoughts.

03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:30.280
We could probably bring some of our other crew members here.

03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:33.280
Right now, it's just me and Diego right now.

03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:37.280
And we wanted to give this a big test after like seven years of not being in the show.

03:03:37.280 --> 03:03:38.280
So I was like, OK.

03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:39.280
All right.

03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:42.280
And we thought, OK, this would be a great opportunity to network and stuff.

03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:43.280
All right. Sounds good.

03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:46.280
Next time, though, we've got to hook up some games to the TV and get playing during the show.

03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:49.280
So I'll let you guys choose what to bring.

03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:50.280
Oh, cool. Awesome.

03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:51.280
All right.

03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:52.280
Thank you again for being here.

03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:54.280
A final thought from you, sir.

03:03:54.280 --> 03:03:57.280
That was actually my final thought was like to be continued, like, OK,

03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:01.280
we're going to have new people in the show to actually speak their mind of things.

03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:04.280
As you can see, you saw how Diego I was talking to.

03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:06.280
He had a couple of laughs.

03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:08.280
Where every gamer has a voice.

03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:09.280
Oh, yeah.

03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:10.280
Bring me more gamers.

03:04:10.280 --> 03:04:11.280
Lend me their voices.

03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:17.280
And of course, minus that part, that's actually two little things to discuss.

03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:19.280
Make sure you guys have the hygiene, of course.

03:04:19.280 --> 03:04:20.280
Make sure shower.

03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:22.280
I don't want to see another brown stain.

03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:26.280
And if I may add, it's not just acts bathe.

03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:28.280
Yes, please.

03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:34.280
And of course, of course, with my Facebook message being blown up over this whole San Diego Comic Con,

03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:38.280
with the sexual harassment incident with the cosplayer.

03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:41.280
Everybody, please get concrete information.

03:04:41.280 --> 03:04:45.280
Don't go spreading the wrong information because it all caused more confusion.

03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:47.280
And don't listen to the girl's mom.

03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:50.280
I think that goes for anything.

03:04:50.280 --> 03:04:52.280
Like, don't fucking spread rumors.

03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:53.280
Stop it.

03:04:53.280 --> 03:04:54.280
Yeah, pretty much.

03:04:54.280 --> 03:04:55.280
I will tell you this.

03:04:55.280 --> 03:04:59.280
There's a reason I reposted things is because when they were still looking for apparently the person.

03:04:59.280 --> 03:05:00.280
Sure.

03:05:00.280 --> 03:05:06.280
When you spread the information like that, there is a chance that in the legitimate cases, people will have witnesses.

03:05:06.280 --> 03:05:07.280
It's spreading awareness.

03:05:07.280 --> 03:05:13.280
However, when the final word came out, there were still people going,

03:05:13.280 --> 03:05:14.280
Oh, I bet that's not true.

03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:15.280
I bet that's not true.

03:05:15.280 --> 03:05:17.280
And no, it was true.

03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:27.280
So I still, my personal thought on this, I still don't really believe the whole story yet because we don't have the whole story.

03:05:27.280 --> 03:05:31.280
I just, I know the authorities were looking for a certain person so they could ask some questions.

03:05:31.280 --> 03:05:32.280
They could do their job.

03:05:32.280 --> 03:05:37.280
I hope they are able to do their job and figure out a very ugly situation.

03:05:37.280 --> 03:05:40.280
Anyhow, thanks again guys for being here.

03:05:40.280 --> 03:05:41.280
Really appreciate it.

03:05:41.280 --> 03:05:44.280
Loki, since you're over there, we'll see you next week.

03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:46.280
Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

03:05:46.280 --> 03:05:50.280
Um, no.

03:05:50.280 --> 03:05:51.280
I don't know.

03:05:51.280 --> 03:05:56.280
I'm very jealous that Vanguard V has a pretty awesome title theme.

03:05:56.280 --> 03:05:59.280
Wish I could find one of those for free.

03:05:59.280 --> 03:06:01.280
That's why it's awesome it's not free.

03:06:01.280 --> 03:06:02.280
Anyway, my...

03:06:02.280 --> 03:06:04.280
They're never going to hit their Kickstarter goal, by the way.

03:06:04.280 --> 03:06:07.280
There's no way they're going to make a hundred and...

03:06:07.280 --> 03:06:08.280
That's too bad.

03:06:08.280 --> 03:06:09.280
Yeah, it's not going to happen.

03:06:09.280 --> 03:06:10.280
I'm sad.

03:06:10.280 --> 03:06:15.280
As always, I just want to say, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lunch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

03:06:15.280 --> 03:06:17.280
Help spread the word about Orange Lunch Radio.

03:06:17.280 --> 03:06:21.280
Because, you know, we don't have big magazines or huge million dollar websites backing us.

03:06:21.280 --> 03:06:23.280
We never have for the past twelve years.

03:06:23.280 --> 03:06:25.280
So tell a friend or fifty about the show.

03:06:25.280 --> 03:06:28.280
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

03:06:28.280 --> 03:06:29.280
And that's all we ask.

03:06:29.280 --> 03:06:32.280
My final thought tonight otherwise is...

03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:34.280
I'm craving some more of that apple soda.

03:06:34.280 --> 03:06:35.280
That was really good.

03:06:35.280 --> 03:06:37.280
Apple soda, who would have thought?

03:06:37.280 --> 03:06:39.280
The El Forastero.

03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:40.280
Yeah, right, right.

03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:42.280
Just tell everybody where I live, Dark Sakura.

03:06:42.280 --> 03:06:43.280
Alright, just kidding.

03:06:43.280 --> 03:06:46.280
There are five of them in freakin' town, Rob.

03:06:46.280 --> 03:06:47.280
Fair enough, fair enough.

03:06:47.280 --> 03:06:54.280
And they're almost indistinguishable from at Alberto's, Carolina's, and all of the other places that are technically all...

03:06:54.280 --> 03:06:56.280
were part of the same chain and then split apart.

03:06:56.280 --> 03:06:58.280
I was going to say, probably all owned by the same person.

03:06:58.280 --> 03:06:59.280
No, no, it's actually true.

03:06:59.280 --> 03:07:01.280
They all started off as at Alberto's and then started splitting off.

03:07:01.280 --> 03:07:02.280
Wow.

03:07:02.280 --> 03:07:03.280
Yep.

03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:05.280
Jeez.

03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:06.280
Shut up, really?

03:07:06.280 --> 03:07:07.280
That's what happened?

03:07:07.280 --> 03:07:09.280
Alberto was married to somebody that...

03:07:09.280 --> 03:07:11.280
Give Diego a mic, give Diego a mic.

03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:12.280
There's a Beto's by my house, by the way.

03:07:12.280 --> 03:07:13.280
Oh, yeah.

03:07:13.280 --> 03:07:16.280
Alberto was married to some chick and then they divorced and such.

03:07:16.280 --> 03:07:21.280
And then she made something called Beto's, which is off the corner of El Camino and Howe.

03:07:21.280 --> 03:07:22.280
And then it's still on El Camino.

03:07:22.280 --> 03:07:23.280
There's one in Citrus Heights now.

03:07:23.280 --> 03:07:24.280
Beto's?

03:07:24.280 --> 03:07:25.280
Yeah.

03:07:25.280 --> 03:07:26.280
That's her branch.

03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:28.280
So she took that little thing, except changed the name.

03:07:28.280 --> 03:07:30.280
They sell the same things.

03:07:30.280 --> 03:07:33.280
There's some telenovela shit going on with all these different taquerias.

03:07:33.280 --> 03:07:34.280
There's some going on.

03:07:34.280 --> 03:07:35.280
Alright.

03:07:35.280 --> 03:07:36.280
Wow.

03:07:36.280 --> 03:07:37.280
Alright.

03:07:37.280 --> 03:07:38.280
There you go.

03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:41.280
Last but not least, Dark Sakura, your final thought for our listeners tonight.

03:07:42.280 --> 03:07:43.280
Bravely defart.

03:07:48.280 --> 03:07:50.280
That'll do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:07:50.280 --> 03:07:52.280
Thanks again for listening, everybody.

03:07:52.280 --> 03:07:53.280
Be nice to each other.

03:07:53.280 --> 03:07:54.280
Bathe, please.

03:07:54.280 --> 03:07:56.280
And we'll see you next week.

03:07:56.280 --> 03:07:57.280
