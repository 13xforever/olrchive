00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,400
This week, a new service starting up means another one is shutting down, but one single

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,200
game ending means that many more are becoming available.

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,240
It's a new month, and a new story about EA's decisions makes it to the top.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,280
We'll explain all the changes that are in store on the show, where every gamer has a

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
voice.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:34,680
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,440
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:45,120
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this August 3rd, 2014, with the 562nd episode of our program.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,200
My name is Rob Roberts, joining over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
culture, and the gamer lifestyle, hopefully hiccup-free this week, thank you very much,

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,720
with my co-host.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,960
Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,440
Can't talk, I have a milkshake.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,700
Speaking of sick, you were out sick last week.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,700
I had the plague.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,800
I think you and I had a similar thing, because I was here on the show, and I did the show

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,080
anyway, and I had hiccups, and then I was feeling really sniffly, and sure enough, I

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
missed work on Tuesday.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,340
I didn't have sniffly things, my stomach felt like rocks were in it, and I ended up having

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,000
to eat very, very plain, plain chicken broth and rice, because every time I would eat something,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,840
it would cause immediate reflux.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
You.

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
So, yeah.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,960
I think mine was a case of gastritis.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,680
Happy place, video games, yay.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,120
I have chocolate milkshake this week.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
There you go.

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Is it bringing all the boys to the yard?

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Mm.

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
All right.

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,880
Well, I know who it did bring to the studio.

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,440
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Hello.

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,400
Hi, Loki, how are you?

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Doing fine.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,680
So, a little bit before we went live tonight, we did a little taste test, and I think a

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,600
lot of your friends and people on YouTube and Facebook are talking about this contest

38
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,360
that's happening for the second year, and that's the whole Lay's Do A Flavor contest

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,040
where they have the crazy chip flavors, and last year, what, they had chicken and waffles,

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
which was amazing.

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,200
Sriracha, the garlic bread one, right?

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,160
You mean the spicy ketchup one?

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Yes.

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,400
So, this year, and I just had Loki and Dark Soccer, I tried these before the show, and

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,720
I'm curious what you thought, Loki.

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,780
We had wasabi ginger, which you refused to touch it.

47
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,180
I don't like wasabi or ginger, so this wouldn't have been good.

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,500
And then there was cappuccino, which I think is way better than people are giving it credit

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
for.

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,740
They taste like Taco Bell cinnamon twists to me.

51
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,740
It's kind of meh.

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,220
All right, and then there was bacon mac and cheese.

53
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,220
That was really good.

54
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,220
Of course.

55
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,220
That was really good.

56
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
Of course, because bacon.

57
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,220
It was really cheesy.

58
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,260
No, the thing is, I didn't even taste the bacon in it.

59
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,260
I like this show.

60
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,620
All right, and then my favorite reaction I saw to you all night, mango salsa.

61
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,620
Oh, that was nasty.

62
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
Where you literally went through it.

63
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
It wasn't bad.

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,180
It was absolutely nasty.

65
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,420
It was not bad.

66
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,620
All right, we're going to the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the

67
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,540
Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

68
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,060
right after the Bobby Blackall show.

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,620
It is the show where every gamer has a voice and you guys can join in in our live chat

70
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,500
room, live.vognetwork.com.

71
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,180
And you know, every gamer has a voice, even when they're wrong, such as Brad from Pod

72
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,020
Culture, who says the chicken and waffles one was nasty.

73
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,580
You're entitled to your wrong opinion.

74
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,580
Those were the best.

75
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,340
Okay, maybe you all don't agree with me.

76
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,340
That's fine.

77
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,340
Everybody gets to have a voice.

78
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,180
Hey, we've got a voice here in studio tonight that we haven't heard from in years and years

79
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,740
and years, but thanks to the magic of running into each other at conventions, we've got

80
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,980
him back on the show tonight and I'm hoping his mic works.

81
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,620
Say hello everybody to Jonas back on the show tonight.

82
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Hello.

83
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,620
Hey Jonas, how are you doing?

84
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,620
I've been doing great.

85
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,260
I know it's been seven years since the last time we met.

86
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,300
Has it really been seven years since you've been on the show?

87
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Yeah, I think so.

88
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,300
Because I remember I came to the show before SacAnime of 2007 because you've heard it better

89
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,340
and I was like, oh, I'll stop by the Orange Dance Radio to talk.

90
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,140
You're a little quiet, so just make sure that mic gets a little closer to your mouth.

91
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
Can you all hear me now?

92
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
Yes, we can.

93
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,140
Okay.

94
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,020
Yeah, it's been seven years because I remember me, I guess I was talking to one of you guys

95
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,460
to have a panel at SacAnime on July 2nd.

96
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,460
Oh, that's right.

97
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,620
Yeah, we had one years and years ago.

98
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,540
I don't know why we haven't had one since, it never is hooked up.

99
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,020
That was the same year I bought the Dalek.

100
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,100
Oh, and SacAnime's Dragon Con weekend now, which VOG does a lot of stuff with Dragon

101
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,580
Con, so I go out to Atlanta now.

102
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,380
And maybe they're cosplaying, by the way.

103
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,380
Awesome.

104
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,920
Yeah, I know the SacAnime weekend is usually tough for summer because it's the same time

105
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,500
as Dragon Con, as mentioned, as well as PAX.

106
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,800
And that's where we went in 2008.

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,220
That's probably how we kind of lost touch because we went there the next year.

109
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,060
Well, it's fantastic to have you back on the show and believe it or not, we have some new

110
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,620
listeners since 2007.

111
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,020
Oh, that's great.

112
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,420
Not everybody knows you, but we all met playing DDR, which if you don't know the history of

113
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,300
Orange Lawn Radio, Dark Soccer, Loki, myself, we all met at Roseville Golf Land or Milpitas

114
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,420
Golf Land or some, insert golf land here, playing Dance Dance Revolution and the old

115
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,420
school music games.

116
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,820
And this was born of that community, really, and Jonas, you were a part of that community

117
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,820
as well, right?

118
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,820
Correct.

119
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,580
So I have to ask you, do you still dabble in the foot stomping and all this?

120
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:17,900
DDR, not so much, but whether it's DDR or ITG, it's kind of out of touch a little bit.

121
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,740
Only because DDR is only in Japan now because of the future installments.

122
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,740
Right.

123
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,620
You know what's funny though?

124
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,580
I was at Milpitas Golf Land yesterday, and that's the first time I've been there in probably

125
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,580
like six or seven years.

126
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,480
It's been a very long time, right?

127
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,920
And so I went there and I remember the first place I ever saw DDR, ever saw the game.

128
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,920
You can thank that for this show, that weekend for this show, because I remember going into

129
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,120
the back arcade and there was like a mini tournament going on and people dancing crazy

130
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
on the machine.

131
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,480
And I was like, these hams up there doing that stuff, I'm like, I want to do that.

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,880
I know I'm white, but the arrows will tell me how to do it.

133
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,540
Well, see, that's the thing is the first time I saw DDR was actually at Fanime.

134
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,060
They had a fourth mix there and I was like, wow, that looks really cool.

135
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,900
And then I ended up buying the soundtrack and like, just then later on importing, you

136
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
know, mixes.

137
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
The music was very special.

138
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,420
I think it's a good way to put it.

139
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,620
It was a very special time.

140
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,620
It was cool.

141
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,620
I don't know.

142
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
It was.

143
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:27,380
Just rewind back to Anime Expo 2000, with the third mix machine and the chair.

144
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,380
Okay.

145
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,620
The first time you and I ever met was at Milpitas Golf Land in that same back arcade playing

146
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Para Para Paradise.

147
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Yes.

148
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,100
That was the whole time when I lived at Melrose Place and, you know, that whole thing was

149
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
going on.

150
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
And then that was like the first time we met.

151
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Right.

152
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,540
So you were living at Melrose Place after that.

153
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,540
Oh, was it?

154
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,540
Oh, it's all a blur.

155
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,540
It's all a blur.

156
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,540
Anyway, let's not talk about those theatrics.

157
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,060
What my point that I wanted to talk about with the whole, um, uh, the back arcade and

158
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,140
everything that happened there, I went to Milpitas Golf Land only to discover that back

159
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
arcade gone.

160
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,140
What?

161
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Gone.

162
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
It's the laser tag arena.

163
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,380
Now they converted the back arcade to a laser tag arena.

164
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,060
I want to find whoever made that decision and smack them in the nose with, with, with

165
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,620
a used a low.

166
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,660
Here's the, it's the sad reality of arcade star soccer at the front arcade, nothing but

167
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,900
ticket spitters.

168
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:26,260
And in the back corner, you've got your initial DS, your racing games, and then beat me to

169
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,420
the X, Technica in the groove.

170
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
That's it.

171
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Your little, your little corner.

172
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,940
We need to just open the moneycade.

173
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,980
I know, but it would, it would sadly probably flop actually, um, that's something that could

174
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,220
actually work based on the situation with shenanigans.

175
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
Okay.

176
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Okay.

177
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,260
So literally you walked in here like two minutes before we're live tonight and you're telling

178
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,900
us here that locally Scandi, I don't, I don't know if we're contributing to drama or gossip,

179
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,180
but Oh, well, so the Scandi here locally, which has a bunch of these Bemani machines,

180
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
which we're loving.

181
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
They're not going to have these machines anymore.

182
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:05,260
Um, because, okay, the con, what happened was, um, when, when, I think it was after

183
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,580
United States Pump Festival, for those who are not aware, it was the United States Championships

184
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,580
for Pump It Up, which is still going on.

185
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,060
And it's going to happen in November again at Pacific Media Expo, um, shenanigans decided

186
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,980
to put their machines, um, in Scandia as like a partnership thing, which includes converting

187
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:32,660
the DDR supernova one into a dual, um, switched, um, DDR extreme plus, um, the, in the groove

188
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,260
two with like the simple theme, like the Pump It Up pro to Pump It Up, um, fiesta two, which

189
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:45,660
is the latest one, as well as all the Bemani stuff like 2DX, pop in music, DJ Max Technica

190
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,380
and upgraded in, um, maximum tune.

191
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,380
Wow.

192
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,780
And okay.

193
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,140
And of course, um, Street Fighter 4 arcade edition.

194
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,940
Oh yeah.

195
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,140
But so this is, it's leaving, it's, it's going away because there's a disagreement between

196
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
the two.

197
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,940
I don't even know what it is because I just read the thing too.

198
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,220
Apparently it's like an audit or whatever done by the owner.

199
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,460
But he even like, you know, Sean was just like, listen, I, it's more important to me,

200
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,340
you know, that these games are there for the community there to use them because he's all

201
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,820
well, I'll even leave them there for free, allow you bring in whatever revenue you want

202
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,980
and I'll leave them there for free and is, but you know, cause these people, you know,

203
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,140
are coming here to play these games and it's really important to keep that going and there's,

204
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,740
they're saying, well, no.

205
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,740
Okay.

206
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,980
I look, look, message to Scandia, Sacramento, you know, I, I, hi, I'm Rob and this is Loki

207
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,980
and Dark Sakura.

208
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,020
We have a podcast with dozens and dozens of listeners, so we're really important.

209
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
Okay.

210
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,140
Please don't get rid of these, these machines cause it's like the whole reason to go to

211
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,500
the arcade right now.

212
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,380
Like our, I hate, it pains me, I hurt, I ache when I see these other once great arcades

213
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,220
like Milpitas Golf Land and stuff and golf lands in general go the way of the redemption

214
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
scene.

215
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,660
But Chuck E Cheese does this too, not to pick on Golf Land, but everything's going the way

216
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,260
of the redemption machine.

217
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:15,740
Like actual video games that are, that, that contribute to music and you know, the enrichment

218
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,340
of that and making people excited about music and wanting to possibly play a real instrument,

219
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,340
you know, that type of thing.

220
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,700
This is a great thing for the community.

221
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,180
So please think twice about what you're doing cause it would suck.

222
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,180
So.

223
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,180
Well, I mean, to be fair, I think Scandia has tried a lot of weird shit.

224
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,940
I mean, look at, was it the Scandia Screamer, this giant thing that's just an eyesore, you

225
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,960
know, or, or they're like shooting gallery or just like, you know, all sorts of weird

226
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,460
stuff that they have there that it seems like money making ideas that they thought, you

227
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,140
know, I don't know if that does make a lot of money for them, the Scandia Screamer or

228
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,140
whatever.

229
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
It's, I don't know.

230
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,340
I'll be a weird screamer when they truck those machines out of there.

231
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
All right.

232
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Anyway.

233
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,740
Um, so on the, on the happier things.

234
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,380
So I ran into you at gamer X, which if you guys saw the videos over at VOG network, you

235
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,320
guys saw where I was interviewing Jonas.

236
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,840
So some, some stuff you've done in the past few years, since you got more involved with

237
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,980
SAC anime and all this, you actually do the game rooms at anime cons, right?

238
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
Correct.

239
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,340
And how does that, how did you get into that?

240
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,980
How did, how did you go from gamer guy who likes to play DDR to, I'm now putting together

241
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,660
all these gaming rooms at expos.

242
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,660
How did you get into that?

243
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,660
Okay.

244
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,540
Um, I'll try to keep this as like short as possible.

245
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,340
Like as, as, as, as short as possible because it's a really, really long story.

246
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
It's all right.

247
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
It's a three hour show, but yeah.

248
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,340
Give us, give us a cliff notes.

249
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,740
Cause I know it started like when, you know, this history, let's say like go to orange

250
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,380
house radio and stuff and then suddenly I'm starting to do tournaments because I thought

251
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,340
the tournament C would have died in paradise Island.

252
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:51,100
Cause you know, like what kind of term has happened like past, um, the shaft tournament?

253
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Not a lot.

254
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Yeah.

255
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,100
Shaft probably killed DDR for a lot of people, but yeah.

256
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,020
But so I decided, okay, I start with the whole tournaments with paradise Island.

257
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Let's see how this works.

258
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,980
And I didn't know it would go that, that a decent size.

259
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:12,580
And so we did three shows and then of course paradise Island shut down for unknown reasons.

260
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,940
Um, of course, give my involvement, give my hands on like game development with in the

261
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,500
group too, because they liked some of my step charts at the time.

262
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Right.

263
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,600
And it was fun experience, but unfortunately my contract didn't renewed from pump it up

264
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
pro too.

265
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,100
Cause I was working at pumping a pro as well.

266
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,440
Oh, I didn't realize that.

267
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Very cool.

268
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Yeah.

269
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,780
So when people heard my name working on these things, they thought, well, let's bring this

270
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,780
guy along.

271
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,260
So you did some of the steps for pumping a pro?

272
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,260
Some.

273
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
Yeah.

274
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,260
That's like what Shane did for DDR ultra mix and that stuff.

275
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
You guys should fight.

276
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,940
Hey, he had some awesome steps back when, God, when I was trying to put that, uh, statement

277
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:52,980
in a cabinet in it, um, yes, once again, let's dredge up the bad memories of that thousand

278
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
dollars.

279
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,520
It costs me to buy the parts and everything for that machine, which they ended up not

280
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
doing anyways.

281
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,100
And all I want to do is be reimbursed a thousand dollars for those parts.

282
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,660
So they reimburse me and then they sent me tax forms.

283
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,460
And they charged me $300 in taxes.

284
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,460
What?

285
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,340
Yes, exactly.

286
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,140
Because it was like, I don't know.

287
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,140
It was stupid.

288
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
All right.

289
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,140
Stop making it about you.

290
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,620
I'm sorry, but no, but he had a, some pretty awesome, he had a, I forget what song it was

291
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,980
now, but he had some pretty awesome double step charts for that.

292
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
All right.

293
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Anyway, so, okay.

294
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,540
So you, you got more involved with, with even some of the game making and so forth.

295
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,220
But then how did you get into your first anime con?

296
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:39,660
Well, I did go to Fanime Con 2005 as my first con, but I think it was AOD 2006.

297
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,420
I just went like with a few friends of mine, but they couldn't make it to the next day.

298
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,460
So it was like, okay, I had to figure out a hotel place.

299
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,580
And some people found out that I actually did some game development and, but for those

300
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,380
who are part of the anime con scene in 2007, there were some people talking about some

301
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,580
issues behind the scenes that people were not aware of.

302
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,740
Whether the room where people stealing money or whatever, like I said, I don't know that

303
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,540
70 year old drama though, 70 year old drama.

304
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:12,300
But anyways, they probably drama at anime conventions, get out, get out, Jonas, get

305
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,300
out.

306
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,820
There's a lot of politics stuff, but there's some stuff I can't say, just fair enough.

307
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,820
Fair enough.

308
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,820
I understand.

309
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,780
I'm just saying like, they said, okay, this guy might be a future leader of certain things

310
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,860
because I guess I just brought on one random sack anime.

311
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,420
I brought my DDR, DDR pads, like a hard pads because they're running a DDR tournament,

312
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,980
but they're going to use soft pads.

313
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,500
Was it because you were the only sucker willing to do it then?

314
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,820
I just thought, okay, I paid a badge for a sack anime at one point.

315
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,980
And I thought, okay, the tournament is like, I have hard pads, we could just probably use

316
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,980
that possibly.

317
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
Oh, okay.

318
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,240
And then one successfully led to another.

319
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,940
And of course, since some people found that some people there actually competed in one

320
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,460
of our tournaments and then I guess the word got spread far that I did the game development.

321
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,540
They said, bring this guy in.

322
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,220
I was like, okay, I'll give this a shot and stuff.

323
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,540
So then this grew into something like, I'm assuming you were doing Fanime kind of regularly

324
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,460
and then you started dabbling in other conventions too?

325
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,680
Yes, we didn't start doing other conventions.

326
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:17,260
We didn't do some other conventions until 2009 where we got the gig with Fanime Con.

327
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,340
With numerous people, because some of the group members that joined in 2007 were also

328
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,440
friends of mine.

329
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,980
So we thought, okay, we could form a group and start just doing sack anime stuff.

330
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,900
And then in 2009, we grew into more than just sack anime, then Fanime Con, then all these

331
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,140
other people who want to run conventions, start-up conventions, or even GamerX just

332
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,140
contacted us.

333
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Like, you want to do game rooms?

334
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Like, sure.

335
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,780
Because you guys like now have this whole little organization, right?

336
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,780
Because you guys have a Facebook page, right?

337
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
Correct.

338
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
What's it called?

339
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,240
If people want to go check it out and like it and all that?

340
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:56,180
The name is The Big Anime Game Room, aka Teabagger.

341
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,500
So you're here representing teabaggers, all right, that's fair, all right.

342
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,920
You sound like my mother talking about politics.

343
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,380
Those teabaggers are at it again, Rob.

344
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,540
So gross, those teabaggers do.

345
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,540
I can't stand that woman in Alaska, she's so stupid.

346
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
Anyway.

347
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,460
Oh boy, the initials was unexpected, it just happened.

348
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
You're with teabaggers?

349
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,100
All right, fair enough.

350
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,300
Okay, so The Big Anime Game Room, which is teabaggers.

351
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,300
So how did the teabaggers, so you guys just get approached by different cons because you've

352
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,100
done a big one like Fatime and SacAnime, which is like SacAnime has gotten huge just in like

353
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
this, you know, six or seven years I've been kind of seeing it.

354
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,820
And so these other conventions, like you said, GamerX, they come to you now.

355
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
How do you set up for a convention like this?

356
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,220
How do you know like what games you're going to bring to a con?

357
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,220
Like is there a science to it, or is it just, this is what we have available, let's just

358
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,620
kind of throw it all out there, randomize things, or do you actually go like, because

359
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,620
I'm going to this convention, we should bring this, this, that we should make sure there's

360
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,220
DDR, we should, like, how do you kind of choose what goes to what convention?

361
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,060
We actually, it's not just a group of, again, by the way, it's not just a group of just

362
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,580
being random games.

363
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,480
Since based on like my background with the competitive scene and our staff members actually

364
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,400
have background with the competitive scene of Aether Weathers from Smash and other games,

365
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,280
we actually do some research, like, and analysis of human behavior to see what games people

366
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
like.

367
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,600
Like, at first, we didn't think like, for example, we didn't think like Just Dance would

368
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,360
be big, and Just Dance 3 had some songs that we actually liked.

369
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,940
So we give it a shot at an event called Yaoi Con and we didn't expect it to be that big.

370
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,400
And later on, the popularity of Just Dance and the conventions became much bigger than

371
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
we expected.

372
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,440
I wouldn't have thought that Just Dance was a huge convention game, but it makes sense.

373
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
It actually makes a lot of sense.

374
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,280
Aren't they, like, talking about adding Just Dance to, like, MLG or something like that?

375
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,240
I think, I think, I feel like we had a story like that not that long ago.

376
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Yeah.

377
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
It actually exists, so.

378
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Wow.

379
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
Okay.

380
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,340
Because of, um, Electronic Sports World Cup in Europe.

381
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,640
They're actually hosting a world championship right now.

382
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,660
So, okay, so you kind of have to keep a pulse on, like, what games, and you might not necessarily

383
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,780
be right that this game is going to be a huge thing at conventions.

384
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,420
Like, have you ever found that there's a game that you didn't bring, but somebody else brought

385
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,580
it, and, like, suddenly everybody's playing that, and you were like, shit, we didn't think

386
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,580
to bring that?

387
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,220
Um, that was, that was just, yeah, that was the story of Just Dance when, um, we didn't

388
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,700
know, she wasn't a staffer at the time, Patricia, um, she, they said, okay, let's bring Just,

389
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
she had the idea of Just Dance.

390
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,420
This is before she became part of the gaming group.

391
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,660
So we give, still we decided to give her the shot and see how it works, but it actually

392
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,140
turned out, we exceeded our expectations.

393
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Wow.

394
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Um.

395
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,540
And since we do, there was tournaments, we actually have suggestions of what people,

396
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,540
what people actually want.

397
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
I see.

398
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,380
It's like, you get through your Facebook page and stuff?

399
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Yeah.

400
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,340
From Facebook or emails too, like direct emails.

401
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,060
And I see your website's actually getting pimped in our chat room right now.

402
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,620
Dungeon Buster says the big anime game room, www.tbagr.org.

403
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,140
Fifth Dream says, just remember, teabagger orgy.

404
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,140
Yeah.

405
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,140
Perfect.

406
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,140
Teabagger orgy.

407
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,140
Boy, if we named the shows there, there would be right there.

408
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,340
Uh, that'll be Horde House this week.

409
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,500
Um, so, okay, uh, I want to get to the really good stuff.

410
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,780
So I, I, somebody's had to try to steal your shit before, right?

411
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,060
Have you ever had people try to steal your shit?

412
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,620
Yes, we had, we have, which this is why we had to increase our security purposes as well

413
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,420
as the community getting involved and to making sure that no one steals crap from the game

414
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:49,860
room because if somebody steals a agreement, it affects not just one con, but the entire

415
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,700
area and also ruins the trust between the community itself.

416
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,260
Do you ever like, I mean, this might be a really weird question, but I'm always curious

417
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,980
like kind of what makes people tick in that regard because I'm sure you've had to have

418
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,260
as the leader of this organization, you've probably had to have these awkward conversations

419
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,180
with people that have tried to steal shit.

420
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,400
And have you ever been able to figure out like, why, why do people, why do people try

421
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
to steal?

422
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,020
Is it just that they want a free game or do they, are they trying to hurt you guys hurt

423
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
the convention?

424
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,300
Are they addicted to stealing?

425
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Like, I don't even know if you have an answer for this.

426
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,860
I'm just kind of rambling, but what's the reason?

427
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,320
There's a lot of answers, but the direct answer is usually personal issues happening.

428
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,420
Some people, this is why we don't really discuss about drama and conventions, but some

429
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,120
people's like, oh, they didn't win a tournament, so they're going to try doing, whether it's

430
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,840
they didn't win a tournament, they think a certain price is too large.

431
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,880
Let's say they saw something in the dealer's room.

432
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Oh, it's too expensive for them to buy or, or they've never seen, they've never seen

433
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,620
a quote this game or so they want us to, you know, the intentions of stealing.

434
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,020
So it's acting out like a dog pees on the carpet to act out when the dog doesn't get

435
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
his way.

436
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,020
Correct.

437
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,020
That, that, that's okay.

438
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
Okay.

439
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
So that's okay.

440
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,020
So it's very animalistic.

441
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
What do these people do?

442
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,020
Yeah.

443
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,580
But we always track them down, make sure that it doesn't happen because, you know, because

444
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,500
it does more damage than actual trying to help.

445
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,960
Now going to the flip side of things and talking about something a little more positive, I'm

446
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,200
sure you guys get like some donations too, and people that like contribute as well to

447
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
what you guys are doing.

448
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,440
Do you ever get any like really cool, like, Oh my God, somebody's contributing like this

449
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,960
rare game import that everybody's going to want to play.

450
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,280
Do you ever kind of get that kind of stuff?

451
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,840
We get, we actually sometimes get that because I remember the first, let's, here's a good

452
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,400
example of like gamer X one where they got sponsorships from Microsoft and so, or an

453
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,960
EEA to get like battlefield copies to people who participate, who win the determines.

454
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,360
Because companies will fund it if you give them like the right reason to, for them to

455
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
come up with an approach.

456
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Okay.

457
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,760
And sometimes like some other groups or what we call proxy, like let's say I'm like orange,

458
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,640
like you're orange and orange and I'm like teabag or we can proxy each other to build

459
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,880
relationships or another group, like let's say mission star podcast at one conventions

460
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,800
where they wanted to do a raffle in the, in the game room.

461
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,880
It's like, well, let that happen.

462
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
See how things go.

463
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Okay.

464
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,280
So they bring not only new ideas, but it also gives us a more, a more better understanding

465
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
of what other communities do too.

466
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
We should look into that.

467
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,440
See if we can get some free games and get a little voice of geeks network and, and teabag

468
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
or magic going on here.

469
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,880
It'd be a lot of fun to look into that for the future.

470
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Okay.

471
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Very cool.

472
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,480
So you, you just wrapped up a gamer X two.

473
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
That's where we ran into each other.

474
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,560
How'd that convention go for you?

475
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Was it fun?

476
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
It was fun.

477
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,120
I know that a lot of the information has been posted online, whether it's from, from polygon

478
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,800
for those who have read and it's, but it's kind of unfortunate though for us.

479
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:58,840
That gamer X two is, is in hiatus right now based on the news that we've read, right?

480
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,040
Cause yeah, yeah, it's going to, that's a convention you don't get to do next year.

481
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,800
Maybe I don't know what actually we're going to touch on this a little later.

482
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,240
There's a very interesting, very interesting gamer X developments this week.

483
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,640
We're going to get into a little later, so I'll put that on hold a little bit, but, uh,

484
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,160
we don't know what's going to happen and it's going to be how I mean, but, but you're, you're,

485
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,980
you're a straight guy that, you know, and, and we heard a lot of these, these talks from

486
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,580
straight guys who went to gamer X that were pretty impressed with the convention that

487
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,420
they were just kind of like, yeah, it was cool.

488
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
It was really chill.

489
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,860
Did you kind of walk out of there with the same attitude?

490
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,260
Like this was different.

491
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,260
Of course.

492
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,460
I mean, like I said, Oh, sorry.

493
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,980
Um, like I mentioned to some of the people, this is going to be an article that's going

494
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,600
to be written soon that one of the biggest reasons why we wanted to try, um, gamer X

495
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,620
and gamer X two was to show that there's more to gaming than just like straight people as

496
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,300
well as for us, like get teabaggers and stuff.

497
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,660
We do not discriminate at all.

498
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:58,100
Well, if you're going to call yourself teabagger, you have to have a little bit of, you obviously

499
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,100
have a little bit of, you know, I, I don't, anyway, I, I, that's, that, no, that's great.

500
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
That's, that's fantastic.

501
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,540
I think that's the perfect attitude.

502
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,780
Because, um, even though we deal game room, sometimes, you know, the people that go to

503
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,940
all these events sometimes show some social inactivity or negative comments that even

504
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,240
though it doesn't hurt, even though it's not, we didn't have nothing to do with it,

505
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,460
it could affect us too.

506
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,140
If it's that person once said the, the, the forbidden words to other, right?

507
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,140
Like the T word or F word and the things that I get it, like somebody in your game room

508
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,940
says something, then that's not going to be posted on Facebook.

509
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,700
That such and such person said it's going to be, Oh, that game room at gamer X was so

510
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,380
awful because they used all these slurs type of thing that is not going to fall on the

511
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,300
individual who said it's going to fall on you.

512
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
It sucks.

513
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,700
So you have to kind of create an environment where that doesn't happen.

514
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Right?

515
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
Yeah.

516
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Yes.

517
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,580
Um, yeah, this is a one, one challenge that happened at gamer X too.

518
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,580
Yeah.

519
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,300
And this is something that was really hard to figure because we're, again, we're trying

520
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,980
to be, we're trying to figure out the behavior of like, what can we do to make people happy?

521
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
Right.

522
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,620
And one of the Just Dance tournaments, I guess this one person, I'll just say person, I can't,

523
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,420
I can't, it's hard for me to identify.

524
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,420
Right.

525
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,020
Um, some, like one of the attendees said, she said that, but the girl got, I mean, that

526
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,220
person got upset and said, is it she?

527
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
Okay.

528
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,220
So it was, it was misgendered.

529
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,220
The person was misgendered.

530
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,220
Correct.

531
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,220
Okay.

532
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Right.

533
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,840
Which is not the environment, like, you know, gamer X is trying to create an environment

534
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,620
where people can be who they, who they identify as and you know, who they, who they are.

535
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,820
So yeah, I can, I can, yeah, if somebody gets misgendered, that's a big no-no, especially

536
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
at a con like that.

537
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,820
Yeah.

538
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,300
But we did clear it up to her just to make sure she feels better over the matter.

539
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,460
It was just an unfortunate sight cause it, the Just Dance room was so, the tournament

540
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,220
was so big that everybody heard it like, and she heard it too, like right in front of a

541
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
bunch of people.

542
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,140
Um, hopefully, I don't know if, if they had one of those stickers, I know those helped

543
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
a lot.

544
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,240
Like when, you know, it's like, well, how do I, you know, what, what gender does this

545
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
person prefer?

546
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,420
Then you can, you know, you can see the sticker.

547
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,420
So yeah.

548
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,180
But I think at the end she was okay with it.

549
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,540
Like it was like, it was not done with ill intentions or anything like that.

550
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Okay.

551
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Okay.

552
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,620
So what, what about what's coming up?

553
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,340
You've got other conventions coming up, right?

554
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,620
You're doing, um, SacAnime, this coming, right?

555
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,980
Um, FYI, I know some people are wondering, what's the tournaments and stuff.

556
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,020
We will release the tournament list this week also.

557
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:30,420
And we're asking, we're going to make it a special announcement for additional PopRise.

558
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:37,340
If the, if two objectives actually follow, if, if people can bring, bring teabag to 500

559
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:43,880
likes or a certain post that to like like 50 likes on an actual post, we'll offer a

560
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,860
special bonus to a certain tournament.

561
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,640
So this is like a Kickstarter only you want people's social, social involvement, not their

562
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
money necessarily.

563
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,100
It's social involvement because with new games coming out, they want to see like the competition

564
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,260
still rise up while still teaching the people who are not in the competency to be competitive

565
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,980
and to enjoy the game at its fullest.

566
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,980
Okay.

567
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,980
All right.

568
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,580
So it's not just getting like 500,000 likes.

569
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Oh, and whore it out.

570
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,860
It's more like connect, connected to community.

571
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Yeah.

572
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,340
It helps you get a bigger voice when it comes to, um, you know, what, what do people want

573
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,140
to play and really see the cons and stuff.

574
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,740
It's a win, win all around.

575
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
Yeah.

576
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
Correct.

577
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
Cool.

578
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Uh, quickly, any other cons that you've got coming up?

579
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,340
I got to get into gaming news for the week, but, um, I know SacAnime is coming up.

580
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,140
Um, SnafuCon, the Reno event.

581
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,520
Oh, okay.

582
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,380
It's coming up soon in October.

583
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,620
One of our, one of our partners, crew members who brings like the old school games that

584
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,220
you bought, like the Sega Genesis and everything.

585
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,220
Yeah.

586
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,220
I know.

587
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,140
Cause I know you're playing, I saw you playing like Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic.

588
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,140
Yeah.

589
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,580
Uh, Jeremy from Koopa Club and I were throwing down on Sonic.

590
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,580
It was Sonic three.

591
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Yeah.

592
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,580
It was Sonic and Knuckles attached to Sonic three.

593
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,740
What was the only thing that was open that we could find because your game room was so

594
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
popular.

595
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,740
We couldn't.

596
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,740
So that happened to be open at the moment.

597
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
We were like, yeah, let's do this.

598
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,700
So we had a lot of fun playing that I had more fun cause I won.

599
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,700
Awesome.

600
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Yeah.

601
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,860
Um, yeah, I got to thank Abe who actually brought the equipment there and he was actually

602
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,980
the manager of the SnafuCon game room.

603
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,180
So it happens in October, so stay tuned for that.

604
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
All right.

605
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
Um, yeah.

606
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:23,380
And just one, um, to clarify things, if people don't see, if people don't see a game that

607
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,060
they want to play badly, just ask us.

608
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,800
Not all games can be shown because of the high demand that everybody wants to play every

609
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,300
game possible.

610
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,460
So you can always ask if we have this game and we'll assist you guys as much as possible.

611
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
All right.

612
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Very cool.

613
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Well, um, again, check them out on Facebook.

614
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,960
Uh, just, just remember teabagger, the big anime game room, because if they get to 500

615
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,260
likes, they're going to bring more prizes to SAK anime.

616
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,700
And even though you might not live in Sacramento, you might live somewhere in California or

617
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,200
hell Nevada, it sounds like in probably Oregon soon where these guys are going to be.

618
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,940
So, um, best of luck to you as your thing grows and grows, uh, your, your organization.

619
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,780
And um, yeah, uh, stick, stick with us and talk about the week in gaming.

620
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,780
All right.

621
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,060
What do you, uh, do you still play a lot of the new stuff?

622
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,700
I know the game rooms do a lot of classics for you play a lot of, do you play PlayStation

623
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,460
four, Xbox one, or what are you playing these days?

624
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,500
I have a PlayStation four, I've missed out on the destiny beta cause I was so busy with

625
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
them.

626
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
A lot of life stuff.

627
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,820
Oh no, you missed out and some other games and like in a more game business stuff, but

628
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,460
I've, I've, I've still, but we, I have a, we use still, so I play some games.

629
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
Nice.

630
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,660
Well, we'll get to your gaming week in a little bit here cause we're gonna get to how was

631
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,660
your gaming week.

632
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,980
No, I was just cause I went, you know, I had to go like the page cause I haven't liked

633
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,580
the page yet, but it does, it does bring up a one good question though.

634
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:47,020
Are you going to include a ball pit in future game room?

635
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,500
That was something that was suggested to us and well, there are a few things that we'll

636
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
say the word.

637
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,780
Maybe we can't guarantee anything about that.

638
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,460
I would call $17,000.

639
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,060
I feel if nothing else, what Dashcon brought to the world was that every convention will

640
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,780
be expected to have a ball pit now.

641
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,740
It's going to be a thing where every convention is asked, where's your ball pit?

642
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,060
I want my hour in the ball pit.

643
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,340
Have you already seen the people cosplaying the ball pit?

644
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,980
Oh yeah, I knew that would be a thing.

645
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,260
I knew that would be the, somebody, somebody like that same weekend, cause there were other,

646
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,620
obviously gamer X was going on.

647
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,340
I think there was another convention going on stream.

648
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,340
Not just that, some other stuff because I want to say, uh, uh, Rama or somebody had

649
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,860
posted a picture of somebody that was dressed as a PayPal account looking for $17,000.

650
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,500
Like that same weekend.

651
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,140
Like that's how fast the internet works.

652
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,140
People.

653
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,140
It's amazing.

654
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,140
All right.

655
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,100
Um, anyhow, let's, let's get into, uh, our gaming weeks, the types of video games that

656
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,740
we've been playing this week and we'll get into a week in gaming news as well.

657
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,220
Uh, let's start with you, dark soccer.

658
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,020
What types of video games you've been playing this week?

659
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Been playing some final fantasy 14, um, last weekend while I was sick, sick Dan, um, played

660
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,580
through and beat mega man X.

661
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
I saw your pictures on Facebook.

662
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,980
We had a couple hours to kill.

663
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
It was fun.

664
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,980
Yeah.

665
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:08,500
Um, I've been playing a little bit of bravely D fart.

666
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,940
Why do you call it that?

667
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,320
Just because I tried to say default the other day at work and I said, D fart.

668
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,300
So since then it's been bravely D fart.

669
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,300
Okay.

670
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,060
You know, that game's done very well for square Enix.

671
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,860
There was a report that came out this week or last or something that they, they've sold

672
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,100
a million of that game worldwide.

673
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Great.

674
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,780
Um, Dan and I are probably, we were talking about getting rid of some of our more expensive

675
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,700
stuff that we're not playing anymore.

676
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:41,340
Um, but he and I are actually playing on like a regular game night and he bought me a kingdom

677
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:51,020
hearts 1.5 HD remix, whatever for matching service.com edition.

678
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,100
So we're going to be starting that one together.

679
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,060
You'll probably finish it just in time for kingdom hearts 2.5, which is coming out.

680
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,180
Which he's ordered for me so I can get a pin.

681
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,180
Hooray.

682
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,180
That's the whole reason we got it.

683
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:05,660
So I could have a pin for my collection because pin trading, I love how you just like literally

684
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,100
within the same breath talked about, we're going to be getting rid of some of our stuff

685
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,180
cause we have a lot of stuff, but I got a pin and I bought this game cause I got a fucking

686
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
pin.

687
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:20,060
No, actually we're going to be getting rid of like a lot of our DVDs and seeing what

688
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,060
we can keep digital.

689
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:27,100
You know, basically trying to downsize because, um, as much as we love our games and love

690
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,300
our stuff, a person can only take up so much space responsibly, so that, and we want to

691
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,300
move.

692
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
Understandable.

693
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Understandable.

694
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,660
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

695
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,700
I played pretty much nothing.

696
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,380
The only thing I did get, I was hoping to be able to play a little bit more than nothing

697
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,220
because we had our like kind of work game conference thing.

698
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,420
I thought that was this week and you were hoping to place some new stuff.

699
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,500
Yeah, but we had a lot of no shows.

700
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,660
One of those being, uh, Tech Mccowie and they usually bring a demo, but they didn't have

701
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,660
anything.

702
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,740
So the only thing I got to actually see, didn't really play shame of like I got to see a trap

703
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,460
team, but, um, I don't know.

704
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,460
It's Skylanders.

705
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:16,780
I just don't give a shit about Skylanders and all I saw was like, they were like saying,

706
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,180
okay, yeah, see, look at these, these little trap crystals or whatever.

707
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:25,580
You put it in there and you get to, you know, you get to capture enemies and, and, but you

708
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,060
know, if you trap a different enemy with this, then that old enemy's gone.

709
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:35,260
So you need to buy as many as you can to be able to travel like, Oh, come the hell on.

710
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,420
Can you be any more obvious?

711
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,340
You know, it's like, seriously, let's just sell all this shit.

712
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,340
They'll buy it.

713
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,860
And it's like, come on me guys.

714
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,460
It's so obvious now.

715
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,700
But so that, that was really the only new game that I saw.

716
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,380
Um, they didn't even have like Ubisoft didn't have anything.

717
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,620
Um, you know, even sometimes they bring just dancers, sadly.

718
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,260
Do you think this is because with the news of your company being sold, they just are

719
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,860
kind of like, yes, because lame duck X, no, no, that's not why.

720
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,860
It's not why at all.

721
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,420
It's because the, the Ingram expo is the week prior.

722
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,500
Um, so there's a lot of reps already went off that.

723
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,340
Because of that, there's certain reps at these companies that call on Ingram and there's

724
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,260
certain reps of those companies that call on our company.

725
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,940
And so it was kind of that weird gray area, like, okay, well, is it this rep that's coming

726
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,860
out or is it this rep?

727
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:37,100
And so just a lot of them didn't come or, you know, I dunno, but I got to rep, you know,

728
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:42,660
for seven different companies because I was working the, they didn't show up booth.

729
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,220
Let me talk about all their games.

730
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:53,260
So like, you know, I got to do was as I was the rep for EA take to, um, Microsoft, Konami,

731
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,380
these companies realize that we're going to be repping them.

732
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,020
No, they weren't.

733
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,460
But thankfully Bethesda and Konami were super easy because they have nothing coming out

734
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,860
with the evil within Bethesda.

735
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,860
Yeah.

736
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:10,140
The evil within, and maybe the Ls girls online, Konami has soccer and there's the, um, there's

737
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,420
that don't call it team fortress three, but it's pretty much team fortress three game

738
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,900
that Bethesda has, but that's next year.

739
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,900
That's yeah, that's not this year at all.

740
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,980
I was only talking about stuff for the fourth quarter, but uh, yeah, so I got to do that

741
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
stuff and that was kind of fun.

742
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,180
I made my own trailer loop and everything and uh, there wasn't even a swag.

743
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,040
It was like, Oh, now there was swag.

744
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,740
It was giant fucking bags from Atlas.

745
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,280
Like these bags were ridiculous.

746
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,740
The mouse swag that would fit in those, they hit like they didn't even have a traditional

747
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,740
handle on them.

748
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,740
It was like a backpack.

749
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,100
You were wearing this big swag backpack thing.

750
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,100
All right.

751
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,100
So how's that?

752
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,180
I forgot one other, sure.

753
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,180
Sims two.

754
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,180
Oh, did you play, uh, they gave away the whole shebang.

755
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,180
Yeah.

756
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Yep.

757
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
I forgot to grab that.

758
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,180
I put all the dirty stuff back in my game too.

759
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
Did you?

760
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,180
Yeah, I did.

761
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,180
It works.

762
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
All right.

763
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:04,580
Um, but I'm building a compound that my character and her cat live in.

764
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,340
And what do they do in the compound?

765
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,340
I don't know yet.

766
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm still building the compound.

767
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,700
I spent more time building the house than I have actually playing the game.

768
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,700
So that's what happens.

769
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
I did.

770
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,220
I did download that just because it's free and I can't possibly pass up on it.

771
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,220
You know, free stuff.

772
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
I forgot.

773
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
But Alan grabbed it.

774
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,180
So I can always just use his login if I really had to play it, you know?

775
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Yeah.

776
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,580
The chat room is taking this fart thing away too.

777
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,580
Yeah.

778
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,580
What now?

779
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,900
Everybody's putting fart in the name of game titles because of what you did with bravely

780
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,900
to fart.

781
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Defart.

782
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,940
But, uh, farts a horizon says rage nator.

783
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
Mario fart.

784
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
He says so.

785
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,940
Act deaf.

786
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,860
I came out with final fart is fart ashy.

787
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,020
The fart of us act deaf.

788
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,020
Okay.

789
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,020
You guys like how are you?

790
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,020
My favorite.

791
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,460
How fucking old are we?

792
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,020
It's farting mama.

793
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,500
How fucking old are we chat?

794
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,740
And then I have never yelled at a chat room like this before.

795
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,100
This dream has brought it back to the news and linked to the article that says no fartings.

796
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,220
Smelling farts don't prevent cancer.

797
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,500
Grow up all of you.

798
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
All right.

799
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:15,780
So like, so like would that be like, for example, like kingdom farts toots point five.

800
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,780
All right.

801
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
I'm done.

802
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
I'm sucking.

803
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,780
Can't.

804
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
I can't.

805
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,980
Street far turn four.

806
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
I will.

807
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,540
I will bring those wasabi ginger chips out.

808
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
That's fine.

809
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,460
I'm not going to eat any of the end of you.

810
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
Rob.

811
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,460
Let it go.

812
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,460
Let it go.

813
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
All right.

814
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,460
Let's go to Jonas.

815
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
Our guest.

816
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,460
Let it blow.

817
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
Who can hopefully.

818
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,460
Tell me.

819
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,460
What?

820
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,460
What's up?

821
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,460
I think he's here.

822
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
Oh, your friend's here?

823
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,020
Well, do you want to give us quickly your gaming week?

824
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,860
Of course.

825
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,980
I'm technically playing three games competitively.

826
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,180
Just Dance 2014 because the World Cup Invitational.

827
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,860
Yeah, we'll let Jamie do our duty.

828
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,860
Go ahead.

829
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:10,100
Yeah, I'm competing on that, so I'm hopefully get the trip to Paris, France because the

830
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,420
top player's good to go to Paris, France with all expenses played.

831
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:23,540
Pump it at Fiesta 2 because of the United States Championships at Pacific Media Expo.

832
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,060
And of course, like everybody's doing is Mario Kart 8.

833
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,720
Yeah, I've been playing that competitively.

834
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,280
Won three tournaments and I'm undefeated in rounds so far, so I'm 10-0 and 3-0.

835
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Nice.

836
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
I bet.

837
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,280
Does the Mario Kart get pretty competitive at your game rooms?

838
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,600
In game or X2, it was big.

839
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Oh, yeah.

840
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,840
I guess it hasn't been out long enough for you to take it to a lot of cons, but game

841
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
rooms.

842
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Yeah.

843
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
Zack Enemy will be the biggest test to see how big it's going to be.

844
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
All right.

845
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Sounds like fun.

846
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,840
Sounds like fun.

847
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
All right.

848
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,680
Well, let me talk about my gaming week real quick and then we can introduce our guests

849
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,120
that just arrived.

850
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
My gaming week.

851
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,800
I played a lot of old standby stuff that I usually play, like Final Fantasy XIV stuff.

852
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,940
They did play a few new games.

853
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,040
Rogue Legacy on the PlayStation 4 just came out this past week, which I've played on the

854
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,520
PC before.

855
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,400
And obviously, I like the retro vibe this game has going on.

856
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,720
And it obviously recalls a lot of Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, but with the roguelike

857
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,680
twist of the fact that the castle randomizes every time you play the game.

858
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
And you get more...

859
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
It's Rogue Legacy.

860
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Jonas is like, what is this game?

861
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Rogue Legacy.

862
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
It's a PlayStation Network game.

863
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,440
And you can also get on PC, Steam.

864
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,560
And the game is hard as hell.

865
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,840
But the good news is that even when you die in the game, you don't die permanently because

866
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,940
your predecessor takes your place.

867
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,120
And all the gold that you collected, you can spend on upgrades.

868
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,420
But to get back in the castle, you'll have to give up all your change.

869
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,440
So whatever gold you don't spend on upgrades, you're going to lose.

870
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,480
So you want to buy things every time and it'll help you make your character a little more

871
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,200
stronger, a little more stronger, a little more stronger, until you can take on the boss

872
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,080
characters and go into the other areas.

873
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,120
And the other big twist in Rogue Legacy, your descendants all have issues.

874
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,360
Most of them have issues.

875
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
And that could be anything for...

876
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,360
I say issues very, very liberally, because some of them will just say they're gay, which

877
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,600
obviously isn't an issue, but it's just like that will change the ending if you happen

878
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,420
to beat it with a gay...

879
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,580
Not to be a spoiler, but that'll be something.

880
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,200
Some of them do crazy shit, like this person is colorblind, so the whole screen is black

881
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
and white when you play.

882
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,040
Or this person has vertigo, so everything is upside down.

883
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,840
Or this person tends to exaggerate, so whenever they take damage, the damage meter shows like

884
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,760
five billion is the damage they took, even though it was only like 24.

885
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,280
So some of them are really silly, but some of them really will screw with your gameplay.

886
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,320
Some of them are tinier, this person has dwarfism, or this person has gigantism, or this person

887
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,840
has ADHD, so they run really fast.

888
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Or just other things like that.

889
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,320
Or this person has irritable bowel syndrome, so they make little fart noises when they

890
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,560
jump, like your little jokes in chat, right?

891
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,280
Like little silly things like that.

892
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,640
But it adds a different cool little layer to the game, the fact that it's not always

893
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,080
the same person you're running through the castle with.

894
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,880
So yeah, if you like the retro games, if you like Symphony of the Night or Roguelikes,

895
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,080
I think Roguelikes is really cool, and it's only like 15 bucks, it's worth checking out.

896
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:21,840
Speaking of roguelikes, this one just hit Steam this week in a pre-alpha, what do they

897
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,680
call it on Steam, first look?

898
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
Early Access.

899
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,800
Early Access, that's it.

900
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,720
So on Steam Early Access, and I got it specifically because we have a chatter who's called into

901
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,320
the show to talk about this game before, and I've heard a lot about this on Twitter, I

902
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,720
checked out Crypt of the Necrodancer on Steam Early Access because it just came out, which

903
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,320
is also a roguelike, meaning it has randomly generated dungeons and items that you find,

904
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,880
but here's the catch.

905
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,360
It's a music game.

906
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:52,680
So, as you play, you have to move with the beats of the music, because if you don't,

907
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,560
your character will get frozen, or you won't do the moves that you want to do.

908
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,160
And it's really funny because as you do it more and more in time, then the rooms start

909
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,640
lighting up like it's a disco and this stuff.

910
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,840
So what I find that it does is it forces you to think fast, because you have to move in

911
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,720
time with the music, you don't have time to think about, am I gonna go left or right,

912
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,460
or have I been down here, have I been by here, because you need to already be pushing the

913
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,060
button in time with the music.

914
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:23,940
So it turns Rogue into an action game, which is kind of a really cool twist on the formula.

915
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,700
And the fact that it's a music game, right?

916
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,940
Yeah, and you can load your own music, but the music that comes with the game is actually

917
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
really good.

918
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,940
But you can load your own MP3s if you want.

919
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
Ooh, question for this.

920
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,840
Here's a funny question.

921
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,520
Is the bar or the chair included?

922
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,920
There is no bar that I've seen yet, but there is a variety of weapons, there's like a shovel

923
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,880
and stuff, so maybe there's a hidden joke in there somewhere.

924
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,040
I don't know if the developers played DDR a lot and really like understood the scene

925
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,960
or what have you, but yeah, that would be funny.

926
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,080
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

927
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,240
Some people talking about Rogue Legacy still.

928
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,320
Act Def says, Rogue Legacy is awesome, one of my favorite games from last year.

929
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:08,740
I like the symbolism in being gay from Rogue Legacy, it changes nothing at all.

930
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,640
Let's see, and Fifth Dream says, NecroDancer is amazing.

931
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,560
The soundtrack is great too.

932
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,080
So there you go, some of our comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

933
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,880
So yeah, I had fun playing around with Krypton the NecroDancer and I see why, I think it

934
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,400
was as I shared with Matt that had called in about the game before him, but I'm positive

935
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,080
it was him, why he really was into this, especially as a music game fan.

936
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,240
And I like the roguelikes.

937
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,320
I'm starting to think the genre is a little bit, like every game wants to be a roguelike

938
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,980
now, so I think it's starting to thin a little bit, but I think this was a really refreshing

939
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,880
twist on that idea.

940
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,240
So four for you, Krypton the NecroDancer, you go.

941
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,960
And then lastly, okay, I have to bring this up.

942
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,040
So I tried a new game this week, and the game I tried this week, I felt obligated to at

943
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,320
least try it, because I can't hate on a game until I've played it for myself.

944
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,640
Like I'm not gonna be that cynical bastard on the internet that hates something based

945
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,320
on principle, unless it's Fifty Shades of Grey, I mean let's be real, everybody fucking

946
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
hates that.

947
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,360
Oh, you mean Fifty Shades of Abuse?

948
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
Fifty Shades of...

949
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
Nope!

950
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Yeah, that's what I was calling it.

951
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:17,720
Anyway, all kidding aside, I played Kim Kardashian Hollywood, which is the most popular iPhone

952
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
game right now.

953
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,800
Stop, you are giving me judgy stares.

954
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Stop it.

955
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,440
It is the number one game on iPhone right now, and I want to know how is this game making

956
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,040
$700,000 a day?

957
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,780
They're saying $700,000 a day.

958
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,240
So here's the question you might be wondering whether you want to admit it or not.

959
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,400
Is this game really good?

960
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,480
And the answer is no, it's not good.

961
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,240
But it's not as bad as you probably think.

962
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,900
It's more like a Facebook game to me, it's a lot like a Facebook game, it reminded me

963
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,480
a lot of that Sims Facebook game they had, where you have to spend energy to do certain

964
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,840
tasks, and I appreciate that the game has some tongue-in-cheek humor in it.

965
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,480
Like I don't think the game takes itself too seriously.

966
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:06,000
Like I had a guy, okay so like the characters in the games will like write tweets, and tweets

967
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,600
that mention you will get you more fans, which helps you move up on the A-list or whatever.

968
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,740
But like, okay so there's this character I got into a fight with earlier in the game,

969
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:20,160
and he decided to write a tweet about me, and what he put in the tweet, he said, a nobody

970
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,780
ruins the party and I get kicked out?

971
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:30,720
How does Rob even know Kim Kardashian, total conspiracy, hashtag Illuminati, hashtag Obamacare?

972
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,160
And that made me laugh.

973
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,280
And that was the little touch that I was like, alright, so this game kinda knows its place,

974
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,360
like it's not that serious.

975
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:46,160
So if you want a game that's just gonna make you laugh for five minutes, it's free, don't

976
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,520
spend money on it, but at the same time there's really not much of a game here.

977
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,640
It's go to this location and pose for all these pictures by clicking this bar and spending

978
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,640
your energy.

979
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,560
Like it's a really, like game is a really loose term with this.

980
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,840
Like Flappy Bird was more of a fucking game than this is, okay?

981
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,000
Flappy Bird at least, you know, yeah, you had to flap and you had to dodge and there

982
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,080
was some skill involved, believe it or not, but there's no skill involved in Kim Kardashian

983
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,720
Hollywood, there's none.

984
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:18,840
But it's, if you read tmz.com and that type of trash, then you know what, you're probably

985
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,680
gonna appreciate some of the trash in this game too, and that's probably why it's doing

986
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,900
so popular.

987
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,900
So there it is.

988
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:31,960
Let's see, looking at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Blender says, can't believe

989
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,000
Skye passed up The Last of Us for this game.

990
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,640
All right, here's the problem, Blender, Last of Us, $50, Kim Kardashian, free, Last of

991
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,680
Us, trip to Target or wherever, Kim Kardashian, press button and download on my phone, which

992
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
I guess.

993
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,680
Now, now.

994
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
Press button, download on Steam.

995
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,240
Yeah, I know I could download it on PlayStation 4, but still, still, I didn't want to spend

996
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,480
all that money right now.

997
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,520
I will get to The Last of Us eventually, I promise.

998
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:08,000
For science people, I did it for science because it's the number one game and I felt an obligation.

999
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,320
You did it for the Aperture Science reason.

1000
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,320
Because we can.

1001
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,600
Because you can.

1002
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,120
Because I was promised cake if I beat the game and I've yet to receive my cake.

1003
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,840
And you ended up being baked instead.

1004
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,320
But Dark Sakura did bring me tortilla chips, which I think we actually brought up there.

1005
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,840
And a Mexican soda, which is good.

1006
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,440
I did, made with actual sugar and not HFCs.

1007
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,040
By the way, apparently donuts are now called sugar bagels.

1008
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,120
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com is suggesting VoG Network Hollywood.

1009
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,520
Oh, I love the idea.

1010
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,520
I love the idea.

1011
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,520
But it shouldn't be VoG Network Hollywood.

1012
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,360
It should be like VoG Network Fresno.

1013
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,120
We should call it VoG-ywood.

1014
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
VoG-ywood.

1015
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,120
VoG-ywood.

1016
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,120
All right.

1017
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,040
Before we get to more, we have, we're going to get to gaming news and so forth.

1018
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,400
But Jonas, you invited a buddy of yours to come out to the show tonight.

1019
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,600
Why don't you, why don't you introduce who you brought to the studio?

1020
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,200
This is Diego, the second head of the teabaggers.

1021
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,200
Okay.

1022
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,200
There you go, Diego.

1023
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Give Diego the mic.

1024
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,200
Hi, Diego.

1025
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,200
How are you?

1026
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,200
Good.

1027
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,200
How are you doing?

1028
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,200
Hi, good.

1029
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,200
We've never met.

1030
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,200
I'm Rob.

1031
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,200
Hi, Rob.

1032
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,200
We're doing a show.

1033
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,200
That's Jamie.

1034
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,200
That's Matt.

1035
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,200
Hi, Jamie.

1036
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
How you doing?

1037
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,200
How did you meet Jonas?

1038
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,200
I met Jonas.

1039
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,200
Well, actually technically we met, we could have met at Paradise Island tournament back

1040
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
in the day when they were still around.

1041
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
And we had a tournament in Sacramento.

1042
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Right.

1043
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Okay.

1044
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,480
So maybe, maybe we have crossed paths back in the day or whatever, one of those tournaments.

1045
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,480
Give or take, I'd say that we must've just like literally crossed paths and just didn't

1046
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,960
know there were multiple tournaments that were going on that time at the Paradise Island

1047
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,000
that was across from the Arden Fair Mall.

1048
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah.

1049
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Oh yeah.

1050
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I remember Paradise Island.

1051
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,200
And me and my other friends went there for a Smash Brothers Melee tournament while he

1052
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,760
was hosting a DDR tournament at the same time in the other parts of the room.

1053
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:57,680
So, but we officially got reacquainted back in 2007, January psych anime, where he just

1054
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,240
got into staffing and I just became a volunteer and then later upgraded to staff.

1055
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,000
And that's when we were part of the same exact department of gaming.

1056
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
There you go.

1057
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,040
Now, do you travel to all the conventions like Jonas does or?

1058
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,040
Yes.

1059
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,040
I'm pretty much right behind him.

1060
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,040
100%.

1061
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,040
So you were at Gamer X a couple of weeks ago?

1062
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,040
Yes, I was.

1063
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,040
How was that?

1064
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,040
How did you have a good time?

1065
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,040
Wonderful.

1066
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,520
I wish I would've gone to the first one, but it was complications with getting time off

1067
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,520
at that time.

1068
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,520
Sure.

1069
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
I heard the first one was a blast.

1070
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,920
The second one, which was my first one, was amazing.

1071
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,400
I wish we could have had a bigger room.

1072
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,400
Yeah.

1073
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,480
That was pretty much like cutting our legs off a little bit because we didn't get to

1074
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,680
use over 50% of our equipment and we didn't want to cause any fire hazards or have the

1075
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,480
fire marshal come in and notice because regardless of what we did, it was pretty packed, but

1076
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,480
it was still fun.

1077
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,480
It was definitely fun.

1078
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
Yeah.

1079
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,440
The way they did it at Gamer X this year was different too because they had that, you know,

1080
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,000
you guys unfortunately had like a pretty small room, but that's because they had other

1081
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,920
rooms where they were showing other types of games, like they had the Ouya games, they

1082
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,620
had the, you know, the sponsor games, but I say sponsor games, but yet they were showing

1083
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,360
off indie games, which was pretty awesome because there was a lot of good stuff over

1084
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,360
there.

1085
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,360
It was good for what it was.

1086
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:09,760
They had an entire room dedicated for Pokemon on the DS, which was amazing and as odd as

1087
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,240
it sounds for some people, but it's still very popular Pokemon today, even with the

1088
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:20,200
new game coming up, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and that's going to be pretty big

1089
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,880
because it just all of a sudden jumped up to fame again after when it first debuted

1090
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,720
back when the anime came out in the game in 97 or something.

1091
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,640
Pokemon does so crazy well, it really blows my mind, like how really obsessed with those

1092
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,640
games people get.

1093
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,960
My roommate's one of them.

1094
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,960
It's gotten very deep.

1095
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Yeah.

1096
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,960
What do you play?

1097
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,760
What types of games, like what brought you, what games do you love that made you want

1098
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,480
to do this Game Room stuff?

1099
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,760
Well, when I first started actually taking games seriously back in the day, I was more

1100
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,760
into Smash Brothers.

1101
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,040
I'd say for a while that was my game because I got into the community and in getting into

1102
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,120
the community, that's when I pretty much was getting closer to Jonas as it is.

1103
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,760
I didn't know his reputation on DDR in the past, what he's done.

1104
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,600
As much as I had my reputation, although my group of people were not the best at it, we

1105
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,760
were more of the comedy group of doing that.

1106
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,720
So we made our stuff known as of just doing, we also did our own little videos.

1107
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,120
We had a group called Teamscape and we did our own little videos and it's just nothing

1108
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,120
to be taken seriously.

1109
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,320
It's just to listen to our corny jokes and such, but we actually just traveled around

1110
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,840
and met the high round players.

1111
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,960
I also do a little bit of Street Fighter, fighter games all around, first person shooters.

1112
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,400
I'm very versatile with video games and I like it.

1113
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,940
Okay, very cool.

1114
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:34,000
So are you excited for the new Smash Brothers that's coming?

1115
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Definitely, yes.

1116
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
On 3DS?

1117
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Yes, yes, definitely.

1118
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,400
Are you as pissed as I am that they still haven't revealed Ness as a character?

1119
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,680
I'm pretty anxious to see what's going on with all that stuff.

1120
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,360
Alright, because that's the one thing where I saw this great picture on Tumblr last week

1121
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,320
where it says, it's just a big picture of Ness and it says, I've got that summertime,

1122
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:59,880
summertime sadness because he still hasn't been announced as a character.

1123
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,920
Oh right, I know, and he's been in all the games.

1124
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,920
Yeah, he's a mainstay, but it's like how much do you freaking hate the Mother series, Nintendo?

1125
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,920
It's amazing.

1126
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,920
But it's like Nintendo just kicks it in the face every chance they get.

1127
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,400
They just don't see good games with good characters in them.

1128
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,280
They just don't understand Mother or online.

1129
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,320
Fair enough, fair enough.

1130
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,640
So what do people, we asked Jonas this a little bit, but from your perspective, what do people

1131
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,120
have to look forward to at SacAnime from the teabaggers?

1132
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:33,760
We are, we're always having different versions of games and such, we go from retro to the

1133
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:40,280
latest console games that we have up to date, PS4 and Xbox One, Putting in Killer Instinct,

1134
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,680
which has already been showed off through us.

1135
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:48,120
We are hosting a pretty big event on Saturday night where they're allowing us to rent out

1136
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,280
the rooms at the bottom where the pre-registration is.

1137
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,400
And for that night, that Saturday night, we're going to do a couple of tournaments there

1138
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,840
for the main events.

1139
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,760
And one of the big ones will be definitely Mario Kart 8.

1140
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,180
Oh nice, alright.

1141
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,260
So yeah, because Mario Kart 8 hasn't been out, we were just mentioning it hasn't been

1142
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,220
out long enough to really be at every single con yet, so this will be kind of probably

1143
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,340
at the first big, big, big tournament for it.

1144
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,340
It'll be fun.

1145
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,700
I've dabbled with it a little bit, including at GamerX, and it is a fun game.

1146
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,380
It is definitely a fun game.

1147
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,060
People are liking it a lot.

1148
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,140
And what we want to do after seeing examples through other conventions that have done it

1149
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,700
a little bit, like we said, it hasn't been gone all the way around yet on certain conventions

1150
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,780
or places, is we're going to try and make it a really big event, fill up this room,

1151
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,900
get the crowd hyped, and livestream it.

1152
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,900
Nice.

1153
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,780
I'm going to ask you a crazy question, because I asked Jonas a crazy question about like

1154
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,580
people that steal shit.

1155
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,660
So I'll ask you this, and I don't even know if this is something that happens or not,

1156
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,420
but have you ever seen a fight break out in your game room?

1157
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,660
I've heard.

1158
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,660
You've heard?

1159
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,660
I've heard.

1160
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,700
Alright, well tell us second hand what happened.

1161
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:56,140
I've heard of little things, but it was a, I guess it didn't escalate that much, but

1162
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:02,300
there have been cases of like maybe a splashing of water on something, but other than that,

1163
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,500
that was probably like personal business between two people, but it was squashed very quickly,

1164
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,980
it was taken out of the game room.

1165
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,540
Okay, that's good.

1166
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,980
Nothing escalated to draw a riot or something, which would have been really bad, because

1167
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,860
we've had tie quarters a couple of times.

1168
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,860
Yeah, yeah.

1169
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,380
Well I was just curious, like if somebody gets way into the game and they're just like,

1170
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,340
you know, like, you're a fucking cheater, da da da, and just like, you know, just try

1171
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,700
to throw a punch or something.

1172
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,620
Well, besides punching and all that, which usually doesn't seem, but as saying you're

1173
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,660
a cheater and getting mad at a game, that's every day for a gamer.

1174
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,660
That is true.

1175
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,340
They get mad at every game.

1176
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,060
Like I remember just playing Mega Man back in the day.

1177
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,060
That almost ruined my childhood.

1178
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:43,020
Like, oh my God, I can remember Mega Man 2, yeah, that really was giving me some early

1179
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,020
gray hairs.

1180
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:49,300
I was trying to get through like quick man stage, oh Jesus Christ, that just, oh wow.

1181
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,460
Yeah that, like examples of that, of a frustration, I can see someone's frustration and practically

1182
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:58,620
making me myself, like getting frustrated at such a game that I want to throw the controller

1183
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,040
right at the damn TV.

1184
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,580
Which is why nobody buys a Wii U, because those controllers are, you don't want to throw

1185
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,580
those.

1186
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,580
Right, exactly.

1187
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,580
It's very bad, very bad idea.

1188
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,580
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1189
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,580
All right.

1190
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,580
Well, Diego, stay with us.

1191
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,340
That's why they make those like Nerf armor things for us.

1192
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,340
Oh yeah, right?

1193
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,340
Right?

1194
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,500
Nerf is Nerf or nothing.

1195
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,260
Stay with us, we're running a little long tonight, but we're going to get to some gaming

1196
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,260
news.

1197
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,900
Feel free to comment on any news you want to, and good luck with SacAnime and everything

1198
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,900
you have coming up.

1199
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,900
It's a pleasure to be here, yeah.

1200
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,900
Yeah, fantastic.

1201
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,900
Good.

1202
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,900
Glad to have you here.

1203
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,900
You missed us earlier, unfortunately.

1204
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,860
We're reminiscing about the good days of DDR and all that stuff, so unfortunately you missed

1205
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,860
all that fun stuff, but.

1206
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,700
I would just say that actually I don't have a history on DDR.

1207
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,860
Oh, I thought, oh, because of Paradise Island and all this stuff, I thought you did.

1208
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:44,020
No, actually that's definitely a rhythm music game that I've never really gotten into, sadly.

1209
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,060
I love watching it, but I'm not into that game.

1210
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,980
All right, well then you didn't miss shit, all right.

1211
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,300
We need to get into some gaming news though, we're running a little long.

1212
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,740
So I do want to keep things moving.

1213
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,300
Really quick, some housekeeping.

1214
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,460
Be sure to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and we're on Facebook as well,

1215
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,440
facebook.com slash OrangeLunchRadio.

1216
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,800
We will still be here every week with new shows, but Labor Day weekend, we will not

1217
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,940
be here.

1218
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,860
There's just a whole lot going on that weekend.

1219
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:12,260
Obviously we've got SacAnime, right, and Dark Soccer is going to be going over to SacAnime.

1220
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,180
I'm actually at DragonCon in Atlanta, so for those of you guys out there who are going

1221
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,700
to be at DragonCon in Atlanta, don't forget Voice Geeks Network.

1222
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,520
Going to be showing up on a few panels throughout the weekend, most notably Monday morning.

1223
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,640
There will be a VOG Network panel.

1224
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,840
More details on that as the date gets closer.

1225
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,160
But because of all the shenanigans, Labor Day weekend, and I'm sure you guys have your

1226
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,440
own things you participate in too out there in the listening world, we will have no show

1227
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,700
live that Sunday.

1228
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:40,400
So just be prepared for that, those of you guys that rely on us to get through your Monday

1229
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,400
work day.

1230
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,000
But the good news is, it's Labor Day weekend.

1231
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,160
There is no Monday work day, woohoo.

1232
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,520
All right, let's get into some gaming news and let's talk about it.

1233
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,520
It's been a bit of a slower week, but as I was mentioning during Bobby's show, there's

1234
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,600
a few big tent poles, big, big things going on, right, Loki?

1235
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,460
Yes, one of those being EA's Access program.

1236
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,120
It's kind of an expansion on what they used to do before, I forget what they, I think

1237
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,640
they actually called their last program like Early Access or something, where they used

1238
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:13,800
to give you early access to like different games right before they came out.

1239
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,320
Like I remember one of the titles that they were advertising was like Madden, where you

1240
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,400
could play it five days before there was street data on it, but you'd have to pay a

1241
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,360
fee and then at the street data, that's when it deactivates.

1242
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,080
So it's like, oh, you get hyped about this game and you get to play it before it comes

1243
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,360
out and that kind of stuff.

1244
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,140
But now this new thing is a little bit different.

1245
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:38,400
It's actually gonna give you access on the Xbox One to the back catalog of EA games,

1246
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,200
which on the Xbox One isn't that deep right now.

1247
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,360
It's just a couple games.

1248
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:49,040
But five bucks per month or $30 per year, which seems pretty reasonable, it gets you

1249
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:55,540
access to right now Battlefield 4, Pagle 2, FIFA 14, and Madden 25.

1250
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:00,920
And then it says apparently they're gonna be adding to the game's selection as time

1251
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,920
goes on.

1252
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:08,520
Also, it's gonna give you 10% discounts off of all EA digital Xbox One content.

1253
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:15,580
And they're saying that you're gonna get access to EA, big EA releases up to five days

1254
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,040
prior to their official debut, much like they were doing before.

1255
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,480
So a little bit, kind of an update on that.

1256
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:29,760
And then also one of the, I guess, a limited trial game, they're saying early access to

1257
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,820
some of this.

1258
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,800
One of the games that's not available, I guess, is Titanfall.

1259
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,320
It's excluded from all EA access features.

1260
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,520
So that's kind of weird.

1261
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:45,920
They did say, though, that Xbox Live Gold is not required to participate in this.

1262
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,500
But of course, if you wanna play online, then yes, you do need Xbox Live Gold.

1263
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,680
But as of right now, it's only on Xbox One.

1264
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:58,120
And apparently Sony was saying, okay, they were offered this as well, but they didn't

1265
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:04,000
think it was a good value for the consumer, which, let's be honest, that's just kind of

1266
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,480
a bunch of bullshit.

1267
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:10,400
It's more of, hey, they were offering a service that had, I mean, a couple of things.

1268
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,200
I could see the positives and negatives, but I think the negative for them was, hey, we've

1269
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,960
got this PlayStation Now service that we're trying to get people to buy four hours of

1270
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:26,800
gameplay for $4 or whatever, and we don't want some of the paid $5 to get access to

1271
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
multiple games.

1272
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
Or even PlayStation Plus.

1273
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,120
I didn't even really consider the PlayStation Now, I just thought that it was more competitive

1274
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,120
for PlayStation Plus.

1275
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,080
Although to be fair, Games for Gold or whatever does the same thing now.

1276
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,600
And PlayStation Plus also, they probably don't want the set president with, oh hey, we're

1277
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,740
gonna have all these different publishers offering these free trials for $5 for back

1278
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,740
catalog tiles and stuff.

1279
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,560
But you know, to be honest, I don't see the problem with it.

1280
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:57,280
I think it would be a good idea to offer this stuff, and everybody wants, like with cable

1281
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,620
and stuff, they want all the cart stuff.

1282
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,500
And that's kind of the problem where the consumers are gonna start to, I think, lose

1283
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,860
a little bit, is it really reminds me of when Warner Brothers pulled all their movies from

1284
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:11,360
Netflix because they wanted to do their own service.

1285
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,700
And you can guarantee, I'll guarantee you, you'll never see an EA game for free on PlayStation

1286
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,700
Plus again.

1287
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,340
Which, I don't think we've even seen.

1288
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:21,660
Wasn't Mass Effect 3 a game at one point?

1289
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,820
I think it was at one point, Mass Effect 3 was something.

1290
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:27,700
But yeah, EA does, I don't know, but yeah, I would imagine that you're not gonna see

1291
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,340
any of these games free on any of these services.

1292
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:34,180
I just, it's really not worth it, to be honest.

1293
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:38,860
Now, well yeah, and for me, I'm not a huge sports games fan, so right there, that eliminates

1294
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,580
half the titles.

1295
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:46,060
And so it's just, okay, Pagel 2, which I don't need to play that for free, and Battlefield

1296
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,880
4, which, let's be honest, we're getting to almost that game being out for a year now.

1297
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,440
It's gonna drop in price eventually, or hell, if I haven't played it by now, I can rent

1298
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,100
it or buy it used or something like that.

1299
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,000
And they're thinking maybe that because it's $30 a year or something, that's gonna cut

1300
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,920
in the used game sales, maybe so that people are less likely to want to buy used games

1301
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,880
from EA or something, I don't know.

1302
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:14,160
It might be worth it if there was a richer back catalog, especially, and it is kind of

1303
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:19,200
a bummer it didn't work out with Sony, because maybe via PlayStation Now you could get access

1304
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:25,360
to EA's entire PlayStation 1, 2, and 3 back catalog, which would be pretty fucking impressive.

1305
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,240
Or it might be way more worth it.

1306
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,820
Or even like on the Xbox 360, it would have been nice to be able to play like SSX or,

1307
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:38,640
you know, anything like Battlefield 2 or, I don't know, they have a lot of the Mass

1308
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,880
Effect games, you know, all that stuff.

1309
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,880
That would have been worth it.

1310
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,880
Dragon Age.

1311
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,160
Yeah, that would have been more worth it to me, but right now, I mean, just play Madden

1312
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:54,120
or FIFA, which I don't give a shit about, or Battlefield 4 and Pagel.

1313
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,400
I mean, it's like, fuck, Pagel is pretty cheap anyways, and why would I, it just doesn't

1314
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,400
seem worth it right now.

1315
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,740
So obviously this is in the hands of consumers.

1316
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:04,200
If you like it, get it.

1317
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,640
If you don't like it, don't get it, you know, and that's ultimately how well this does will

1318
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,420
have a huge impact, but the only precedent that could be set here is that if it works

1319
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:21,100
for EA, then Ubisoft's gonna want one, Activision's gonna want one, and let's remember, let's

1320
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:26,180
flash back a little bit, it wasn't that long ago that EA came up with a crazy idea to do

1321
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:31,460
these online passes, because they think that you should pay extra money for your used games,

1322
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:35,220
because they have to run those servers and stuff, and there's gonna be somehow more people

1323
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,940
on the servers with the same amount of games.

1324
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,740
And so this is kind of along the lines of that.

1325
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:45,220
So if this works out for EA, Ubisoft's probably gonna jump in and do this kind of thing, and

1326
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:49,780
I'm trying to think of who also had online passes, Deep Silver maybe, I don't know, but

1327
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:53,460
THQ used to do that, Deep Silver's kind of got rid of that stuff.

1328
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:58,780
I'm going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, as a person who buys an EA

1329
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,100
sports game every year, NHL, I don't really have a need for this service.

1330
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,500
I sadly still own all the previous NHL games for, if I ever wanted to play it, many of

1331
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,180
the free games they're offering.

1332
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:12,540
I don't, I also never really jumped on the early access ploy because I work so much and

1333
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:16,540
I don't really have time to play things day of or morning of anymore, but for the person

1334
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,220
who has time to, I can see it being worth it.

1335
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,140
But ultimately the catalog is small right now.

1336
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,340
I'm sure they will expand it.

1337
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:29,500
If it was take two though, a rockstar game, I'd probably have to do that.

1338
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:34,980
I just, it's, it's going to be very difficult if everybody wants to do their own.

1339
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,620
That's why I kind of like that PlayStation has kind of their own PlayStation plus and

1340
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:44,180
you know, Xbox has their games for gold, but I also understand where maybe the publishers,

1341
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,180
they want their own piece of the pie.

1342
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:51,620
So we have to kind of find that happy medium somewhere, you know, like how can publishers

1343
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:55,860
get the amount that they feel they're entitled to, but yet the consumers don't get screwed

1344
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:58,980
with having to subscribe to all these different services because everybody will lose in that

1345
01:03:58,980 --> 01:03:59,980
scenario.

1346
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:06,300
Honestly, I mean, if I, if you're looking to, maybe if you're looking to purchase one

1347
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,580
of these titles, like say you were interested in buying battlefield four, then yeah, maybe

1348
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:15,300
it's worth it to do this because you're going to get it for probably cheaper than battlefield

1349
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,540
four sold for right now.

1350
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:20,420
And then you get access to some more games for like at least a year.

1351
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,780
So it might be worth it to try that.

1352
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:25,180
Um, I don't know.

1353
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,820
It's not that much of an investment, but yeah, I don't like the precedent that it's, that's

1354
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:34,020
because, uh, they whore the crap out of their games with like, you know, DLC and stuff.

1355
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,100
And so I, I don't know.

1356
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,100
All right.

1357
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,460
Well, uh, very curious to see what you guys think of this.

1358
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,060
I wouldn't know if anybody actually signed up for the program because this is available

1359
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:43,060
now.

1360
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,060
Right.

1361
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,060
So you can actually sign up for it now.

1362
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,820
Yeah.

1363
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,820
I want to know if anybody's actually, uh, got in on this.

1364
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:52,020
So let us know in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com or you can always email us participate at orange

1365
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,860
lounge, radio.com.

1366
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:57,140
Moving on to another story that came out this week, um, about a convention we've been talking

1367
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,140
an awful lot about.

1368
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,220
Um, just, you know, cause dark soccer and I went a couple of weeks ago, had a panel

1369
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,220
there.

1370
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,360
Uh, we're just talking about it with Jonas and Diego a little bit of a go, but gamer

1371
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:09,100
X to, um, a little bit of fallout from that convention, unfortunately that, uh, was, was

1372
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,900
a little bit of drama this week, but I have to mention it cause it was kind of big news.

1373
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:18,380
Um, NIS America reached out to founder Matt Kahn to basically say, sorry, but that pledge

1374
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:22,380
of $3,000 that we'd promised you for the con, we're not going to be able to give it to you.

1375
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,740
Um, through, you know, I, I don't want to get too much into the details because the

1376
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:34,140
epilogue to this is they work their shit out, but, uh, it still was, it was pretty big deal

1377
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,900
because Matt actually posted the email on his Twitter.

1378
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:42,500
Not everybody thought that was the most professional thing to do in the world, which in retrospect,

1379
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,060
it probably wasn't.

1380
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:48,180
But taking a step back at everything, I can see where Matt was probably incredibly frustrated

1381
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:52,700
because I know he went into debt over this convention and in his, his group collectively,

1382
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,940
I don't want to just keep saying Matt, Matt, Matt, but his group collectively, you know,

1383
01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:01,160
they, they spent a lot of money on that con and the hotel was not a cheap place and they

1384
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,580
ended up, you know, going into the hole because of this.

1385
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:08,580
So and from what I understand, they tried to get a ton of corporate sponsorships and

1386
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:10,860
some of the companies, some companies were really cool about it.

1387
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,540
Like 2k Ubisoft showed up, right?

1388
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,540
Did their thing.

1389
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,540
EA went to the first year.

1390
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,540
Right.

1391
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:16,540
Very cool.

1392
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:19,220
But my understanding is some companies straight up like laughed in their face when they tried

1393
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:20,980
to pitch gamer X, these companies.

1394
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:25,820
So I can understand where Matt probably gets really frustrated with, Oh, so I'm going in

1395
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:29,740
debt over this and these companies don't even take it seriously.

1396
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,660
And now I'm just going to get screwed out of $3,000.

1397
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,860
So probably that whole posting it on Twitter and shit was just out of frustration.

1398
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,120
Like I just, I hit my breaking point, right?

1399
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:42,440
So obviously in retrospect, he realized that was a bad thing to do.

1400
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,240
And I, as America realized that maybe the way they communicated that message or how

1401
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,880
they even got to that point in the first place probably wasn't a good thing because the epilogue

1402
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,880
is.

1403
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,360
And I asked, they, they, they had a lunch meeting and work their shit out and ass is

1404
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,240
going to make good on their money.

1405
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,080
Everybody's hugging it out and that's all good.

1406
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:05,560
An interesting thing that came of this though, a very interesting, like,

1407
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
So like, okay.

1408
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,440
I mean, I don't know what the agreement was.

1409
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,440
If they were just going to give them money for the hell of it or were they like advertising

1410
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,640
their games at the con?

1411
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,160
They were a sponsor because I remember one of the drinks you could get was a pretty bomb,

1412
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,800
which is obviously a Disgaea reference.

1413
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,480
Well, that's kind of messed up though.

1414
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,400
If they have like their stuff there and then they're, Oh, by the way, we don't, we'll take

1415
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,400
a free advertisement.

1416
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,400
I thought it was weird.

1417
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,920
They didn't have to pay upfront, but you know what I, I've never organized a con, so I don't

1418
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,720
know how these agreements work and maybe it's just one of those things where it was like,

1419
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,680
we can give you the money on XYZ day, usually, but usually it is upfront because I know like

1420
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:46,200
a lot of co-op stuff, especially when you're doing events and stuff that you get the money

1421
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,200
up front.

1422
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,660
If, if you get companies straight up laughing you out the door and then this company says,

1423
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:57,080
we can get you the money on this day, if you'll, if you'll put us in in advance, probably didn't

1424
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,080
want to turn that down.

1425
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,240
And it's like, I kind of get it.

1426
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,280
Like maybe in retrospect, of course, everything sounds like boy would, I shouldn't have done

1427
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,280
that.

1428
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,240
But I mean, in the moment, if you're desperate con or no con, or I'm going to go into debt,

1429
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,220
like you probably agreed to it again, but I didn't make that deal.

1430
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,440
I wasn't there.

1431
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,880
So I can't, I don't want to make it up, you know, so it is what it is.

1432
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,080
But here's the interesting side effect that happened.

1433
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:27,240
So in that 24 hour period between they sent the letter to Matt, Matt posted on Twitter

1434
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,780
and they hug it out.

1435
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:33,420
There's obviously that period of what the fuck NIS and all this stuff, right?

1436
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:38,940
Devolver Digital sent out a tweet, which is interesting because Devolver Digital don't

1437
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,740
remember seeing them at gamer X one or two, but it's very cool.

1438
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,700
I'm not, not shading them or anything.

1439
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:48,060
It's just very interesting that now Devolver Digital literally comes out of nowhere and

1440
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:55,560
says, we pledged $3,000, the amount that NIS was, was supposedly failed to pay.

1441
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:02,440
We pledged $3,000 for a 2015 gamer X sponsorship and challenge other game companies that have

1442
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,220
the means to do so the same.

1443
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:08,040
Four other indie developers stepped up and said, we'll do it.

1444
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,740
And I don't have the list in front of me, but I think the makers of Thomas was alone

1445
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:12,740
was one of them.

1446
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,820
So there's a few others.

1447
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:19,380
So because of this unfortunate situation, even though they've said, we're not going

1448
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:21,660
to do a gamer X three, we've gone into debt, dah, dah, dah, dah.

1449
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:29,260
Now they've already raised $15,000 without essentially having to do anything weird, right?

1450
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,100
You guys haven't heard of this at all, huh?

1451
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,500
This is news to us right now.

1452
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:36,900
So, well, that's, we usually don't deliver news on this show, but there you go.

1453
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,160
But yeah, but weird how that worked out, right?

1454
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:44,180
So it now it's like maybe gamer X three will happen after all, because all of a sudden

1455
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,100
these people are literally coming out from behind the curtain saying, you know what?

1456
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,220
This is a great con that you guys are doing.

1457
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,220
And you know, it's true.

1458
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,060
Like we were getting feedback from that as well.

1459
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:56,060
They said they, a lot of people were feeling kind of sad because they felt like, oh, it's

1460
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,500
dying and it's not coming back.

1461
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,420
And he said, it must be a way to revive this.

1462
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,460
There must be a way for it to go on.

1463
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:05,700
And as you were talking about the drama and so forth about what was going on, people getting

1464
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,180
screwed over and sponsorships and stuff.

1465
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:12,100
And Jonas was relaying this to me to also kind of telling me to like, keep it to myself

1466
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:16,220
at the time, but to show that, yeah, it looks like they really just got screwed over and

1467
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,860
just, just either way, because of all the things that all the people who promise certain

1468
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:25,580
things and we're back down and said, and then I, in my mind, I can see, I can see why they

1469
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,580
can't do this again.

1470
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:30,660
I know that you're out of all these problems, but knowing this now, um, it just feels like

1471
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,820
the name itself needs to go on.

1472
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:33,820
Right.

1473
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:37,180
Well, well, ironically there, they might change that and they've talked about how they probably

1474
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:38,780
aren't going to call it gamer X next time.

1475
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,380
They're probably going to call it something else.

1476
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:44,100
And there have been tweets going out from the gamer X account this week, like, so what

1477
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,700
if we moved it out of San Francisco?

1478
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,700
What would you guys think?

1479
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,700
Which I think a lot of people are like, yes, move it out of San Francisco.

1480
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,700
It's too fucking expensive.

1481
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,860
They're move it, move it, move it.

1482
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,980
I think a lot of people are saying that, um, but then they're also saying, what should

1483
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:57,180
we call it?

1484
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:02,020
Because I think they want to get away from being a gay expo where they want it to be

1485
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:09,500
really about the Sacramento so I can go cause I can't, a lot of people drove from soccer.

1486
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,500
I was shocked.

1487
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,820
How many people from SACRA at that?

1488
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:15,580
I'm just saying, you know, cause the teabaggers are there.

1489
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,580
Yeah.

1490
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:21,100
I, I, well shit, I need to go to like, you know, SAC anime because I haven't, you know,

1491
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:25,180
gone since it was that was the Radisson early, but I, that sounds about right.

1492
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:29,980
I suggested San Jose and or anywhere along that line between, you know, anywhere in the

1493
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:34,940
Bay there between, you know, down the one to one or the two 80 between, you know, near

1494
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:38,180
SFO airport even or somewhere is going to be cheaper than in the city.

1495
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:43,100
Um, let me put it into a little bit, maybe be possible, maybe for like an area like San

1496
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:49,100
Mateo, maybe because I'm not sure who, who are all, all part of the gamer X know about

1497
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:54,620
yaoi con as well, which has some of the members of the other LGBT community actually being

1498
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,620
there too.

1499
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,620
Right.

1500
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:00,780
So yeah, it's just a suggestion of San Mateo being made possibly cheaper compared to like

1501
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,300
San Jose, which could be extremely expensive as well.

1502
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:08,620
So I, I, I'm thinking they're going to move it if they do it in another year and they're

1503
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:11,740
probably going to put the feelers out there like, okay, what can $15,000 get us?

1504
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:15,620
You know, and how much, you know, so, so they might, it might happen, uh, so it'd be interesting,

1505
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,340
but then it's going to probably have a new name.

1506
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,100
They also were tweeting, what should the new name be?

1507
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,780
And this is funny because I tweeted back and I said, why don't you just call it?

1508
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,240
Because the thing is everybody games, right?

1509
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,740
So call it everybody games expo.

1510
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,380
I think that'd be a great name, right?

1511
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,380
E G X.

1512
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,380
I said, there you go.

1513
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,380
There's your name.

1514
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,380
Well, here's the hilarious thing.

1515
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,100
I got a tweet just randomly, I guess somebody that was searching names or whatever.

1516
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:37,260
So somebody that represents Eurogamer expo tweeted me saying, Hey, we really want to

1517
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,300
see this happen, but please don't take our name.

1518
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,820
And I was like, Oh fuck, that's right.

1519
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:46,340
Eurogamer expo is EGX whoops, but still, you know, they, they'll, they can, they can massage

1520
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:47,340
that idea or whatever.

1521
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:48,340
EGX or whatever.

1522
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,340
Yeah.

1523
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,340
Or EGE or something.

1524
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:55,620
Anyway, who doesn't want to, they could do EDGE.

1525
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,620
Everybody wants to edge.

1526
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,620
All right.

1527
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:58,620
What?

1528
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,620
How about everybody expo?

1529
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,620
E V E.

1530
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,620
Eve.

1531
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,620
Eve.

1532
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:08,380
And you're going to get sued by the folks that do Eve online because, Oh God, here we

1533
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,380
go.

1534
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,380
All right.

1535
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:14,460
Just call it, um, no name con.

1536
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,460
That's it.

1537
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,460
No name con.

1538
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,460
That's it.

1539
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,460
How about dash con?

1540
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,460
Does anybody use that?

1541
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,460
All right.

1542
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,460
I vote for redacted.

1543
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:26,780
Why don't they just, why don't they just call it donkey con, but I'm going to see none of

1544
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,780
these names.

1545
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:31,020
Unfortunately give that whole like, Oh, this isn't everybody open type of con.

1546
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,020
I don't know.

1547
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,420
Inclusive con.

1548
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,420
Overshare con.

1549
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,420
Registration con.

1550
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:36,420
Gay rave con.

1551
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,420
All right.

1552
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,420
Everybody fart con.

1553
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,420
Be quiet.

1554
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,420
All right.

1555
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,420
The chat room was still going on that by the way.

1556
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,420
I know.

1557
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,420
That's why I said that.

1558
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:50,020
Anyway, so look, in all seriousness, uh, I best of luck to, you know, I'm, I'm glad they

1559
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,780
resolved their shit within 24 hours of the NAS America.

1560
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:58,620
And it's really weird how despite the unprofessionalism of NAS America and then the unprofessionalism

1561
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:04,700
of, of gamer X and posting that out there, that yet something good came out of that possibly

1562
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,020
like really fucking good came out of that possibly.

1563
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,860
Um, I'm, I'm very interested to see what develops.

1564
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,420
Can they just call it con?

1565
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:12,420
No.

1566
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,420
Be quiet.

1567
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,420
All right.

1568
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,420
Anyhow.

1569
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:21,620
Akuma JP says donkey Kong only for the hung.

1570
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,620
Wow.

1571
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,620
Stop it.

1572
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:24,620
There you go.

1573
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,540
He is going on the right road.

1574
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:34,180
Brad says, call it VOD con if I, if I had, if, if I had $3,000 to contribute to, I would

1575
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:40,060
love to, but I did, I bought VIP tickets or had about a little more money than, than the

1576
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,060
average bear.

1577
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,420
Here's a question though.

1578
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:44,900
I know you've said about $15,000.

1579
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:48,660
What about the potential kickstart of what they were using?

1580
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:53,060
Like in the past, wouldn't that be additional revenue to that's, that's a decision for somebody

1581
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,060
else to make.

1582
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:56,580
I mean, but believe me, they're considering all this shit.

1583
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,580
I'm sure.

1584
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,580
Yeah.

1585
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:02,300
So I do agree on the fact that you said about, it should leave San Francisco cause it is

1586
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:06,220
expensive there, but not, not straight away too far, but you know, it's still like somewhere

1587
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,220
on the Bart line.

1588
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,220
Right.

1589
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:09,220
And the San Francisco people can still go.

1590
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:12,140
You know, like, like Jonas said about maybe San Mateo, because as we've seen the yaoi cons

1591
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,860
move around throughout the time, cause we staff there as well.

1592
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:19,580
Uh, it's still kept it in a good spot in the bear that was not too far away from San Francisco.

1593
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:20,580
You're right.

1594
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:21,580
Keep it through the Bart lines.

1595
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,380
Uh, but yeah, and that changed as well.

1596
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:28,700
And even though it'll probably go under a new ownership or whatever or whatnot, that

1597
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,260
to the point that, uh, it doesn't change too drastically to the point where it's completely

1598
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:36,980
changed itself in like inner wise, besides maybe the name and such forth, like you're

1599
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:42,140
saying that, that some fans want to see it a bit the same way as it was before, but not

1600
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:44,860
an entirely drastic change, right.

1601
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:48,700
But I'm just saying as an opinion, as in a fan that they might see that maybe it changed

1602
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,300
too much or so forth, I don't know.

1603
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:55,700
I, I, they've got a lot of really tough decisions to make really fast just when they thought

1604
01:15:55,700 --> 01:16:00,080
they were getting a break from con planning, but, um, I guess a unfortunate side effect

1605
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,740
of being really popular and well liked in the community.

1606
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,740
So there you go.

1607
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,740
All right.

1608
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,700
Well, anyhow, we got more news to get to, so let's, uh, let's keep moving.

1609
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:12,300
Pina con, con Lada, really?

1610
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,580
This is better than fart con.

1611
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,140
It feels like they're going off that YouTube video.

1612
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,140
What was it?

1613
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,140
Uh, Oh yeah.

1614
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,140
The, the, what was it?

1615
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:24,300
Sorry, we can't hear Jonas cause he's not my power thirst about the gay power thirst

1616
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,620
where they said penis colada.

1617
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:26,620
Yeah.

1618
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,620
There you go.

1619
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:28,620
There's so much references in there.

1620
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:31,580
Don't forget my favorite flavor gun.

1621
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:32,580
New topic.

1622
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:35,100
It's a Brown icon or something.

1623
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,100
All right.

1624
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,100
All right.

1625
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,100
I'll just stop right there.

1626
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,100
Yeah.

1627
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,100
I'll just stop right there.

1628
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,100
Anyway.

1629
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:44,940
EA is doing some crap.

1630
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:45,940
How's that for news?

1631
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,940
EA is fucking up.

1632
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:48,940
No, I'm kidding.

1633
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,900
Um, they actually are shutting down Ultima forever.

1634
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:55,020
It will be closed down by the end of August.

1635
01:16:55,020 --> 01:17:02,160
It was the spiritual successor to Ultima for, um, it was a mobile title, had the stupid

1636
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,180
transaction crap going on.

1637
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,820
Um, it's, they're shutting it down on August 29th.

1638
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:12,700
Can we, I was going to say, can we sue them for false advertisement?

1639
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:17,680
Durr wamp wamp.

1640
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,160
It's not really forever.

1641
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,000
Um, I have a great respect for the Ultima series.

1642
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,340
Like I loved it on the NES and in the Commodore days and the old computers and so forth and

1643
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:31,040
all that being said, good fucking re riddance to this trash cause that game was awful.

1644
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,160
So they also shut down Lord of Ultima.

1645
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:40,920
Well, the Ultima did not translate well to a mobile at all and uh, that I don't think

1646
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:46,320
that was Ultima's fault as much as it was the, um, uh, fault of, uh, the game design

1647
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,280
behind it and what, you know, EA was doing with their mobile games cause they've done

1648
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,880
it in other games that haven't done well.

1649
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,720
Fifth dream colon con.

1650
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,720
Stop it.

1651
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:05,000
And I just said what I was thinking Ultima not forever for the record fifth dream Decepticon

1652
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,280
I do believe already exists as there is a Decepticon.

1653
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:13,440
Yeah, of course there's also botcon and the other major transformers conventions.

1654
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,760
All right, moving on.

1655
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,760
Uh, Loki.

1656
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:26,320
Do they have like conjugate as like a, like a grammar con anyways, I'd go, uh, Nintendo

1657
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:33,880
unfortunately has posted $97 million as a loss, um, for the last quarter.

1658
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,840
Fortunately Mario Kart eight, it did great, but it just wasn't enough.

1659
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,360
And um, you know, they had a great attachment rate against, they're saying almost 3 million

1660
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:47,640
units, um, were shipped by the end of June and you know, definitely people are buying

1661
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,640
the title.

1662
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,400
It's just, what else did they have come out?

1663
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,720
I mean, not a lot else.

1664
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:56,720
I mean, just wasn't, wasn't enough.

1665
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,800
Of course, um, probably should be a little bit better through the fourth quarter.

1666
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,600
I know they've got like a lot more games expected out and um, hopefully that sells more units.

1667
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,440
Smash Brothers should help.

1668
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,120
Definitely that's the, just that, that, that's a name that will go on.

1669
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,120
Definitely.

1670
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,680
But I mean, I understand that it's just, you know, the average mom and pop consumer, you

1671
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:23,320
know, I don't know, but their kids will, they need, no one really helped the Wii or the

1672
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,000
Wii U or both Zelda.

1673
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,640
Well, Zelda, yes, but a legitimate Pokemon game on, I'm really surprised they haven't

1674
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,640
gone there.

1675
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:38,160
It's probably cause they haven't figured out how to be able to transfer data between 3ds

1676
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,160
and the Wii U.

1677
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,160
It can't be that hard.

1678
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,160
It can't be that hard.

1679
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,160
Do it through a Nintendo network.

1680
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:45,160
Just like, just like online or DLC, it can't be that hard.

1681
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,640
But yet for some reason, it escapes them.

1682
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,440
They have that fucking cloud thing that people are paying for for the Pokemon now.

1683
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,520
Cause I remember they treaded that with Pokemon revolution and then that didn't go so well.

1684
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,320
But the reason the problem is right now is because don't they not have, their accounts

1685
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:02,140
are tied to, um, they're not tied to your Nintendo account.

1686
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,480
It's tied to your console, isn't it?

1687
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,480
No, is it?

1688
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,720
Um, so I think that's why they don't have a unified, you know, eShop account or anything

1689
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,880
I feel like I've seen, can't, okay.

1690
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:18,480
If the Wii can beam demos to your 3ds, then this technology cannot be that difficult for

1691
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,480
the DS.

1692
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,680
I mean, they, they both have a Bluetooth stuff in them, right?

1693
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,680
That they could transmit data.

1694
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,680
It can't be that hard.

1695
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,240
I mean, I realized this is Nintendo, but it really can't be that hard.

1696
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:32,360
Look, Mario Kart 8 kind of made us go, Oh, Nintendo really can do this shit.

1697
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,360
Wow.

1698
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,360
They probably already do.

1699
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,360
They're just too afraid to actually test it out.

1700
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,360
It might flop.

1701
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,360
May.

1702
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,360
Yeah, they can't.

1703
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,360
They definitely do.

1704
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,360
They can't afford to have a flop.

1705
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,360
Actually.

1706
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,360
Wait, wait.

1707
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,360
The realization is completely obvious.

1708
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,260
I can't believe I didn't even think about it.

1709
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:49,040
You know why they haven't put a Pokemon game on the Wii U?

1710
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,520
It's because they haven't manufactured the fucking amiibo characters that are going to

1711
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,140
go along with it.

1712
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:58,360
That is why they haven't put a Pokemon game on the Wii U because they're going to fucking

1713
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,480
whore the shit out of that.

1714
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:06,180
You think, you think Activision or Skylanders and Disney infinity, you know, horse those

1715
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,180
characters.

1716
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:10,180
You have not seen anything yet.

1717
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,320
You have not seen anything yet.

1718
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:16,860
The fans of those series, I mean, Skylanders, no one who knows who the fuck the Skylanders

1719
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:17,860
are.

1720
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:21,920
I mean, kids, I'm surprised that they attach themselves to like these brand new characters,

1721
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:27,780
but Pokemon characters, all ages are going to eat that shit up because you got to collect

1722
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:28,780
them all.

1723
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,540
I mean, and they're going to buy all of them.

1724
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:31,540
All right.

1725
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:32,540
Well, here's Kaijuto in chat.

1726
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:37,020
The reason why we don't have Pokemon on the Wii U is because the game is made for handheld.

1727
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,240
That's why it's called Pocket Monsters.

1728
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,020
It's a handheld game, not a console.

1729
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:42,380
I like it where it is.

1730
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:45,060
I understand that, but money talks.

1731
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,060
You know what I mean?

1732
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:53,780
Like, gee, the Pokemon stepped into a growth machine and now it's Pokemon in giant giant

1733
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:54,780
world.

1734
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:57,980
It's called Pocket Monsters because they collect them in Pokeballs, which fit in your fucking

1735
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:58,980
pocket.

1736
01:21:58,980 --> 01:21:59,980
Done.

1737
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:00,980
Yeah.

1738
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:03,360
I'm like where, where there's a check, there's a way.

1739
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,360
You know what I mean?

1740
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,140
They'll, they'll figure out a way to retcon it in the story.

1741
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:11,340
I do, I do appreciate the viewpoint though that, yeah, that's how Pokemon was certainly

1742
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:16,140
born, but if Nintendo really needs the money and needs to do it, they could.

1743
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,940
That's how they'll transfer data back and forth too is because they're going to have,

1744
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:24,460
remember, the amiibo support for 3DS at some point, and that's how it's going to work.

1745
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:29,940
That they will have a game that comes out on 3DS and on, you know, Wii U and it'll transfer

1746
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:34,620
data back and forth just like they do with the 3DS versions right now and the DS versions

1747
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,620
and all that fun stuff.

1748
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:37,100
All right.

1749
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,100
Let's move on.

1750
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,100
Dark Sakura.

1751
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,100
Oh, that's right.

1752
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,100
Well, how about something about Killer Instinct?

1753
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,100
Well.

1754
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,100
Huh?

1755
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,580
Oh, there was some discussion.

1756
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:51,740
Killer Instinct is going to be having a retail release.

1757
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:57,060
This is the Double Helix version, by the way, not the really awesome very first game as

1758
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:01,020
we remember KI Gold from the N64.

1759
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,740
They have this one that I have yet to touch.

1760
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:10,620
Microsoft basically has put out the announcement that on September 23, Killer Instinct will

1761
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:17,340
be available out to purchase a retail version, and it will come with the first season and

1762
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:24,340
the season 2 TJ combo code for $19.99, which is a little bit better than the combo breaker

1763
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,340
pack.

1764
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,340
So.

1765
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:28,740
There you go.

1766
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:33,420
So this would be good for people that maybe don't get online all the time with their system

1767
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,220
to be able to get the game, I guess.

1768
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,220
Probably four.

1769
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:38,220
Yeah.

1770
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:39,220
It makes sense.

1771
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:43,020
I mean, I think that maybe the just the online only thing didn't quite work out well for

1772
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,020
them.

1773
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:48,380
Is it also coming out holiday September, September 23rd close enough.

1774
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:51,980
That might be the that might be the reason is so it can be something that shows up under

1775
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:55,220
the Christmas tree or Hanukkah Bush or whatever it is.

1776
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:58,060
Hanukkah Bush, probably.

1777
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:04,460
I mean, that's still way, way early, even for Hanukkah and for Christmas.

1778
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:06,460
This is basically like an afterthought.

1779
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:09,060
I think we didn't get enough money out of this.

1780
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,340
Let's put it out for the people who didn't want to do online purchases.

1781
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,340
All right.

1782
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,860
Well, let's talk about something that's coming a little bit sooner than September 23rd.

1783
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:19,340
How about this week in retail?

1784
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:22,780
Loki starting off with the U.S. release dates, really only two games this week, Sacred three

1785
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:27,940
on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Ultra Street Fighter four on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1786
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:32,860
The disc version, of course, because you could purchase the download a while ago.

1787
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:37,180
So we're just in a drought until Labor Day, pretty much.

1788
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,180
Right.

1789
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:39,180
And like destiny.

1790
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,180
Yeah.

1791
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,180
Oh, there you go.

1792
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:46,220
I guess it'll be a little while and it's going to be this is your time to catch up, people.

1793
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,660
That's what this is.

1794
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:51,780
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andereto at VOG Network

1795
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:52,780
dot com.

1796
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:53,780
Use the passphrase North.

1797
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:57,740
Well, if you're in Japan, things are a little more exciting on the PlayStation three this

1798
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:58,740
week.

1799
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:03,620
Anyway, over in Japan, Lost Dimension Shin Hayarigami comes out this week as well.

1800
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:07,380
And Ultra Street Fighter four gets its Japanese release this week.

1801
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:11,420
So is that to look forward to on the Xbox 360, you can get Ultra Street Fighter four.

1802
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:15,420
Should you actually be in Japan and have an Xbox 360 for the dozens of you out there with

1803
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,420
one?

1804
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,180
And then are you a unicorn?

1805
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:23,700
And on the Wii U, Dragon Quest 10, the all in one package comes out this week because

1806
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:28,940
over in Japan, they actually got Dragon Quest 10 on the Wii U, whereas here we're still

1807
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:29,940
waiting.

1808
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:33,180
Although I thought I heard something that's going to be a 3DS thing.

1809
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,180
Do we touch on that?

1810
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:37,740
I thought I heard somewhere around that, that it is going to end up make its way over here

1811
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:40,440
at some point, which is exciting.

1812
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:45,860
On the PlayStation Vita this week in Japan, Lost Dimension and Shin Hayarigami, which

1813
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:48,300
were also on a PS3, are also out on Vita.

1814
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,300
So that's pretty cool.

1815
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,400
Some more stuff on the Vita.

1816
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:56,900
And lastly, on the 3DS, Dragon Ball Heroes Ultimate Mission 2, Farming Simulator 14 Pocket

1817
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:04,320
No. 2, Senran Kagura 2 Shinku comes out on 3DS, and Bravely Default for the sequel goes

1818
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,460
into the Ultimate Hits edition.

1819
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:10,400
Keep in mind, Bravely Default for the sequel is actually what we got over here as simply

1820
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:14,540
Bravely Default, because I think Bravely Default for the sequel was an enhanced version of

1821
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:18,540
the original game that they had out on Japan, so it's not like an actual sequel or anything

1822
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,540
like that.

1823
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:25,380
Not yet anyway, but I believe one is coming really soon in Japan, like this year.

1824
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,580
So there you go, Japanese release dates.

1825
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,740
How about the UK, Darusaka?

1826
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:30,740
Only two things.

1827
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,020
Well, sorry, three things.

1828
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:37,940
On August 6th is Metrico for Vita and Road Not Taken for PlayStation 4.

1829
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:42,540
And on the 8th, Ultra Street Fighter IV.

1830
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:48,060
AkumaJP clarifying the Dragon Quest X question, AkumaJP says, next month, Dragon Quest X free

1831
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:53,580
on new 3DS purchase, and since he's in Japan, that must be how they're pushing it forward

1832
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,580
over there.

1833
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,580
That's pretty cool.

1834
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,660
I hope it makes its way over here, because I'd like to check it out.

1835
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:01,580
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1836
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:03,580
But first, Loki.

1837
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,580
Alright.

1838
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:12,340
So this is kind of ridiculous, but apparently, the brand new game that was done by, was it

1839
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:17,820
the guys that did the, what was it, Black Forest Games, they did the Gianna Sisters

1840
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:21,780
remake, sequel, whatever you want to call that.

1841
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:28,980
They had a brand new game called Diesel Stormers, and it was a kind of a dieselpunk action game.

1842
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:37,780
They got a, I guess, a trademark, or their trademark blocked, because apparently, Diesel,

1843
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:41,220
the fashion brand, had a problem with it.

1844
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:45,260
They were saying that it's going to cause confusion.

1845
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:51,740
So I don't know, it seems like there's no case, they said, in all probability, an understanding

1846
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:56,460
will be reached as Black Forest has no intent to create clothing under the Diesel Stormers

1847
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:58,100
brand in Diesel.

1848
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:02,240
The Diesel part of Diesel Stormers refers to the liquid fuel of the same name, and not

1849
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,440
a parody of the fashion brand.

1850
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:10,940
So yeah, it's a little ridiculous, but you gotta love that trademark law and copyright

1851
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,100
law.

1852
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,580
I guess you gotta defend it in order to keep it.

1853
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:15,580
I guess that's true.

1854
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,460
It's a little ridiculous, though.

1855
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,340
Do they sue gas stations, too?

1856
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:20,340
I don't know.

1857
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,340
But seriously, that's a little ridiculous.

1858
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,340
What about that Vin guy?

1859
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,340
Right?

1860
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:26,340
Yeah.

1861
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,900
Oh no, they settled with him out of court.

1862
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:35,500
I completely forgot Diesel was even a fashion brand until they mentioned this lawsuit.

1863
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,900
They're just tired of not being relevant anymore.

1864
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:42,900
I only know because I might have underwear that says Diesel on it.

1865
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,900
And clearly that's because of the liquid fuel, right?

1866
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,900
Burn it, Rob.

1867
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:46,900
Burn it and protest.

1868
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:47,900
I'm a big fan of the game.

1869
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:48,900
What can I say?

1870
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:49,900
I'm very committed.

1871
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,900
What?

1872
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,900
What?

1873
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,460
What?

1874
01:28:53,460 --> 01:29:00,860
If you put Diesel fuel on your underwear, you'd have underwear ception, Diesel ception.

1875
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:03,140
You've got problems.

1876
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:06,140
You hang out with me.

1877
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,140
But how much longer?

1878
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:08,140
Just kidding.

1879
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:09,140
Bitch, please.

1880
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:13,380
You should have seen the way her face changed when I said that.

1881
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:14,380
All right.

1882
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,700
The chat room's going with you.

1883
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,820
Fifth Dream says, I'm confused.

1884
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:20,220
This is about Vin Diesel.

1885
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:24,020
Tiger Claw says, is Diesel even a real last name?

1886
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,380
Someone went to Kevin Nash as well.

1887
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,060
Kevin Nash used to go by Diesel.

1888
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,260
Big Daddy Diesel.

1889
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:30,260
Dungeon Buster says, good grief.

1890
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:31,440
Minus the quad.

1891
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,440
Good grief.

1892
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,300
Another marketplace confusion lawsuit.

1893
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,300
I don't...

1894
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,300
It's fine.

1895
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,300
Look.

1896
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,300
One is underwear.

1897
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:39,300
One is a game.

1898
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:40,300
It's very, very different.

1899
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,980
I don't understand.

1900
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:46,700
And all three of them are flammable.

1901
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:48,420
And seriously, it's like...

1902
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,700
Especially when being warned by me.

1903
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,660
No, it's seriously just like, uh...

1904
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:57,020
Did you say that your panties get set on fire?

1905
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:59,460
Was it Monster Cables and, um...

1906
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,820
I want to say Monster Cables and Monster Energy.

1907
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:03,820
They go in the rounds and sue everybody that's Monster.

1908
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:04,820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1909
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,900
Because they sued the Monster Golf place in Folsom, right?

1910
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:08,900
Yeah.

1911
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:09,900
Well, the chain.

1912
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:10,900
Yeah.

1913
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:11,900
Yeah, yeah.

1914
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,900
Oh, boy.

1915
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:13,900
All right.

1916
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:16,660
One more story for you guys here for part A. And this is about the...

1917
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:20,340
Credit card that you may have heard about this week at...

1918
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:23,420
Available at Evil G, which of course is the...

1919
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:27,740
Our loving name for the GameStop retail chain.

1920
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:30,100
And I'm gonna be honest.

1921
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:35,000
This news came out, and I was actually more surprised that this wasn't already a thing.

1922
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,500
Because GameStop is going to be bringing out their own credit card.

1923
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,480
So a GameStop credit card is gonna come out in the next few months, and this will be something

1924
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:48,560
that their employees can push for incentives, I'm sure, along with pre-orders.

1925
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,680
If you sign up, you will get 5,000 power-up points if you're a power-up basic member.

1926
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,880
And if you're a pro member, you get 15,000 power-up points.

1927
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,760
And you're already pre-approved if you're a member, I guess, which seems weird because

1928
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,480
some people have some really shitty credit.

1929
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,480
I don't know.

1930
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:08,480
But anyway, the interest rate is a low, low 26.99% APR.

1931
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,440
Sounds like my student loan.

1932
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:18,240
That means for every $100, it gets $27 in interest a year.

1933
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,040
And of course, they calculate that by the day.

1934
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:24,680
But anyway, most credit cards for reference, 13 to 15%.

1935
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,680
So yeah, there you go.

1936
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:29,520
You can get some points if you spend money with your GameStop card.

1937
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,880
I'm gonna be honest though, as crap as this whole situation sounds and everything, there's

1938
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:39,200
also a part of me that goes, well, every retail chain has a fucking card.

1939
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,920
Sears has a card.

1940
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,920
Surprise has a card.

1941
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,640
The rate on our Sears card is something like 4%.

1942
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,640
Yeah.

1943
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,960
Well, I actually, full disclosure, I have a Sears card.

1944
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,880
But the reason why I have one is because they had a good deal where when we bought the washer

1945
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,000
and dryer, you don't have to pay any interest at all as long as you pay it off within like

1946
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,440
18 months or something like that.

1947
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,080
We got ours a long time ago when we got Dan's power tools.

1948
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,800
Power tools.

1949
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:11,080
Can I imagine like if you just pay off your, you know, if you make your payment every month,

1950
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:16,640
like pay it off in full every month and you can earn points or whatever, I guess.

1951
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:22,280
If you're good with credit, but here's the thing, that's the only kind of shady thing

1952
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:26,520
I see here is that GameStop, what do they kind of tend to cater to?

1953
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:32,120
The younger folks right in that 18 to 23 area.

1954
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,400
Poor impulse control and no sense of responsibility.

1955
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,960
Who are most likely to fuck up their credit.

1956
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,820
You know, and I'm not saying, I'm sure many of you that listen to the show fall into this

1957
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:43,680
age bracket, just, you know, make smart decisions with the credit.

1958
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:47,800
If you're going to get something like this, you really do have to pay it off because that

1959
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,740
shit will haunt you for a long, long time if you don't.

1960
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:54,600
So just words of advice from your pals at OLR.

1961
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,600
So shop responsibly.

1962
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,600
That's right.

1963
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,600
That's right.

1964
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,560
Don't, there's, remember that's $27 for every hundred you spend.

1965
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,320
That's like one and a half games a year.

1966
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,320
If you don't pay it off.

1967
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,320
Yeah.

1968
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:11,680
Worse if it's someone buys a console, I'm going to buy a PS4 and Xbox One.

1969
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:14,320
And keep, keep in mind that's going to be added on monthly.

1970
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:19,600
So whether, even if you pay it off three months later, you're still paying them some money.

1971
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:24,320
So I think the question will be here, big, big thing here.

1972
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:28,400
And Bobby Black Wolf adding to this conversation, I have a best buy credit card, but all my

1973
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,240
purchases are zero if I pay off by certain dates, like a similar thing.

1974
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,520
So another retail chain with one.

1975
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:36,580
SDG100Matt says, the sick thing is that the suckers that they're going to heavily pressure

1976
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:41,760
people into getting these cards don't really know how bad 27% APR is.

1977
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,080
That's what I kind of want to wait and see.

1978
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:46,720
I want to see how GameStop pushes this.

1979
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,120
Are they going to be preying on the week essentially?

1980
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:53,200
Like what the fuck did the power up reward points get me?

1981
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,200
What the hell is that?

1982
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,200
Discounts, free games, magazines.

1983
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,200
I don't know.

1984
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,680
What does, I don't shop at GameStop.

1985
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:01,160
I literally don't know anyone shop at GameStop.

1986
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:04,600
You have shopped at GameStop with me there to watch.

1987
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:09,340
My assumption is used game credit or deals and things like that.

1988
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:13,480
For the record, they usually have really good deals on their used 3DS games.

1989
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:20,080
So I've gone, but I think, you know what, I think this, I think if we really, really

1990
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:25,080
are against these policies that companies are doing, we really should just say, okay,

1991
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,520
we're not going to be a part of it anymore at all.

1992
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:33,080
Not even if they have good sales, not even if it's, you know, we happen to be there or

1993
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,400
they're the only ones who are carrying a game.

1994
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,560
If you're going to stand against something, then including their, their little credit

1995
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:43,600
thing, then tell them with your money.

1996
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,780
So here's something else that's kind of interesting that came out about GameStop this week on

1997
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:50,720
a completely different note, but something to think about when you're going to be doing

1998
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:55,080
business with them is obviously GameStop huge in the business of buying back your games

1999
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:58,140
and reselling, right, and all that stuff.

2000
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:03,360
So in some areas it should be noted that video game trade-ins like the ones at GameStop are

2001
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:09,120
treated like pawn shops with the pawn shop laws and pawn shops in some areas, one of

2002
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:12,680
them being Philadelphia, have to scan fingerprints.

2003
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:17,100
So there's a Philadelphia GameStop out there that is now scanning fingerprints that started

2004
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,400
about a month ago.

2005
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:23,040
Because that way if, you know, they find the fingerprints on stolen goods, then they know

2006
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,160
either they can kind of trace it on stuff, right?

2007
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,960
That's the thought behind it, whatever.

2008
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,200
But here's the interesting thing.

2009
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:33,680
Those scans, so when you get your finger scanned, that goes into a Leeds online database, which

2010
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:40,480
is quote, the nation's largest online investigation system to recover stolen property, help stop

2011
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:44,120
meth makers, reduce metal theft, and solve crimes.

2012
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,760
I don't really have a problem with that.

2013
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,160
It's not anything new.

2014
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:51,240
They do that at my GameStop nearby.

2015
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:55,760
If one, back when I was treating stuff in, they do that because they do have theft in

2016
01:35:55,760 --> 01:36:00,440
the area and so they want to make sure that people aren't turning in stolen goods.

2017
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:04,600
Well just, if you're one of those people that, you know, the NSA is watching you masturbate

2018
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:10,200
and all that stuff, then just throwing it out there, your fingerprints, you know, when

2019
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,520
you have a driver's license, your fingerprints are already in the fucking system.

2020
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:17,280
It doesn't matter.

2021
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:22,400
But now, now they'll know when I sell back Onechambara, they'll know that I was playing

2022
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,400
that.

2023
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:27,440
You'll get a call from D3, why didn't you like that game?

2024
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,440
What the fuck?

2025
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,480
You know, we worked hard on that.

2026
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:34,580
We're going to have to fire employees because you didn't like that game.

2027
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:38,320
The boobs weren't big enough, unfortunately for me.

2028
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:43,880
Honestly, putting the tinfoil hat aside, seriously, I think it's a good idea.

2029
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:48,920
You know, when Dan was a manager, he would talk about all of these people that would

2030
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:58,280
just come into the store who were clearly not all there, as in, like, clearly had stolen

2031
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,280
items.

2032
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:03,160
That's why they don't take games back if they've still got shrinkwrapping on them and all of

2033
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,160
that.

2034
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,160
That doesn't go far enough.

2035
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:07,500
They just learn, okay, I got to rip this shrinkwrap off.

2036
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:12,540
So power up rewards, basically you earn points, you can get crap.

2037
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:17,420
And so, for example, some of the things you can get, for 6200 points, you can get Boba

2038
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,420
Fett necklace.

2039
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:22,320
Oddly enough, there's a ton of fucking Star Wars shit on here and I'm not sure why.

2040
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:28,380
So if I sign up for my 28% APR credit card, I can get a Boba Fett necklace?

2041
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:33,620
You can get for 29,500 points, you can get Boba Fett candy bowl holder.

2042
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:39,100
I just want to throw out there, at least it's not Jar Jar Binks, right?

2043
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:42,380
I just want to throw out there, there's other credit cards that will give you a flight to

2044
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,780
Hawaii if you sign up for their credit card.

2045
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:46,660
Do they also include a Boba Fett necklace?

2046
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:47,660
They do not.

2047
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:48,660
Oh my god.

2048
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:49,660
So you have a tough decision to make.

2049
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:50,660
Do you want Hawaii?

2050
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:52,660
Or a necklace?

2051
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:57,420
6,000 points, 25% off a pre-owned handheld game.

2052
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:02,660
Mind you, you get 10% off anyways with your power up rewards card as it is.

2053
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:05,580
12,490 points, a Millennium Falcon model.

2054
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:09,340
Yeah, I don't understand why all this shit's Star Wars stuff, but I think that's just an

2055
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:10,340
example.

2056
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,340
I'm surprised it's not the Slave I.

2057
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,340
It's still on Boba Fett.

2058
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:13,340
Yeah.

2059
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,340
It felt like a line of Boba Fett toys.

2060
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:19,220
You can get Stormtrooper earrings for 7,940 points.

2061
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:20,500
So yes, quality stuff.

2062
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:23,420
We're a plastic Stein for 7,200 points.

2063
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:25,500
Did you say Stormtrooper earrings?

2064
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,500
Stormtrooper earrings.

2065
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,500
What in the world?

2066
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,500
Yeah.

2067
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:30,500
Alright.

2068
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:34,380
I feel like these are not the earrings you're looking for.

2069
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:37,180
Star Wars Episode I, the GameStop menace.

2070
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:39,060
Alright, look.

2071
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:42,900
We're going to take a trip to when it wasn't so ... You know what?

2072
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:47,540
The rewards program that you got points for was the Nintendo Fun Club, and that was it.

2073
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:51,220
We're going to go back to a classic time in gaming history.

2074
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:54,660
It's Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

2075
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:57,100
hey, you little brats.

2076
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,540
I dusted the vault today.

2077
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:03,880
Trade in your games, send the money to me, and then go play this, and I'm going to go

2078
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:04,880
eat tacos.

2079
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:08,000
Dark Sakura, what's the classic game of the week?

2080
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:15,520
Mylon's Secret Castle, or as it was known in Japan, Meikyu Kumi Kyouku Myron no Daiboken.

2081
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,520
What?

2082
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:22,280
The maze suite Mylon's Great Adventure, it was Myron.

2083
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:27,920
It was an action-adventure game that came out by Hudson for Nintendo.

2084
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:34,280
Actually, it was originally on Famicom on November 13th, 1986, and came out in the US

2085
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:37,240
in September 1988.

2086
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:43,400
The protagonist, as we all said, Mylon here, but it was Myron, lives in the land called

2087
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:47,040
Hudson, where people use music to communicate.

2088
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,760
Are there bees there?

2089
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,160
I know, right?

2090
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:54,440
Oh, actually, there were honeycombs.

2091
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,920
I do remember that.

2092
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:56,920
Yes.

2093
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:01,840
Anyway, he was the only one who didn't have the ability to communicate and wondered why,

2094
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,940
so he goes out to travel throughout the land, the land of Hudson, to find other people who

2095
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:13,120
were like himself, but he stops to go to visit Queen Eliza, who lives in Castle Garland,

2096
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:18,700
which is also Hudson's Secret Castle, and then he found it was being attacked, and shenanigans

2097
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:19,700
ensue.

2098
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:27,100
So, basically, you run and jump and shoot bubbles, and you start off on the bottom floor

2099
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:30,980
of a four-story castle, and you have to work your way upwards.

2100
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:36,000
You've got three main stories, the side towers, and the very top.

2101
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,040
If you stay outside the castle too long, lightning bolts fall out of the sky.

2102
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,880
There are also enemies, hidden items, the bubbles.

2103
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,880
Don't stay outside or God is going to kick your ass.

2104
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,760
The Lord.

2105
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,720
Yes, the Lord is going to send lightning bolts down.

2106
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:58,620
The bubbles are also not just a tool, they are a weapon.

2107
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:03,600
You get weapon-throwing bubbles, and you can throw them at blocks to cause them to break.

2108
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:10,240
Also, there's hidden items, but there are also additional routes, hidden shops, different

2109
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,760
items you can find that way.

2110
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:16,680
You also can destroy demons that inhabit certain rooms, but they do come back to life after

2111
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,640
a while.

2112
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:23,780
You've got different bosses that are larger, basically bigger demons, and you have to use

2113
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:25,560
bubbles to spit at them.

2114
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:29,180
I'm sorry, I'm thinking of Bubble Bobble.

2115
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:33,500
They attack by jumping back and forth and throw fireballs at you.

2116
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:39,280
And then when they die, they release a crystal ball, like in Castlevania.

2117
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:44,480
And then Mylon gets Biggle Bubbles and he can fly them out faster.

2118
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,780
So you have only one life.

2119
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:51,040
When you lose your life, your game is over and you must start over.

2120
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,780
But if you hold left on the control pad while pressing start at the title screen, you can

2121
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,860
pick up where you left off.

2122
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:00,000
It does not work before collecting the first crystal.

2123
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:08,460
And this instruction was only in the Japanese manual, so folks in America had to figure

2124
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:12,700
that shit out for ourselves.

2125
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:16,540
Or import.

2126
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:21,520
Or if you signed up for their credit card, they'd tell you.

2127
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,820
So it's a really freaking difficult game.

2128
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:26,540
I mean, it's fun, don't get me wrong.

2129
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:29,540
It's just really difficult.

2130
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:33,140
It's got some interesting tidbits to it.

2131
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:39,600
So like I said, there's the left and start to start from where you left off.

2132
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:46,000
Mylon actually doesn't become invincible after he's attacked, you know, when he's hit that

2133
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,180
blinking animation.

2134
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:53,580
But each room in the castle has the honeycomb that restores your life.

2135
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:58,460
And extends it by one unit, so that was the honeycomb you were talking about, Rob.

2136
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:03,300
It also is a little unorthodox in the way the other 2D platformers can be.

2137
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:11,100
The rooms can be accessed in any order, and they don't really go like in one direction.

2138
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:16,420
In each room there's only the one exit that's at a fixed spot, but it doesn't appear until

2139
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:18,780
you fire a bubble where it's hidden.

2140
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:23,460
And then navigating each of the rooms, you know, like I said, it's free flowing.

2141
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:25,700
It goes around in different directions.

2142
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,820
You can explore it however you want to.

2143
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:32,320
Plus it also has a side quest of finding music boxes.

2144
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:36,400
If you touch a music box, you go to a mini game where you attempt to pick up as many

2145
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:42,940
musical notes as possible, with extra points for sharps and negative points for flats.

2146
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:49,780
And basically, each time you collect a music box, you get an elf with a different instrument

2147
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:53,460
each time, and the song gets more and more elaborate than they play in the background.

2148
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:54,460
That's right.

2149
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:57,540
This might surprise you, Darcy, I own this game, actually.

2150
01:43:57,540 --> 01:43:58,540
It doesn't surprise me.

2151
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:02,660
I had this game, this was one of the few NES games I had, this was probably one of the

2152
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:07,060
first games I actually had on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and yeah, I remember

2153
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:08,060
that.

2154
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:11,180
But this game was, no joke, this game was hard as hell.

2155
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:15,340
I couldn't even really get past just the first couple of rooms.

2156
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:21,940
GameSpot gave this game a really bad review for its control, saying that, and this is

2157
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:27,780
a quote from Frank Provo of GameStop, sorry not GameStop, GameSpot, that Milon runs like

2158
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:31,540
his feet are greased, his jumps are easily interrupted by nearby blocks that are adjacent

2159
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:32,540
or directly above him.

2160
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:34,420
He gave it a 2 out of 10.

2161
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:38,860
The one thing I didn't really care for about it is that most of the shit in it is hidden.

2162
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:44,400
Like there's, to progress in the game, you have to find all this hidden stuff, which,

2163
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:47,240
you know, when you're younger, you don't want to be looking for that shit.

2164
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,240
Ain't no one got time for that shit.

2165
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:49,960
Ain't nobody got time for that.

2166
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:55,520
Anyway, there was a Game Boy version that came out.

2167
01:44:55,520 --> 01:45:05,120
There was also, in 1993, there was Mira no Meikyu Kyumi Kyoku, that's almost a tongue,

2168
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:11,760
which was just called Milon's May Suite, and it did come out in the U.S. as well.

2169
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:17,360
There were a lot of different differences, the Game Boy version had smaller rooms, it

2170
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:24,960
had less stuff, and then you had like different money between the different versions.

2171
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:31,480
There was also a sequel that came out for the Super Famicom, which was only out in Japan,

2172
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:41,720
called Doremi Fantasy Mira no Doki Doki Daibouken, and there were also other sequels that were

2173
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:44,160
all Satellaview games.

2174
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:51,360
There was BS Doremi No. 2, BS Doremi Okuno Original Sound Witch, Blue Sword Witch, and

2175
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:56,080
BS Doremi Okuno Original Sound Witch Power Sound Witch.

2176
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:05,200
So there were also cameos by Milon, or Miron, in the Sega Saturn Saturn Bomberman and in

2177
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:10,280
Star Soldier, where there are Milon titles to be discovered, and then there's a puzzle

2178
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:18,720
game that came out on the DS called Mira no Hoshizora Shabon Puzzle-Kumi Kyoku.

2179
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:26,200
And then, yeah, there were also, though, it did, on the Japanese Hudson channel for PS2

2180
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:31,360
and the Wii's Virtual Console, there was a re-release of this, and there's also a Nintendo

2181
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,480
3DS Virtual Console one as well.

2182
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:36,520
Came out October of 2013.

2183
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,760
And actually, it did come out in the PAL region as well.

2184
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,120
So there you go.

2185
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,960
There it is, your classic game of the week, the hardest hell and hard to control, but

2186
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,720
still relatively unique.

2187
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:50,160
I'm going to eventually say Kumi Kyoku properly.

2188
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,920
Kumi Kyoku.

2189
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:55,200
Milon's Secret Castle, or Milon's Secret Castle.

2190
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,760
Meikyu Kumi Kyoku Mira no Daibouken.

2191
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:01,080
Oh god, we're seeing it in the YouTube right now.

2192
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:04,240
That's that boss, I never could get past this guy, he was too hard.

2193
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,120
Is this a speedrun or a full play?

2194
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:10,080
I think it's a full play, because the guy was stuck in that one room for forever.

2195
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:11,640
What is that, a giant dragon?

2196
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:14,600
It's like, it looks like Kraid from Metroid.

2197
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:18,120
I thought, doesn't he look like, he looks like a winged hyena.

2198
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:19,760
It looks like his feet are going to tickle you.

2199
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:20,760
It's like tickle tickle tickle.

2200
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,200
He kind of looks like a winged hyena.

2201
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,720
It looks like Bowser.

2202
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:28,080
It looks like every room is the same, I can't tell it's red.

2203
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,920
It might be, well that's the outside of the castle, now he's, oh god, I remember this

2204
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,320
room where he flew through the little.

2205
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,040
Now I feel like he's playing Metroid in a way, I don't know why.

2206
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,880
Alright, anyway, sorry, this is Bionic Commander, horrible radio while we're talking about

2207
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,880
a video here.

2208
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,080
And Blinder, yes, it was Do Re Mi.

2209
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:46,400
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

2210
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,920
Hey guys, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere.

2211
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:49,920
Do Re Mi.

2212
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:50,920
Faso Latido?

2213
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:51,920
I was explaining.

2214
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:52,920
A deer?

2215
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:53,920
A female deer?

2216
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,920
Oh fuck, wrong.

2217
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:59,560
Alright, anyway, don't go anywhere guys, we've got plenty more Orange Lawn training to come.

2218
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:04,160
Your answers to the Frugal Question of the Week, mailbag, phone calls, and is Jonas

2219
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:07,040
going to be here for the FUs of the week?

2220
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,520
I cannot wait.

2221
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:11,520
So we'll be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

2222
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:23,520
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this August the 3rd of 2014, with

2223
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:28,480
the 562nd episode of our show already in progress.

2224
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:34,920
Joining us in the studio tonight, Jonas and Diego from the T-Baggers, which actually means

2225
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:36,720
the Big Anime Game Room.

2226
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,800
There you go, either way sounds great.

2227
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:46,320
But well, did you, have you guys got, I guess your website is tabgr.org.

2228
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:49,160
T-B-G-A-G-R.

2229
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:51,080
You know what, acronyms, I can't do it.

2230
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,080
T-Baggers.

2231
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,080
T-B-A-G-R.

2232
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:54,640
Okay, the Big Anime Game Room.

2233
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:59,760
So it's that dot o-r-g, so somebody in our chat said, T-Bagger orgy.

2234
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:03,480
Right, they're really just.

2235
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,480
There it is.

2236
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:05,480
All right, yeah, I got nothing.

2237
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:06,480
I got nothing.

2238
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,480
All right, there it is.

2239
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,480
T-Bagger orgy, wow.

2240
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,480
All right.

2241
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,480
I'm going to remember that one.

2242
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,480
That was pretty good.

2243
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,480
All right, that could.

2244
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,480
There you go.

2245
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,480
That's what it became there.

2246
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,480
Oh, wait.

2247
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:16,480
All right.

2248
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,200
We got some rapid fire news to get to.

2249
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:21,280
Your emails, the Frugal Question of the Week, all coming up here.

2250
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,720
So let's get into some news.

2251
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:23,720
Some quick news.

2252
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:24,800
All right.

2253
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,400
So PlayStation Now.

2254
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:32,400
We kind of talked a little bit about it when we were talking about EA saying PlayStation

2255
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,880
Now is now in beta, open public beta, I guess.

2256
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:41,920
And they've got a bunch of different plans available, I guess.

2257
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:46,360
And one of those, they're talking about something in the works is actually a subscription plan

2258
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:52,560
that would maybe be all-inclusive, although to be honest, based on how expensive things

2259
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:55,960
are now, I would be curious to see how much that would actually cost.

2260
01:49:55,960 --> 01:50:00,200
Because right now, what they have it set up, and it doesn't really make any sense to me,

2261
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:01,680
they've got four different options.

2262
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:06,960
You can either rent a title for four hours, seven days, 30 days, or 90 days.

2263
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:12,960
So for example, Darksiders, three dollars for four hours, six dollars for a week, eight

2264
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:18,960
dollars for 30 days, or 15 dollars for 90 days, which that's almost the price of the

2265
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:19,960
game itself.

2266
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:27,000
In fact, there's even some games, I want to say, that were like $49.99 for like 90 days.

2267
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:32,200
It's like, shit, just buy it either digitally or buy it used or something.

2268
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,920
I mean, at that point, what's the point in renting it for that much time when you can

2269
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:40,160
just buy it for cheaper?

2270
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:46,360
They're saying the pricing structure right now, of course, has been a major contention

2271
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:52,680
for a lot of people, and there will be reduced pricing on some four-hour rentals.

2272
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:56,480
Ooh, thank you, that's so generous.

2273
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:00,720
Also they're saying that they recommend that you have a five megabit connection in order

2274
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:04,400
to be able to utilize the service.

2275
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:11,120
And yeah, it's going to be coming to, right now, I think it's open to PlayStation 4 owners

2276
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:16,160
in the US and Canada, but later on it'll be available for a PlayStation 3 Vita and

2277
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:21,560
certain models of Sony TVs.

2278
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:25,440
I gotta be honest, for this thing to be utilized a little bit more, it's going to have to be

2279
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:31,000
a hell of a lot cheaper than it is right now, because that's just ridiculous.

2280
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:36,680
Three dollars for four hours, fuck that, just go buy the game or go rent it somewhere else.

2281
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:41,040
Bobby in chat loves to be Devil's Advocate, so here he goes, Devil's Advocate, yes, but

2282
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:45,600
can I buy Darksiders for fifteen dollars and play it on my PlayStation 4?

2283
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:51,840
True, you can't do that, but is really that kind of, you know, a premium price worth it

2284
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,840
for playing an old game like that?

2285
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:58,040
I would argue no, I mean it's just, if you wouldn't pay that much to bring it out of

2286
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:02,400
a red box, then why, I mean the streaming thing works well, great.

2287
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:07,480
I'll play your Devil's Advocacy right there, brand new Darksiders collection that's going

2288
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:13,240
to be coming out, I want to say is, I think $29.99, and that should be coming out in a

2289
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:19,040
couple weeks, on PlayStation 3, it's got the first two games and all the DLC.

2290
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,760
But not the PlayStation 4.

2291
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:22,400
Who gives a fuck?

2292
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:26,040
You're not buying the PlayStation 4 to play the original Darksiders game.

2293
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,240
If you want to play PS3 games, buy a PS3, I get it.

2294
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:36,280
I think it would have been nice, like say, for example, I owned Darksiders on PlayStation

2295
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:40,960
3, because I bought it digitally or something like that, see I was dumb enough to do that.

2296
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,520
I should be able to play that streaming for free.

2297
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:48,720
I actually deeply agree with that, because it gives digital enhanced value, because you

2298
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:54,280
lose the equity of owning the physical copy of the game, that you could go to GameStop

2299
01:52:54,280 --> 01:53:00,120
and give your, you know, fingerprint and urine sample in order to turn the game in for money.

2300
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:01,120
Yeah.

2301
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:05,320
So, you know, you lose that ability when you buy something digitally, but that would be

2302
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:09,640
a perk, like, oh, buy this game digitally, and you get your cross-buy of being able to

2303
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:13,240
have it on the PS3, the PS4, and the PS Vita, and you know, all this stuff through the magic

2304
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:14,240
of PlayStation Now.

2305
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,240
Woo!

2306
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:16,240
You know.

2307
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:20,000
It just, for me, it sounds like right now PlayStation Now is not going to be a service

2308
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,120
I'm going to utilize at all.

2309
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:25,960
And that's sad, because it sounded like it had potential, but.

2310
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:27,760
Well, let's wait.

2311
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,680
I'm not ready to throw it all away yet, because it will be very interesting to see what happens

2312
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:36,480
when they add the PS1 and PS2, because it will have additional features, like the trophies

2313
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:40,800
at least, that weren't in the original, and it will be, I kind of hope that if they do

2314
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,920
the subscription service, they're doing it for the PS1 and PS2 games, that's why we haven't

2315
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:44,920
seen it yet.

2316
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:48,520
And I hope that when they add trophies, Nintendo will go, hey, we can add trophies to our game,

2317
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:52,160
or whatever their accomplishments to you, whatever they're going to call their bullshit.

2318
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:53,160
Yeah.

2319
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,160
Coins.

2320
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:55,160
Stickers, yeah, coins, why not?

2321
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,160
Why not?

2322
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,160
Or power-ups.

2323
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,160
Power-ups, yeah.

2324
01:53:58,160 --> 01:53:59,160
Alright.

2325
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:01,160
What else, Loki?

2326
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:04,600
Also, it's back.

2327
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:10,240
Flappy Bird is back, because, you know, you probably haven't been able to play any sort

2328
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:14,080
of Flappy Bird games for the last few months, you know, it's not like there's zillions of

2329
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:23,560
clones out there, but yes, the official Flappy Bird is back on the Amazon Fire platform exclusively

2330
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:27,120
right now with Flappy Bird's Family.

2331
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:32,400
And Flappy Bird's Family, it's got some new multiplayer options.

2332
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:39,480
Right now, I think it's locked into, it's now on the Amazon App Store for Android, it's

2333
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:46,640
not on iTunes or Google Play, and apparently, I think they have a version out for the Fire

2334
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:53,360
TV, I'm not sure about the Fire Phone, but I just don't give a shit.

2335
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,760
I seriously don't give a shit about this game.

2336
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:56,760
Who cares?

2337
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:57,920
Oh, it's back.

2338
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,920
Guess what?

2339
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:02,400
Sorry that you're not gonna be able to play, you know, the Flappy Bird's Family right now

2340
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:06,840
because it's exclusive on Amazon, but guess what, there's gonna be a zillion Flappy Bird's

2341
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:07,840
Family clones.

2342
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:08,840
You know who cares?

2343
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:09,840
You know who cares?

2344
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:13,840
Kim Kardashian cares, because some bird's about to steal her tiara.

2345
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:19,520
Wait, isn't there like a Flappy Bird arcade game in Roseville Golf Land, a redemption

2346
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,520
game?

2347
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,520
Is there?

2348
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:22,520
Oh, why wouldn't that surprise me at all?

2349
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:27,840
I know they do Doodle Jump as one, and they do, I was just at Dave & Buster's yesterday,

2350
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,640
so I saw a lot of this crazy redemption shit.

2351
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:30,640
Fruit Ninja.

2352
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:31,640
Fruit Ninja's one.

2353
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:34,920
Infinity Blade is like a game, I don't think it gives tickets though.

2354
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:38,320
I still like Feeding Frenzy, maybe that's just because I actually win tickets when I

2355
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:39,320
play Feeding Frenzy.

2356
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:40,320
Anybody?

2357
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,840
It's alright, anyway.

2358
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:50,080
And then, last but not least, they're gonna have Paper Mario in Smash Bros.

2359
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,520
It will be a stage.

2360
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:56,480
Diego perked up for a minute, what?

2361
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:57,480
I had heard this.

2362
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,720
Yeah, sadly it's gonna be a stage, because that would have been too cool, and they can't

2363
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,720
do that.

2364
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,880
They had me go in there, I was like, Paper Mario's a playable character, it was just

2365
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:07,880
revealed.

2366
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:11,160
My favorite stage will always be the Picto chat stage, and I kind of hope they bring

2367
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:14,720
that back in one way or another.

2368
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:17,840
That was pretty creative, everything's being drawn around you, and you can be inside the

2369
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:18,840
whale.

2370
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,560
But it wasn't accurate because balls never showed up in the stage, and that's what people

2371
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,920
drew on Picto chat was balls.

2372
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:25,920
They should have...

2373
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,720
Of course they drew a lot of stuff when they pushed at him, I remember when that first

2374
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,720
started up, I was like, oh it's so bad.

2375
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:33,400
They should have a Mii Plaza stage, or like a Wii Sports stage.

2376
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:36,920
Or a Swap Notes stage that just shuts down part way through.

2377
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:38,320
How about that.

2378
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,320
Joke, anyway.

2379
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:41,160
In the meantime, you're fighting on cats.

2380
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:42,160
Missing a Go stage?

2381
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,160
A what?

2382
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,160
He said missing those.

2383
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:47,000
Everything's just glitching, and you got like nine of them.

2384
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,480
A Pac-Man glitch stage?

2385
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,480
Oh my goodness.

2386
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:50,480
There you go.

2387
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:51,480
Why not?

2388
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:52,480
Pac-Man's in the game now.

2389
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:53,480
We just need to have a game called Kill Screen.

2390
01:56:53,480 --> 01:57:01,000
I don't think it made your show roll, but there's also Galaga assists now in the game,

2391
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
so...

2392
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
That's kind of cool.

2393
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Yeah.

2394
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I hope it plays the little song.

2395
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,760
Alright, some more news.

2396
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:14,520
Hey, remember Awada missed E3 because he had had some medical issues, and had some, I think

2397
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:17,560
he had surgery for a bile duct growth was what was going on.

2398
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:22,240
Well, the good news is Nintendo did put out a little update through a spokesperson, Yoshihiro

2399
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:26,480
Minagawa, who said that Awada is recovering steadily.

2400
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:29,200
There's no interference with his business as president.

2401
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:33,960
So just a little update, he's doing fine.

2402
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:38,600
Also an update on the Wii U front, Hyrule Warriors, another game that people are looking

2403
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:44,280
forward to this fall, not just, you know, the Smash Brothers or Captain Toad, but there's

2404
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:46,280
Hyrule Warriors as well.

2405
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:51,400
And Hyrule Warriors sadly will not have an online co-op mode, because, you know, it's

2406
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:57,960
Nintendo and it's online, but there will be local co-op, because again, it's gonna get

2407
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:58,960
loco!

2408
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:05,400
You're gonna drink some far loco and play Hyrule Warriors.

2409
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:10,720
Has this happened at one of your cons?

2410
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:13,360
The Hyrule Warriors tournament, sponsored by 4 Loco.

2411
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:16,980
Wow, there you go, is that still around?

2412
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:17,980
They had to change it.

2413
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:19,600
I think they had to take the caffeine out of it.

2414
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:21,120
Right, because it was killing people.

2415
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:23,120
Yeah, that's usually bad PR.

2416
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:25,120
That's not a reason.

2417
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:27,760
They found out what the cans latched to their hands.

2418
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:30,960
I think we found the cause of death.

2419
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:36,520
So anyway, there will be local co-op, and there you go, but they will say there will

2420
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:39,220
be some other type of online play.

2421
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:44,000
The reason why this is relevant, Dynasty Warriors always had online play, and yet this is coming

2422
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,200
from the same people, yet, you know, just throwing it out there.

2423
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:51,440
Hey, let's talk about Justice Beaver.

2424
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:56,960
Hey, that is the name of the game, Justice Beaver.

2425
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:58,960
Order in the court!

2426
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:05,280
Gee, that's totally not a spoof on Justin Bieber.

2427
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:10,720
I hope Oranja Boom comes out and punches him in the face.

2428
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:12,880
That would be pretty awesome.

2429
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:20,320
Anyway, Justice Beaver is a platformer game that's going to be coming out for the Wii

2430
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,960
U and the Super Nintendo.

2431
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:25,400
Yes, the Super Nintendo.

2432
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:28,520
People want to make shit for old consoles, so why not?

2433
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:31,640
UnderVision is the company putting this out.

2434
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:36,480
The Super Nintendo will be the flagship platform, and they're trying to get a Super Nintendo

2435
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,800
virtual console release on the Wii U eShop.

2436
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,480
That would be kind of awesome, actually, if they could actually get a virtual console

2437
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,280
release on the eShop, even though it's not really a classic game.

2438
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:48,480
That game would be banned in Canada, I guess.

2439
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:50,760
Justice Beaver, would the Canadians not take lightly to that?

2440
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:51,760
I don't know.

2441
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,560
They'd probably all laugh their ass off.

2442
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:55,600
Probably, and then apologize for it.

2443
01:59:55,600 --> 02:00:00,840
And then the sequel, Justice Beaver Rush.

2444
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:05,360
Hopefully that's the end of the game, is that Rush just, you know, kills them all.

2445
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:07,680
Anyway, alright.

2446
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,680
There it is.

2447
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:09,680
That's what I've got.

2448
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:10,680
Dark Sakura.

2449
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:12,320
Oh, yeah.

2450
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:16,640
Well, how about LittleBigPlanet 3?

2451
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:19,080
Pre-orders are ready to go.

2452
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,080
As soon as...

2453
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,320
You could probably pre-order LittleBigPlanet 4 if you want.

2454
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:25,540
GameStop's like, sure, I'll take your five bucks.

2455
02:00:25,540 --> 02:00:27,620
Do you want to put that on your new GameStop card?

2456
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:31,740
That's how they sell the card.

2457
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:33,500
You want to guarantee that you get that DLC?

2458
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:38,580
Well, it looks like that if you do the order, you get a Sackboy plushie.

2459
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:43,340
If you order one at Target, his comes with a Target hat.

2460
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:47,700
And then the thing that interests me, a Dragon Age Inquisition costume pack, because that's

2461
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:48,700
all I care about.

2462
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:51,320
No, there's also other costume packs.

2463
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:53,540
There's the Mythical Creatures one.

2464
02:00:53,540 --> 02:00:55,700
There's Hidden Animals.

2465
02:00:55,700 --> 02:01:00,260
There is the PlayStation's favorite costume pack that includes Journey, Jak and Daxter,

2466
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:04,820
Sly Cooper, Loco Roco, Ratchet and Clank, and Tearaway.

2467
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:07,580
Many of which have already been out there already.

2468
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:10,620
So since Dark Sakura brought up a LittleBigPlanet plushie...

2469
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:11,620
November 18th, by the way.

2470
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:12,620
Thank you.

2471
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:16,580
Since Dark Sakura brought up the LittleBigPlanet Sackboy plushie, can I borrow your outfit

2472
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:17,580
and go to FurCon?

2473
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:23,060
If you want, it's really hot.

2474
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:28,700
And Dusty, there could be an infestation of Black Woodas in there and I don't even

2475
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:29,700
know.

2476
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:30,700
I'll fur-freeze it.

2477
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:34,460
Alright, I'll beat it out in the backyard with a bat.

2478
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:37,860
We don't want you to know about you beating it in the backyard, Rob.

2479
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:42,740
I knew, like, the minute the words were coming out of my mouth, I was like, stop talking!

2480
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:43,740
But I can't.

2481
02:01:43,740 --> 02:01:44,740
Because you know where...

2482
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:48,620
Yes, if you really want to borrow that Dusty costume for, you know...

2483
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:50,820
We'll get you some fumigation stuff, Rob.

2484
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:51,820
I really...

2485
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:56,020
I should take it to Dragon Con, but how am I going to get that on the plane?

2486
02:01:56,020 --> 02:01:57,020
Strap it to the top.

2487
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:59,060
It is really large.

2488
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:00,060
It is really large.

2489
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,060
It is really large.

2490
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:04,260
I'd have to take a whole other thing.

2491
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:05,260
Can I continue?

2492
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:06,260
Yes, yes.

2493
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,260
Okay.

2494
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:08,260
Alright, Your Highness.

2495
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:13,740
So Kmart has listed a game called Captain Toad Treasure Tracker for $39.99.

2496
02:02:13,740 --> 02:02:16,300
Apparently, it was a mini-game.

2497
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:18,500
I actually did not play this game.

2498
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:26,020
Oh yeah, it was a mini-game in Super Mario 3D World, but now it's going to be its own

2499
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:28,900
game, according to Kmart listings.

2500
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:31,420
So who knows if this is real, because it's Kmart.

2501
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:32,420
The game is real.

2502
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:33,420
They talked about it at E3.

2503
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:34,420
It's the price.

2504
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:38,660
The price we didn't know, because that's lower than most games.

2505
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:39,660
It is...

2506
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:43,060
Yeah, I mean, it's lower.

2507
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:46,140
I could see them doing that, because I don't think it's going to be that popular.

2508
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:50,700
It is a legit listing, because I can see right now the model number is a legit Nintendo

2509
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:52,860
model number.

2510
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:54,420
So yeah.

2511
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:55,420
So there's that.

2512
02:02:55,420 --> 02:02:58,260
But I would assume the price is correct.

2513
02:02:58,260 --> 02:03:00,780
If they've got the model number, they probably have the price.

2514
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:04,020
Yeah, it's actually correct, because I was at E3 when I was playing it, and they were

2515
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,020
saying it was $39.99.

2516
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:07,020
Oh, they did.

2517
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:09,700
I didn't know they gave the retail price at E3.

2518
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:14,420
I think I remembered seeing something about it, and then...

2519
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:16,980
I guess the news here is that Kmart is selling something.

2520
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:19,980
I think I saw it and didn't pay attention to it, so that's why.

2521
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:20,980
Because...

2522
02:03:20,980 --> 02:03:21,980
Alright, well there you go.

2523
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:22,980
Oh, there's more news.

2524
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:23,980
There's more news.

2525
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:24,980
Yeah, why...

2526
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:28,300
Okay, so all the chatters that are like, the game was announced at E3, yeah, but sorry

2527
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:31,860
if we were paying attention to Splatoon or the cool stuff.

2528
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:36,620
Or sorry if some of us had Job and real life stuff to worry about.

2529
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:39,300
I saw the stuff on Kirby Treasure Tracker.

2530
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:42,660
I just thought it looked so boring that I just didn't give a shit.

2531
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:44,860
No, I didn't realize the price had already been out there.

2532
02:03:44,860 --> 02:03:45,860
I thought that was the new thing.

2533
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:46,860
Alright, whatever.

2534
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:47,860
DarkSira.

2535
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:48,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

2536
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:51,860
I was busy worrying about real life for a moment.

2537
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:52,860
Sorry.

2538
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:56,460
Another thing too, if you are a fan of Zen Pinball 2, then there is a Guardians of the

2539
02:03:56,460 --> 02:04:01,220
Galaxy table to be out on Jul- actually, it's already out.

2540
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:07,660
It came out on July 29th for $2.99, and it's both heroes and villains from the universe,

2541
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:12,340
and should be awesome, as long as it has lots and lots of Rocket Raccoon.

2542
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:18,940
The movie, by the way, killed the box office, like 90 plus million, and they were only expecting

2543
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:19,940
it to make 70.

2544
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:20,940
Fuck you, Titanic.

2545
02:04:20,940 --> 02:04:25,900
So, well, I don't think it's going to go that huge, but it's doing very well for itself.

2546
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:27,940
No, Dan went and saw it without me.

2547
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:29,380
What a jerk.

2548
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:30,380
I know, right?

2549
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:32,820
Well, he better go see it again.

2550
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:34,180
I'm going to go without him.

2551
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:35,180
You should.

2552
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,180
We'll go.

2553
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:37,180
We can go on a date.

2554
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:38,180
We're going on a date.

2555
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:39,180
Let's go on a plater date.

2556
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:40,180
Alright, it'll be fun.

2557
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:41,180
Okay.

2558
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:42,180
Because I haven't seen it yet.

2559
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:44,020
I haven't seen him, so.

2560
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:45,740
Then Dan can take Alan to see it.

2561
02:04:45,740 --> 02:04:46,740
You know what, though?

2562
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:51,060
Alan and Shane went out last night to go have Mongolian, so, you know what?

2563
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:52,060
Oh, really?

2564
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:53,060
Yeah, there you go.

2565
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:54,060
So, alright.

2566
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:55,060
Moving on.

2567
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:57,060
Oh, it's the FUGL Question of the Week time.

2568
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:58,060
Maybe.

2569
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:00,220
Here I was talking about Guardians of the Galaxy.

2570
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:03,460
I almost forgot to get to Facebook and Google Plus.

2571
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:06,180
You slam those words together, you get FUGL.

2572
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:07,580
It's the FUGL Question of the Week.

2573
02:05:07,580 --> 02:05:11,100
Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and we read some

2574
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:12,700
of our favorite answers here on Air.

2575
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:14,820
If I'm feeling quite generous, I'll read all of them.

2576
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:18,100
Well, tonight, I had to ask something about that GameStop credit card.

2577
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:22,740
So, the question we asked, did you hear about the controversial new credit card at the Evil

2578
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:23,740
G?

2579
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:28,060
This makes us think about crazy lengths you might have gone to in the past to play the

2580
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:29,660
game you want.

2581
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:35,180
What's the craziest thing you've ever done to either A, get a great deal on a game, or

2582
02:05:35,180 --> 02:05:38,260
B, get your hands on the game at all?

2583
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:41,820
Now, the weird thing about this FUGL Question of the Week is we had a lot of people that

2584
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:47,740
just kind of responded to the story, and not really the question, but, okay, it's the show

2585
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:50,940
where every gamer has a voice, and there are some really interesting opinions on it, so

2586
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:51,940
I'll read all the answers anyway.

2587
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:53,580
This is the show where nobody reads.

2588
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:54,580
You have to clearly...

2589
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:55,580
This is...

2590
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:58,540
Did you not read the sign on the door before you came in?

2591
02:05:58,540 --> 02:05:59,700
This is the 2000s.

2592
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:00,700
No one reads.

2593
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:01,700
They assume.

2594
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:02,700
All right.

2595
02:06:02,700 --> 02:06:03,700
No, it's fine.

2596
02:06:03,700 --> 02:06:04,700
I'm just giving you guys some crap.

2597
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:07,420
Well, clearly, people wanted to comment on the credit card, and that's fine.

2598
02:06:07,420 --> 02:06:11,540
So let's start with our buddy Renee from Killer Queens from Outer Space, who did answer the

2599
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:16,940
question at hand, who said, being a part-time street corner pharmaceutical representative

2600
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:22,620
in order to save up enough moneys to purchase the Sega CD system and a couple of titles.

2601
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:27,300
Girl, you sold weed so you could play Night Trap?

2602
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:29,420
Is that what you're saying?

2603
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:32,180
Is that what I'm hearing?

2604
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:35,220
What is a part-time street corner pharmaceutical representative?

2605
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:36,220
That is...

2606
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:37,220
Is that a weed salesman?

2607
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:44,140
Anyhow, AZHP says, this sounds like it's meant for the irresponsible college student who

2608
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:48,780
gets their first credit card at the same time they move out but have no job, buy a whole

2609
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:52,360
bunch of things on credit saying, I can make the minimum and pay it off when I get a job

2610
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:53,360
at a college.

2611
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,740
Then five years later, they realize they've got thousands of dollars in debt in addition

2612
02:06:56,740 --> 02:06:59,500
to their student loans and have to go bankrupt to 23 years old.

2613
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:02,700
I guess if GameStop wants a piece of that pie, go for it.

2614
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:06,420
It's no stinkier than any other retail-based credit card offer for Macy's, even if the

2615
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:08,020
APR is higher.

2616
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:13,220
Degenerate Johnny says, back to the crazy thing you did for a game, I convinced my family

2617
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:15,660
to do a yearly present trade-off.

2618
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:17,920
No presents for me for an entire year.

2619
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:20,060
No birthday presents, no Christmas presents, et cetera.

2620
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:23,900
In exchange, they would purchase an Atari Jaguar for me when it came out.

2621
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:26,940
I was a big Aliens vs. Predator fan back then.

2622
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:31,540
Well, and Tempest 2000 was definitely worth getting a Jaguar for as well.

2623
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:35,180
All right, let's see.

2624
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:39,780
Elliot B. responded, saying, I spent the majority of a family holiday in New York traipsing

2625
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:41,620
around shops for a DS.

2626
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:46,060
It wasn't available in the UK at that point, and even in New York, it was sold out everywhere.

2627
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:49,620
Eventually I managed to find one in Times Square, and I was the coolest kid in school

2628
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:52,500
until it came out in the UK three months later.

2629
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:57,900
Jonathan L. said, during the PlayStation Network's sales a few months ago, I bought three months

2630
02:07:57,900 --> 02:08:03,740
of PlayStation Plus to get some PS3 games cheap, but I don't actually have a PS3.

2631
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:08,700
I'll get one eventually, and when I do, I have some HD remakes waiting to download.

2632
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:11,540
So he bought games for a system he doesn't even own.

2633
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:13,020
That is going to pretty great lengths.

2634
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:18,260
SG100Matt says, when the DS Lite came out, I went to several Circuit City stores, bought

2635
02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:23,020
a few $6 PlayStation 2 games, and returned them to Walmart for $35 each.

2636
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:28,300
I ended up with about $130 in store credit after only spending 36 collectively at various

2637
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:29,900
Circuit City stores.

2638
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:31,980
With that store credit, I bought a DS Lite.

2639
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:36,580
I understand this is a highly unethical tactic and probably illegal, but I was a young, crafty

2640
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:39,460
college student and a big cheapskate.

2641
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:44,020
A few more answers on the credit card front, Chigurh says, I am swamped with credit card

2642
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:47,460
debt, and if I ever get out of it, I will never let it happen again.

2643
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:49,740
These things are evil.

2644
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:51,900
And lastly, Alan Alchemy, that's right.

2645
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:55,820
My partner couldn't read the question and answered.

2646
02:08:55,820 --> 02:08:56,820
Way to go, Alan.

2647
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:57,820
No, but you know what?

2648
02:08:57,820 --> 02:08:58,820
Heart, heart.

2649
02:08:58,820 --> 02:09:01,460
This is a good piece of feedback on the credit card issues.

2650
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:05,860
Alan Alchemy says, I don't mind it because they can't pitch it to anyone who looks under

2651
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:10,420
18, but this is no different from when we're harassed at Target for their card.

2652
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:14,260
They're just joining the big kids table, which makes sense since video games is a multi-billion

2653
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:15,460
dollar industry.

2654
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:20,160
The main issue is that 18th birthday, no credit, horrible interest rate, foreshadowing of fucking

2655
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:24,180
up their credit rating forever, risk angle, but that's not GameStop's problem and will

2656
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:26,320
just happen on some other store's card.

2657
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:29,700
The interest rate is gross, but similar to what Providian and Capital One provides for

2658
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:30,980
the same demographic.

2659
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:36,220
$20 up front is a pretty lame perk too, but oh well.

2660
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:42,100
Well let's check out over on Google Plus and see if people actually was answering the question

2661
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:44,060
or was answering the credit card feature.

2662
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:45,340
Again, I'm just giving you guys crap.

2663
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:48,060
I actually think the answers on the credit card front are great.

2664
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:50,020
It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

2665
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:53,780
Let's see, we have a couple answers and they are both about the crazy questions.

2666
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:57,660
So Act Def says, I think the most crazy thing I've done to get my hands on a video game

2667
02:09:57,660 --> 02:09:59,380
is probably overpay for one.

2668
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:03,060
I wanted a copy of Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney when it first came out, but it was super rare

2669
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:10,180
to get, so I paid $50 USD for a used when it actually cost $30 USD new, but it was kind

2670
02:10:10,180 --> 02:10:13,940
of hard to actually find a new copy at that price, so at the time I didn't mind.

2671
02:10:13,940 --> 02:10:18,220
Sadly, a few months later, Capcom decided to print more copies of the game, oh well.

2672
02:10:18,220 --> 02:10:23,500
And lastly, Retertainment says, when I was a kid, I mowed lawns to buy a Game Boy.

2673
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:27,700
Due to me being a ginger, this resulted in me bursting into flames on a regular basis

2674
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:29,860
due to walking outside.

2675
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:31,780
Flame on!

2676
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:34,100
There it is, the answers to the FUGO question of the week.

2677
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:36,700
I'll pose the question in the room, does anybody want to answer?

2678
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:40,220
We already talked about the credit card thing, but what was the craziest thing you ever did

2679
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:42,420
to get your hands on a game?

2680
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:48,140
I paid $210 USD to get the Sailor Moon S fighting game, and I ordered it COD in Alabama, which

2681
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:50,140
was the only way I could get it.

2682
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:53,300
I saved up for like six months.

2683
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:56,420
And then my grandma drove me around to five different stores until we went to Montgomery

2684
02:10:56,420 --> 02:10:59,180
Wards so I could buy Killer Instinct.

2685
02:10:59,180 --> 02:11:00,180
Awesome.

2686
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:01,180
In Alabama.

2687
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:02,180
That's awesome.

2688
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:06,660
I bought press kits to play games early.

2689
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:07,900
Wow!

2690
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:09,860
Several times.

2691
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:15,380
I paid, I think $120 USD for the Motorstorm Apocalypse press kit, but I got to play the

2692
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:19,540
game over a month before it came out.

2693
02:11:19,540 --> 02:11:25,500
I did that for DJ Hero 2, or you know, DJ Hero, the original one.

2694
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:29,620
I remember I got the, I don't remember if it was the first or second one, but I got

2695
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:33,620
the DJ Hero turntable, like a beta one that was wired.

2696
02:11:33,620 --> 02:11:34,820
I remember that.

2697
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:36,420
And then I got the demo disc with that.

2698
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:37,420
You used to buy that?

2699
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:38,420
Worth it.

2700
02:11:38,420 --> 02:11:39,420
It was awesome.

2701
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,500
You used to buy that crazy shit all the time, and I was like, how much did you spend on

2702
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:43,060
that, Logie?

2703
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:48,040
Anyway, I would say honestly the craziest thing I did was I imported a Japanese PlayStation

2704
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:50,300
2 to play Beatmania 2DX.

2705
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:51,300
That was pretty crazy.

2706
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:53,940
That was a lot of money to be able to do that.

2707
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:58,740
We bought the one that Game Master had, their last, which was the first model, the Japanese

2708
02:11:58,740 --> 02:11:59,740
PlayStation 2.

2709
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:00,740
Nice.

2710
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:01,740
By the way, still works.

2711
02:12:01,740 --> 02:12:02,740
I know, yeah.

2712
02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:03,740
Mine probably still works too.

2713
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:07,420
I don't know if you can, it stopped working with my TV at some point.

2714
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:09,460
Like some of the older games didn't work.

2715
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:12,660
Jonas, Diego, anything crazy you guys did?

2716
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:13,660
Might be gamer related.

2717
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:18,660
When I actually purchased Iguana Girls, a Japanese PlayStation 2, because she wasn't

2718
02:12:18,660 --> 02:12:23,220
using, I think she wanted to sell it like with Beatmania and stuff.

2719
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:28,660
In the top of buying the DDR pass for cheap, I decided to compulsively buy a lot of the

2720
02:12:28,660 --> 02:12:34,620
Bemani and DDR games just to keep up with the gamers at the time.

2721
02:12:34,620 --> 02:12:36,500
Yeah, as most music game nerds would do.

2722
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:37,500
They have to have them all.

2723
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:43,620
I've got to get 7th style, 8th style, 9th style, 10th style, and they have them all.

2724
02:12:43,620 --> 02:12:48,500
And we provided a lot of the stuff for the community, for the cons.

2725
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:53,540
In addition to that, with the buying the games, we compulsively bought repair kits

2726
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:58,100
for the pads too, because as much as people start stomping with heels, we have to repair

2727
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:00,420
the hell out of those.

2728
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:03,660
It gets pricey, but we did it for all the fans.

2729
02:13:03,660 --> 02:13:05,580
Alright, I did it for the fans.

2730
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:08,740
Alright, Diego, any crazy purchases you made?

2731
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:12,820
Yeah, also hanging out with Jonas and all, some of his friends got me into music games

2732
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:19,940
and such, but when I was getting into imports, I went online and bought a Japanese Wii and

2733
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:23,380
got Brawl when it was released in Japan before it came out in America.

2734
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:24,380
Oh, dang.

2735
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:25,380
Okay.

2736
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:27,060
So we had it over here quite early and people were on that.

2737
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:30,140
And the amazing thing about that is that the names are different.

2738
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:31,740
Two of the names are different in Japanese.

2739
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:35,860
They call Bowser Koopa, King Koopa, or just Koopa, which is amazing.

2740
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:39,300
And they call Jigglypuff Purrin.

2741
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:44,620
And Pokemon Trainer was, I don't know, they said it in a different tone, and Rob was called

2742
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:45,620
Robot.

2743
02:13:45,620 --> 02:13:46,620
Okay.

2744
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:47,620
Yeah.

2745
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:48,620
Wow.

2746
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:52,300
So we had that for about a good three to four months before it was released in America.

2747
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:53,300
Huh.

2748
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:54,300
Yeah.

2749
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:55,300
So we're showcasing it over here.

2750
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:57,060
I did that too and I wasn't even a big fan of Smash Brothers.

2751
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:58,300
I just wanted to play it early.

2752
02:13:58,300 --> 02:13:59,740
Yeah, you just had to have it early.

2753
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:00,740
That's it.

2754
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:02,780
But see, I didn't buy an import system.

2755
02:14:02,780 --> 02:14:08,620
I put a mod chip in mine instead, which, that was scary because at the time I wasn't very

2756
02:14:08,620 --> 02:14:09,620
good at soldering.

2757
02:14:09,620 --> 02:14:11,260
I was like, I'm going to fuck this up.

2758
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:12,260
I'm going to fuck this up.

2759
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:13,260
I'm going to fuck this up.

2760
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:14,260
And it worked!

2761
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:15,260
Yay!

2762
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:18,140
I've heard people who were just flimsy on that and they just screwed up their entire

2763
02:14:18,140 --> 02:14:19,140
Wii system.

2764
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:20,500
I'm like, well, there goes the warranty.

2765
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:21,500
You just screwed with it.

2766
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:22,500
So.

2767
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:23,500
Yeah.

2768
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:25,660
By the way, you know, we have a switch on the back of our GameCube.

2769
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:26,660
It's not hooked to anything.

2770
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:28,260
We just have a switch on the back of our GameCube.

2771
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:29,260
It's just there.

2772
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:32,300
We put it there, starting to mod it, and we didn't think we'd do anything with it.

2773
02:14:32,300 --> 02:14:34,300
So now we just have a switch.

2774
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:38,580
I miss the days of the PlayStation 1 where you just plug that little guy in the back

2775
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:39,580
and bang, it's done.

2776
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:40,580
I remember that.

2777
02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:41,580
Oh, that's fantastic.

2778
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:42,580
I remember that.

2779
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:46,580
And don't forget about, though, trying to sit and go through all of the hoops that you

2780
02:14:46,580 --> 02:14:50,260
had to jump through to get PSO to work with the Ethernet adapter.

2781
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:51,260
Yes.

2782
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:52,260
On the DreamCube.

2783
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,260
And I got it.

2784
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:54,260
The DreamCube?

2785
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:55,260
No, the DreamCube.

2786
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:56,260
The Dreamcast.

2787
02:14:56,260 --> 02:14:57,260
Rob.

2788
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:58,260
She's the dream team.

2789
02:14:58,260 --> 02:14:59,260
Yeah.

2790
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:00,260
Fart, Rob.

2791
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:01,260
Fart.

2792
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:02,260
I will.

2793
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:03,260
I will.

2794
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:04,260
Anyway, moving on.

2795
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:07,860
Let's get back into some other news for the week.

2796
02:15:08,140 --> 02:15:15,020
So, Crytek hasn't been doing that great, and because of that, they actually ended up selling

2797
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:19,940
off some of their titles and assets to different companies.

2798
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:24,860
For example, Homefront The Revolution was actually sold to Deep Silver, the company

2799
02:15:24,860 --> 02:15:30,340
that was going to be publishing it, because I guess they just didn't have the money or

2800
02:15:30,340 --> 02:15:31,340
something.

2801
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:32,340
Whatever.

2802
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:35,940
But basically, they said, hey, we strongly believed in the potential of Homefront The

2803
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:40,660
Revolution and trust the new team to continue the path that they have been walking for the

2804
02:15:40,660 --> 02:15:44,340
last few years.

2805
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:52,700
And also to go along with that, Crytek also has this game called Hunt, which is a co-op

2806
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:55,020
monster hunting game.

2807
02:15:55,020 --> 02:16:01,260
Kind of think of, I don't know, Constantine or something like that.

2808
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:07,380
But this has actually moved from the original studio to now Crytek Austin.

2809
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:14,940
Oh, I'm sorry, from Crytek Austin to the Frankfurt location, so shifting stuff around.

2810
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:20,660
But I guess they did make a comment, though, I want to say, saying that, no, no, no, our

2811
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:24,740
financial stuff's okay, but you've got to wonder if they're starting to sell assets

2812
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:30,740
like that and move stuff around that maybe they're thinking of downsizing a little bit.

2813
02:16:31,220 --> 02:16:36,220
GameGuru in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com is asking, did someone buy TimeSplitters?

2814
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:37,220
No.

2815
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:42,180
No, sadly, I would have been excited about that.

2816
02:16:42,180 --> 02:16:45,820
I want to buy TimeSplitters, I just don't have any money.

2817
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:48,820
We'd take a dollar.

2818
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:51,700
That's my final offer.

2819
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:56,220
Moving on to some other news, this is about Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.

2820
02:16:56,220 --> 02:16:59,580
For those of you that have picked this up for the 3DS, this is kind of neat.

2821
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:04,020
A lot of stuff on 3DS, as you know, is region-locked, and that doesn't make the system popular with

2822
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:07,860
some people, because they've got to buy the import systems, but the cool thing about Monster

2823
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:14,220
Hunter 4 Ultimate is that the multiplayer mode is not going to be region-locked online

2824
02:17:14,220 --> 02:17:20,060
with North America and Europe, but the weird thing is, not Japanese.

2825
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:22,860
So it's still region-locked for Japanese, but North America and Europe will be able

2826
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:23,860
to play together.

2827
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:27,940
I don't know if that's a language difference, although there's other parts of Europe where

2828
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:29,260
they speak other languages than English.

2829
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:30,260
I don't know.

2830
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:31,260
That's kind of funny.

2831
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:35,220
Yeah, I'm not sure what went into that decision, but those walls coming down with region-locking

2832
02:17:35,220 --> 02:17:36,220
is a good thing.

2833
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:39,740
I mean, I know I have friends overseas that I would love to play World of Warcraft with

2834
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:40,740
or whatever.

2835
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:43,780
I mean, not that I'm really playing WoW anymore, but when I was, I would really love to play

2836
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:47,100
with them, but I can't, because they can't roll characters on these servers with the

2837
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:48,100
Europe game.

2838
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:49,100
It's stupid.

2839
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:50,260
It's so stupid.

2840
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:51,940
But in Final Fantasy XIV, you can, which is great.

2841
02:17:51,940 --> 02:17:53,700
I can play on a Japanese server if I want.

2842
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:56,020
I'll have lag, but I can do it.

2843
02:17:56,100 --> 02:17:58,420
I really didn't notice much lag playing on the Japanese server, by the way.

2844
02:17:58,420 --> 02:17:59,420
It's not that bad at all.

2845
02:17:59,420 --> 02:18:00,420
No.

2846
02:18:00,420 --> 02:18:03,620
I used to love playing with the Japanese players in Final Fantasy XIV.

2847
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:05,460
Because they freaking know how to play.

2848
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:07,660
Well, they used to respect the bard.

2849
02:18:07,660 --> 02:18:12,780
A bard couldn't get a fucking party because I had a kick-ass bard, too, so.

2850
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:15,460
Well, what I have to make a quick mention.

2851
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:19,420
I love playing with Japanese players, be using the little translator thingy, because they

2852
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:24,100
actually will make sure everyone's ready and move forward at the same time.

2853
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:28,500
Even if you were a complete stranger, you were still treated with basic respect and

2854
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:34,700
your skills are incorporated into the group properly and not just the party bitch.

2855
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:36,700
I'm sorry, healer.

2856
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:40,020
Some of those are very well organized, especially the Japanese servers.

2857
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:43,660
But they know you'll be lagging like a motherfucker, especially because that's definitely an American

2858
02:18:43,660 --> 02:18:44,660
right there.

2859
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:45,660
And they'll wait.

2860
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:46,660
But that's the thing.

2861
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:47,660
They'll wait.

2862
02:18:47,660 --> 02:18:48,660
Yeah.

2863
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:49,660
At least most of the ones I've run into.

2864
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:55,020
When I played Metal Gear 4 online, as soon as you get on those servers, they kick you

2865
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:56,020
out immediately.

2866
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:57,020
They just ban you, kind of.

2867
02:18:57,020 --> 02:18:58,020
Wow.

2868
02:18:58,020 --> 02:19:00,060
Because they can choice ban you as a vote.

2869
02:19:00,060 --> 02:19:04,380
Because seeing them playing that game online, when that game came out, that was probably

2870
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:05,940
the best Metal Gear Online I played.

2871
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:09,700
Because in Japan, it's a game and they have the online games separate.

2872
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:11,980
In America, it's just one game.

2873
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:14,940
And in going there and seeing them being so organized, I said, okay, I can see why they

2874
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:17,080
don't want to lose a match on that.

2875
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:21,720
Because if you're lagging it up, you're holding up the team.

2876
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:22,720
Yeah.

2877
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:24,360
All right.

2878
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:25,360
Let's move on.

2879
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:28,840
I guess we'll do one more story here, or no, a couple more stories here before the mailbag.

2880
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:29,840
Dark Sakura.

2881
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:33,960
Well, there's one about the best game ever.

2882
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:37,480
Hataful Boyfriend.

2883
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:43,240
If no one has ever heard of this game, I don't know why, because it's amazing.

2884
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:48,560
Basically it's a game where you get to, you're the only human left and all of the guys left

2885
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:49,560
are pigeons.

2886
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:52,520
So you have to date a pigeon.

2887
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:58,400
You're the last human woman in the world and you have to date a pigeon.

2888
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:00,920
You go to an all pigeon high school except for you.

2889
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:05,400
Anyway, this game has been out for a little while, since 2011.

2890
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:11,360
And yeah, this is done by, well, okay.

2891
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:15,360
It was actually done by a manga artist named Hata Moa.

2892
02:20:15,360 --> 02:20:20,740
And the people who did Amateur Surgeon and Foul Play are going to be putting this out

2893
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:25,280
through Steam for $9.99 on August 21st.

2894
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:28,400
And it's awesome.

2895
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:34,160
Hataful Boyfriend will have, there'll be a collector's edition called Summer of Dove

2896
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:38,160
that has a copy of the game as well as the downloadable version of the soundtrack, the

2897
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:43,760
digital comic by Moa, wallpapers of one of the game's pigeon heartthrobs, and a digital

2898
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,800
version of the yearbook.

2899
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:48,640
And so the world was engulfed in pudding.

2900
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:54,040
So what would be the proper etiquette when you go out on a date with a pigeon, Dark Sakura?

2901
02:20:54,040 --> 02:20:57,720
Does the pigeon pay, or do you pay, or do you go Dutch, or what?

2902
02:20:57,720 --> 02:20:59,760
You regurgitate your food to the babies.

2903
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:05,360
Oh my gosh, his mother birded it into their mouths.

2904
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:06,360
That's a fair response.

2905
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:07,360
That's a fair response.

2906
02:21:07,360 --> 02:21:09,360
Hey, cuckoo motherfucker.

2907
02:21:09,360 --> 02:21:10,360
Loki.

2908
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:16,840
Yeah, it's gonna be hard to follow up, but this is kind of neat, I guess, you know, they've

2909
02:21:16,840 --> 02:21:23,160
been working together for a while now, but Gust, the company that puts out a lot of different

2910
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:30,960
Japanese games, including the popular Atelier series, mainly on PlayStation 3, will now

2911
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:39,240
become part of Koei Tecmo, and this is gonna be effective on October 1st.

2912
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:45,080
And yeah, so I guess we'll see a lot more Atelier games from them, and maybe some more

2913
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:49,920
of the Arto and Leeko series.

2914
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:54,960
So these companies are merging and getting bigger and turning into super companies and

2915
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:55,960
Voltron.

2916
02:21:55,960 --> 02:22:00,320
Well, they're like turning from like small companies to mid-sized small companies.

2917
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:03,880
I guess Atelier wasn't really a huge, huge, huge developer, so.

2918
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:12,000
Well, Gust, yeah, they weren't that huge, but hey, it's good that they'll be around.

2919
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,880
Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

2920
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,400
Every week you guys send us emails.

2921
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:21,120
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com, and DarkSakura picks some of her favorite emails

2922
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:25,200
to read right here on the show, although I was gonna say, I don't think there was a big

2923
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:26,200
selection this week.

2924
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:30,000
We had a very quiet audience.

2925
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:35,120
I guess the show we did last week was just so powerful that everybody was just blown

2926
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:37,520
away by it and felt no need to email us.

2927
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:39,080
I gave everybody the plague.

2928
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:40,080
Alright.

2929
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:43,720
Again, if you want to email us, participate at orangelaungeradio.com, but in the meantime

2930
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:45,760
there's at least one email, right DarkSakura?

2931
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:48,560
What's up, OrangeLounge?

2932
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:52,240
Can someone remind Loki that Skeezy makes music?

2933
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:56,420
Here, Loki, give my next sample a listen.

2934
02:22:56,420 --> 02:23:01,360
If you have a certain mood or style that you think you can describe, I'm willing to try

2935
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:02,600
anything for you.

2936
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:03,600
He did send us music.

2937
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:07,080
See, I knew that would happen when you complain about not having music for your game.

2938
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:09,600
Somebody out there would be like, I do music.

2939
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:12,200
Yeah, there's, I don't know.

2940
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:16,840
There's a beat, I guess, but yeah, I'll take a look.

2941
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:19,960
I'll forward to the email so you can check out the MP3.

2942
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:20,960
Is that it?

2943
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:21,960
Um, no.

2944
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:22,960
Oh.

2945
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:27,080
Anyways, but I heard Rob say that he's quote too old, end quote, to be going to midnight

2946
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:32,040
releases, but I'm sure you guys have some good memories of standing in line pre-holiday

2947
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:33,040
season.

2948
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:36,880
Could you share some midnight release moments from the past with us?

2949
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:41,920
There was a time that Kristen and I bribed our way into the middle of the line to get

2950
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:46,400
wheeze with donuts and coffee.

2951
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:52,680
You found fans of OLR fans at, which is, which still blows me away that there's people that

2952
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:56,400
recognizes out there, but you found fans of OLR standing in line at target.

2953
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:59,760
We asked everyone in line, do you mind if we take this place in line and we will buy

2954
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:02,320
you donuts and coffee when Krispy Kreme opens?

2955
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:04,160
And they're like, sure.

2956
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:05,160
Nice.

2957
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:10,720
So, and then we stayed up all night writing bad fan fiction together, which was awesome.

2958
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:16,280
And then there was Waiting for the Dreamcast where, um, my friend and I went over to Barnes

2959
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:19,480
and Noble and got like really cheap, crappy horror books.

2960
02:24:19,480 --> 02:24:26,160
And we're reading about really bad vampire stuff in line at the mall sitting on the floor.

2961
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:30,340
My midnight release story was when Extrofer was my roommate at the time and he really

2962
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:32,760
wanted to play the Wii even more than I did.

2963
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:36,360
So I said, here's the cash, you go wait in line and get the Wii and I'm going to sleep.

2964
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:37,360
And I did.

2965
02:24:37,360 --> 02:24:38,360
And he did.

2966
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:39,960
And everybody was happy.

2967
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:47,880
Oh, now there was Waiting in Line to see, uh, episode one, which God, what was I thinking?

2968
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:50,840
Even though it wasn't, you know, it was a movie and not a game release.

2969
02:24:50,840 --> 02:24:51,840
Yeah.

2970
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:56,480
The coolest thing about the whole event, including the movie, were the people under the trees,

2971
02:24:56,480 --> 02:25:01,880
um, in full costume having a toy lightsaber duels until the cops made them stop.

2972
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:02,880
Yeah.

2973
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:06,280
I was at the midnight, uh, re uh, release of episode one as well.

2974
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:07,280
Yeah.

2975
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,840
I've done that for a few movies, but I don't do it for a lot of games.

2976
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:15,480
The last, honestly, like the last midnight release I really remember going to for a game

2977
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:16,800
was Final Fantasy 12.

2978
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,400
It was a long time ago.

2979
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:21,720
Dan did a bunch of them, but he worked at GameStop and GameCrazy.

2980
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:22,720
Yeah.

2981
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:25,240
Loki, any crazy midnight releases you did?

2982
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:28,120
Um, I haven't done too many.

2983
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:31,920
I mean, I did those for like the Grand Theft Auto games.

2984
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:37,000
Um, like the only one, the last one I remember actually going to midnight release for was

2985
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:43,760
San Andreas and that it wasn't that interesting to me and it was just kind of, okay, we're

2986
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:44,760
waiting in line.

2987
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:45,760
Okay.

2988
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:46,760
They're open.

2989
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:47,760
Pick up copy.

2990
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:48,760
Done.

2991
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:54,720
Um, the Wii stuff was fun, but at the same time I already had mine that prior that week.

2992
02:25:54,720 --> 02:26:00,360
So it wasn't like I was excited to get that day with the whole, I just don't have to do

2993
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:03,680
it anymore because like I can't stay up late playing the game because I have to work the

2994
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:08,040
next day and if I buy it on a place like Amazon or whatever, they deliver it and it's

2995
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:10,560
home when I get home from work and there you go.

2996
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,560
Yeah.

2997
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:12,560
That's pretty much it.

2998
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:14,000
I mean, that's what I'll do with Destiny probably.

2999
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:18,100
I mean, the only time I'd say that the exception for that is like if I'm going to get a game

3000
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:24,000
system day one and I really, you know, need it that, you know, ASAP, but the problem is

3001
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:31,720
though nowadays, cause I would just order it for my work and just get it delivered prior

3002
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:32,720
to release.

3003
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:33,760
I don't know.

3004
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:38,480
How about our guests, Jonas, Diego, any, um, crazy midnight stories for you guys to play

3005
02:26:38,480 --> 02:26:39,480
a game?

3006
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:44,360
Um, well, um, I would say also for the Wii when we were, uh, me and my friends were waiting

3007
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:50,120
for the Wii release, um, via Walmart and, uh, my one friend had, um, suggested that

3008
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:54,240
we would bring a, uh, foldable, unfoldable table, sit down with a couple of chairs and

3009
02:26:54,240 --> 02:27:00,320
play magic the gathering as we waited and it worked out so well cause, uh, we were so

3010
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:04,040
into our game that we forgot that time was passing by and a little bit of coffee that

3011
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:05,040
helped out.

3012
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:06,040
It helps out too.

3013
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:07,040
Yeah.

3014
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,840
But it was unusual cause a lot of people gathered around us and they're like, well, they thought

3015
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:14,440
we were gambling and I was like, no, no, no, no, these are just these cards.

3016
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:15,440
And they're like, Oh, okay.

3017
02:27:15,440 --> 02:27:16,440
We did.

3018
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:20,000
And they were going to go tell like security like, no, wait, this is not going down.

3019
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Like kick them out of line.

3020
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,680
Like, like you don't see chips here.

3021
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:23,680
You don't see nothing.

3022
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:24,680
There's nothing going on.

3023
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:25,680
There's no money on the tables.

3024
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:26,680
Let's just calm down.

3025
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:28,360
You probably weren't even playing for Auntie, were you?

3026
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:29,360
It's just magic.

3027
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:30,400
I know.

3028
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:31,400
All right.

3029
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:32,400
Jonas?

3030
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:36,400
Um, for, for midnight releases, I really don't do those kind of things.

3031
02:27:36,400 --> 02:27:41,080
But um, the last time I did a midnight release was with my girl, with my fiance now since

3032
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:42,080
we're never got engaged.

3033
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:43,080
For what game?

3034
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:44,800
Um, Pokemon, um, X and Y.

3035
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:45,800
There you go.

3036
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:46,800
All right.

3037
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:47,800
Okay.

3038
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:48,800
So I didn't invite her for, for first ever midnight release.

3039
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:49,880
That wasn't that long ago.

3040
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:51,200
So, so, okay.

3041
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,960
We went to midnight release and because she's like one of the only girls who actually play

3042
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:59,200
Pokemon X, Y, and that line, she, she just played a lot of people and kicked everyone's

3043
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:00,200
ass.

3044
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:01,680
So wait, she was one of the only girls in line.

3045
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:03,600
I would think there are tons of girls that play Pokemon.

3046
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:08,360
Oh, well, I was in the Folsom area, but almost everybody was all male.

3047
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:09,360
Wow.

3048
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:10,360
All right.

3049
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:12,960
Well, there are just parts of them that were female.

3050
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:13,960
I guess.

3051
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:18,200
Well, well, maybe it's the fact too that the women just, you know, they, they knew better

3052
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:19,720
to stay home and sleep and rest.

3053
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:20,720
You know what?

3054
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:22,880
I think midnight releases are fun sometimes.

3055
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:24,880
It's just, I'm old.

3056
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:25,880
Yeah, me too.

3057
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:26,880
And I like to sleep.

3058
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:27,880
Me too.

3059
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:28,880
It could be fun.

3060
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:29,880
I mean, it was just me and my...

3061
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:30,880
Get off my lawn.

3062
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:31,880
All right.

3063
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:32,880
But, but, but, but, but the rest of the email?

3064
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:33,880
Yes.

3065
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:34,880
Thanks.

3066
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:35,880
Much love, ESPZ.

3067
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:38,320
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

3068
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:39,320
You're welcome.

3069
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:41,320
There it is.

3070
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:46,480
Participate at orangelawntrader.com if you would like to take some of Dark Sakura's precious

3071
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:49,840
time to have an email read here on the program.

3072
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:52,000
You would take my time and my sanity.

3073
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
All right.

3074
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,480
Well, I guess it was good that our mailbag segment was a little bit shorter tonight because

3075
02:28:56,480 --> 02:29:01,920
after the mailbag always comes, the FUs of the week.

3076
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:17,640
I have two.

3077
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:25,720
The first one goes towards people who take up far, far too much personal space than they

3078
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:26,720
need to.

3079
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:27,720
I'm sorry.

3080
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:32,800
You don't have to sit on a public bench with your legs spread out to where you're the size

3081
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:36,160
of two people instead of one.

3082
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:37,160
Keep them together.

3083
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:38,160
No one wants to see your crotch.

3084
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:39,160
I don't care who you are.

3085
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:40,460
I don't care what gender you are.

3086
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:44,400
I don't care if you are a scrawny little two year old.

3087
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:51,840
I don't care if you are, I don't know, the biggest Bubba to have ever bubbered.

3088
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:52,840
Keep it together.

3089
02:29:52,840 --> 02:29:55,040
Dark Sakura just doesn't care in general.

3090
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:59,560
I think that if a guy is going to sit there with his legs spread out, like, come do me

3091
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:04,720
now, then I should be able to sit with my legs spread out and take up more space than

3092
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:05,720
possible.

3093
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:08,040
But no double standards.

3094
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:09,840
So men, keep your legs together.

3095
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:10,840
All right.

3096
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:11,840
Number two.

3097
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:12,840
Number two.

3098
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:13,840
The waiting.

3099
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:21,240
I want to know now, I want to know, I want the world, I want the world.

3100
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:22,240
All right.

3101
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:23,240
Loki, how about Europe?

3102
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:24,240
Here's the week.

3103
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:26,920
All right, ladies, let's let's be real here.

3104
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:27,920
Yeah.

3105
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:28,920
Crazy sometimes.

3106
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:35,520
And, and, and, and I know that you don't like it when men call you crazy, but hear me out

3107
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:36,520
today.

3108
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:43,520
Let's change the baby as I normally do, because he poops and my wife walks in and she goes,

3109
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:46,680
you don't say my name enough.

3110
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:47,680
I'm like, what?

3111
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:52,360
I'm like, you know, when we're having a conversation, you don't say my name.

3112
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:55,320
I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?

3113
02:30:55,320 --> 02:30:57,240
I say your name all the time.

3114
02:30:57,240 --> 02:30:58,240
How do I get your attention?

3115
02:30:58,240 --> 02:30:59,880
Nelly, can you go do this?

3116
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:00,880
Nelly do this.

3117
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:01,880
Nelly do this.

3118
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:03,580
It makes no fucking sense.

3119
02:31:03,580 --> 02:31:09,140
Why would a woman come into the room and like have this thought in their head and complain

3120
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:10,140
about this?

3121
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:12,000
It makes no goddamn sense to me.

3122
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:17,760
And maybe just because I'm a man, but that's why I call you crazy sometimes because you

3123
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,480
say crazy things.

3124
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:23,920
Maybe if you didn't say crazy things, I wouldn't call you crazy.

3125
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:30,240
No one is around you say, baby, I love you, you ain't running games.

3126
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:35,900
For the record, that is crazy.

3127
02:31:35,900 --> 02:31:40,800
Just saying Dan and I pride ourselves on making up weird nicknames for each other.

3128
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:46,760
It's not like, you know, I don't refer, like, I don't go, Hey, you, I mean, like, I say,

3129
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:48,680
I call her by her name.

3130
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:50,560
Like I call my kids by their names.

3131
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:54,440
I, when appropriate, I mean, like if I'm talking to you already, I'm not going to just say

3132
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:55,440
your name all the time.

3133
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,000
You know, like call her weird nicknames.

3134
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,040
No, I don't call her weird nicknames.

3135
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:00,760
You call her any fun pet names?

3136
02:32:00,760 --> 02:32:01,760
Nope.

3137
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:04,000
No, maybe you should.

3138
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,680
Well, no.

3139
02:32:06,680 --> 02:32:12,560
Make up a fun, crazy nickname and see if she likes that better.

3140
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:14,200
Like you could call her Nelly Pop.

3141
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:17,840
No, it's unfortunately, it'll just rub off on her kids.

3142
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:20,480
Like my, my son already, he doesn't want to go to sleep.

3143
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:25,000
You know, if his fan blades on the ceiling fan are facing the right direction, this is

3144
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
the kind of crap.

3145
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Oh no.

3146
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
So whatever.

3147
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I'm done.

3148
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,000
All right.

3149
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:36,040
Um, I don't have a whole lot of FUs of the week F F you to the fact that, um, I like

3150
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:37,960
only slept for like five hours last night.

3151
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:41,400
That would be my FU of the week because sleep is valuable.

3152
02:32:41,400 --> 02:32:47,440
Um, let me, let me, let's hear more about this sleeping for five hours a night.

3153
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:48,440
You know what?

3154
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:49,440
Tell me more about it.

3155
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:52,440
You're the one that had the kid.

3156
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:53,440
Kids.

3157
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:57,720
For the record, since there seems to be a mention of this in the chat, Dan just calls

3158
02:32:57,720 --> 02:33:00,400
me girl and I call him boy.

3159
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:02,760
That's what I call you too, girl.

3160
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:03,760
Girl don't even.

3161
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:04,760
All right.

3162
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:10,520
I didn't know Dan and I really do have weird names for each other.

3163
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:11,520
I'm not going to get into it.

3164
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:12,520
What Alan and I do.

3165
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:15,880
It's not none of your business, any of your businesses.

3166
02:33:15,880 --> 02:33:16,880
All right.

3167
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:17,880
Anyhow.

3168
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:18,880
Um, moving on.

3169
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:21,400
Diego, do you have any FUs?

3170
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:22,400
See FUs.

3171
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:26,320
Uh, well one that comes to mind, I just said just one because my one, uh, since like me

3172
02:33:26,320 --> 02:33:29,600
and Jonas do a lot of conventional work and such, and we always influence, especially

3173
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:35,040
at Fanime, we influence the, the three, uh, the three standard rule law of, uh, taking

3174
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:40,880
it, taking at least one shower, uh, please using some sort of deodorant and by golly

3175
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:45,720
drink as much water and food as you can because all these kids running around don't do that.

3176
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:49,360
And, and, and for the fact of being illiterate and such forth, or screaming at the top of

3177
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:53,240
your lungs when you're doing a tournament and they, they, they, they're staring at you

3178
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:55,320
and saying, did you call my name yet?

3179
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:56,320
Yes.

3180
02:33:56,320 --> 02:33:57,760
I, is there a Jason?

3181
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:58,760
Jason?

3182
02:33:58,920 --> 02:33:59,920
Jason here.

3183
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:00,920
Jason.

3184
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:01,920
Just an example.

3185
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:02,920
Let's just put it out there.

3186
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:03,920
Just an example.

3187
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:04,920
Jason.

3188
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:05,920
Jason.

3189
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:07,640
And about five, five, 10 minutes later after I disqualified this kid, he comes up, Hey,

3190
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:11,800
and I, I literally know where this kid was staying the whole time and he comes like, had

3191
02:34:11,800 --> 02:34:12,800
I been called yet?

3192
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:15,240
I said, are you fucking serious?

3193
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:18,920
All Diego, all Jason wants is for you to say his name.

3194
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:20,920
No one is around you.

3195
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:22,920
Say baby, I love you.

3196
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:24,920
If you ain't running game.

3197
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:25,920
Say my name.

3198
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:26,920
Say my name.

3199
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:32,640
Jason's standing in front of me lately.

3200
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:33,640
You're hired.

3201
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:35,640
You're on the megaphone.

3202
02:34:35,640 --> 02:34:40,800
I still can't, I still can't hear you lately, Mr. Jason's disqualified when I didn't hear

3203
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:41,800
my name then.

3204
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:43,440
No, you're still disqualified.

3205
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:45,120
It's not going on the wish list.

3206
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,120
You got to get the fuck out of here.

3207
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:49,120
I don't know.

3208
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:50,120
I try to improv there.

3209
02:34:50,120 --> 02:34:51,120
I guess I tried.

3210
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,120
I tried.

3211
02:34:52,120 --> 02:34:53,120
Good night, everybody.

3212
02:34:53,120 --> 02:35:00,560
This week, oh, you just, you just won OLR for the evening.

3213
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:01,560
Congratulations.

3214
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:02,560
All right.

3215
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:05,440
Well I would say, how can we follow that FU of the week?

3216
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:09,800
But then I remember Jonas is here for the first time in seven years.

3217
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:10,800
Let's hear it.

3218
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:11,800
Seven years worth of FUs.

3219
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:14,800
Well, I'll keep it short.

3220
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:18,920
I mean, I'm more calm nowadays for the past after seven years, but okay.

3221
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:19,920
All right.

3222
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:25,320
From the big FU to the person who stained my Wii U, it went from-

3223
02:35:25,320 --> 02:35:26,320
Wait, wait, wait.

3224
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:27,800
Who stained your Wii U?

3225
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:28,800
No, no, no.

3226
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:29,800
Wii controller.

3227
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:30,800
Wii remote controller.

3228
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:31,800
Okay.

3229
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:32,800
I don't even want to know what got on it.

3230
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:33,800
Wait, what?

3231
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:35,600
What was the stain?

3232
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:36,640
Okay.

3233
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:40,100
This happened at one of the events.

3234
02:35:40,100 --> 02:35:44,960
It was white at 10 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, it was like clear white, cleaned

3235
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:45,960
up.

3236
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:49,440
I come back 11 o'clock, it was brown stained.

3237
02:35:49,440 --> 02:35:50,440
The Wii strap.

3238
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:52,200
Oh, the strap.

3239
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:55,760
And we had to clean that up because someone pointed out how nasty it was.

3240
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:59,800
I'm like- Oh my God, so somebody tried to put it in

3241
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:00,800
their butt?

3242
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:01,920
Like how does it- No, no, no.

3243
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:04,200
Someone like sweat grease basically.

3244
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:10,080
I have some coworkers that the controllers are like, how the fuck is there like wax built

3245
02:36:10,080 --> 02:36:11,620
up on this shit?

3246
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:14,080
What are you guys like sweating like motor oil or something?

3247
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:15,080
I don't know.

3248
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:16,080
Maybe, maybe.

3249
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:17,080
Let's see.

3250
02:36:17,720 --> 02:36:18,720
Let's see.

3251
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:22,600
Another fuck you to like the whole story with the standing situation.

3252
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:28,080
Now for those who want to play the B-Money games in Sacramento, you might as well play

3253
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:36,720
them as soon as possible because we have unfortunately with the unknown audit, we have to take those

3254
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:40,880
games out before, actually with less than 20 days.

3255
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:44,920
Get ready to drive to Miggle where it's twice as far and costs twice as much.

3256
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:48,960
And sadly, that was actually the place where I can actually practice form a freestyle for

3257
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:51,120
the United States Championships for Pump It Up.

3258
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:53,600
I'm like, fuck, how am I supposed to practice now?

3259
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:57,480
And people are expecting me to be competing with two routines if possible.

3260
02:36:57,480 --> 02:37:03,560
Yes, I still freestyle, just came back out of nowhere, but unfortunately with what just

3261
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:05,640
happened it's going to be a lot tougher to deal with.

3262
02:37:05,640 --> 02:37:08,720
Well, people have been demanding Dr. Dick to come back too.

3263
02:37:08,720 --> 02:37:10,240
So someday, someday.

3264
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:11,240
I know.

3265
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:12,240
It's raining midroutine.

3266
02:37:12,240 --> 02:37:13,240
Yep.

3267
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:14,240
Someday, someday.

3268
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:18,480
Very, like 2% of our listeners get that joke, get that, that's it.

3269
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:23,120
A critical fuck you, and hopefully this gets into people's heads, fuck you to those who

3270
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:29,040
are trying to bring illegal like ROMs and stuff or even requesting it to the game rooms

3271
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:30,840
or even like hack stuff.

3272
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:37,520
FYI, you guys, there's actual companies like Nintendo, Sony watching these conventions.

3273
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:42,520
You don't want conventions to get shut down or get sued, you all know the strict legal

3274
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:43,520
laws of these things.

3275
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:46,440
And we don't want to be held responsible for that.

3276
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:49,520
Let's say this happens, let's say a really good event like Gamer X.

3277
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:55,880
Yeah, where 2K and Ubisoft are present, it's like, in Gearbox, let's play a pirated version

3278
02:37:55,880 --> 02:37:56,880
of Rayman.

3279
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:57,880
Yeah, let's not do that, yo.

3280
02:37:57,880 --> 02:37:58,880
Let's not.

3281
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:02,920
Like, I know this is a big issue with like the Project M community, it's like, look,

3282
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:05,040
it's a modern game, we can't do that.

3283
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:06,040
Right, right.

3284
02:38:06,040 --> 02:38:10,040
Because even Nintendo said don't bring that to us, we can't have that.

3285
02:38:10,560 --> 02:38:14,040
Again, we just don't want these conventions to get in trouble because it hurts the industry,

3286
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:15,640
it hurts us, it hurts the community.

3287
02:38:15,640 --> 02:38:18,360
You can go up to your hotel room and play all the Project M you want.

3288
02:38:18,360 --> 02:38:19,360
Yes, exactly.

3289
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:21,360
Take it out of public sight.

3290
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:23,360
Alright.

3291
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:26,160
Um, I think that's about it for now.

3292
02:38:26,160 --> 02:38:27,160
Alright, for now.

3293
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:29,160
For now, alright.

3294
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:31,360
There it is, folks, the FUs of the week.

3295
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:34,560
It was a little bit longer tonight, but you know, Jonas was here, that was gonna happen.

3296
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:38,560
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to your calls.

3297
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:42,080
If you want to call in and say FU, but then I can just hang up on you, but if you have

3298
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:46,880
something you want to actually talk about, whether we missed it or whether there's a

3299
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:51,480
new story that you want to give an opinion on, perhaps the whole EA Pass thing that we

3300
02:38:51,480 --> 02:38:56,360
talked about earlier in the show or, you know, you want to talk to us about the Evil G's

3301
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:58,840
credit card or whatever, we can talk about that.

3302
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:03,160
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, but first, we have a couple

3303
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:04,160
more stories.

3304
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:05,160
Loki.

3305
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:11,360
So, Monopoly has had several, several themed versions of their game, including a Super

3306
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:14,720
Mario Bros. version and World of Warcraft version.

3307
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:20,400
Well, now there's gonna be the Legend of Zelda edition that's gonna be coming out on September

3308
02:39:20,400 --> 02:39:29,960
15th and, um, it is all Hyrule themed and they've got, uh, you know, all sorts of cool

3309
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:30,960
game pieces.

3310
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:32,520
There's like a Triforce in there.

3311
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:33,520
I'm trying to see.

3312
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:34,520
This picture is so tiny.

3313
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:39,160
Soon to be seen in convention board game rooms everywhere across America, right?

3314
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:40,160
Yes.

3315
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:45,720
And, um, you know, apparently, I'm trying to see here, uh, oh, here we go.

3316
02:39:45,720 --> 02:39:53,280
The choice is that you'll have a bow, a hook, shot, boomerang, Triforce, or shield, um,

3317
02:39:53,280 --> 02:40:00,440
are gonna be available and, uh, also, I guess, if you want to shop at the Evil G, they also

3318
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:09,520
have an Ocarina of Time as well and, uh, six power cards that tweak the gameplay and some

3319
02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:13,240
sort of lithograph of the Hyrule map if you want to purchase it from the Evil G.

3320
02:40:13,240 --> 02:40:20,400
So, all right, looks kind of neat, I guess.

3321
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:22,320
I would like to get my hands on that, actually.

3322
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:23,320
I have that.

3323
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:26,120
There was a Mario Monopoly not that long ago that I have, like, it was like Nintendo or

3324
02:40:26,120 --> 02:40:27,120
something, so.

3325
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:28,120
Yeah, both.

3326
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:29,120
Yeah.

3327
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:30,120
So, why not?

3328
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:31,800
All right.

3329
02:40:31,800 --> 02:40:32,800
Well, one more story for you guys.

3330
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:36,800
This is a little bit of a warning to those of you that downloaded The Sims 2 by EA.

3331
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:42,560
Heads up, Dar Sakura, Loki, those of you that, uh, got your free Sims 2, it has come to people's

3332
02:40:42,560 --> 02:40:49,640
attention that, uh, Sims 2 contained Securom, which you might remember from a long time

3333
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:50,640
ago, right?

3334
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:51,640
Yeah.

3335
02:40:51,640 --> 02:40:52,640
We talked about this on the show before.

3336
02:40:52,640 --> 02:41:00,160
Securom was a pretty intrusive form of, um, uh, anti, uh, or the copy protection scheme

3337
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:03,760
that they would have in the game there that had the potential to screw up other games

3338
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:04,760
on your computer.

3339
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:09,080
Uh, it would bury itself in your registry and it's a real pain in the ass to get out.

3340
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:13,640
So, just a heads up, if you installed Sims 2, your computer probably has Securom in it

3341
02:41:13,640 --> 02:41:14,640
now.

3342
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:15,640
Um, you can get rid of it.

3343
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:19,220
There's, uh, you know, just Google it if you want a how to remove Securom, although look

3344
02:41:19,220 --> 02:41:23,380
for instructions, not for software, because the software probably has viruses.

3345
02:41:23,380 --> 02:41:25,180
So, there's instructions out there.

3346
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:30,140
Um, other games that have the, uh, Securom, if you didn't know, BioShock, Mass Effect,

3347
02:41:30,140 --> 02:41:33,580
Spore, which is a huge one, because this is a big part of the reason why people pirated

3348
02:41:33,580 --> 02:41:39,100
Spore back when it came out, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, Dragon Age 2, Final Fantasy 7

3349
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:44,260
on PC, the re-release, um, so there you go, so, uh, you might want to check your registry,

3350
02:41:44,260 --> 02:41:47,740
see if Securom's there, unless you don't care, if you don't care, then there you go, but,

3351
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:50,820
uh, if you do care, and you want to get that shit off your computer, you might need to

3352
02:41:50,820 --> 02:41:57,980
look into that, so, there it goes, so, you'll have to, uh, quarantine Sims 2 like it was

3353
02:41:57,980 --> 02:42:02,700
an Ebola virus or something, or, or, send it back to where it came, to, to, to its homeland

3354
02:42:02,700 --> 02:42:03,700
or something, I don't know.

3355
02:42:03,700 --> 02:42:07,460
Alright, uh, there it is, 1-877-GAMO-L-R, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd

3356
02:42:07,460 --> 02:42:11,980
like to give us a call, and, uh, we can talk about whatever's on your mind, while we wait

3357
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:13,860
for the calls to come in, if any come in at all.

3358
02:42:13,860 --> 02:42:16,860
For, for the record, Avast caught it, like, right away.

3359
02:42:17,260 --> 02:42:18,260
Oh, good.

3360
02:42:18,260 --> 02:42:19,260
Yeah.

3361
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:20,260
So, don't worry about it.

3362
02:42:20,260 --> 02:42:21,260
That's good.

3363
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:22,260
There you go.

3364
02:42:22,260 --> 02:42:29,220
Um, let's see, uh, I'm looking in our chat here, over at live.vognetware.com, um, cause,

3365
02:42:29,220 --> 02:42:34,180
Kossen says, this is why you quarantine Origin, I always mispronounce his name, sorry, oh

3366
02:42:34,180 --> 02:42:37,500
no, as my Vista partition has been corrupted, how will I live?

3367
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:43,420
Hey, that's what happened with Spore on my computer, our Vista, I think it's a joke.

3368
02:42:43,460 --> 02:42:46,860
Uh, alright, uh, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

3369
02:42:46,860 --> 02:42:51,100
Sure, this is pretty exciting, um, there's gonna be a brand new adventure, point and

3370
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:57,300
click adventure game called Randall's Monday, and why is it even more awesome?

3371
02:42:57,300 --> 02:43:01,820
Because Randall, or I should say, the actor Jeff Anderson, Randall from Clerks, will be

3372
02:43:01,820 --> 02:43:03,140
doing the voice of Randall.

3373
02:43:03,140 --> 02:43:06,020
I wasn't even supposed to be here today.

3374
02:43:06,020 --> 02:43:09,620
Uh, I believe that would have been Dante.

3375
02:43:09,620 --> 02:43:12,060
I thought they both said it.

3376
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:13,060
No.

3377
02:43:13,700 --> 02:43:20,340
Um, so, I'll probably have to get that game, cause it looks pretty awesome.

3378
02:43:20,340 --> 02:43:25,100
And I'll just pretend it's Randall from Clerks, even if it's not really Randall from Clerks.

3379
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:27,820
Randall from Clerks was the one that said, this job would be great if it wasn't for the

3380
02:43:27,820 --> 02:43:29,540
fucking customers, right?

3381
02:43:29,540 --> 02:43:30,540
Yeah.

3382
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:31,540
There you go.

3383
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:36,260
But you hate people, but I love gatherings, isn't it ironic?

3384
02:43:36,260 --> 02:43:39,860
Oh, that's such a good movie, I wonder if they ever will make a Clerks 3.

3385
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:41,260
I hope they do.

3386
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:47,380
I heard something where like, Miramax rejected the script, or rejected it or something.

3387
02:43:47,380 --> 02:43:50,660
Or whatever, the Weinstein company or whoever does these movies now.

3388
02:43:50,660 --> 02:43:56,500
Uh, 1877 game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, meanwhile I do have a few tweets

3389
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:58,460
I could read here.

3390
02:43:58,460 --> 02:44:04,260
One of the tweets is from SSG100Matt, who says, the folks at Overclocked Remix have

3391
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:09,820
released a Game Boy 25th anniversary album, and of course it's free, and you can check

3392
02:44:09,820 --> 02:44:14,540
that out at gameboy25.ocremix.com.

3393
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:15,540
Wait, free?

3394
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:16,540
Mm-hmm.

3395
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:17,540
I like free.

3396
02:44:17,540 --> 02:44:20,020
That's OC Remix album, they do a lot of stuff for free.

3397
02:44:20,020 --> 02:44:23,540
And yes, the Game Boy is 25 years old, are you okay?

3398
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:25,540
Okay, read it.

3399
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:28,340
What is this you're going to show me?

3400
02:44:28,340 --> 02:44:32,420
I had to show it to somebody.

3401
02:44:32,420 --> 02:44:37,140
You guys have problems, stop interrupting the radio show through Tumblr posts.

3402
02:44:38,140 --> 02:44:46,860
All right, uh, let's see, 13Forever, 13CrossForever, 13XForever says, as I can't call in, you and

3403
02:44:46,860 --> 02:44:52,580
any listener with at least passing interest in JRPGs should research Kiss Case series

3404
02:44:52,580 --> 02:44:54,460
and buy Trails in the Sky.

3405
02:44:54,460 --> 02:44:56,900
I'm not familiar with this one, Logan, you heard of this one?

3406
02:44:56,900 --> 02:45:00,700
Trails in the Sky is, I think, one of those games that was built with RPG Maker, and they

3407
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:04,920
actually have that part of the RPG Maker Humble Bundle, if I remember correctly.

3408
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:07,440
So yes, I'm a little familiar with it.

3409
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:08,440
Supposed to be pretty good.

3410
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:11,960
I don't know, Jamie would know she bought that Humble Bundle.

3411
02:45:11,960 --> 02:45:14,200
I did, but I haven't touched it yet.

3412
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:20,600
I bet I have it, I probably purchased it at some point, it's probably on my Steam library

3413
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:24,680
or something, I don't even know if it's on Steam or something, but I've got so many games.

3414
02:45:24,680 --> 02:45:29,480
Dartitsuya tweets us and says, on the whole Scandia controversy, some people were suggesting

3415
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:31,240
a Kickstarter, so stay tuned.

3416
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:33,200
What's a Kickstarter going to do in that situation?

3417
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:37,520
Open a Zone Arcade, that's a lofty goal.

3418
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:41,960
On the topic of that, it has been done for arcades before, I'm not sure if anybody has

3419
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:45,160
heard about the Super Arcade on Kickstarter.

3420
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:46,160
I don't think so.

3421
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:47,160
Tell me more.

3422
02:45:47,160 --> 02:45:51,160
Okay, so the idea of what happened with Super Arcade when they did the Kickstarter was to

3423
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:56,560
keep the arcade running because the guy was using all his financial assets to make sure

3424
02:45:56,560 --> 02:46:02,720
it runs, and to renovate to make it even look better for a wide variety of audiences.

3425
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:07,000
Right now, they're currently in the assembly, like reassembling the whole location.

3426
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:13,000
I think the idea of a Kickstarter would be great, but before even doing that, before

3427
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:17,280
the Kickstarter, they had to figure out the location, whether it may be in the Thomas

3428
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:24,720
area or even Elk Grove, or just a location where it actually suits everybody.

3429
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:25,720
Or those who are-

3430
02:46:25,720 --> 02:46:29,800
Downtown, sell booze, that's a great formula.

3431
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:33,480
Actually, downtown is kind of a hit and miss at the moment, because the reason why is because

3432
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:35,880
currently the arena is being-

3433
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:40,600
Oh, shit, yeah, and it's going to jack all the prices up downtown, too.

3434
02:46:40,600 --> 02:46:46,280
Yeah, it's going to jack up the prices downtown, and it may also make operations a lot difficult

3435
02:46:46,280 --> 02:46:47,280
because of parking.

3436
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:48,280
Yeah, makes sense.

3437
02:46:48,280 --> 02:46:50,640
I think everybody remembered Nickel Arcade.

3438
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:54,960
Oh, God, yeah, see, I remember that, that was what I was going to say, downtown is not

3439
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:56,960
a good place for an arcade.

3440
02:46:57,800 --> 02:47:01,200
All right, maybe Roseville, I don't know, they used to, speaking of Nickel Arcades,

3441
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:02,200
they used to have NickelMania and Rose-

3442
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:03,200
Citrus Heights?

3443
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:04,200
Who knows?

3444
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:05,760
I mean, not bad, I mean, no.

3445
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:11,120
But regardless, I mean, yes, there needs to be an arcade location, like at least known

3446
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:16,960
soon before the scramble, or the location the arcade's going to be at.

3447
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:17,960
Right, right.

3448
02:47:17,960 --> 02:47:21,320
Like, the arcade machines will be sold to other places, or will be kept still in the

3449
02:47:21,320 --> 02:47:23,920
Sacramento area for another location to keep-

3450
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:26,880
It'll be interesting to see what develops with that.

3451
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:28,720
Oh, yeah, the old Birdcage.

3452
02:47:28,720 --> 02:47:30,200
The old Birdcage Arcade.

3453
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:35,360
All right, 1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give

3454
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:36,680
us a call.

3455
02:47:36,680 --> 02:47:43,000
We keep talking about all this local drama, but there is a whole world out there of people.

3456
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:46,540
And Dartasuya in our chat room, following up, saying, yeah, they're just discussing

3457
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:49,040
it at the moment, but I'm keeping an ear out.

3458
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:51,880
Let's see.

3459
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:54,800
There's some folks talking about the Clerks 3 thing in chat.

3460
02:47:54,800 --> 02:48:00,520
SHO 100 Matt says, Kevin Smith is going to, but nobody ever got paid for Clerks 2, so

3461
02:48:00,520 --> 02:48:03,640
he's sorting out the legal stuff for the Weinstein's for that first.

3462
02:48:03,640 --> 02:48:05,600
So maybe they'll work it out, who knows.

3463
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:07,040
We do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

3464
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:09,200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3465
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:11,200
This is Rageinator.

3466
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:13,200
Hey, Rageinator, what's up, buddy?

3467
02:48:13,200 --> 02:48:15,200
Excuse me.

3468
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:23,640
Now, just a little bit of news, that beer is repeating.

3469
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:29,400
You know how for the past few weeks, I've been promoting or passing along information

3470
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:34,240
about the free games that have been given away by PC Gamer?

3471
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:35,720
We love free things.

3472
02:48:35,720 --> 02:48:36,720
Yeah.

3473
02:48:37,240 --> 02:48:46,240
Well, the promotion is more or less in its, quote, unquote, final week.

3474
02:48:46,240 --> 02:48:56,240
It's like they're essentially recapping the bundle that they've been giving away.

3475
02:48:56,240 --> 02:49:02,240
This is essentially the last chance to get any games that you may have missed.

3476
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:06,760
And there's one or two gems in there.

3477
02:49:06,760 --> 02:49:09,760
They're actually quite good.

3478
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:14,760
One of which is Dino D-Day, which obviously appeared for a while.

3479
02:49:14,760 --> 02:49:25,760
It's basically, imagine a PlayStation 2 era Medal of Honor game, but both sides,

3480
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:33,280
from human characters, you also have dinosaurs, the choice of playing as a dinosaur as well.

3481
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:34,280
Wait, wait, wait.

3482
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:35,280
You can play as a dinosaur?

3483
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:36,280
Yeah.

3484
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:38,280
Or a human.

3485
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:40,280
It's like Jurassic Park on the Genesis.

3486
02:49:40,280 --> 02:49:42,280
That was cool.

3487
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:49,280
Basically, well, like I said, in terms of graphics, it looks exactly like a PlayStation

3488
02:49:49,280 --> 02:49:57,800
2 era Medal of Honor game, and kind of plays like one or two, just with the inclusion

3489
02:49:57,800 --> 02:49:58,800
of dinosaurs.

3490
02:49:58,800 --> 02:49:59,800
All right.

3491
02:49:59,800 --> 02:50:02,280
I think everybody perked up when you said that dinosaurs were involved, so tell us one

3492
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:04,280
more time where we can grab this.

3493
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:17,280
PC Gamer, I believe on top of the websites, there's like a scrolling banner, and you just

3494
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:29,280
mentioned the increasing giveaway, and there's another really good one, which is a constant

3495
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:33,280
shooter called Really Big Sky.

3496
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:34,280
Oh, yeah.

3497
02:50:34,280 --> 02:50:35,280
I have that game.

3498
02:50:35,280 --> 02:50:36,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3499
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:43,280
Yeah, that's really fun, and I forget what else there is in there.

3500
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:47,280
It's a total of five games all together.

3501
02:50:47,280 --> 02:50:53,280
And here's the thing, Really Big Sky has trading cards in it, so hypothetically, you could

3502
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:57,280
grab this free game and then sell the trading cards, and you'd have like a dollar.

3503
02:50:57,280 --> 02:50:59,280
Yeah, exactly.

3504
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:07,280
And at Dafta, I see in a chat that at Dafta is asking what the website is.

3505
02:51:07,280 --> 02:51:15,280
It's PC Gamer, PC Gamer, gamer.com.

3506
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:19,280
And there's also this website called Google, and you put PC Gamer into it, and you're likely

3507
02:51:19,280 --> 02:51:21,280
to get that as the first result, I think.

3508
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:23,280
It's a pretty big banner that you can click on.

3509
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:25,280
I actually redeemed all of these.

3510
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:28,280
I already had Gun Monkey, well, except for Gun Monkeys, because I already had Gun Monkeys,

3511
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:31,280
and I actually have two copies of Gun Monkeys.

3512
02:51:31,280 --> 02:51:32,280
Wait, wait, wait.

3513
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:33,280
Monkeys with guns?

3514
02:51:33,280 --> 02:51:35,280
Yes, it's like Smash Brothers.

3515
02:51:35,280 --> 02:51:36,280
Cool.

3516
02:51:36,280 --> 02:51:37,280
What the heck?

3517
02:51:37,280 --> 02:51:39,280
But with Monkeys and Guns.

3518
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:42,280
Let's talk more about the Gun Monkeys.

3519
02:51:42,280 --> 02:51:44,280
First off, why don't you give a monkey a gun?

3520
02:51:44,280 --> 02:51:47,280
I don't know, you want a copy of the game, I have an extra Steam Key, because each one

3521
02:51:47,280 --> 02:51:50,280
you redeem, including this, if you get it for free, you get two.

3522
02:51:50,280 --> 02:51:52,280
Hell yeah, if Monkeys with Guns are involved, I want it.

3523
02:51:52,280 --> 02:51:53,280
I want Monkeys with Guns.

3524
02:51:53,280 --> 02:51:56,280
That's like Planet of the Apes again in the movie, right?

3525
02:51:56,280 --> 02:51:57,280
Do you know what?

3526
02:51:57,280 --> 02:51:58,280
This game is officially a virus.

3527
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:05,280
PC Gamer.com, go to the free Steam Key thing, you just have to like bundle stars and stuff,

3528
02:52:05,280 --> 02:52:09,280
but the thing is, you can always unsubscribe.

3529
02:52:09,280 --> 02:52:11,280
Yeah, like, key, unlike.

3530
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:13,280
Done.

3531
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:20,280
Yeah, you also have to bring your email address, but if you really don't want to bring an actual

3532
02:52:20,280 --> 02:52:25,280
email address that you use, you can make up an email address, like you can put in, you

3533
02:52:25,280 --> 02:52:33,280
know, fart.fartataol.com.

3534
02:52:33,280 --> 02:52:37,280
To be fair though, I mean, bundle stars, and there's a lot of other services out there

3535
02:52:37,280 --> 02:52:41,280
like that, they'll do a lot of these Steam bundles, and they're really, really cheap,

3536
02:52:41,280 --> 02:52:46,280
but then again, they're also really, really like, I mean, if you're looking to build up

3537
02:52:46,280 --> 02:52:51,280
your Steam library and you don't give a shit what's in there, bundle stars is the way to

3538
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:52,280
go.

3539
02:52:52,280 --> 02:52:55,280
Like, for example, they have this one bundle here that's $3.49 and you get like eight games

3540
02:52:55,280 --> 02:52:56,280
with it.

3541
02:52:56,280 --> 02:52:59,280
Yeah, but what games are they?

3542
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:02,280
You know, push space barf to change the color of your screen?

3543
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:07,280
I don't know, they have decent games like vector, which is sort of like, it's a free

3544
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:08,280
running game.

3545
02:53:08,280 --> 02:53:12,280
They have, this is actually a bad example, this one doesn't have a lot of cool stuff

3546
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:16,280
in there, but there's actually some other ones that were pretty sweet that I've gotten

3547
02:53:16,280 --> 02:53:18,280
before, there was like a racing one.

3548
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:23,280
Here you go, reboot 6.0, it's $2.99, you get postal, underground, block land, which is

3549
02:53:23,280 --> 02:53:27,280
actually pretty cool, it's like a cross between Lego and a first person shooter.

3550
02:53:27,280 --> 02:53:28,280
Oh, that's cool.

3551
02:53:29,280 --> 02:53:34,280
They have Steel Storm, Rock of Ages, and Expeditions Conquistador, so not bad.

3552
02:53:34,280 --> 02:53:38,280
I would have gotten that, except they have most of those games.

3553
02:53:38,280 --> 02:53:40,280
So, you know, $2.99 though?

3554
02:53:40,280 --> 02:53:50,280
Yeah, honestly, after the fact I saw the Hokies during the bundle stars group, I joined just

3555
02:53:50,280 --> 02:54:01,280
a sheer curiosity, and my only, although I'm in the minority here, my only problem with

3556
02:54:01,280 --> 02:54:10,280
buying games from the stars, or even buying games from Amazon or Google games or whatever,

3557
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:17,280
is that I'm probably one of the few people out there that does not have a debit card

3558
02:54:17,280 --> 02:54:26,280
or credit card or what have you, and even when I had a Playstation 3 or an Xbox 360,

3559
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:36,280
how I put paper stuff is through PSN cards or points cards or now Steam cards.

3560
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:40,280
Well, Raginator GameStop's got a deal for you.

3561
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:42,280
Look out.

3562
02:54:42,280 --> 02:54:50,280
Yeah, Raginator, they can ask with a chainsaw, they go to GameStop.

3563
02:54:50,280 --> 02:54:55,280
Wow. All right, Raginator, I gotta let you go so we can try to get some more calls, but

3564
02:54:55,280 --> 02:54:58,280
have fun with the dinosaurs and monkeys with guns, okay?

3565
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:00,280
Have a nice night.

3566
02:55:00,280 --> 02:55:01,280
All right, bye.

3567
02:55:01,280 --> 02:55:06,280
All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call.

3568
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:11,280
Maybe you know animals doing crazy things in video games that you want to share with us.

3569
02:55:11,280 --> 02:55:14,280
Jurassic Park, the movie, the fighting game.

3570
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:15,280
Was that actually a thing?

3571
02:55:15,280 --> 02:55:17,280
No, but I wish it was.

3572
02:55:17,280 --> 02:55:24,280
They have Jurassic World next year. We'll probably get some game tie-ins with that, at least I can hope.

3573
02:55:24,280 --> 02:55:28,280
I still remember the Jurassic Park game on Super Nintendo because it was kind of at the height of the goons.

3574
02:55:28,280 --> 02:55:31,280
Even the Genesis one was crazy. They're good in different ways.

3575
02:55:31,280 --> 02:55:35,280
They were totally different, but the Super Nintendo one had the first person super pixelated.

3576
02:55:35,280 --> 02:55:36,280
Oh, yes, I remember that.

3577
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:41,280
Like when the velociraptors would literally jump out from behind shit and scary.

3578
02:55:41,280 --> 02:55:42,280
Crazy little things like that.

3579
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:45,280
I still like the Sega one. You still sit down.

3580
02:55:45,280 --> 02:55:47,280
Oh, yeah, that's right, the mechanic.

3581
02:55:47,280 --> 02:55:48,280
Was that a side-scroller?

3582
02:55:48,280 --> 02:55:49,280
No, it was a shooting game.

3583
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:50,280
The arcade.

3584
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:53,280
That one was great, yeah, definitely.

3585
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:59,280
Which, by the way, I totally forgot what I was going to say, never mind.

3586
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:00,280
All right, fair enough.

3587
02:56:00,280 --> 02:56:02,280
One last chance if you want to give us a call.

3588
02:56:02,280 --> 02:56:04,280
Every gamer has a voice, but only if you use it.

3589
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:08,280
1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3590
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:11,280
Tigerclaw reminding us that Chris Pratt is in Jurassic World.

3591
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:16,280
Well, that guy's headed straight for the A-list between Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World.

3592
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:18,280
I'm sure he's going to do really well, and people love their parks and rec.

3593
02:56:18,280 --> 02:56:22,280
So that guy making good moves, good career choices.

3594
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:25,280
So he's just destined to star in some flop in a couple of years.

3595
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:30,280
Like, remember when Halle Berry won the Oscar, and then she did Catwoman?

3596
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:32,280
Not a good career move.

3597
02:56:32,280 --> 02:56:37,280
I'm sorry, there's one thing I care about, one thing that has to happen in my lifetime.

3598
02:56:37,280 --> 02:56:38,280
What?

3599
02:56:38,280 --> 02:56:42,280
An actual, for real, wonderfully well done Deadpool movie.

3600
02:56:42,280 --> 02:56:46,280
Well, you know, that footage online, it's possible.

3601
02:56:46,280 --> 02:56:48,280
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

3602
02:56:48,280 --> 02:56:49,280
I know.

3603
02:56:49,280 --> 02:56:50,280
Very cool.

3604
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:52,280
So, how about a Wonder Woman movie?

3605
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:54,280
That's what I want to see.

3606
02:56:54,280 --> 02:56:58,280
If we can have Guardians of the Galaxy, we can have a solo Wonder Woman movie.

3607
02:56:58,280 --> 02:57:04,280
Should we be doing that after the whole Marvel, or is it the Batman and Superman movie?

3608
02:57:04,280 --> 02:57:06,280
Don't call it a Justice League movie, but it kind of is.

3609
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:12,280
For the record, I think that Gal Gadot is absolutely gorgeous.

3610
02:57:12,280 --> 02:57:14,280
And I would go see it just for her.

3611
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:17,280
We briefly, you know, because you weren't here last week actually,

3612
02:57:17,280 --> 02:57:21,280
and since we aren't getting a lot of calls tonight, it's a good time for me to kind of ask you about this.

3613
02:57:21,280 --> 02:57:25,280
Surely you saw the costume. I'm curious on your thoughts, because I was kind of like,

3614
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:30,280
Well, okay. I didn't hate it, but I was very much like, she does look like Xena.

3615
02:57:30,280 --> 02:57:33,280
Everyone was like, it's all brown, it's all brown.

3616
02:57:33,280 --> 02:57:37,280
And I'm like, so is everything around her. It could be lighting.

3617
02:57:37,280 --> 02:57:41,280
I mean, I didn't get a really good high-res picture, so I could tell.

3618
02:57:41,280 --> 02:57:44,280
But I mean, it could very well have just been lighting.

3619
02:57:44,280 --> 02:57:46,280
She could have been drenched in blood.

3620
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:48,280
The blood of her enemies.

3621
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:49,280
Perhaps.

3622
02:57:49,280 --> 02:57:52,280
Although, I have to say that I did like the style.

3623
02:57:52,280 --> 02:57:58,280
I like the sword and all that, but she's got to have a lasso that makes people tell the truth at some point.

3624
02:57:58,280 --> 02:58:01,280
I mean, it's Wonder Woman.

3625
02:58:01,280 --> 02:58:04,280
Well, you know about how the character came across, right?

3626
02:58:04,280 --> 02:58:05,280
What do you mean?

3627
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:08,280
The guy who created Wonder Woman was a fetishist.

3628
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:09,280
Oh, lord.

3629
02:58:09,280 --> 02:58:10,280
No, seriously.

3630
02:58:10,280 --> 02:58:11,280
Wow.

3631
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:16,280
The lasso had to relate it back to the whole lie detector test.

3632
02:58:16,280 --> 02:58:21,280
And any time that she was, her weakness is being bound by a man.

3633
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:22,280
Wow.

3634
02:58:22,280 --> 02:58:24,280
And she loses her abilities.

3635
02:58:24,280 --> 02:58:25,280
Huh.

3636
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:28,280
I don't remember Linda Carter doing that.

3637
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:33,280
This was the early iteration, and there was a lot of tying people up in Wonder Woman.

3638
02:58:33,280 --> 02:58:34,280
Bound by a man.

3639
02:58:34,280 --> 02:58:36,280
Interesting. Very interesting.

3640
02:58:36,280 --> 02:58:40,280
Alright. Well, that is, and Dungeon Buster is pointing out the lasso is there.

3641
02:58:40,280 --> 02:58:42,280
It's right next to her sword hand on her hip.

3642
02:58:42,280 --> 02:58:43,280
Oh, good. I missed that.

3643
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:46,280
I guess I didn't see, I just saw the little Twitter picture. I didn't see the, oh.

3644
02:58:46,280 --> 02:58:48,280
So that's good. I'm glad to hear it.

3645
02:58:48,280 --> 02:58:51,280
Alright. Well, that's, I guess, going to do it.

3646
02:58:51,280 --> 02:58:55,280
We're not getting any of the calls tonight, so our audience is just being shy.

3647
02:58:55,280 --> 02:58:56,280
I see how it is.

3648
02:58:56,280 --> 02:58:58,280
If you want to email us, you sure can.

3649
02:58:58,280 --> 02:59:03,280
You can send an email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

3650
02:59:03,280 --> 02:59:05,280
But for now, we're going to wrap up here in studio.

3651
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:07,280
We're on our way out tonight.

3652
02:59:07,280 --> 02:59:08,280
I want to say thanks to our guests.

3653
02:59:08,280 --> 02:59:10,280
Diego, great to meet you.

3654
02:59:10,280 --> 02:59:11,280
Oh, it's a pleasure. Definitely.

3655
02:59:11,280 --> 02:59:15,280
And best of luck with SacAnime coming up in a few weeks.

3656
02:59:15,280 --> 02:59:20,280
I'm sorry I can't go myself, but DarkSakura will go and tell me all about the fabulous teabagging going on there.

3657
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:22,280
Fabulous teabagging.

3658
02:59:22,280 --> 02:59:23,280
That's right.

3659
02:59:23,280 --> 02:59:30,280
Maybe, you know, she participated in a cosplay tournament at GamerX, so maybe she'll do one of your gaming tournaments.

3660
02:59:30,280 --> 02:59:32,280
Oh, wow. That would be really nice.

3661
02:59:32,280 --> 02:59:33,280
There you go.

3662
02:59:33,280 --> 02:59:36,280
She can kick somebody's ass at Tekken. I don't know if that's a thing you guys do.

3663
02:59:36,280 --> 02:59:37,280
Oh, that'd be good.

3664
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:43,280
It's been ages since I was at my legendary level of skill in Tekken 3.

3665
02:59:43,280 --> 02:59:45,280
Do you like how I'm volunteering for stuff, too?

3666
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:48,280
Wow, that's amazing. We have our own little Tekken player in our group, too.

3667
02:59:48,280 --> 02:59:53,280
And he goes under the name Heisenberg, I guess, but he just took that off of...

3668
02:59:53,280 --> 02:59:57,280
My last regular ongoing Tekken playing was in Tekken 4.

3669
02:59:57,280 --> 02:59:58,280
Oh, 4, yeah.

3670
02:59:58,280 --> 03:00:02,280
But my regular wasn't... They changed all of Jin's moves for 4.

3671
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:03,280
Oh, damn.

3672
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:06,280
And he was my regular in 3, so...

3673
03:00:06,280 --> 03:00:07,280
Yeah.

3674
03:00:07,280 --> 03:00:08,280
Him and Julia.

3675
03:00:08,280 --> 03:00:12,280
I like the one that did the capoeira dancing because you could just button mash.

3676
03:00:12,280 --> 03:00:14,280
Yeah, you could just button mash. It was great.

3677
03:00:14,280 --> 03:00:18,280
However, if you actually could play him without mashing, oh my god, even better.

3678
03:00:18,280 --> 03:00:19,280
Yeah.

3679
03:00:19,280 --> 03:00:20,280
Oh, yes.

3680
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:22,280
Seriously. It's like watching... You don't know what you're watching.

3681
03:00:22,280 --> 03:00:24,280
It's just like suddenly there's feet.

3682
03:00:24,280 --> 03:00:25,280
Yeah.

3683
03:00:25,280 --> 03:00:27,280
Yeah, but it'll be good to see you there.

3684
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:29,280
And the second one is just getting bigger.

3685
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:32,280
And we want to make this one the best one possible.

3686
03:00:32,280 --> 03:00:34,280
And I think you would agree, Jonas, right?

3687
03:00:34,280 --> 03:00:39,280
Oh, yeah. Especially with the new change in the direction of things, as well.

3688
03:00:39,280 --> 03:00:45,280
Like new generation of systems and the higher demand of new games coming out.

3689
03:00:45,280 --> 03:00:49,280
I'll bust out the Homestuck cosplay again.

3690
03:00:49,280 --> 03:00:50,280
All right.

3691
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:51,280
I'm one of them.

3692
03:00:51,280 --> 03:00:52,280
No, it's cool.

3693
03:00:52,280 --> 03:00:57,280
Actually, speaking on the Homestuck topic of things.

3694
03:00:57,280 --> 03:01:01,280
Surprisingly, I know people are sometimes concerned, like convention people can criticize Homestuck,

3695
03:01:01,280 --> 03:01:05,280
but for us game rooms, we're actually 100% welcoming the Homestuck crew

3696
03:01:05,280 --> 03:01:08,280
because a lot of them actually play our games, especially the Just Dance section.

3697
03:01:08,280 --> 03:01:13,280
This is as long as they don't get Ben Nye all over the controllers.

3698
03:01:13,280 --> 03:01:15,280
We'll make sure of that.

3699
03:01:15,280 --> 03:01:17,280
Emperor of Husky is in chat right now saying,

3700
03:01:17,280 --> 03:01:20,280
I hope to see Dark Sakura at SacAnime.

3701
03:01:20,280 --> 03:01:22,280
Oh, is it Wendell?

3702
03:01:22,280 --> 03:01:24,280
I love you, Wendell.

3703
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:25,280
You're in demand.

3704
03:01:25,280 --> 03:01:26,280
I want to go.

3705
03:01:26,280 --> 03:01:29,280
All right, if my costume still fits me, I'll wear it.

3706
03:01:29,280 --> 03:01:30,280
All right.

3707
03:01:30,280 --> 03:01:32,280
My costume is actually just a slight bit too big for me,

3708
03:01:32,280 --> 03:01:35,280
and I hope to have a little bit less by the time.

3709
03:01:35,280 --> 03:01:36,280
There you go.

3710
03:01:36,280 --> 03:01:37,280
Take it in.

3711
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:39,280
Easier to take it in than let it out.

3712
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:40,280
I can't sew for shit.

3713
03:01:40,280 --> 03:01:42,280
I hear that.

3714
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:44,280
Awesome.

3715
03:01:44,280 --> 03:01:49,280
I would say I'm almost sad that I'm going to Dragon Con, but to be honest, I'm really not.

3716
03:01:49,280 --> 03:01:55,280
I'm fucking excited for Dragon Con, but I'm sad that they have to be the same weekend.

3717
03:01:55,280 --> 03:01:58,280
That's a pain in the butt.

3718
03:01:58,280 --> 03:02:00,280
Diego, now it's tradition here at OLR.

3719
03:02:00,280 --> 03:02:03,280
We always ask everybody to give their final thought, like Jerry Springer style.

3720
03:02:03,280 --> 03:02:08,280
Do you have a final thought, a final note for our listeners tonight?

3721
03:02:08,280 --> 03:02:13,280
Final thought?

3722
03:02:13,280 --> 03:02:16,280
Do you have another song parody you'd like to build out for us?

3723
03:02:16,280 --> 03:02:20,280
I don't know. Whenever I hear a song itself, I usually try to change the lyrics around the spot.

3724
03:02:20,280 --> 03:02:21,280
Fair enough.

3725
03:02:21,280 --> 03:02:27,280
Final thought is listen when your name's called out when I'm running a tournament.

3726
03:02:27,280 --> 03:02:28,280
That's right.

3727
03:02:28,280 --> 03:02:31,280
Pay attention. Be smart.

3728
03:02:31,280 --> 03:02:36,280
I don't know. Just try not to be like the typical con goer, but that's not going to change.

3729
03:02:36,280 --> 03:02:39,280
Your final thought is when I talk, you listen.

3730
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:40,280
I hope so.

3731
03:02:40,280 --> 03:02:41,280
When anyone does so.

3732
03:02:41,280 --> 03:02:42,280
It feels bad.

3733
03:02:42,280 --> 03:02:48,280
Like we list up so many people and about a fourth of those people just drop out because they don't show up or something.

3734
03:02:48,280 --> 03:02:52,280
I'm like, well, oh, well, let's just go on to the next bracket.

3735
03:02:52,280 --> 03:02:54,280
Let's go on to the next pairing.

3736
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:56,280
It's OK. It's just that's not going to stop us.

3737
03:02:56,280 --> 03:02:58,280
And we can satisfy the majority.

3738
03:02:58,280 --> 03:02:59,280
We did our job.

3739
03:02:59,280 --> 03:03:01,280
That's the whole thing.

3740
03:03:01,280 --> 03:03:03,280
All right. Thanks again for being here, buddy.

3741
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:05,280
Well, you're welcome back any time.

3742
03:03:05,280 --> 03:03:10,280
Jonas, it's so good to see you again after years and years and years and years, far too long.

3743
03:03:10,280 --> 03:03:12,280
Thank you for gracing us with your presence tonight.

3744
03:03:12,280 --> 03:03:14,280
Best of luck teabagging at SacAnime.

3745
03:03:14,280 --> 03:03:15,280
Oh, definitely.

3746
03:03:15,280 --> 03:03:17,280
Your teabag orgy and all that stuff.

3747
03:03:17,280 --> 03:03:19,280
I love that. I love that.

3748
03:03:19,280 --> 03:03:21,280
I hope to see you guys at a future con.

3749
03:03:21,280 --> 03:03:23,280
And yeah, come back any time.

3750
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:24,280
Oh, definitely.

3751
03:03:24,280 --> 03:03:25,280
Now you know where we're at.

3752
03:03:25,280 --> 03:03:27,280
Yeah, that's actually one of my final thoughts.

3753
03:03:27,280 --> 03:03:30,280
We could probably bring some of our other crew members here.

3754
03:03:30,280 --> 03:03:33,280
Right now, it's just me and Diego right now.

3755
03:03:33,280 --> 03:03:37,280
And we wanted to give this a big test after like seven years of not being in the show.

3756
03:03:37,280 --> 03:03:38,280
So I was like, OK.

3757
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:39,280
All right.

3758
03:03:39,280 --> 03:03:42,280
And we thought, OK, this would be a great opportunity to network and stuff.

3759
03:03:42,280 --> 03:03:43,280
All right. Sounds good.

3760
03:03:43,280 --> 03:03:46,280
Next time, though, we've got to hook up some games to the TV and get playing during the show.

3761
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:49,280
So I'll let you guys choose what to bring.

3762
03:03:49,280 --> 03:03:50,280
Oh, cool. Awesome.

3763
03:03:50,280 --> 03:03:51,280
All right.

3764
03:03:51,280 --> 03:03:52,280
Thank you again for being here.

3765
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:54,280
A final thought from you, sir.

3766
03:03:54,280 --> 03:03:57,280
That was actually my final thought was like to be continued, like, OK,

3767
03:03:57,280 --> 03:04:01,280
we're going to have new people in the show to actually speak their mind of things.

3768
03:04:01,280 --> 03:04:04,280
As you can see, you saw how Diego I was talking to.

3769
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:06,280
He had a couple of laughs.

3770
03:04:06,280 --> 03:04:08,280
Where every gamer has a voice.

3771
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:09,280
Oh, yeah.

3772
03:04:09,280 --> 03:04:10,280
Bring me more gamers.

3773
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:11,280
Lend me their voices.

3774
03:04:11,280 --> 03:04:17,280
And of course, minus that part, that's actually two little things to discuss.

3775
03:04:17,280 --> 03:04:19,280
Make sure you guys have the hygiene, of course.

3776
03:04:19,280 --> 03:04:20,280
Make sure shower.

3777
03:04:20,280 --> 03:04:22,280
I don't want to see another brown stain.

3778
03:04:22,280 --> 03:04:26,280
And if I may add, it's not just acts bathe.

3779
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:28,280
Yes, please.

3780
03:04:28,280 --> 03:04:34,280
And of course, of course, with my Facebook message being blown up over this whole San Diego Comic Con,

3781
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:38,280
with the sexual harassment incident with the cosplayer.

3782
03:04:38,280 --> 03:04:41,280
Everybody, please get concrete information.

3783
03:04:41,280 --> 03:04:45,280
Don't go spreading the wrong information because it all caused more confusion.

3784
03:04:45,280 --> 03:04:47,280
And don't listen to the girl's mom.

3785
03:04:47,280 --> 03:04:50,280
I think that goes for anything.

3786
03:04:50,280 --> 03:04:52,280
Like, don't fucking spread rumors.

3787
03:04:52,280 --> 03:04:53,280
Stop it.

3788
03:04:53,280 --> 03:04:54,280
Yeah, pretty much.

3789
03:04:54,280 --> 03:04:55,280
I will tell you this.

3790
03:04:55,280 --> 03:04:59,280
There's a reason I reposted things is because when they were still looking for apparently the person.

3791
03:04:59,280 --> 03:05:00,280
Sure.

3792
03:05:00,280 --> 03:05:06,280
When you spread the information like that, there is a chance that in the legitimate cases, people will have witnesses.

3793
03:05:06,280 --> 03:05:07,280
It's spreading awareness.

3794
03:05:07,280 --> 03:05:13,280
However, when the final word came out, there were still people going,

3795
03:05:13,280 --> 03:05:14,280
Oh, I bet that's not true.

3796
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:15,280
I bet that's not true.

3797
03:05:15,280 --> 03:05:17,280
And no, it was true.

3798
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:27,280
So I still, my personal thought on this, I still don't really believe the whole story yet because we don't have the whole story.

3799
03:05:27,280 --> 03:05:31,280
I just, I know the authorities were looking for a certain person so they could ask some questions.

3800
03:05:31,280 --> 03:05:32,280
They could do their job.

3801
03:05:32,280 --> 03:05:37,280
I hope they are able to do their job and figure out a very ugly situation.

3802
03:05:37,280 --> 03:05:40,280
Anyhow, thanks again guys for being here.

3803
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:41,280
Really appreciate it.

3804
03:05:41,280 --> 03:05:44,280
Loki, since you're over there, we'll see you next week.

3805
03:05:44,280 --> 03:05:46,280
Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

3806
03:05:46,280 --> 03:05:50,280
Um, no.

3807
03:05:50,280 --> 03:05:51,280
I don't know.

3808
03:05:51,280 --> 03:05:56,280
I'm very jealous that Vanguard V has a pretty awesome title theme.

3809
03:05:56,280 --> 03:05:59,280
Wish I could find one of those for free.

3810
03:05:59,280 --> 03:06:01,280
That's why it's awesome it's not free.

3811
03:06:01,280 --> 03:06:02,280
Anyway, my...

3812
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:04,280
They're never going to hit their Kickstarter goal, by the way.

3813
03:06:04,280 --> 03:06:07,280
There's no way they're going to make a hundred and...

3814
03:06:07,280 --> 03:06:08,280
That's too bad.

3815
03:06:08,280 --> 03:06:09,280
Yeah, it's not going to happen.

3816
03:06:09,280 --> 03:06:10,280
I'm sad.

3817
03:06:10,280 --> 03:06:15,280
As always, I just want to say, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lunch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

3818
03:06:15,280 --> 03:06:17,280
Help spread the word about Orange Lunch Radio.

3819
03:06:17,280 --> 03:06:21,280
Because, you know, we don't have big magazines or huge million dollar websites backing us.

3820
03:06:21,280 --> 03:06:23,280
We never have for the past twelve years.

3821
03:06:23,280 --> 03:06:25,280
So tell a friend or fifty about the show.

3822
03:06:25,280 --> 03:06:28,280
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

3823
03:06:28,280 --> 03:06:29,280
And that's all we ask.

3824
03:06:29,280 --> 03:06:32,280
My final thought tonight otherwise is...

3825
03:06:32,280 --> 03:06:34,280
I'm craving some more of that apple soda.

3826
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:35,280
That was really good.

3827
03:06:35,280 --> 03:06:37,280
Apple soda, who would have thought?

3828
03:06:37,280 --> 03:06:39,280
The El Forastero.

3829
03:06:39,280 --> 03:06:40,280
Yeah, right, right.

3830
03:06:40,280 --> 03:06:42,280
Just tell everybody where I live, Dark Sakura.

3831
03:06:42,280 --> 03:06:43,280
Alright, just kidding.

3832
03:06:43,280 --> 03:06:46,280
There are five of them in freakin' town, Rob.

3833
03:06:46,280 --> 03:06:47,280
Fair enough, fair enough.

3834
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:54,280
And they're almost indistinguishable from at Alberto's, Carolina's, and all of the other places that are technically all...

3835
03:06:54,280 --> 03:06:56,280
were part of the same chain and then split apart.

3836
03:06:56,280 --> 03:06:58,280
I was going to say, probably all owned by the same person.

3837
03:06:58,280 --> 03:06:59,280
No, no, it's actually true.

3838
03:06:59,280 --> 03:07:01,280
They all started off as at Alberto's and then started splitting off.

3839
03:07:01,280 --> 03:07:02,280
Wow.

3840
03:07:02,280 --> 03:07:03,280
Yep.

3841
03:07:03,280 --> 03:07:05,280
Jeez.

3842
03:07:05,280 --> 03:07:06,280
Shut up, really?

3843
03:07:06,280 --> 03:07:07,280
That's what happened?

3844
03:07:07,280 --> 03:07:09,280
Alberto was married to somebody that...

3845
03:07:09,280 --> 03:07:11,280
Give Diego a mic, give Diego a mic.

3846
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:12,280
There's a Beto's by my house, by the way.

3847
03:07:12,280 --> 03:07:13,280
Oh, yeah.

3848
03:07:13,280 --> 03:07:16,280
Alberto was married to some chick and then they divorced and such.

3849
03:07:16,280 --> 03:07:21,280
And then she made something called Beto's, which is off the corner of El Camino and Howe.

3850
03:07:21,280 --> 03:07:22,280
And then it's still on El Camino.

3851
03:07:22,280 --> 03:07:23,280
There's one in Citrus Heights now.

3852
03:07:23,280 --> 03:07:24,280
Beto's?

3853
03:07:24,280 --> 03:07:25,280
Yeah.

3854
03:07:25,280 --> 03:07:26,280
That's her branch.

3855
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:28,280
So she took that little thing, except changed the name.

3856
03:07:28,280 --> 03:07:30,280
They sell the same things.

3857
03:07:30,280 --> 03:07:33,280
There's some telenovela shit going on with all these different taquerias.

3858
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:34,280
There's some going on.

3859
03:07:34,280 --> 03:07:35,280
Alright.

3860
03:07:35,280 --> 03:07:36,280
Wow.

3861
03:07:36,280 --> 03:07:37,280
Alright.

3862
03:07:37,280 --> 03:07:38,280
There you go.

3863
03:07:38,280 --> 03:07:41,280
Last but not least, Dark Sakura, your final thought for our listeners tonight.

3864
03:07:42,280 --> 03:07:43,280
Bravely defart.

3865
03:07:48,280 --> 03:07:50,280
That'll do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3866
03:07:50,280 --> 03:07:52,280
Thanks again for listening, everybody.

3867
03:07:52,280 --> 03:07:53,280
Be nice to each other.

3868
03:07:53,280 --> 03:07:54,280
Bathe, please.

3869
03:07:54,280 --> 03:07:56,280
And we'll see you next week.

3870
03:07:56,280 --> 03:07:57,280
