00:00.000 --> 00:17.880
This week, the playful jobs at Ubisoft continue with Sunset Overdrive offering full customization

00:17.880 --> 00:19.400
no matter the gender you select.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.800
EA CEO has owned up to Battlefield 4's issues, but stopped short of promising that it will

00:22.800 --> 00:23.800
never happen again.

00:23.800 --> 00:29.920
We'll tell you more about all this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.480
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.480 --> 00:36.040
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.880
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.880 --> 00:46.000
Live for this, our 557th episode, June the 22nd of 2014.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.520
We're here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the

00:49.520 --> 00:52.840
gamer lifestyle with me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts.

00:52.840 --> 00:57.160
Unfortunately not here tonight, DarkSakura, she has the night off, but here in studio

00:57.160 --> 00:59.560
with me, TechMasterLoki.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.840
I get the comfier chair today.

01:00.840 --> 01:05.920
Yes, you get the upgrade in DarkSakura's little fuzzy chair.

01:05.920 --> 01:06.920
Yeah, throne.

01:06.920 --> 01:07.920
Yeah.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.480
It is appropriate that DarkSakura gets a throne here on the show, but sadly, you're a seat

01:12.480 --> 01:15.800
warmer tonight with her being out, so.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.800
That's fine.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.960
Well, how you doing, Loki?

01:17.960 --> 01:18.960
What's new with you?

01:18.960 --> 01:19.960
Not much.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.960
Yeah?

01:20.960 --> 01:29.320
It's just, uh, I don't know, working on my game in free time and I did like house repairs

01:29.320 --> 01:30.320
today.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.320
Wow.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.920
I repaired a drain in our bathtub.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.360
I got some things that need repairing too, I'm just kidding.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.760
We were talking a little bit before the show tonight about the steam sales, cause you know,

01:41.760 --> 01:46.760
it is that time of year where, or actually it's several times, that biannual time of

01:46.760 --> 01:49.960
year, cause there's two of them usually, the summer and the winter sale.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.680
I know they do, do they normally do a spring sale too?

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
Do they?

01:53.680 --> 01:58.560
They did, because I remember last year it was the winter and then spring sale.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.560
Oh wow.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.560
Maybe I'm thinking the winter sale, I don't know.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.720
Maybe it's like mini sales or something, I don't know, maybe like a, I feel like there's

02:03.720 --> 02:06.840
a sale around Black Friday, you know, usually, but anyway.

02:06.840 --> 02:10.640
We all know there's a summer sale and a winter sale, right, so, and steam, there's a lot

02:10.640 --> 02:14.160
of stuff always on sale, so there's the huge summer sale going on, but you said, unfortunately

02:14.160 --> 02:17.240
you haven't really got to participate much this year, just cause, you know, you're trying

02:17.240 --> 02:18.800
to look out for the monies, right?

02:18.800 --> 02:21.200
Money and also just, I don't want to buy anything.

02:21.200 --> 02:28.200
I mean, just, I have so much that I've bought before, I haven't played most of it, like

02:28.240 --> 02:32.880
everybody, but you know, there's not really the point of a steam sale, but there's not

02:32.880 --> 02:36.680
really anything that jumps out that like I need to buy it because like most of the things

02:36.680 --> 02:38.920
like are on sale right now, I already own.

02:38.920 --> 02:43.800
So your EP is directly judged by how big your steam library is.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.120
It's 350 games in my library.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.200
What was the last one you played?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.200
I don't know.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.560
Probably sieve four or no sieve.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.560
Was it sieve five?

02:53.560 --> 02:56.040
You don't even know what damn game you play.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.040
No, no.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.040
I'm saying which one you played.

02:58.880 --> 02:59.880
Sieve five.

02:59.880 --> 03:00.880
No, we'll get into that in my gaming.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.560
We played one today.

03:02.560 --> 03:06.440
But no, um, I mean I have, there's a lot of stuff out there, but there's not really anything

03:06.440 --> 03:13.760
new that I'm getting aside from, you know, free games and um, like, uh, no, actually

03:13.760 --> 03:19.800
I should give you, I have a steam code for a game that I have a DRM free copy of, um,

03:19.800 --> 03:20.800
that kickstarted.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.360
It was a rhythm shooter, like a space shooter, but it's a rhythm game sort of.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.480
That'll be one extra inch on my collection.

03:27.920 --> 03:28.920
There you go.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.720
Um, so, but yeah, aside from like stuff that kickstarted that they have, like, you know,

03:33.720 --> 03:35.600
steam codes for, I haven't really been buying any games.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.600
Okay, we'll take that back.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.920
I did buy that bundle at E3, but I only paid a dollar.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.640
I didn't want any, like I said, I don't need the Mortal Kombat arcade collection cause

03:43.640 --> 03:47.080
I just don't, I'm not a big fan of Mortal Kombat, you know, and they have like, now

03:47.080 --> 03:50.240
I have a bunch of random DLC for shit I don't own.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.400
Funny enough, that was the last game I bought before the steam, I bought on Epic on the

03:54.400 --> 03:57.440
steam sale yesterday cause that was the game I had my eye on for a while anyway.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.960
I haven't played it yet, but you know, I will four months from now when I get really

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
bored.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
Right.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
Uh, no, hopefully sooner than that.

04:03.960 --> 04:08.600
But before that I bought Mortal Kombat, the, the, the reboot, Mortal Kombat nine or whatever.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.920
No, I guess it really was eight.

04:09.920 --> 04:10.920
I don't know.

04:10.920 --> 04:11.920
Whatever.

04:11.920 --> 04:12.920
You know what I'm talking about?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.680
The reboot Mortal Kombat, uh, was the last thing I bought on steam, even though I already

04:15.680 --> 04:20.120
owned it on PS3, but the steam one was so cheap and it's like, Oh, this one comes with

04:20.120 --> 04:26.360
Freddy Krueger and, and all the other characters, Kenshi and, um, so whatever.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.840
Yeah, they did re-release the Mortal Kombat game.

04:28.840 --> 04:32.080
Uh, they did like a game of the year edition with, yeah, that's what I bought on steam

04:32.080 --> 04:36.500
or whatever it was, but yeah, I mean they've got, you know, like dead rising three look

04:36.500 --> 04:41.960
kind of cool, but I don't think my, I don't think my laptop would run it very well.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.540
So yeah, I just dumped all that money into my new PC.

04:44.540 --> 04:47.720
So I no longer have to worry about, will my computer play this game?

04:47.720 --> 04:51.440
Because the answer is yes, it will, at least for the next year or two, well, I'll be fine.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.440
You know?

04:52.440 --> 04:53.440
Yeah.

04:53.440 --> 04:58.800
I mean, it's just, I don't want to really right now, I'm trying to focus on finishing

04:58.800 --> 04:59.800
my game.

04:59.800 --> 05:06.080
So that's why I haven't been buying anything or playing anything because you know, I don't

05:06.080 --> 05:08.000
want to be distracted from that.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.620
Although I may force myself to actually play something just because I sometimes maybe need

05:13.620 --> 05:17.500
a distraction just to kind of take a break from it, you know, for a little bit.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.420
But I don't know.

05:19.420 --> 05:25.180
I just, there's not really anything new out there that I'm like, Oh, I got to play that.

05:25.180 --> 05:28.420
You know, it's like so brand new, like, Oh, I need to get a copy of that.

05:28.420 --> 05:32.820
Um, well there's having come back off of the E3 episode last week, there were certainly

05:32.820 --> 05:35.300
some games I saw there where I'm like, Ooh, I definitely want to get that one.

05:35.300 --> 05:40.320
That's out, you know, uh, on the PC front, this will surprise nobody, but civilization

05:40.320 --> 05:43.140
beyond earth, uh, looks, um, right up my alley.

05:43.660 --> 05:47.020
Well, yeah, I mean, some of those games are cool, like No Man's Sky and stuff when that

05:47.020 --> 05:48.020
comes out on PC.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.820
Hell yeah, I'd want to pick that up.

05:49.820 --> 05:54.140
But you know, right now there's not really anything like indie that's like super, I mean,

05:54.140 --> 05:57.660
there's a couple like I've seen a Kickstarter stuff that looked kind of cool that maybe

05:57.660 --> 06:01.020
I'll pick up when they come out, but there's not really anything that I like that's out

06:01.020 --> 06:04.580
there right now that's on the marketplace of like, Ooh, I really, really need that.

06:04.580 --> 06:08.540
You know, what I found has been extraordinarily useful for finding new games on steam that

06:08.540 --> 06:12.420
are, you know, things that have not been on my radar, but they're usually indie because

06:12.420 --> 06:16.340
you know, ever since Greenlight started, indies have really, really, really become

06:16.340 --> 06:17.460
very prevalent on steam.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.940
They're doing very well there.

06:18.940 --> 06:23.180
And you know, a lot of them are, are, are really low value, you know, under $10.

06:23.180 --> 06:25.660
Some of them go on sale, they're like $2.50, right?

06:25.660 --> 06:29.820
So what's been really useful for finding a lot of those steam keywords have been like,

06:29.820 --> 06:33.460
I got to say that was actually a really cool feature they implemented because like, you

06:33.460 --> 06:38.340
know, I might be looking at a game's page and then I'll see that the, um, the keywords

06:38.340 --> 06:42.180
on the game are like JRPG or something and I'll be like, Ooh, I wonder, I wonder what

06:42.180 --> 06:45.220
the big selling JRPGs are because you can click on that keyword and then you sort like

06:45.220 --> 06:48.980
what are the top sellers, what are the new or like roguelike or, you know, things like

06:48.980 --> 06:49.980
that.

06:49.980 --> 06:55.420
Like, like categories that the games aren't often sorted into, like, you know, action

06:55.420 --> 07:00.220
adventure sports, you know, you get a little more specific than that, which has been really

07:00.220 --> 07:01.300
good for targeting games.

07:01.300 --> 07:04.380
I think they've got some like super hot, look pretty cool.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.980
Like I'd want to kind of check that out.

07:07.980 --> 07:12.820
There is one, it's a Devolver Digital's new game that they published.

07:12.820 --> 07:18.100
It was, um, I figured it was a, it was a kind of a rogue-like first person shooter game.

07:18.100 --> 07:21.380
I think it's called Bullets or Six Bullets or something like that.

07:21.380 --> 07:23.700
It's a game where you're fighting these monsters.

07:23.700 --> 07:29.140
It's kind of a retro arcade looking title, but, um, you have to go and pick up your bullets

07:29.140 --> 07:30.420
because you only have six bullets.

07:30.420 --> 07:34.640
So you shoot something and you have to go run and pick up your bullet, um, and before

07:34.640 --> 07:36.600
you, more monsters attack you.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.680
So, I don't know, I have to look at some of that stuff, but right now there's not really

07:40.680 --> 07:43.360
anything that jumps up that like I really want to play.

07:43.360 --> 07:47.440
Just mainly because, you know, if there is something like maybe like Arma 3 or something,

07:47.440 --> 07:52.160
which I have Arma 2 and I still haven't fucking touched that game, so I don't know, but, uh,

07:52.160 --> 07:56.400
it looks interesting, but that'd be something I'd want to sink, you know, several hours

07:56.400 --> 07:57.400
into.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.520
Like, I was like, oh, I could get South Park, but I already have it on 360, so I don't really

08:01.520 --> 08:06.520
need to buy it on PC as well, but, ooh, I could get that game, but it wasn't really

08:06.520 --> 08:07.520
marked down that much.

08:07.520 --> 08:11.760
I just, I don't know, there's not really anything that's really jumping out at me.

08:11.760 --> 08:16.000
All right, so I need to introduce our chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night

08:16.000 --> 08:18.640
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.820
The time is six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern to catch our show.

08:21.820 --> 08:26.120
That's right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and of course you can participate live along

08:26.120 --> 08:30.360
with our show at the chat room, which is at live.vognetwork.com because we are the show

08:30.360 --> 08:35.000
where every gamer has a voice, including actdeft, who's clarifying some information

08:35.000 --> 08:39.920
about the sale, saying they used to do a spring sale, but this year they didn't, though the

08:39.920 --> 08:41.700
big sales are summer and winter.

08:41.700 --> 08:45.600
Now some other voices in chat rooms reminding us not to forget about other sites.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.560
You know, we talk Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, but I see a lot of chatter about Humble Bundle,

08:49.560 --> 08:52.080
although I don't think there's a main Humble Bundle going on right now.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.680
There's always like the weekly as they do those, right?

08:53.680 --> 08:54.680
They have one at the store.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.380
No, they have one going on right now.

08:56.380 --> 08:59.640
They have the games done quick, Humble Bundle, but it's not really a Humble Bundle.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.880
It's like, you know, you have to pay 25 bucks as the minimum to get a bunch of stuff, but

09:03.880 --> 09:06.360
it's like quite a few games.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.360
They're all pretty good.

09:07.360 --> 09:12.760
They have like the Gianna Sisters, Twisted Dreams in there, and there was a bunch of

09:12.760 --> 09:16.080
other ones, and I think Stanley Parable and stuff was a part of that.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.080
So those are pretty good.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.680
There's also like the other non-Humble Bundle sites, like Indie Royale.

09:20.680 --> 09:25.440
Well, I was gonna say, fifth dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says GOG,

09:25.440 --> 09:28.740
or Good Old Games, is getting more money from me than Steam this weekend, and DungeonBuster

09:28.740 --> 09:29.740
adding to that.

09:29.740 --> 09:33.620
Good Old Games is having a summer sale, too, for classic titles and some not-so-classic

09:33.620 --> 09:34.620
titles.

09:34.620 --> 09:35.620
Yeah, that's good.

09:35.620 --> 09:41.900
Also, like I said, the Indie Royale, Indie Gala, there's one other one that they have,

09:41.900 --> 09:43.500
too, that's out there.

09:43.500 --> 09:48.820
But those also have, usually it's a lot of like kind of secondary stuff, but you can

09:48.820 --> 09:50.100
get stuff really cheap on there.

09:50.100 --> 09:55.940
They have bundles for three bucks, four bucks, and it's usually like eight games in there.

09:55.980 --> 09:59.820
And of course, there's always gotta be those people that do the anti-sale, right?

09:59.820 --> 10:03.940
Remember Cards Against Humanity on Black Friday jacked the price of their game up by $5, and

10:03.940 --> 10:05.380
people still paid it, right?

10:05.380 --> 10:10.780
But I'm looking in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, our pal Bobby Blackwolf is in there sending

10:10.780 --> 10:16.860
over a tweet from At Fork Parker, who said, all Devolver Digital games are double the

10:16.860 --> 10:21.660
price in Portugal for the next 24 hours, which, if you don't catch the reference, appears

10:21.660 --> 10:26.060
to be a direct response to the World Cup game that just took place, which resulted

10:26.060 --> 10:33.220
in a tie, which I don't follow a lot of soccer if it's not preceded by Mega Man, which I

10:33.220 --> 10:37.140
believe puts the U.S. in a not-so-great position where they have to go up against Germany,

10:37.140 --> 10:38.140
which is really good, too.

10:38.140 --> 10:42.900
I think, yeah, he was saying, though, if U.S. did win the World Cup, that he would give

10:42.900 --> 10:47.660
away a thousand copies of Broforce, but he's like, I'm not actually gonna do that because

10:47.660 --> 10:51.820
they know there's no way they're gonna win or something.

10:51.820 --> 10:52.820
I love his humor.

10:52.820 --> 10:53.820
It's hilarious.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.820
Yeah.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.820
Good times.

10:55.820 --> 10:56.820
Good times.

10:56.820 --> 10:57.820
Let's see here.

10:57.820 --> 10:58.820
So, let's see if there's any other.

10:58.820 --> 11:01.980
Oh, yes, I did have another kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight before we got

11:01.980 --> 11:05.220
all on the tangent about steam sales.

11:05.220 --> 11:09.060
You know, we talk about new games here on OLR, but we love classic games, too, right?

11:09.060 --> 11:12.380
Dark Soccer, she always does the classic game of the week, although I'll do one tonight

11:12.380 --> 11:16.780
since she's not here, but we, you know, we try to find the balance between the classics

11:16.780 --> 11:18.260
and the new stuff, right?

11:18.260 --> 11:23.620
So, I love stories like these, and this has been making its way around Facebook and Twitter

11:23.620 --> 11:24.620
and all the social media.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.940
This kind of went viral, so I bet a lot of you guys have seen this.

11:26.940 --> 11:28.660
I don't know if you've seen this, Loki.

11:28.660 --> 11:36.020
A brand new trick discovered in Super Mario Brothers, as in the NES launch title here

11:36.020 --> 11:40.700
in the States, Super Mario Brothers, right, where now there's a new way to get unlimited

11:40.700 --> 11:45.940
one-ups, and we all knew about, like, at the end of a level, you could bounce the Koopa

11:45.940 --> 11:47.420
Troopa on the staircase over and over.

11:47.420 --> 11:49.420
Yeah, it's like 3-1 or 3-1.

11:49.420 --> 11:51.820
Yeah, that's a really hard trick to do, though.

11:51.820 --> 11:54.060
I don't know if I've ever pulled that off successfully.

11:54.060 --> 11:57.980
And you can also, in, you know, the Minus World was something that was discovered, you

11:57.980 --> 12:00.300
know, not long after the game's release and all that stuff.

12:00.300 --> 12:05.060
Well, somebody found a new trick that you can do in the game, and this was something

12:05.060 --> 12:08.980
that I guess was discovered on, like, a YouTuber or whatever.

12:08.980 --> 12:15.700
Keep in mind this game is 30 years old, and what happened is that they were kind of ping-ponging

12:15.700 --> 12:20.980
against Mario and Luigi, and what they found is that, in order to do this, you have to

12:20.980 --> 12:24.900
go through the game one whole time, because this is something you can only get on the

12:24.900 --> 12:27.340
second quest, okay?

12:27.340 --> 12:32.380
You take Player 1's Mario to the second level of the game and throw away your first life.

12:32.380 --> 12:38.100
Then you have Luigi take over and get all the way to World 5-2, but if you're good at

12:38.100 --> 12:41.740
Mario Brothers, you Super Mario Brothers, it shouldn't be too hard for you, right?

12:41.780 --> 12:45.780
And you get to the hidden Beanstalk block that's halfway through the stage.

12:45.780 --> 12:52.620
What you do is Luigi starts climbing the vine, but you wait and then get killed by the Hammer

12:52.620 --> 12:54.540
Brother that's right there.

12:54.540 --> 12:59.540
And what that does is that causes you to get killed while the vine is growing.

12:59.540 --> 13:02.960
So when you switch back from Luigi to Mario, guess what?

13:02.960 --> 13:04.720
The vine keeps growing.

13:04.720 --> 13:08.900
And suddenly this vine appears in World 1-2 at the very beginning, and all you have to

13:08.900 --> 13:12.660
do is you use that to bounce on one of those little beetles, because all the Goombas at

13:12.660 --> 13:17.420
the beginning become beetles in the second quest, and there you go, unlimited 1-Ups.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.540
Now, obviously that's not easy.

13:19.540 --> 13:20.540
It's not an easy thing to do.

13:20.540 --> 13:26.820
It's also very ridiculous considering that you're already to Level 5, or World 5 in the

13:26.820 --> 13:27.820
game, so.

13:27.820 --> 13:28.820
On the second quest.

13:28.820 --> 13:30.660
On the second quest, it's like, I don't care, whatever.

13:30.660 --> 13:35.220
But, you still got to admit, 30 years after the game comes out, finding new bugs and new

13:35.220 --> 13:39.820
glitches and, you know, finding other things beneath the surface is pretty darn cool.

13:39.820 --> 13:44.140
Because obviously with this really convoluted trick, nobody was going to find this right

13:44.140 --> 13:45.140
away.

13:45.140 --> 13:46.900
But it's, you know, still pretty cool.

13:46.900 --> 13:47.900
So.

13:47.900 --> 13:48.900
Yeah.

13:48.900 --> 13:49.900
Yeah.

13:49.900 --> 13:52.860
Any glitches in old games that you always enjoyed?

13:52.860 --> 13:55.340
Like especially when you were younger as a gamer?

13:55.340 --> 13:57.340
Hidden secrets and things?

13:57.340 --> 14:00.540
I don't know.

14:00.540 --> 14:06.140
I just remember, the only one I could think of, it was kind of stupid, but in, was it

14:06.140 --> 14:09.620
GoGlo 13 on the NES, you can make a moonwalk.

14:09.620 --> 14:10.620
Really?

14:10.620 --> 14:15.180
Yeah, you can get it so that the anima- like he's stuck one way and you can move a different

14:15.180 --> 14:16.660
direction so it looks like he's moonwalking.

14:16.660 --> 14:17.660
Nice.

14:17.660 --> 14:18.660
That's kind of fun.

14:18.660 --> 14:22.660
I was always a fan of the custom passwords that were put in games, which I guess was

14:22.660 --> 14:24.180
probably for debug or whatever.

14:24.180 --> 14:27.600
But, you know, you could put like in Metroid, what, Justin Bailey and, you know, have it

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
underlined or whatever.

14:28.680 --> 14:35.240
You could do the Kid Icarus, you could do what, the Terror, Danger, Horror, god damn

14:35.240 --> 14:37.880
it, I don't remember the- oh I think it's just a bunch of exclamation points is the

14:37.880 --> 14:39.200
last one you put.

14:39.200 --> 14:44.240
So and then that is like, you start part way through the game with this weird configuration

14:44.240 --> 14:45.480
of items and things like that.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.120
So I don't know, I always kind of like that stuff.

14:48.120 --> 14:53.280
Because you know, when those games didn't have save batteries here in the US, you know,

14:53.280 --> 14:56.460
because they were disc system games in Japan, they came over here, they don't have batteries

14:56.460 --> 15:00.060
or whatever, like that was really the only way you could be like, I just want to sit

15:00.060 --> 15:03.020
down and beat the game real quick in one sitting.

15:03.020 --> 15:06.900
You know, there's no warp whistles like there are in Mario Brothers or something like that.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.420
If you just want to spend 30 minutes you want to beat through the game, you have to use

15:09.420 --> 15:11.100
these, you know, crazy passwords.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.100
So I kind of always like things like that.

15:12.100 --> 15:17.580
I remember we used to mess with Game Genie codes, especially in like, was it Street Fighter

15:17.580 --> 15:22.340
or yeah, Street Fighter 2 and stuff where you'd do the codes to get, play as, you know,

15:22.340 --> 15:25.860
the boss characters in there, but it wasn't really the boss characters.

15:25.860 --> 15:31.100
It was just kind of the boss character skins on like Ryu or something like that.

15:31.100 --> 15:37.260
And so you'd have, you know, he could do that with like, okay, I want block on the Ryu skin.

15:37.260 --> 15:39.460
So you do like, you know, a hurricane kick or whatever.

15:39.460 --> 15:44.620
And he's just like in this shock, you know, a shock animation while he's flying across

15:44.620 --> 15:48.500
the screen or, you know, if he did E Honda, he'd be doing the hundred hand slab as he

15:48.500 --> 15:49.500
flies across the screen.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
Oh yeah.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.020
I never had a Game Genie, but I always, I think I've like borrowed one from a friend

15:54.020 --> 15:55.020
or something.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.580
Cause I, yeah, you could put in some crazy codes on those that, you know, which was,

15:58.580 --> 16:02.340
which was probably the equivalent of like editing the registry on a game or something

16:02.340 --> 16:06.260
on a PC, you know, like where you could, you know, really screw some things up by changing

16:06.260 --> 16:07.260
values.

16:07.260 --> 16:12.860
Um, but yeah, that was, that was some good times with the, uh, Game Genie.

16:12.860 --> 16:18.940
And then, uh, our, my, my other favorite was watching, um, my friend's copy of Akari Warriors

16:18.940 --> 16:20.700
that was just really glitchy.

16:20.700 --> 16:26.340
Like, it was like dirty or something, but it would get glitchier as we'd play through

16:26.340 --> 16:27.340
the game.

16:27.340 --> 16:32.300
So like at one point, like, Hey, I'm stuck under the background now, uh, I can't really

16:32.300 --> 16:35.300
attack anything, but I'm going to keep following you guys.

16:35.300 --> 16:40.860
And I don't know, it's just, it was really silly cause it would just be completely messed

16:40.860 --> 16:41.860
up.

16:41.860 --> 16:45.100
Uh, Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com is talking about all the, all the ones from

16:45.100 --> 16:47.100
Street Fighter II, the World Warrior.

16:47.100 --> 16:51.260
You could turn Dalzium invisible with the right button combo or Guile's various tricks

16:51.260 --> 16:52.500
and you could even reboot the game.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
Yeah.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.740
Wasn't there the whole like quote unquote handcuffing, you know, Guile's handcuffs or

16:56.740 --> 17:00.220
something that was like, that was like a, uh, arcade urban legend, but like you can

17:00.220 --> 17:03.440
do it on the super Nintendo version, but it really was just that you like stun the other

17:03.440 --> 17:05.620
character or something and it caused the game to reboot.

17:05.620 --> 17:06.620
I don't know.

17:06.620 --> 17:07.620
My memory is a little fuzzy on that.

17:07.620 --> 17:08.620
Sorry guys.

17:08.620 --> 17:13.180
But, uh, yeah, I also liked codes that would like really change the nature of the game

17:13.180 --> 17:15.580
because you guys all know I love the guardian legend, right?

17:15.580 --> 17:18.660
It's like one of those eight bit Nintendo classics that, you know, I think it was really

17:18.660 --> 17:22.660
underrated at the time, but in retrospect it was like, so fricking phenomenal.

17:22.660 --> 17:24.620
Well, there was a code in that game.

17:24.620 --> 17:28.540
If you just put TGL as the password, you just put TGL.

17:28.540 --> 17:33.980
What happens is that it removes all of these Zelda-esque stages, the overworld parts of

17:33.980 --> 17:36.760
the game, and it just becomes a straight up shooter.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.100
You just play the shooter stages.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.100
That's all you do.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.420
So it was like, it kind of like changes the nature of the game in a way.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.820
I always thought that was kind of cool.

17:43.860 --> 17:47.180
And you'd even get like, I think you'd get random power ups that you would get from the

17:47.180 --> 17:49.140
overworld stages, like after each stage.

17:49.140 --> 17:53.260
So it's like they built this mode of the game specifically for people to be able to play

17:53.260 --> 17:54.780
like just a shooter.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.140
That's kind of neat.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.500
And Dr. Sui says the handcuffs was only in the arcade version.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.500
All right.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.500
My bad guys.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.500
That was like 20 years ago.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.660
All right.

18:03.660 --> 18:04.660
So game glitches.

18:04.660 --> 18:05.660
Good times.

18:05.660 --> 18:06.660
Good times.

18:06.660 --> 18:09.980
See if there's any other comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

18:10.020 --> 18:15.220
Dungeon Buster says turning the power on and off really quickly with the Atari VCS created

18:15.220 --> 18:16.660
screwy game effects.

18:16.660 --> 18:17.940
I don't remember that.

18:17.940 --> 18:21.420
I seem to remember there was something though where we would sit there and we'd reset the

18:21.420 --> 18:23.940
game like 30 times to get something to happen.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.340
My memory is really fuzzy, but I remember something with that.

18:26.340 --> 18:29.060
Cause you know, like the switches on that thing were really, there were like these little

18:29.060 --> 18:33.060
nubs you'd push up and like the reset one, you could literally flick.

18:33.060 --> 18:36.180
And like, I remember sitting there flicking it like 30 times to get something to happen.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.300
I don't remember what.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.580
That's a really horrible story.

18:39.580 --> 18:40.580
Isn't it?

18:40.580 --> 18:42.020
You guys, something really cool will happen.

18:42.020 --> 18:46.100
I think, but I don't know, but I was like six at the time.

18:46.100 --> 18:51.380
So just try it on all your games.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.740
Tiger Claw asks, what does TGL stand for?

18:54.740 --> 18:59.180
The guardian legend, Tiger Claw, the name of the game.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.740
Perhaps you missed me saying that was the name of the game.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.340
Uh, let's see.

19:03.340 --> 19:06.900
Tiger Claw also says, I remember back in the days would play metal gear on the NES.

19:06.900 --> 19:10.940
I used to try to enter random passwords into the game and sometimes get lucky when the

19:10.940 --> 19:15.500
game loads with certain number of items I couldn't find before making the game easier

19:15.500 --> 19:16.500
to play through.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
Huh.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
Interesting.

19:18.500 --> 19:23.140
Uh, back in the day when they had gaming codes in the back of magazines, not anymore.

19:23.140 --> 19:24.700
That's part of a DLC pack.

19:24.700 --> 19:25.700
Yeah.

19:25.700 --> 19:26.700
Or yeah.

19:26.700 --> 19:32.460
I go to game facts.com if there are even codes in the game, which what, what recent games

19:32.460 --> 19:34.080
have those types of codes in them?

19:34.080 --> 19:35.080
Not a lot.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.840
I thought a five did, and I'm sure there's other games out there.

19:37.840 --> 19:38.840
Yeah.

19:38.840 --> 19:42.120
Well sometimes also some companies kind of do it like intentionally, especially a lot

19:42.120 --> 19:46.020
of the indie stuff that tries to invoke the retro vibe we'll, we'll do that.

19:46.020 --> 19:48.520
So all right, nice.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.200
Uh, and dungeon buster says it was really random.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.940
We just kept going at it with the, uh, resetting on the Atari until it created a bizarro screen

19:55.940 --> 19:58.200
that we try to play with whatever game we had.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.200
It sounds like, like the kill screen on Pacman or something.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.200
I don't know.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.200
All right.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.200
All right.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.380
The talk is fine and we'll do more of it later with the classic game of the week, but let's

20:07.380 --> 20:11.200
talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this

20:11.200 --> 20:13.640
week, whether they be new or old.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.640
Logie?

20:14.640 --> 20:18.080
Uh, the only thing I played this week was modern warfare two because it had been several

20:18.080 --> 20:21.120
weeks since our, our kind of group got together and played.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.560
So I'm like, Hey, uh, you guys want to play modern warfare two because it's been several

20:25.560 --> 20:28.000
weeks since we've played our game and they said yeah.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.280
And then I kicked the crap out of them in a very vicious way.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.880
Uh, I did notice a lot of places I can actually climb up on.

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
So that's, that's kind of fun.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.280
I like, I kind of doing that kind of thing, but, um, yeah, it was fun.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.280
I had fun.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.980
Um, that was about it cause I didn't really play anything else.

20:45.980 --> 20:46.980
Even programming a lot.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.200
I've been looking at your Twitter.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.200
Yeah.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.200
Putting updates on your game.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
Well, okay.

20:51.200 --> 20:57.160
So like I decided to change up how, um, cause right when I originally had it, I had a, an

20:57.160 --> 21:00.960
Atlas, which is basically just, it's a big texture file.

21:00.960 --> 21:05.320
Instead of having several textures, you have one big texture with several textures inside

21:05.320 --> 21:09.400
of it and you just kind of move where it looks for that texture.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.400
So, okay.

21:10.400 --> 21:15.760
Looks at, you know, 50% over on the top or, you know, 75%, et cetera, et cetera.

21:15.760 --> 21:16.880
So that's how I had it.

21:16.880 --> 21:17.880
The change colors.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.080
I'm like, well, I don't really need to do that.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.120
I want some additional like detail in there.

21:21.120 --> 21:25.080
So I'm going to add a bump map to it so I can have a little bit of a texture and it

21:25.080 --> 21:26.080
looks better.

21:26.080 --> 21:30.000
And then I can just change the colors with the vertex colors cause in the actual like

21:30.040 --> 21:36.920
3D mesh, you can save a color and some people use that for like blending between two textures

21:36.920 --> 21:38.840
or actually change the color of something.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.520
So in this case, I'm actually going to use it to change the color.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.520
So I'm like, okay, fine.

21:42.520 --> 21:47.740
That's, I'll just change it up and I'll create this texture and we'll go with that.

21:47.740 --> 21:53.120
And then I was looking at the code for each mesh and I realized that the program they

21:53.160 --> 21:59.400
had for the, I guess, add on they had for the Atlas thing was really fucking up all

21:59.400 --> 22:00.560
my meshes.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.880
It was like screwing up.

22:01.880 --> 22:07.040
They have this thing called the UV, which basically says, okay, here's how I'm going

22:07.040 --> 22:10.360
to draw this texture on this object.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.060
So you set, okay, here's where this corner goes.

22:13.060 --> 22:15.280
Here's where this corner goes.

22:15.280 --> 22:20.880
And you just kind of lay it out so that it knows how to put the texture on that object.

22:20.880 --> 22:26.200
And it, all it was doing was creating a single point where it was putting the texture.

22:26.200 --> 22:31.040
So I didn't notice it on these objects because I was using a solid color and so it would

22:31.040 --> 22:32.800
still be a solid color anyways.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.940
But when I actually wanted to put texture on it, it was just all fucked up.

22:35.940 --> 22:39.180
So I had to write something to manually fix everything.

22:39.180 --> 22:45.240
And so I'm just kind of, I finished that last night and I'm just have to fix all my UVs

22:45.240 --> 22:49.800
and then actually save new meshes off of that.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.400
And I'm going to delete, it'll allow me to also go back and cause I have like several

22:53.400 --> 22:57.840
copies of all these 3D objects I've made when I've made changes to them that I have to keep

22:57.840 --> 22:58.920
referencing too.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.640
So I'm just going to clean all that out.

23:00.640 --> 23:04.840
And it's just kind of funny because all these things I end up either buying or finding,

23:04.840 --> 23:10.840
I ended up writing my own version of it because it either doesn't work right or I just end

23:10.840 --> 23:12.680
up using my own version instead.

23:12.680 --> 23:15.720
It sounds like it's been an extraordinarily educational project.

23:15.720 --> 23:16.720
Exactly.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.720
Well, that's the whole reason.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
I hope you get through it.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.000
I really hope you get something playable out of this.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.640
I mean, that's the whole thing is why I went with the Atlas program anyways because I didn't

23:24.640 --> 23:25.840
want to mesh.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.560
Like I thought all this like, oh, working with meshes and UVs.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.880
I don't understand any of this is really confusing to me.

23:32.880 --> 23:36.560
And then when I actually did, I'm like, wow, actually that's not that confusing now that

23:36.560 --> 23:38.400
I've messed with this.

23:38.400 --> 23:43.960
And so now I can do cool things like I can manually modify my object and stuff like,

23:43.960 --> 23:48.560
okay, I want to move this point over and I type in a new coordinate for it.

23:48.560 --> 23:53.200
And hit build and I can see my changes and allows me to have like full access all over

23:53.200 --> 23:56.880
the stuff instead of relying on a 3D program.

23:56.880 --> 24:00.040
Because I've rebuilt my, you know, objects several times.

24:00.040 --> 24:03.400
So this is the last time I'm doing it.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.880
But yeah, it's just, I'm learning a lot through and it's kind of exciting in that sense.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.380
And so I'm just trying the whole point of getting, you know, because I started building

24:11.380 --> 24:12.380
an object.

24:12.380 --> 24:13.380
So I was like, okay, cool.

24:13.380 --> 24:16.260
I'm going to get to the point where I can actually build some stuff and then start working

24:16.260 --> 24:19.620
on the game part again instead of just the engine part.

24:19.620 --> 24:23.000
And you know, that's when I was like, okay, well, I just want to change how it looks because

24:23.000 --> 24:24.620
everything was really plain.

24:24.620 --> 24:27.680
It just wasn't, it didn't look right to me.

24:27.680 --> 24:33.340
And so now that I'm, now I have to go back and change all that stuff and then I'll go

24:33.340 --> 24:38.580
back to building assets again and start working on the actual game part.

24:38.580 --> 24:39.580
Nice.

24:39.580 --> 24:44.460
Um, but yeah, I mean, give me something playable for Christmas.

24:44.460 --> 24:45.460
I'm working on it.

24:45.460 --> 24:46.460
It's taking time.

24:46.460 --> 24:47.460
All right.

24:47.460 --> 24:51.220
Uh, well, if there's nothing else for your gaming week, I'll talk briefly about my gaming

24:51.220 --> 24:52.220
week.

24:52.220 --> 24:57.300
Although admittedly, uh, after getting back from LA, I had a high priority this week to

24:57.300 --> 24:59.700
finish orange is the new black season two.

24:59.700 --> 25:03.900
Look, it's, I don't watch a lot of TV shows, but I watched that one.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.720
And because of the way Netflix's model is where people can binge watch everything in

25:07.720 --> 25:13.120
a weekend, I have so many friends that do that and then start spoiling everything.

25:13.120 --> 25:17.680
So like I, I'm afraid to go to certain places on the internet, Tumblr being one of them

25:17.680 --> 25:20.840
because I knew I would get spoiled on orange is the new black.

25:20.840 --> 25:26.000
So I finally sat down, watched the whole thing and, uh, I'm not, I won't, don't worry.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.280
I'm not going to spoil anything about it.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.360
I will just say I finished it finally.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.320
So I could finally use some of that time to play video games again.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.200
Uh, so I did check out a few games.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.440
I did check out at least one new game this week and then I went back and revisited one

25:38.440 --> 25:39.440
too.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.200
Uh, the new game I checked out this week is available on PlayStation four.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.320
I believe it's on PC.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.960
I saw it on Wii U as well.

25:45.960 --> 25:49.000
Uh, it is called 1001 spikes.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.200
And speaking of retro games, Xbox indie even, is it really, that's where I think it first

25:53.200 --> 25:54.200
started with.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.200
Oh, interesting.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.200
Indie games.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.200
Well now it's on a lot of other places too.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.600
It's on a PlayStation four is where I checked it out myself.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.880
Uh, it's very much a retro game.

26:01.880 --> 26:06.620
Like this is like the, it's like eight bit nes straight up.

26:06.620 --> 26:11.940
Like the sound, the way it plays, the controls, like all that stuff just really feel like

26:11.940 --> 26:15.380
an old school eight bit nes game, but of course for widescreen.

26:15.380 --> 26:19.700
So it's a little weird to be playing something like that on the PlayStation four, but hey,

26:19.700 --> 26:24.260
you know, I realized the whole retro stuff is kind of in right now and it is, it is kind

26:24.260 --> 26:25.660
of fun to play.

26:25.660 --> 26:31.060
Um, so in a sense it's a bit of a puzzler game, but it's like a puzzler mixed with

26:31.060 --> 26:32.300
like super meat boy.

26:32.300 --> 26:38.300
It's one of those things where you're going to do this level over and over and over again

26:38.300 --> 26:42.380
and you're going to go crazy doing it because these spikes will pop out of the ground that

26:42.380 --> 26:46.020
you didn't realize were there before and boo, you're dead.

26:46.020 --> 26:48.180
And uh, you know, all those sorts of things.

26:48.180 --> 26:53.180
You have to kind of like memorize how the level is laid out in order to really get,

26:53.180 --> 26:54.900
you know, through the level.

26:54.900 --> 26:58.260
And the reason why it's called the thousand one spikes, I believe is because you have

26:58.260 --> 27:00.140
1001 lives.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.600
So every time you lose a life, you go down.

27:02.600 --> 27:07.900
So I think, I think I only beat the first world and I'm super meat boy in a way.

27:07.900 --> 27:11.620
Yeah, but you're still limited on the number of lives and super meat boy, you didn't, you

27:11.620 --> 27:13.060
weren't really limited on it.

27:13.060 --> 27:16.640
So it's, it's a little bit of that scare factor because like, Oh shit, I need to not die so

27:16.640 --> 27:21.260
much because I just got through world one and I was down to like 980 lives.

27:21.260 --> 27:24.140
I was like, I need to stop being so stupid on some of these things I'm doing.

27:24.140 --> 27:29.100
I want to see is I want to see them bring, I want to be the guy to like steam and um,

27:29.100 --> 27:31.380
you know, like Wii U or something like that.

27:31.380 --> 27:32.860
I think that would be funny.

27:32.860 --> 27:33.860
Yeah.

27:33.860 --> 27:40.220
Cause I remember trying to play on, you know, I want to be the guy guide in and that's fucking

27:40.220 --> 27:41.220
hard.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.540
Even the original game is fucking hard.

27:42.540 --> 27:43.540
Yeah.

27:43.540 --> 27:47.420
Uh, dark to see you in chat says I've heard 1000 spikes was tough.

27:47.420 --> 27:48.420
Yes.

27:48.420 --> 27:50.740
Like when I compare it to super meat boy, there's a reason for that because it's that

27:50.740 --> 27:51.740
whole infuriating.

27:51.740 --> 27:52.740
Damn it.

27:52.740 --> 27:53.740
I died.

27:53.740 --> 27:54.740
Damn it.

27:54.740 --> 27:55.740
I died again.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.740
God damn it.

27:56.740 --> 28:02.300
I was almost complete with that, but I had the DRM free version so that I don't think

28:02.300 --> 28:04.140
that transferred over to my steam version.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.460
I'm like, I don't want to play this again.

28:06.460 --> 28:10.980
I only have like a, like one or two of those things left to get, you know?

28:10.980 --> 28:15.100
Oh, and then here's the other thing too, because on PlayStation four, so every time you die,

28:15.100 --> 28:19.900
the controller like flashes pink, like, so like you see, like I see it on my hands cause

28:19.900 --> 28:22.840
like, you know, the way I'm holding a controller, especially if I'm playing in a dark room.

28:22.840 --> 28:25.860
So when I die, it's like my room lights up slightly.

28:25.860 --> 28:29.580
Like you're an idiot.

28:29.580 --> 28:33.340
So it's interesting how that little controller light is really added a lot to so many different

28:33.340 --> 28:35.700
games, especially to those who tend to play in like dark rooms.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.820
So the TV lights, the thing.

28:37.820 --> 28:40.820
So there you go.

28:40.820 --> 28:45.580
Fifth dream says you can use the Konami code for 3 million and three lives.

28:45.580 --> 28:46.580
Is that, is that real?

28:46.580 --> 28:49.260
I didn't know that if that's a thing that's pretty funny.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.220
So let's see.

28:51.220 --> 28:52.220
So there you go.

28:52.220 --> 28:53.220
Sorry.

28:53.220 --> 28:55.380
I'm laughing at this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

28:55.380 --> 28:59.220
This is something you said, Loki orange, orange launch radio is the new black Wolf.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.220
Yeah.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.220
Cause someone said, yeah.

29:01.220 --> 29:02.780
An active to the orange laundry is a new black.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.260
So yeah, I like that.

29:04.260 --> 29:05.260
That's funny.

29:05.260 --> 29:06.260
That's funny.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.260
All right.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.260
Uh, okay.

29:08.260 --> 29:09.820
So I did revisit a classic this week too.

29:09.820 --> 29:17.680
So you guys know Shane, good Palomine friends, a very long time, and Shane has this really

29:17.680 --> 29:18.680
good ability.

29:18.680 --> 29:23.820
If you weren't aware to talk people into, to talk people into buying and playing games

29:23.820 --> 29:25.620
that they probably wouldn't have done otherwise.

29:25.620 --> 29:26.620
Right.

29:26.620 --> 29:28.380
Like the man should sell video games for a living.

29:28.380 --> 29:32.940
Like I realize it's kind of what you do, Loki, but like Shane's really, really, really good

29:32.940 --> 29:33.940
at it.

29:33.940 --> 29:34.940
Right.

29:34.940 --> 29:39.500
So, um, the game he convinced me to give another go to so I could play with him and one of

29:39.500 --> 29:47.700
his other friends he plays MMOs with is five has the 11, the classic and uh, you look your

29:47.700 --> 29:48.900
needs to go free to play.

29:48.900 --> 29:52.340
I mean, seriously, that, that would ruin my life though.

29:52.380 --> 29:56.740
Well, and my God is the, there's the system to like get your character activated and all

29:56.740 --> 29:57.740
stuff of that game.

29:57.740 --> 29:58.740
It's a mess.

29:58.740 --> 30:02.820
Like, because you know, the play online system is so old, like they've really had to kind

30:02.820 --> 30:10.300
of backend all this new stuff, like the Square Enix global ID and all this stuff into the,

30:10.300 --> 30:12.060
you know, the old play online thing.

30:12.060 --> 30:17.060
So, um, but I did finally figure it out and I got it up and running and I'm being trolled

30:17.060 --> 30:22.180
by Alan in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com who says, how many MMOs are you subscribed

30:22.180 --> 30:23.180
to right now?

30:23.180 --> 30:24.180
Just wondering.

30:24.180 --> 30:28.260
I have three, three MMO subscriptions right now, but not on purpose.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.260
Okay.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.260
Here's what happened.

30:30.260 --> 30:33.060
Finally I see 14 that one I'm like actively playing and I like a lot.

30:33.060 --> 30:39.100
I did 11 for the lolz and you know, I'll talk more about that in a second, but my third

30:39.100 --> 30:44.100
subscription, I accidentally got my world of Warcraft subscription renewed for another

30:44.100 --> 30:47.700
month because I went back to that last month, just kind of on my own whim.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.220
I was just like, Oh, I wonder what's changed.

30:49.220 --> 30:50.220
What's different.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.740
And the answer is nothing.

30:52.740 --> 30:57.440
So I checked that out and I went to go like, Oh, I need to go cancel my game before it

30:57.440 --> 30:58.940
recharges me for another month.

30:58.940 --> 31:03.540
I log into the site and it had renewed the day before.

31:03.540 --> 31:04.960
Yay.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.380
So yeah, I ended up paying for that for another month.

31:07.380 --> 31:12.620
So right now I have three subscriptions, but the world of Warcraft one will expire next

31:12.620 --> 31:16.580
month and I'm not going back to that until the expansion is out.

31:16.580 --> 31:19.180
And I don't think the final fantasy 11 one will last very long.

31:19.180 --> 31:21.580
It's just kind of one of those, like for the lolz things.

31:21.580 --> 31:25.140
But um, I will say this Loki, since I know you used to play the game for a long time

31:25.140 --> 31:29.760
yet again, even though I just, I kinda flirted with this game about a year and a half ago

31:29.760 --> 31:33.020
or so, you know, I was playing for a little bit and I talked about how like some of the

31:33.020 --> 31:36.380
experiencing was different cause you use the books, you go out in the world and you find

31:36.380 --> 31:39.500
the books and you, you can kill certain monsters that way.

31:39.500 --> 31:43.660
Well, they added two new, like really, really major things into the game to make it a little

31:43.660 --> 31:47.540
more less grindy and honestly more single player friendly.

31:47.540 --> 31:50.300
And the hugest one is called the trust system.

31:50.300 --> 31:54.180
And with the trust system, what happens is you get this quest and you'll go find certain

31:54.180 --> 32:01.140
NPCs and they will allow you to basically clone them to make alter egos of them so that

32:01.140 --> 32:02.920
they can join you in the world.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.440
You summon them basically.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.820
It's a new type of magic category called trust and you summon them.

32:07.820 --> 32:11.800
And so it's like you have a party full of NPCs, but they're fully functioning party

32:11.800 --> 32:17.140
members that will act like, you know, those class types should, for example, since I started

32:17.140 --> 32:22.900
in one of the cities in 11 Bastok, um, you can talk to an NPC that is a warrior, Najee,

32:22.900 --> 32:24.420
who's a warrior in Bastok.

32:24.420 --> 32:25.420
And so he'll join your party.

32:25.420 --> 32:26.460
So I have a tank.

32:26.460 --> 32:30.460
So when I'm a red mage right now and I can cure myself, me and a tank make a pretty good

32:30.460 --> 32:31.460
party.

32:31.460 --> 32:32.460
Oh man.

32:32.460 --> 32:33.460
Yeah.

32:33.460 --> 32:34.460
And here's the thing.

32:34.460 --> 32:38.900
You can have up to three of them at one time, man, a party of four anywhere you go.

32:38.900 --> 32:39.900
Right.

32:39.900 --> 32:40.900
Okay.

32:40.900 --> 32:41.900
So that's one big thing.

32:41.900 --> 32:45.980
And they, I guess just in the last update, they made it so that like if let's say Shane

32:45.980 --> 32:49.760
and I are in a party, he can call two people.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.540
I can call two more people.

32:51.540 --> 32:52.540
We have a full party.

32:52.540 --> 32:54.540
That'd be a party of six.

32:54.540 --> 32:55.540
Yeah.

32:55.540 --> 32:56.540
Is it a party?

32:56.540 --> 32:57.540
Uh, final fantasy 11 parties for six people.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.540
Really?

32:58.540 --> 32:59.540
Yeah.

32:59.540 --> 33:00.540
Wow.

33:00.540 --> 33:01.540
Is five.

33:01.540 --> 33:02.540
14 is four.

33:02.540 --> 33:03.540
They all have to be different for some reason.

33:03.540 --> 33:04.540
I don't remember.

33:04.540 --> 33:05.540
It's been so long.

33:05.540 --> 33:06.540
Yeah.

33:06.540 --> 33:07.540
So, um, let's see.

33:07.540 --> 33:08.540
So yeah, there's a that.

33:08.540 --> 33:11.660
And then the other big, big thing they added to the game is something called the records

33:11.660 --> 33:14.140
of eminence, I think is what it's called.

33:14.140 --> 33:15.700
And it's, it's like achievements.

33:15.700 --> 33:16.700
Okay.

33:16.700 --> 33:21.100
It works like achievements, but they're achievements that get you rewards and it's rewards in the

33:21.100 --> 33:22.940
form of XP.

33:22.940 --> 33:23.940
Big one, right?

33:23.940 --> 33:28.640
Gill and these like tabs or something that you can turn in for, um, armor and things

33:28.640 --> 33:30.380
like that, uh, elsewhere.

33:30.380 --> 33:38.760
Um, so it's like, you know, uh, kill 10 monsters in South Gustav Berg or, uh, do one, do a

33:38.760 --> 33:43.500
move that does 11 to 20 damage 10 times or something like that.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.500
That's cool.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.500
Yeah.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.500
When you do that, you get XP.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.500
So it helps.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.580
I wish this game would be a free to play.

33:48.580 --> 33:52.580
So like in one night last night, I got to level 10 real quick or I'd be fine if they

33:52.580 --> 33:58.220
just raised the price, let's just raise the price to like, you know, back to $50 again

33:58.220 --> 34:03.100
and make it like buy to play, you know, like Guild Wars, uh, and fifth dream in our chat

34:03.100 --> 34:06.300
over at live.vog network.com says, please do this in Final Fantasy 14.

34:06.300 --> 34:10.660
Well, you know, it's interesting because, um, and the reason why I bring this up, cause

34:10.660 --> 34:13.660
I'm sure some of you guys are getting put to sleep with the Final Fantasy 11 chatter.

34:13.660 --> 34:16.460
If you're not laughing at the fact that I went back to a game that's like 12 years old

34:16.460 --> 34:17.460
or whatever.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.460
Who cares?

34:18.460 --> 34:22.480
Well, I will be, I think it's interesting to go back to these aging MMOs and see how

34:22.480 --> 34:29.420
they're keeping themselves playable when their user base is dwindling fast, because obviously

34:29.420 --> 34:34.740
Final Fantasy 14 tore a big piece of 11's fan base out, you know, cause a lot of people

34:34.740 --> 34:38.780
moved on to 14, even though the games are very, very different in how they play, you

34:38.780 --> 34:43.020
know, because Final Fantasy 11 is more rooted in EverQuest and Final Fantasy 14 is more

34:43.020 --> 34:46.740
rooted in this weird Warcraft Guild Wars 2 hybrid thing.

34:46.740 --> 34:47.740
Okay.

34:47.740 --> 34:51.820
So they play very different at its core, but, um, I still think 14 kind of took a lot of

34:51.820 --> 34:56.460
11's players, but there's still, you know, uh, I did a slash C all so you can see all

34:56.460 --> 34:57.460
the people on the server.

34:57.460 --> 35:01.940
There were still like 1800 people logged into the server yesterday that I was playing on.

35:01.940 --> 35:04.220
So kind of interesting.

35:04.220 --> 35:05.740
Lots and lots of level 99's.

35:05.740 --> 35:06.740
That's for sure.

35:06.740 --> 35:07.740
Uh, let's see.

35:07.740 --> 35:08.740
Let's see.

35:08.740 --> 35:09.740
So let's see.

35:09.740 --> 35:16.340
Um, over at, uh, live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says, Shane's should be VOG's official PR

35:16.340 --> 35:17.340
person.

35:17.340 --> 35:18.340
Not a bad idea.

35:18.340 --> 35:21.060
If he'd be willing to do it, he could probably, uh, get us some more listeners maybe.

35:21.060 --> 35:25.700
Uh, Alan, who of course is, is my boyfriend is in chat and talking about, uh, listening

35:25.700 --> 35:27.680
to me play Final Fantasy 11.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.900
And when you try to sell him a game, he's like, this is stupid forever and I'll never

35:30.900 --> 35:31.900
play it forever.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.380
And he stays true to his word.

35:33.380 --> 35:34.560
He will never play it.

35:34.560 --> 35:38.640
But this guy is like, Shane, stop it and look at what happens.

35:38.640 --> 35:42.920
Uh, he's, that is all in response to Shane is the worst enabler.

35:42.920 --> 35:43.920
So there you go.

35:43.920 --> 35:50.640
So yeah, I went back to Final Fantasy 11, but I don't, I don't know how long it'll last.

35:50.640 --> 35:55.760
I mean, it's still, I gotta say there's still things about 11 that hold up very well after

35:55.760 --> 35:56.760
12 years.

35:56.760 --> 36:00.240
The graphics are starting to show their age a little bit, but you know, especially on

36:00.240 --> 36:04.440
the PC where you can kind of up the resolutions and everything through some registry edits,

36:04.440 --> 36:06.680
it doesn't look bad.

36:06.680 --> 36:09.680
You know, it's still, I mean, it was a game on the 360 and it probably looks about like

36:09.680 --> 36:10.840
that on your PC.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.780
So it's still, you know, has that the music is still great.

36:13.780 --> 36:16.840
The class design is really fantastic.

36:16.840 --> 36:20.680
There's so many classes in the game and the fact that you can have a main job and you

36:20.680 --> 36:26.640
get a sub job where you get half the levels of whatever second job you want and that you

36:26.640 --> 36:28.640
can switch those jobs on demand at any time.

36:28.640 --> 36:32.520
You know, that whole system is really fantastic and I can't think of anything really like

36:32.520 --> 36:34.560
it in other MMOs.

36:34.560 --> 36:39.720
So cause even 14 doesn't have sub jobs, it has cross-classing, which is kind of a different

36:39.720 --> 36:40.720
thing.

36:40.720 --> 36:41.720
Oh man.

36:41.720 --> 36:45.640
Final Fantasy 11 HD free to play.

36:45.640 --> 36:46.640
Dream on.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.640
Dream on.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.640
It is.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.080
Well, there was those rumors about a Vita version a long time ago, but then it's like,

36:51.080 --> 36:52.600
how would you chat on the Vita version?

36:52.600 --> 36:53.600
Who cares?

36:53.600 --> 36:54.600
Voice chat.

36:54.600 --> 36:55.600
Screw it.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.800
Who cares?

36:57.800 --> 37:01.080
Act Deft in chat says the only thing that's stopping Shane from conquering the world is

37:01.080 --> 37:02.080
apathy.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.080
Whatever.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.080
All right.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.080
So there you go.

37:05.080 --> 37:07.120
I've been playing a little bit of that as well.

37:07.120 --> 37:12.220
And then I've been continuing to play Final Fantasy 14 as well and some Mario Kart 8 today

37:12.220 --> 37:16.360
as well, which moving into our housekeeping segment, I will talk about now.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.840
So I plugged this last week on the show.

37:18.840 --> 37:24.920
We were going to do today a tournament for podcast cross zone, which is the panel that

37:24.920 --> 37:32.280
ourselves, uh, horde house, uh, video game, realness, game, buoy.org, game bar, Koopa

37:32.280 --> 37:38.140
club, all these podcasts coming together to do this panel at gamer X, uh, which is only

37:38.140 --> 37:41.200
like two weeks away at this point, which I can't believe, but, um, yeah, we're all coming

37:41.200 --> 37:42.200
together to do this panel.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.600
So we wanted to bring awareness, you know, just try to get it out there.

37:44.600 --> 37:48.260
So we had this tournament today, uh, and that happened a couple hours before the show tonight.

37:48.260 --> 37:49.260
We had pretty good participation.

37:49.260 --> 37:52.460
Uh, I guess everybody couldn't fit in one room.

37:52.460 --> 37:54.260
So there was like several rooms going on.

37:54.260 --> 37:59.420
Uh, and you know, you played 12 games to get your score and, uh, the whole thing was won

37:59.420 --> 38:03.820
by Jeremy over at Koopa club, who I think got first place in almost every single race

38:03.820 --> 38:04.820
he did.

38:04.820 --> 38:06.740
Cause, uh, he's, I guess, scary.

38:06.740 --> 38:07.740
Good.

38:07.740 --> 38:08.740
Yeah.

38:08.740 --> 38:09.740
I was not in the same room as he was.

38:09.740 --> 38:13.040
I was in a room with like act deft from like OLR and stuff.

38:13.040 --> 38:17.260
And I was with the guys from video game realness, uh, were in my, uh, battle.

38:17.260 --> 38:21.020
So it was unfortunate that because there's so many people, we couldn't all really race

38:21.020 --> 38:22.020
against each other.

38:22.020 --> 38:26.100
It was still, I mean, it was still a loads of fun, uh, just kind of knowing that like

38:26.100 --> 38:31.020
when I use the golden mushroom to fly past Delvin from video game, Rena realness, right

38:31.020 --> 38:34.380
at the last minute, it's like, I can hear him screaming in my ear, right?

38:34.380 --> 38:37.720
Like, Oh no, you didn't that type of thing.

38:37.720 --> 38:38.720
So it was a lot of fun.

38:38.720 --> 38:50.180
Uh, now as far as how I did, I have like the fourth from worst score out of everybody.

38:50.220 --> 38:52.460
I'm just not that good at Mario Kart eight.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.460
It's okay.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.460
It's okay.

38:54.460 --> 38:55.460
I don't know.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.180
Some of these guys, they figure out how to get to the front of the pack right away and

38:57.180 --> 38:59.860
they never, they never fall back.

38:59.860 --> 39:04.060
Whereas I have the problem where when everything gets chaotic, I fall back to like 10th place

39:04.060 --> 39:05.660
and then I have to keep catching up.

39:05.660 --> 39:10.080
And if I'm lucky, I'll get all the way up to like third, but usually I end up in like

39:10.080 --> 39:11.420
seventh place.

39:11.420 --> 39:14.180
So there it is.

39:14.180 --> 39:15.180
So yeah.

39:15.180 --> 39:20.460
Congrats to Jeremy from Koopa club for winning the podcast cross zone tournament.

39:20.460 --> 39:24.780
You bastard, even though they gave the prize because they did, they wanted to give the

39:24.780 --> 39:26.280
prize to like a listener.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.180
They gave it to somebody else and I unfortunately don't, don't remember who that was off the

39:29.180 --> 39:30.180
top of my head.

39:30.180 --> 39:33.240
Uh, but I think it was one of the listeners of Koopa club that ended up winning that.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.900
So grats to you guys.

39:34.900 --> 39:38.260
Speaking of Koopa club, um, they had me on as a guest on Friday.

39:38.260 --> 39:43.580
We taped the show and uh, it was myself and some of the guys from Koopa club and a slide

39:43.580 --> 39:46.220
kick from game buoy.org all did the show.

39:46.220 --> 39:48.740
And I got to say it was really funny.

39:48.740 --> 39:52.140
And we played, uh, we played Nintendo password.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.700
Like you know how we do game shows here on OLR.

39:53.700 --> 39:54.700
They do some on Koopa club too.

39:54.700 --> 39:56.240
They do password is one of their games.

39:56.240 --> 40:01.620
So, uh, we did Nintendo password and there were some crazy words, uh, which I'm not going

40:01.620 --> 40:06.500
to give away what happens, but, uh, one of the passwords was, uh, fire.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.420
I think it was fireball, right?

40:09.420 --> 40:12.020
And I said fire and that wasn't good enough.

40:12.060 --> 40:18.340
So the clue John gives me to try to get it is just like, what are you doing right now?

40:18.340 --> 40:19.340
So check that out.

40:19.340 --> 40:23.060
I don't think they posted it just yet, but Jeremy said he'd get it up today or tomorrow.

40:23.060 --> 40:25.860
So it's episode 52 you're going to be looking for.

40:25.860 --> 40:30.180
So they, they really edit their podcast together and, you know, shift segments around and put

40:30.180 --> 40:31.180
music in it.

40:31.180 --> 40:34.500
So it's a little, it takes them a little bit to edit it, but check that out.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.420
That's Koopa with a Q club with a K.

40:37.420 --> 40:38.420
So they're Q K.

40:38.420 --> 40:39.900
So, uh, check that out.

40:39.940 --> 40:43.620
Uh, I will be on episode 52 whenever that is posted.

40:43.620 --> 40:47.820
Um, and that is really all I can think of for housekeeping because of podcast cross

40:47.820 --> 40:53.660
zone and gamer X, there will be no show on July 12th, uh, but we should be here.

40:53.660 --> 40:58.780
There's two more shows until then, um, our 12th birthday here at orange launch radio

40:58.780 --> 41:00.020
is tomorrow.

41:00.020 --> 41:03.540
Our very first episode was June 23rd, 2002.

41:03.540 --> 41:06.860
Um, so we will be turning 12 years old tomorrow.

41:06.900 --> 41:10.740
So we'll, uh, we didn't want to have a bunch of celebration though without dark soccer

41:10.740 --> 41:11.740
here.

41:11.740 --> 41:14.980
So we'll talk a little more and, and have some retrospective and reflection on 12 years

41:14.980 --> 41:19.380
of orange launch radio next week, uh, on the 29th of June.

41:19.380 --> 41:20.380
All right.

41:20.380 --> 41:22.020
That's all I have for housekeeping.

41:22.020 --> 41:26.540
Plugs for Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge

41:26.540 --> 41:27.540
radio.

41:27.540 --> 41:29.180
Let's get into some gaming news.

41:29.180 --> 41:30.180
Loki.

41:30.180 --> 41:31.180
All right.

41:31.180 --> 41:36.180
So, um, apparently insomniac games does what Ubisoft doesn't.

41:36.220 --> 41:40.860
And that would be, uh, they had, it was funny, they had this nice little teaser video as

41:40.860 --> 41:43.700
talking about sunset overdrive and the customization.

41:43.700 --> 41:49.620
And of course they said, you can play as a male character or as a female character and

41:49.620 --> 41:53.620
all the customizations are completely neutral, um, or gender neutral.

41:53.620 --> 41:59.780
So if you want to have a guy in a dress or you want, you know, a woman in, I don't know,

41:59.780 --> 42:03.940
guy clothes, I guess, regular clothes, you can do that.

42:03.940 --> 42:07.980
And what's kind of funny, a little tongue in cheek, I guess with the video, they have

42:07.980 --> 42:13.500
the character dressed up like one of the assassins from assassin's creed, you know?

42:13.500 --> 42:15.820
So, uh, that's pretty cool.

42:15.820 --> 42:19.280
Well, at least, uh, lots of customization there cause I know all the gameplay that they've

42:19.280 --> 42:24.980
shown so far has been kind of the, um, you know, punk rock looking, um, guy from the

42:24.980 --> 42:25.980
game.

42:25.980 --> 42:29.460
So, uh, very cool that they have that and apparently not impossible to do.

42:29.460 --> 42:33.420
Um, so yeah, um, that word.

42:33.420 --> 42:37.820
That was some pretty epic shade throwing by those guys, the whole Ubisoft thing.

42:37.820 --> 42:41.660
But it's, it's one of the things where you kind of look at it and go, wow, that was a,

42:41.660 --> 42:45.700
that was, that was some shade, but you kind of go, but that needed to happen.

42:45.700 --> 42:51.900
Like Ubisoft needed to be spanked like that, you know, for that really insert, you know,

42:51.900 --> 42:53.340
open mouth, insert foot comments.

42:53.340 --> 42:54.340
Pretty ridiculous.

42:54.340 --> 43:00.020
I mean, they could, they could just keep the animations with the same guy animations in.

43:00.020 --> 43:04.820
I get it that, you know, in co-op, you're really just playing clones of the main character.

43:04.820 --> 43:07.380
So that's all they have is what they should have said.

43:07.380 --> 43:08.380
That's what they should have said.

43:08.380 --> 43:12.740
Well, you know, we're, we don't have any customization because you're just playing clones of the

43:12.740 --> 43:13.740
main character.

43:13.740 --> 43:14.740
Done.

43:14.740 --> 43:15.740
The topic done.

43:15.740 --> 43:16.740
That's all you have to say.

43:16.740 --> 43:20.660
And then said, you know, we do have some strong, diverse characters in this game, not, not

43:20.660 --> 43:22.940
historically or whatever this whole, like we have a diverse team.

43:22.940 --> 43:27.300
We're going to like, here are some other examples of diverse characters in the game.

43:27.300 --> 43:34.260
And then if they can't name any, uh, well, there's a bigger problem Ubisoft, but, and

43:34.260 --> 43:38.420
then, then I think they said even like, uh, maybe they're talking to the next Watch Dogs

43:38.420 --> 43:39.420
game or something.

43:39.420 --> 43:41.220
They were saying that they wouldn't be doing a female character.

43:41.220 --> 43:44.820
I don't know if they are, or they were talking about the original Watch Dogs game, but there's

43:44.820 --> 43:48.020
another game that they mentioned that also female characters weren't going to be a part

43:48.020 --> 43:49.020
of.

43:49.020 --> 43:53.380
But I just like, I think if they just say, explain that, listen, you know, we didn't

43:53.380 --> 43:56.760
design any other characters other than, you know, any other playable characters other

43:56.760 --> 43:58.120
than this main character.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.680
And so that's why they play as clones.

44:00.680 --> 44:03.800
I mean, you know, we, we don't have any other guy characters.

44:03.800 --> 44:05.480
We don't have any other women characters.

44:05.480 --> 44:10.600
We just, that's why we designed all these things and to go ahead and add any, you know,

44:10.600 --> 44:14.360
if it was guy or women, you know, playable characters, it would have taken a lot more

44:14.360 --> 44:15.360
time.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.360
Keep it at that.

44:16.360 --> 44:19.480
Keep it not, don't make gender a, an issue in it.

44:19.480 --> 44:23.760
But when you say, oh, well, it's too hard to render women, you just, you're just asking

44:23.760 --> 44:24.760
for trouble.

44:24.760 --> 44:25.760
Stop talking.

44:25.760 --> 44:29.120
You're making it worse.

44:29.120 --> 44:33.480
So it's just, I don't know, sunset overdrive looks awesome.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.640
And I'm glad to see that there's a lot of customization there.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.640
So, um, it'll be kind of cool when that comes out.

44:37.640 --> 44:42.320
I'm still waiting to hear when we're going to hear about the next Assassin's Creed, what

44:42.320 --> 44:46.760
the current gen or not current gen last gen version, I guess that would be games com.

44:46.760 --> 44:50.320
Maybe it was when they're going to announce that, Oh, I mean this, are they going to put

44:50.320 --> 44:55.720
unity on the, it's unity is only on PlayStation four and Xbox one and PC still doing an assassin

44:55.720 --> 45:01.960
street for the, they're doing one for a, it's like a, I thought it was like cosmos

45:01.960 --> 45:06.400
or something like Assassin's creed cosmos or something that had to do with like space.

45:06.400 --> 45:07.760
I don't remember what it is.

45:07.760 --> 45:12.320
It's not actually in space, but it's just like, um, I was like, that's when you know

45:12.320 --> 45:15.880
this series is dark when it's Assassin's creed in space.

45:15.880 --> 45:21.880
That's a bit much like, isn't that when Friday the 13th on all the scary, like call of duty

45:21.880 --> 45:22.880
ghosts.

45:22.880 --> 45:23.880
Sure.

45:23.880 --> 45:24.880
Call of duty ghosts.

45:24.880 --> 45:25.880
They had a mission.

45:25.880 --> 45:29.960
I think it was in the trailer where it was people fighting with, you know, sub machine

45:29.960 --> 45:33.160
guns in space.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.680
It was really, really ridiculous.

45:34.680 --> 45:39.680
Uh, go into our chat room for some comments on this over at live.vognetwork.com JV Mon

45:39.680 --> 45:43.680
says, sunset overdrive is my most anticipated game of the year.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.000
You know, I don't think you're alone in that.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.960
I think some people are going to finally pony up for an Xbox one because of this game.

45:49.040 --> 45:53.440
I may or may not be one of them, but I also may or may not be more motivated by Forza

45:53.440 --> 45:58.720
horizon two, which yes, I realize is on the 360, but it's going to be prettier on the

45:58.720 --> 46:00.560
one and pretty is important.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.160
Uh, let's see.

46:02.160 --> 46:06.200
SSG100 Matt says there are some fights you can't win.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.200
This is one of them.

46:07.200 --> 46:11.480
Well, you know, like I said last week though, this was just the damn waiting to burst because

46:11.480 --> 46:14.960
obviously there are some major problems in the industry.

46:14.960 --> 46:19.840
There's some problems with some of the thoughts that go in the rationales behind them and

46:19.840 --> 46:20.840
so forth.

46:20.840 --> 46:27.160
And I think honestly, Ubisoft's comment, I hate to say it, but it had to happen so that,

46:27.160 --> 46:31.600
and hear me out here, it had to happen so that people would get pissed off.

46:31.600 --> 46:36.640
And so that we really start demanding change and diversity.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.680
And there are people, there are lots of people that would like to see more of themselves

46:40.680 --> 46:41.680
reflected in games.

46:41.680 --> 46:46.640
And as we got into last week, that doesn't necessarily mean down with the straight white

46:46.640 --> 46:47.640
male.

46:47.640 --> 46:49.640
No, that is absolutely not what anybody's saying.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.080
It's saying, how about options?

46:52.080 --> 46:54.080
Oh, sorry.

46:54.080 --> 46:56.920
It's too expensive, too expensive for options.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.880
That was just really bad.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.280
It was a really bad excuse if really what it was.

47:01.280 --> 47:07.400
And if they literally just stayed with, listen, we designed, you know, this, this main character

47:07.400 --> 47:11.720
and you play as clones of him in multiplayer and we didn't design any other characters

47:11.720 --> 47:16.160
to play as, male or female, left it at that, then that would have been okay.

47:16.160 --> 47:17.160
They're just lazy.

47:17.160 --> 47:20.880
Instead of, no, they're just too lazy to create women in the game.

47:20.880 --> 47:24.400
I mean, it's, it would have been, no, they're just too lazy to create any other characters

47:24.400 --> 47:25.400
in the game.

47:25.400 --> 47:28.760
But I think, you know, like I said a minute ago, we've been waiting for the damn to burst

47:28.760 --> 47:33.880
on this for a little bit and this is something that, you know, unfortunately has to happen,

47:33.880 --> 47:39.520
you know, so that the, all these guys developing the games kind of wake up and say, oh shit,

47:39.520 --> 47:43.400
you know, there are a lot of people out there that want this, you know, or if it's not too

47:43.400 --> 47:47.120
late, put a female lead in the PS3, Xbox 360 one.

47:47.120 --> 47:51.720
I mean, they had one for the Vita, so it might be too late at this point for that.

47:51.720 --> 47:57.360
But you know, again, or how about give some examples again of some of the characters.

47:57.360 --> 48:01.520
I mean, cause what they said is that they said, we look forward to introducing some

48:01.520 --> 48:06.400
strong female characters in Assassin's Creed Unity soon, and I'm sorry, but that comment

48:06.400 --> 48:10.520
comes to me like, oh fuck, we haven't designed any, we better hurry up and do it to shut

48:10.520 --> 48:12.520
everybody up.

48:12.520 --> 48:14.880
That's how that comment hears to me, unfortunately.

48:14.880 --> 48:20.480
So for better or worse, all right, anyway, not to, not to repeat everything from last

48:20.480 --> 48:23.660
week, so let's move on to something else.

48:23.660 --> 48:29.840
Following E3, some interesting financial news about one company and that is Capcom and some

48:29.840 --> 48:32.920
interesting news coming out about shareholders.

48:32.920 --> 48:39.560
And there's a vote going on right now to end the company takeover defense at Capcom.

48:39.560 --> 48:44.240
Capcom could be taken over by a company that will, that could purchase large amounts of

48:44.240 --> 48:45.680
its stock.

48:45.680 --> 48:51.680
Now this causes the internet to go into a tizzy because this causes everybody to go,

48:51.680 --> 48:54.000
OMG, who should buy Capcom?

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Who's going to buy Capcom?

48:55.000 --> 48:56.080
Is it going to be Nintendo?

48:56.080 --> 49:00.000
They get all the, oh my God, Mega Man on Wii U exclusive.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.840
Can you imagine if it was Warner Brothers, then we could finally get Street Fighter versus

49:05.840 --> 49:09.440
Mortal Kombat.

49:09.440 --> 49:12.720
Very interesting prospect there, I like that.

49:12.720 --> 49:17.000
But here's another thing is that I also see a lot of this as hype, hype, hype in the media

49:17.000 --> 49:22.720
because, just because they're open for that doesn't mean they will.

49:22.720 --> 49:29.160
And I don't believe Capcom is actively seeking a bidder in this or is actually actively seeking

49:29.160 --> 49:30.160
this.

49:30.160 --> 49:33.080
But I mean of course when the shareholders do make a move like this it does sort of send

49:33.080 --> 49:34.800
a message that, you know.

49:34.800 --> 49:38.320
I gotta be honest though, their portfolio is not as strong as it used to be.

49:38.320 --> 49:43.040
I mean it's like kind of, they're going the way of like Konami right now where, I mean

49:43.040 --> 49:44.940
let's look at what they've got coming out this year.

49:44.940 --> 49:53.880
They've got another Street Fighter IV version and that's about it.

49:53.880 --> 50:02.420
I mean they have a new Phoenix Wright trilogy like re-release thing.

50:02.420 --> 50:07.460
That's pretty much it, I mean there's just nothing else coming and nothing, I don't think,

50:07.460 --> 50:13.100
I think they've got that, what was it, Deep Down or something like that, that tech demo

50:13.100 --> 50:14.100
that they showed.

50:14.260 --> 50:18.100
That was supposed to be coming at some point, but there's not really anything big, I mean

50:18.100 --> 50:22.740
I'm assuming Street Fighter V is being worked on at some point, but they don't have, Resident

50:22.740 --> 50:27.220
Evil is not as strong as it used to be anymore, Monster Hunter IV I guess would be something

50:27.220 --> 50:34.980
on 3DS, but they just don't have, they don't have like Mega Man anymore really, and Dead

50:34.980 --> 50:39.920
Rising is not as great as it used to be, I don't know.

50:39.920 --> 50:43.860
Interesting comments in our chat room, JV Mon says, people just want Capcom bought out

50:43.860 --> 50:50.540
because they're bitter about Mega Man Legends 3, I'm kind of over that, I don't think that's

50:50.540 --> 50:57.380
far off the mark though, no, but I'm looking forward to, you know, Mighty No. 9 Legends

50:57.380 --> 51:00.120
at some point.

51:00.120 --> 51:04.240
As far as likely buyers for Capcom, you know, I don't know if it would necessarily be one

51:04.240 --> 51:08.760
of the big companies, I mean, Deep Silver, I think it would be, nah, I think it would

51:08.760 --> 51:13.020
be hilarious if it was somebody like Nintendo and I think Nintendo would be a great fit

51:13.020 --> 51:19.100
honestly, but I just, I don't know, you know, I just, there's something about that match

51:19.100 --> 51:24.220
up that doesn't really make a lot of sense to me, I honestly think the likely candidate

51:24.220 --> 51:28.940
would be Bandai Namco, I kind of think would be, I could see as the one that would snatch

51:28.940 --> 51:31.180
him up, but I, I don't know.

51:31.180 --> 51:36.300
I don't know if they're rewinding, but I would think Deep Silver's been buying, well I mean

51:36.300 --> 51:40.520
they bought THQ's, most of THQ's assets.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.380
But did Nordic Games get a lot of that too?

51:42.780 --> 51:44.980
Nordic got a bunch of their catalog.

51:44.980 --> 51:47.020
They got the name too, right?

51:47.020 --> 51:52.300
I don't know why, but yeah, I mean, they got that, but yeah, they've got a lot of the catalog,

51:52.300 --> 51:59.180
they have MX vs ATV, but like most of the main franchises that they had were purchased

51:59.180 --> 52:04.300
by Deep Silver, so I could see them maybe doing that, because Deep Silver also had,

52:04.300 --> 52:10.380
who else did they buy, they bought another, well they bought another company too, but

52:10.380 --> 52:13.580
I don't know.

52:13.580 --> 52:17.500
So I don't know, I could see them doing that maybe, but yeah, I don't know if it means

52:17.500 --> 52:23.820
necessarily that anybody's gonna buy them out right away, I just, I don't know.

52:23.820 --> 52:27.900
Konami could use some extra titles, it would be kind of cool to roll that together, because

52:27.900 --> 52:31.420
shit, I'm surprised Konami's not being bought out by anybody, because-

52:31.420 --> 52:35.780
That's, that, well and I said that last week, it's funny, because I said last week, I said,

52:35.780 --> 52:40.340
you know if anybody's probably gonna get bought in the next few months, it's gonna

52:40.340 --> 52:44.020
be Konami, and then the news comes out like the next day, oh it's Capcom's the one that's

52:44.020 --> 52:45.020
on the block.

52:45.020 --> 52:48.720
Yeah, don't get me wrong, Metal Gear Solid 5 looks awesome, but they're banking everything

52:48.720 --> 52:54.340
on Metal Gear Solid 5, because if that shit doesn't work, then I don't, I guess they're

52:54.340 --> 53:00.180
gonna be going straight slot machines, because they've got that in Pro Evo, and that's it,

53:00.180 --> 53:01.180
that is their slate.

53:01.180 --> 53:04.900
Pro Evo's the only thing coming out this year, so they're hurting.

53:05.460 --> 53:11.460
Alright, speaking of Capcom, some interesting other news coming out of there that is around

53:11.460 --> 53:16.900
Yoshinori Ono, and Yoshinori Ono, of course a lot of people know as the producer of Street

53:16.900 --> 53:22.540
Fighter 4, which keeps going, it's the game that keeps on giving, well this week he announced

53:22.540 --> 53:25.580
that he is leaving Capcom Vancouver.

53:25.580 --> 53:30.420
I resigned from the director position about Capcom Vancouver, thanks good staff of Capcom

53:30.420 --> 53:32.980
Vancouver and Dead Rising staff.

53:32.980 --> 53:36.960
I had to take some time, I think over very carefully about next things, I'd like to watch

53:36.960 --> 53:39.900
TV for Brazil World Cup before thinking it.

53:39.900 --> 53:46.420
Now this caused a lot of people to go, oh fuck he left Konami, he left Capcom, but actually

53:46.420 --> 53:52.940
he furthered, he did a little clarifying tweet, my position within Capcom has not changed,

53:52.940 --> 53:57.920
I'm still involved in all the projects I'm currently working on, only my role for Capcom

53:57.920 --> 54:00.920
Vancouver has ended.

54:00.920 --> 54:01.920
So interesting.

54:02.360 --> 54:07.480
So he's just like, instead of being whatever he was plus head of Vancouver, he's just...

54:07.480 --> 54:11.720
I can understand that maybe you're stretched so thin, you've really got to focus on one

54:11.720 --> 54:17.440
or two things, I understand that very well, so I can see why he resigned in that regard,

54:17.440 --> 54:21.660
where it's like, if he's not able to handle it all because there's too much going on over

54:21.660 --> 54:26.960
here or whatever, they've got to be looking at the future of Street Fighter in some ways,

54:26.960 --> 54:31.240
somebody's got to be whispering Street Fighter 5 over their cap, somebody's got to be doing

54:31.240 --> 54:36.360
it, because they keep cranking out these sequels to Street Fighter 4, and it's like, really,

54:36.360 --> 54:37.480
how many more can they do?

54:37.480 --> 54:41.000
So somebody over there's got to be begging for Street Fighter 5.

54:41.000 --> 54:46.640
I think they're already working on it, it's probably next gen, but that would be cool

54:46.640 --> 54:49.240
at Tokyo Game Show if they showed something like that.

54:49.240 --> 54:51.740
You never know, you never know.

54:51.740 --> 54:59.000
So there you go, a revised or reduced role for Yoshinori Ohno, but at his own choice

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
there.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Yeah.

55:01.000 --> 55:06.560
Well, speaking of Capcom, can I jump in real quick with an interesting comment from our

55:06.560 --> 55:11.000
chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Blueberry jumped in with a comment saying, Konami doesn't

55:11.000 --> 55:16.160
really focus on games any longer, they have sports centers and everything in Japan.

55:16.160 --> 55:19.920
You know, that is true, is that, you know, even though maybe at E3 we see kind of one

55:19.920 --> 55:24.440
side of it, is that their presence over in Japan might be very different, and I think,

55:24.440 --> 55:27.920
like you said a minute ago, they do have all those slot machines and things, you go into

55:27.920 --> 55:33.960
any casino, like you're going to see Konami's logo everywhere, they make a lot of slot machines.

55:33.960 --> 55:37.560
And also they do a lot of mobile stuff, so I think that's where they're moving.

55:37.560 --> 55:42.000
But I mean, come on, I'm not talking like, I'm talking Konami as in, you know, a game

55:42.000 --> 55:45.240
publisher like on console, a console and portable game publisher.

55:45.240 --> 55:49.160
You want your Bemani and your Castlevania and your Silent Hill.

55:49.160 --> 55:55.080
I'm not holding my breath on any sort of, you know, Bemani stuff, but I would expect,

55:55.080 --> 56:03.600
you know, with like, you know, games kind of like, you know, Amnesia and, you know,

56:03.600 --> 56:07.400
even what was it, The Evil Within, and that kind of stuff that's probably going to do

56:07.400 --> 56:08.400
pretty well.

56:08.400 --> 56:12.400
I could see a little bit more of the resurgence of, you know, the survivor horror genre, and

56:12.400 --> 56:17.920
I could see them maybe trying to do a next gen version of Silent Hill.

56:17.920 --> 56:25.040
I'd be down with that, but it's just, you know, I'm not, they've had a lot of flops

56:25.400 --> 56:28.800
I'm just hoping that they, you know, hit a home run with one of these.

56:28.800 --> 56:34.080
ActDeft in chat saying, Konami at E3 said, or sorry, I can't, I keep mixing those two

56:34.080 --> 56:35.080
up tonight.

56:35.080 --> 56:39.800
ActDeft says Capcom at E3 said they're working on Street Fighter 5 for the new consoles.

56:39.800 --> 56:45.560
So, but I mean, that's, I mean, that's as a given as, you know, there's, the PlayStation

56:45.560 --> 56:49.160
5 is currently being developed somewhere, absolutely, of course, and the success of

56:49.160 --> 56:51.000
the Xbox One, absolutely.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.800
Those things are planned out years and years in advance.

56:52.800 --> 56:53.800
Hey, guess what?

56:53.800 --> 56:55.800
There will be new Nintendo hardware.

56:55.800 --> 56:57.680
It's being planned right now.

56:57.680 --> 57:00.400
It's just nowhere near time to show it yet.

57:00.400 --> 57:07.520
I think it needs to be brought up, but, um, where the fuck is Tekken Cross Street Fighter?

57:07.520 --> 57:10.080
Oh yeah, good question.

57:10.080 --> 57:11.720
Where is it?

57:11.720 --> 57:13.200
It wasn't at E3 this year.

57:13.200 --> 57:14.200
That's true.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.200
That kind of disappeared, didn't it?

57:16.200 --> 57:17.200
Yeah.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.200
Huh.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.200
Where is it?

57:19.200 --> 57:22.360
Well, I'm assuming at this point it's going to be next gen for a hat.

57:22.360 --> 57:26.440
Maybe I was wrong in my Bandai Namco idea.

57:26.440 --> 57:27.800
Maybe there's some bad blood going on there.

57:27.800 --> 57:28.800
I don't know.

57:28.800 --> 57:29.800
I don't think it's bad blood.

57:29.800 --> 57:31.920
I think they're probably just developing a new engine for a new Tekken game that they're

57:31.920 --> 57:36.080
going to put out a straightforward Tekken game, maybe like a Tekken 7 or something.

57:36.080 --> 57:38.040
And then they'll run off that engine.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.760
And so they'll build, you know, two birds with one stone.

57:40.760 --> 57:41.880
They held it for next gen.

57:41.880 --> 57:46.240
They held it for next gen and they're building a new engine for Tekken 7 and that'll be

57:46.240 --> 57:47.240
that.

57:47.240 --> 57:48.240
Um, okay.

57:48.240 --> 57:51.120
So anyway, speaking of Capcom, uh, this is kind of interesting.

57:51.120 --> 57:55.400
I've never heard of a straight to Crackle movie, but apparently Dead Rising is going

57:55.400 --> 57:56.400
to be a...

57:56.400 --> 57:58.480
What the hell is Crackle?

57:58.480 --> 58:01.040
I've seen it on PlayStation 4, but...

58:01.040 --> 58:07.160
Crackle apparently is Sony's like a video streaming, um, app or whatever.

58:07.160 --> 58:09.960
So it's like Netflix, but like Sony wants their own Netflix.

58:09.960 --> 58:13.080
But it's not necessarily, it's free.

58:13.080 --> 58:17.000
So all this, like they have like a bunch of old action movies on there and stuff and it's

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
free.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.920
So you can get like a bunch of cool stuff on there.

58:19.920 --> 58:21.080
Now you're talking.

58:21.080 --> 58:22.080
I did not realize.

58:22.080 --> 58:26.320
At least, at least when I perused it once, I'm like, shit, there's all this cool stuff

58:26.320 --> 58:29.040
I don't want to watch and I completely forgot about it.

58:29.040 --> 58:36.060
But anyways, so they're gonna, uh, put this movie on, um, that channel and apparently

58:36.060 --> 58:40.960
it's being, uh, let's see here, who is producing it?

58:40.960 --> 58:44.080
Uh, oh, um, Thomas Harlan.

58:44.080 --> 58:46.640
Did you say what movie it was?

58:46.640 --> 58:47.640
Yeah, Dead Rising.

58:47.640 --> 58:48.640
Okay.

58:48.800 --> 58:54.360
It's, um, Thomas Harlan is producing it and he did, uh, the Mortal Kombat Legacy digital

58:54.360 --> 59:03.240
movie, or not movie, but I guess a web series, um, so they've got that and on top of, um,

59:03.240 --> 59:11.760
having it on Crackle, it's gonna be also distributed on DVD, video on demand and also, uh, TV and

59:11.760 --> 59:16.640
I'm assuming like Netflix and all those other places, but it'll be at Crackle first, um,

59:16.640 --> 59:17.840
I think Crackle's free.

59:17.840 --> 59:18.840
I don't know.

59:18.840 --> 59:22.000
I've, like I said, I've only looked at it like a couple of times.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
No idea what exactly the premise is going to be, um.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.640
There's actually quite a few people, um, commenting on Crackle, um, let's see, Act F says it's

59:30.640 --> 59:36.160
kind of like Netflix, Blender says all free movies and TV Sky, I watched Lords of Dogtown

59:36.160 --> 59:41.200
last week, Fifth Dream says Crackle has anime as well, Bond Solo 6 says think Hulu, Netflix

59:41.200 --> 59:42.480
and Amazon Instant Watch.

59:42.480 --> 59:46.640
Well, yeah, but most of those that you name, you have to pay for, well, I guess Hulu has

59:46.640 --> 59:52.080
a free, well, it's only free on PC for some limited limited thing, but yeah, so it is

59:52.080 --> 59:56.600
free, I think, from what I remember, um, it's interesting though that they mentioned this

59:56.600 --> 01:00:03.160
because I want to say that they had for Dead Rising 2, maybe it might have been 3, they

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.920
had like a little live action short thing that they did that was kind of like a Japanese

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.600
live action short that was, uh, following like Dead Rising 1 or something like that

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.440
and they had kind of some stuff with that, so I'm just kind of curious what the premise

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:21.320
would be or if this is going to be, you know, hopefully it's not like a sci-fi channel movie

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.360
quality or something like that, you know, I hope it's actually something pretty polished

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:32.080
and, um, you know, it says feature length film, but is it a feature length film that's

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.400
going to be CG or is it going to be a live action film?

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:43.000
I don't know, that'd be kind of curious, I don't know, I'm down, down with that.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Interesting.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.720
Uh, yeah, I don't know what I would expect out of a movie like this either, but I guess,

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.000
you know, because it's based on a big zombie franchise, it'll just be like kind of like

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
a...

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.920
It's gonna be weird though, watching the main character go, hey, you know what, I think

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.200
I'm gonna put on this little kid's clothes and then I'm gonna stick this, I'm gonna stick

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.600
this Mega Man, uh, blaster on my arm and then, uh, I'm gonna totally like, um, I'm gonna

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.440
run around with this chainsaw now and, I don't know.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.800
Alright, uh, let's move on to news about the Xbox One in Japan.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.400
Yes, the Xbox One in Japan, it is happening, just in case you weren't aware, uh, they're

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:25.880
gonna try to make it work in Japan and it's launching in September, 29 games at launch.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:32.160
Uh, some of the games that will be coming out include the launch window games we had,

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.400
things like Dead Rising 3, Crimson Dragon, uh, also included things like Strider and

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.400
Titanfall.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.560
Uh, Konami will be out with Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes, so that'll be a pretty good,

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.120
you know, cause I was wondering last week, you know, what was gonna be the game that

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.200
really gets people on Xbox One, except the only problem is that Ground Zeroes is also

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.200
on PlayStation 4.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.840
Well, here's the other thing, the problem is Ground Zeroes is the prequel to Metal Gear

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.840
Solid 5.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.840
Oh yeah.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.600
So, no one gives a shit about it.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600
Duh.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.440
Uh, yeah, so everybody's already played that on PlayStation 4.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.480
Uh, Tecmo Koei will have a port of Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.520
Um, Cyberstep will have their free-to-play MMORPG Onigiri.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.320
Uh, that is a PlayStation 4 exclusive in North America, but it'll be available for the Japanese

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.240
Xbox One at launch, that's very interesting.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.600
Um, so yeah, uh, some other titles that will be coming to the Xbox One in Japan in the

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:33.260
coming months, uh, Natsuki Chronicle, Shooting Love Trilogy, uh, Azito simulation game, so

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.900
some other stuff to look forward to there on the Xbox One.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.940
And, and, a new Raiden game.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.940
A Raiden game.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.460
Oh yes, a new Raiden game.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.940
Uh, hopefully it's a disc-based game, because you know what that means?

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:45.940
Import!

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.940
Because it's reader-free!

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:47.940
Nice.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.940
Yeah.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.940
I'd be down with that.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.940
Alright.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.940
Looking.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:03:00.780
Um, so this is kind of disappointing, normally when we're talking, you know, Nintendo going

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:05.780
to court against, you know, uh, patent, you know, infringement cases and stuff, they're

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.260
pretty much victorious.

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.860
Well, not this time!

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:17.180
Unfortunately, um, they have, um, ruled against Nintendo, um, in the patent lawsuit against

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:25.540
Philips, and this, I guess, affects both the Wii and Wii Rem- uh, Wii U, and, um, the technology

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:29.220
that they were kind of, um, saying that they were infringing on had to do with the Wii

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.660
Remotes and the Wii U gamepad.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:38.020
So, not sure yet, they haven't really said what this is going to mean, if it means, you

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:43.980
know, what kind of fines, damages, are they going to try to stop the sale of the system?

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.420
To which you can make the pun, do they really need to help them stop the sale of the system?

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:51.140
You know, so on and so on, but, no, are they going to, you know, try to bar that?

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:55.520
I don't think that, you know, looking at like, you know, I want to say the Xbox 360 kind

01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:01.560
of had the same thing, um, they had like a patent lawsuit that involved that system,

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560
and-

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560
Controller, right?

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.960
I don't know if it was a controller, I think it was, it was the software, um, it was like

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:15.760
for decoding, like video and stuff like that, and they ended up settling, but they, or maybe

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.120
they had to pay fines or something like that, but they ended up not, it wasn't pulled from

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120
the market.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.040
So, it's still, they're still going to be probably selling the system, but I'm sure

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.040
they're going to have to pay some sort of fines or something.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.040
Yeah.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:31.400
Um, or I don't know if they can, you know, do some sort of appeal or something, but that's

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:36.800
unfortunate, I guess you can't win them all, but.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.000
That law, and this is so complicated, and I thought I saw a story, um, you know, somewhere

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.640
like on Google News or something about how the Supreme Court was kind of starting to

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.720
come down on, and that, obviously we're talking US versus UK, but still, you know, this is,

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.720
this is a problem in a lot of places.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.080
The US is kind of, the Supreme Court here is kind of starting to come out with a lot

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.160
of decisions that are really anti-patent troll sort of thing, and you sort of get the sense

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.600
that legally we're starting to kind of move towards a different system, and I believe

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.800
it had said something about, you know, don't quote me on this because I don't have the

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.120
article right in front of me, but it was something about like the whole like, you can't, you

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.760
can't patent a lot of this software, these ideas, and things that are in software.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:18.320
Well like, yeah, what they're, the premise was is that they can't patent, say for example,

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:24.400
um, say there's a patent out there for like, you know, point of service or something like

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.240
that, where you're, you're purchasing something or doing something in the real world, you

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.240
can't have another patent that says, doing this thing, but on a computer, you know, like

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:39.520
you can't have a patent for playing music on a device and then saying, oh, but this

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.160
is playing music on a device on your computer, you can't have a patent for that if it's basically

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:52.160
the same thing, or you know, I don't know, it's kind of a step towards not being able

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.320
to patent software, which I think is a good idea, I don't think you should be able to

01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:02.600
patent software, um, you know, maybe patent the code for your software, so like, and that's

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:08.440
really how it should be anyways, like, you know, so it just stops people from blatantly

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:14.480
decoding, you know, reverse engineering your software and just putting it into their software,

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.000
that's the whole point of the patent office is to stop stuff like that, stop you from

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.240
reverse engineering these things, but not necessarily like, oh well, this is a patent

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:30.080
for, you know, Wii remote type things, you know, infrared, wireless remotes, I have a

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:35.680
patent for it now, and now you can't make any sort of wireless remotes, it's kind of

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.680
backwards the way it works.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.480
GameGuru in our chatroom says that Nintendo is appealing actually, well that's not a surprise

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:48.400
at all, that's what would happen on the US as well, appeal, appeal, appeal, so this will

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.560
not be resolved anytime soon unless they finally reach that magic settled out of court, so

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560
there it is.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:07:00.920
Alright, so, very interesting new game coming out, and I'm not sure if this infringes on

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:05.320
any patents, let's hope not, because it looks like it's going to be interesting, it is called

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.440
The Rhythm of Fighters, and The Rhythm of Fighters, it's going to be an iOS and Android

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:17.840
game, but it's like a, it's a rhythm game based in the King of Fighters universe, so

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.440
I guess there's tap on notes that are kind of in an ellipse style wireframe, and when

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:26.280
like a cursor goes over the notes, you tap them out, and depending on how well timed

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:31.080
it is, you either do damage or you take damage, we don't know a whole lot else about the game

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.760
besides, it's happening, so fans of King of the Fighters, especially if you're into that

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:41.280
and music games, which, this sounds like somebody made a game for Dark Sakura, it's a real bummer

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.240
she's not here tonight, I kind of see this and I go, hey, somebody made Dark Sakura's

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.240
video game.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.400
Well they've got like a, they've spun off so much stuff for the King of Fighters, remember

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:56.480
they have the shooter game at one point, yeah, that was pretty funny, I like that, I'm not

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.480
surprised.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.560
Not at all, but this will be fun.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.280
So yeah, check that out, the rhythm of fighters, of course we don't know when, but I can't

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.400
imagine it's going to be too, too long.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.080
Speaking of not having to wait too, too long, let's travel around the world and check out

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.200
some release dates.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:16.400
Yes, this week actually you do have a few things coming out before pretty much the dead

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:22.540
time which is, what is it, July, when nothing comes out, you used to have NCAA.

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:26.600
This week though, if you happen to be a fan of Transformers and maybe you've seen the

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.160
movie, they have kind of the best of both worlds, whether you like the Transformer

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.800
movie games or not, it's Transformers Rise of the Dark Spark that's coming out on Playstation

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:44.620
3, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, Xbox One, Wii U, and 3DS.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:55.200
Also this week we've got Grid Autosport, which is out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, which

01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:00.920
is kind of cool, it's being published by Codemasters and they actually have, it's funny

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.440
how Codemasters kind of jumps between publishers and stuff, so now it's Namco Bandai publishing

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440
it.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:17.160
Outlier Rorona Plus, The Alchemists of Arland on Playstation 3, also, let's see here, oh,

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.160
actually that would be it.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.160
That's it?

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.160
Yep.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.160
Alright.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160
That is it.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.180
You think there'd be more leading up to what, July 4th weekends next week, you think there'd

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.700
be a little more, but maybe they just figure a lot of people are away on break or whatever.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:32.500
Well, spoiler, next week there's really only, there's two games coming out next week, Sniper

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:39.300
Elite 3 and the Far Cry collection on 360, which I was hoping that would come out here

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:44.600
because it's in the UK, but I don't think it includes the first Far Cry, because the

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.540
one in the UK included the first Far Cry on 360 but not on PS3, because they never did

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:50.540
one on PS3.

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:51.540
Right, right.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:52.540
Interesting.

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:56.060
Alright, well, going over to Japan, looking at the rest of the world and the release dates

01:09:56.060 --> 01:10:01.300
there, on the Playstation 4, Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate is out on June 26th, as well as

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.740
Watch Dogs gets its release on the Playstation 4 in Japan this week.

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:11.620
Over on the Playstation 3, an awful lot on June 26th, that's my birthday, it's all, they're

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:15.220
celebrating my birthday over there in Japan this week with all these game releases.

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:22.060
Cross Channel for all people, Date Alive, Arusu Install, there's a regular and limited

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.900
edition for that, there's the Devil May Cry HD collection getting a price reduction, Grand

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:32.580
Theft Auto 5 gets a price reduction as well, Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider Batride War 2 in

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:37.700
a regular and premium edition comes out from Bad9Amco, and Watch Dogs gets its Playstation

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:44.260
3 release as well, and also Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition goes into the Playstation

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:48.820
3 the best, which of course Biohazard means it's Resident Evil over there in Japan.

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:53.900
On the Xbox 360, just some price reductions as we look at F1 2013 and Grand Theft Auto

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:59.540
5 getting price reductions, but Watch Dogs also gets a 360 release in Japan this week.

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:05.980
On the Wii U this week, Kamen Rider Batride War 2 is out on the Wii U as well.

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:10.740
And lastly, looking at the Playstation Vita and the 3DS, on the Vita, Cross Channel for

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:19.180
all people, Freedom Wars, Girls and Panzer, Senshado Kiwa Meimasu comes out, there's a

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:23.740
whole accessory set coming out for that as well, so this is a pretty big one, Robotics

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:31.420
Notes Elite comes out as well, and lastly on the 3DS this week, if I can get to those

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:36.380
dates here, oh, much less on the 3DS, but for you music game fans, you'll recognize

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:44.780
the name Taiko no Tatujin Don Tokatsu no Jiku Daibuken comes out this week on the 3DS, so

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:49.580
if you like your taiko drum master, you can import that, but hopefully you have a Japanese

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:52.180
3DS to play it on, because it is region locked.

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.460
There's also a pen set coming out too, that matches.

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:58.940
That's completely stupid that the 3DS is region locked.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.180
Releases over in the UK, Dark Soccer's not here tonight, but I have them up for you.

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.980
On June the 25th, the Another World 20th Anniversary Collection's out on PlayStation 4, Vita and

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:11.460
3, and the Swapper out on PlayStation 4, Vita and 3.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:16.660
As far as some retail releases, you have Grid Autosport on PC, 360 and PS3 coming out on

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:23.780
June 27th, Sniper Elite on many platforms, that's PS3, 4, Xbox 360, 1 and PC, that's

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:29.380
Sniper Elite 3, and lastly, Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare makes its way to PC in Europe

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.380
on June 27th.

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:36.260
I did forget a couple real quick, BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma on Vita was this week, and

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:37.260
a Vita game!

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:42.780
Yeah, there you go, and I got another one, X-Blaze Code Embryo on PlayStation 3 and Vita

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.780
as well.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:48.060
So, a couple more Japanese games there.

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:53.780
Alright, so this is kind of cool if you're into, you know, esports.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:13:00.100
There is a college, actually, offering scholarships for League of Legends players.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:08.980
It's the Robert Morris University in Chicago, and apparently they will be the first university

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:14.220
to offer a competitive team on the varsity level, and will offer scholarships for up

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:18.700
to 50% tuition and 50% room and board.

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:24.900
So, that's different, I guess, seeing esports actually being part of, you know, college

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:25.900
sports.

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:31.260
It's cool in a way, I mean, as somebody who's obviously a big gamer, it's nice to see that

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.260
happening.

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:38.660
It's, I go back to those days when, you know, we were focusing exclusively on music games

01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:42.060
and we talked a lot about DDR and what was going on in that scene, and you remember when

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:48.080
DDR became a sport in, like, Norway or something, one of the Scandinavian countries, I remember

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.060
we talked about it here on the show a lot, you remember that when that happened?

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.220
DDR became, like, an officially recognized sport in one of those countries, and we talked

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.140
about, like, could it become a sport here and so on, and it was interesting because

01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:01.980
you saw more and more DDR that would hit school classrooms and things like that, but one of

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.380
the interesting points that was brought up is about how, well, when you have a ball and

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:11.500
you go outside and you have those types of rules, you know, you can really play those

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:17.340
games with anything, I mean, as long as you have, like, a ball, you can play soccer.

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:21.900
Now, granted, you might, or I guess you have to have really goalposts, too, but you know

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.340
how people, you know, people will kind of modify these types of games, like, they'll

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.060
say, okay, well, that tree is the goal or something, you know, you know what I mean?

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.540
People, like, modify these things sometimes, right?

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:37.580
But when it comes to an e-game, there's a third party involved in making the play field,

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:41.780
and only they can do it, and only they control it, and it was, I don't know, I don't know

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:45.820
why, but that's what my mind kind of always goes to, is, like, a really interesting difference,

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:49.580
and I, and I get, you know, and I'm sure some people, chatters are gonna say, oh, but there's

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.460
regulation rules, especially when you're playing in college, and you can't use any

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.240
ball because there's regulations on the ball that you can use, and there's regulations

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.780
on, you know, what, what the sizes are and everything like that, yeah, I get that, I

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:03.140
get that, I get that, but those, I, I still feel like when we were talking about esports,

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:06.780
they're still a third party that's ultimately in control of all of that, they can kind of

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.700
change that on a whim, too, like, aren't they making changes to some, some pretty big changes,

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:11.700
some League of Legends maps?

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:14.260
Like, that seemed, that was in the news not that long ago, I think we talked about it

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:18.660
on Hoard House this week, so, you know, I, I don't know, it, it's weird when you have

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:24.340
a, it, I guess it feels way more commercialized when this third party's in control, and I

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:28.220
even realize, yes, there's the NBA in the, well, I guess, but they aren't involved with

01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:32.180
college, either, but NCAA, if you will, or whatever, like, I, I still feel like there's

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.460
just, like, a difference here.

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:37.700
And it also seems really weird that it's this college doing it, I mean, I could see something

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:43.100
like, you know, a game design college or, like, some sort of tech, like, I could see,

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:47.300
you know, MIT or something doing something like this where they have, you know, a team

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:54.300
that's playing esports, maybe that's too cliche, but it just seems really odd that

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.820
this random university's doing this, but hey, whatever, that's cool.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:01.700
It gets them a lot of press, and certainly, you know, if you're a college trying to recruit

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:07.660
some smart kids, you know, putting something out there, you know, anyway, let's see, Raman

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.660
in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, if they're giving out scholarships for

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:15.940
playing a fucking video game, I want to see scholarships for people building a computer.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.700
Let's see, SHU100Matt says, DDR was going to be in the X Games a while back, but it

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.260
fell through due to music licensing issues.

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:25.500
That was, that was another big issue with the whole sport thing.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.360
That's why you need DDR USA.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.860
You can do DDR USA because it's all Konami originals, for the most part, I think.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.020
Didn't they have, like, Smoke on the Water and some of that other stuff?

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:37.020
That was not in, uh, oh, the arcade version.

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.020
Arcade version.

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.020
Was the arcade version?

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.540
Oh, Stomp to My Beat was in the arcade version.

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.540
Ha!

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:42.540
No, it wasn't.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.540
Yes, it was.

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:45.100
Stomp to My Beat was in DDR USA Arcade.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.100
Was it?

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:49.460
Don't play with me on DDR trivia!

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.860
We used to play that song all the time!

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:53.020
Yeah, but we used to play it on 4th Mix.

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:57.820
No, I'm telling you, somebody look it up, threw Loki wrong for me.

01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.540
I just don't remember that.

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:06.460
I thought it was, uh, I know End of the Century was in there, um, I don't remember that being

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.460
on there.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.460
Maybe it was.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.560
It's been so long!

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.980
How long has it been since I played a USA mix?

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.020
That's how we all met, so it was probably, what, like 12 years ago, right?

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:20.780
Yeah, I mean, seriously, so, I don't know.

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:23.980
Sorry that I don't remember.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:28.780
I'm actually trying to look it up right now on Wikipedia, but there's, like, so many frickin'

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.980
articles on this.

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:36.860
You just need to look up, was it, uh, let's see, there's releases, list of DDR video games,

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:42.100
let's see, is this Dance Dance Revolution, where's USA?

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:43.100
There it is.

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:48.020
They can click it, and music, show soundtrack.

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:52.700
Right there, biatch, stomp to my beat, JS16 in the list.

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:59.060
Alright, well, I just didn't remember, I mean, sorree.

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.540
Dubby Dub would've been a licensed tune, there was Smile Decay, Boyz.

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:06.420
But still though, I mean, they could've, they could've done it, but they could've just, yeah,

01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.420
just don't do those songs.

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:08.420
Can't do those songs.

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.820
Everybody's gotta do La Senorita.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:14.340
Alright, uh, let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:21.980
Cuz back in the day, these weren't sports, they were just fun.

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.940
Every week, Dark Soccer dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:29.900
you kids should be playing this video game this week, but guess what, she's not here,

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:33.340
ha ha ha, so I'm taking over tonight with my take on-

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:38.060
They should've made him play all solo, uh, Dance Dance Revolution solo bass.

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.060
Heck yeah.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.300
That would've been awesome.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.300
That was great.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:45.860
Alright, anyway, quiet on the DDR talk, cuz this game even predates DDR, it's that old.

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:49.620
This is an old, old classic, and it's one that I have chosen, uh, tonight to bring to

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:54.100
the table, and that game I have chosen is Lode Runner.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:19:00.420
Let's write Lode Runner, and the way Lode Runner, it's L-O-D-E Runner.

01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:06.260
And I particularly remember this on the Commodore 64, but this game does exist on a variety

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.260
of platforms, actually.

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.620
Uh, so let's talk a little bit about Lode Runner, which is a puzzler game that was published

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:17.060
by Broderbund in 1983, but here's what's made Lode Runner unique.

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:21.380
Lode Runner was one of the first games out there that actually had a level editor inside

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:26.500
of it, so you could make your own levels for the game, and this caused it to be, like,

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.500
hugely popular.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:31.000
Um, because, you know, why do people love things like Little Big Planet, or people are

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.020
excited about Mario Maker, cuz they get to make their own stuff and share it with friends,

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.020
and that's what Lode Runner was all about as well.

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:43.180
So, um, Lode Runner was developed by Douglas E. Smith, who lived in Washington at the time.

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:46.420
He was an architecture student at the University of Washington.

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:51.580
The prototype, which was originally called Kong, was written for a Prime Computer 550

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:55.760
minicomputer, and it was on the University of Washington campus.

01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:01.980
It was ported after that to VAX, and then over a weekend in 1982, Douglas Smith built

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:08.300
a playable version in 6502 assembly language on an Apple II+, and he renamed the game Miner

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.060
at that point.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:15.660
He kept refining that version, and then finally he submitted his rough version to Broderbund,

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:20.980
and he got a rejection letter that said, sorry, your game doesn't fit into our product line.

01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:24.780
So he borrowed money to get a color monitor and a joystick, and he kept working on the

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:27.520
game, cuz the original version of the game was black and white only.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.640
So Christmas of 1982, he submitted the game to four publishers, and he got offers from

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.280
all four.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.560
So he took the deal with Broderbund, which is interesting.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.880
They rejected him the first time, but he ended up going with them anyway.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.200
So anyway, he was given a $10,000 advance to go ahead and design the game and to do

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.040
150 levels for the game.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:52.920
Apparently, and I don't know if this is true or not, he paid neighborhood children to design

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.560
levels with the editor he coded.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.360
Just an awesome way to outsource.

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.560
Molons are design levels for my computer game.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.800
All right, so what was the game all about?

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.920
Okay, so you played in these levels where you had ladders, and you had, I always called

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:12.080
them monkey bars, but they were basically like wires that you could kind of climb across,

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.760
and there were bricks all over.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:19.600
What you could do with the bricks, you could dig holes in the bricks, and that could allow

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.760
you to do several things.

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:28.800
It could allow you to go get through an area without having to use a ladder, because you're

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.260
constantly being chased by guards the whole time.

01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:36.440
But if a guard falls into a pit, the gravity works a little different for them.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.560
They will not fall all the way to the ground.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.200
They will become trapped in that hole.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:48.040
Now after about two seconds, they will make their way out of that hole and continue chasing

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.040
you.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.260
The holes fill in after about five seconds.

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:56.280
So if you time it just right, or if you build a sequence of holes, like three back to back

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:59.900
that the guard keeps falling in back to back and climbing out of, eventually the guard

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:02.120
will get buried alive, essentially.

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:05.240
So he gets killed, and he restarts at the beginning of the level.

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.720
So it's a really great way to get the guards to start chasing you.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.520
And the guards are really stupid.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.120
They only chase you, you know the patterns.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.720
They're always going to take the most direct route to you no matter what, but it was the

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:20.200
way you built the holes that could really change the level.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.320
Now of course, you're not just running around dodging guards.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:25.040
You're actually trying to collect gold throughout the level.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.720
And once you get all the gold, you go to the top of the screen to get to the next level.

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:32.200
And the level designer, you actually have an exit ladder that you can design that would

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.720
show up once all the gold has been corrected.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.080
So you can only dig a hole on the sides.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.200
You cannot dig a hole underneath yourself.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:48.840
So meaning if you fall in a hole and you get stuck, you will die unless you are smart enough

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:53.360
to build like a line of three, fall in a line of two, fall in a line of one.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.880
You can do that really quick if you don't have a lot of guards chasing you.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.880
So kind of neat there.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.280
If you start with five lives, but every time you finish a level, you get an extra life.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.440
And if a guard catches you, of course, the current level restarts.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.880
You can fall as far as you want, but you can't jump.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.520
So very, you know, kind of a simple game in that regard.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:18.960
But it was the level editor and the fact that people kind of did their own crazy things

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:23.600
with it that really, you know, made this game, I think, influential on some of the stuff

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.960
we see today.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.400
The game was pretty well received when it came out.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:35.000
For instance, PC Magazine gave the game 16.25 out of 18 points.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.980
It said that the game was a tour de force of American ingenuity and the first release

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.820
in a long time that can honestly bear the title Computer Game.

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:50.060
Zzap!64 in 1985 said that the Commodore 64 version was, quote, not one of the most recent

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:54.300
games, but certainly one of the best, a classic for a long time to come.

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:58.740
The Spectrum version voted number 37 in the official top 100 games of all time for the

01:23:58.740 --> 01:23:59.740
Sinclair.

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.180
GameSpot named Lode Runner as one of the greatest games of all time.

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:10.140
Time rated Lode Runner the number one game in the greatest games for the Apple II list.

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:16.900
And Alexey Pajnetov, who designed Tetris, confirmed that it is his favorite puzzle game

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:19.420
for a long, long time.

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:23.740
Now there were other versions of Lode Runner that came out.

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:27.780
This game, of course, is successful in that it spawns a hell of a lot of sequels, including

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:32.780
Championship Lode Runner, which was a sequel with 50 levels, Lode Runner's Rescue, which

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:38.340
was a 3D sequel for Atari 8-bit computers, Hyper Lode Runner, which was on the original

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:39.860
Game Boy.

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.660
There was arcade versions of this as well.

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:46.700
And then in the 90s, Sierra brought, because they acquired a lot of this stuff, brought

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.340
back Lode Runner.

01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:53.540
Sierra brought back Lode Runner The Legend Returns in 94, Lode Runner Online, Mad Monks

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:59.100
Revenge, which actually had online play, excuse me, Lode Runner 2 with isometric 3D gameplay,

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:03.980
and Lode Runner 3D for the Nintendo 64.

01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:08.460
And lastly, to note, the Xbox Live Arcade.

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:14.140
In 2008, a remake of Lode Runner was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show, and it was

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.500
released in April of 2009.

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.980
The game has revamped 3D graphics, more game modes, cooperative and competitive multiplayer

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:27.460
support, six block types, and a level editor, as well as live leaderboards and a timeline

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.140
of the game's history.

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.180
So there you go, Lode Runner.

01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:35.140
Now Lode Runner, I'll mention this as well real quick, Lode Runner was also available

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:38.940
on the Nintendo Entertainment System, so I see some of you guys probably remember it

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:39.940
from there.

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:44.940
Let me jump ahead to a little clip of this Lode Runner on the Nintendo Entertainment System,

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:49.580
because obviously it had a little bit, it made a little more music when he was walking

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:50.580
along.

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:53.500
And it was weird too, because the screen would scroll around.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:56.940
I don't know if it's the way the game was designed or whatever, but the sprites were

01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:02.500
so big that the screen actually panned around to fit it all.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:07.260
And the other really, really interesting thing about the NES version, the enemies, the guards,

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:08.260
were all Bomberman.

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:11.260
I don't, like they look like Bomberman.

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:15.980
I don't know why they did that, but they did, I guess maybe to recycle some sprites or something

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:17.460
like that, I don't know.

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:18.540
So there you go.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.300
There it is, your classic game of the week, Lode Runner.

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:25.060
I remember it fondly on the Commodore 64, but I think most people probably started on

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:29.580
the Apple IIe, or maybe even the Nintendo Entertainment System, but it's available a

01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:30.580
lot of different places.

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:32.700
You ever played Lode Runner when you were a kid, Loki?

01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:34.900
I think so, I just don't remember.

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:39.780
I'm trying to see, it doesn't look familiar, but maybe it did.

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:42.220
I played a lot of different games.

01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:45.380
I would have thought the creation element of it would have really appealed to you.

01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:51.300
But remember back then though, I didn't really, it was hard to be on top of everything that

01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:54.340
came out, because you only had magazines.

01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:59.340
So I don't know if that ever came up on my radar.

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.780
All right, well, you'll have to check it out at some point during the week.

01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:06.780
There's lots and lots of different ways to play it, and one of its sequel forms is nothing

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:07.780
else.

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:12.460
I still say the original's the best, and there's all those websites of questionable legality,

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.300
but they allow you to play the old school computer games, right?

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.860
Like the Apple IIe games, you know?

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:20.220
So I'm sure if you Google it, you'll find a way to play Lode Runner, or remember that's

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:21.220
L-O-D-E.

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:26.980
Although I always kind of thought that was a tongue-in-cheek way of, you know, because

01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:28.900
you would load your user levels.

01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:29.900
I don't know.

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:30.900
Anyway.

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:31.900
All right, forget it.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:34.780
All right, that's going to do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but guys,

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.780
don't go anywhere.

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.220
We have plenty more show coming up right after this quick break.

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.220
So don't go anywhere.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:41.220
We'll be right back.

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:53.300
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June the 22nd of 2014

01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:56.180
with the 557th episode of our show.

01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:58.860
Just Loki and I here in studio tonight at our Sakura.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:02.580
She is out tonight, and yeah, no, Jason's not in town.

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.500
He's back home in Colorado.

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.180
Shane's doing something else online.

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.180
Alan's at work.

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:09.180
So all the usual standby people not available.

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:11.900
So it's just Loki and I, just us.

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:15.900
But you guys with us in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and on the Skype line

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:20.340
in just a little while, you can add us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:21.380
That's all one word.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:24.740
Or you can always use the telephone, too, even though I think everybody in this day

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.380
and age is really switching over to Skype.

01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:29.180
But 1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number.

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:33.300
Speaking of Skype, if you do plan to call us that way, please do us all a courtesy.

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:37.460
Call Echo 123 first before you call into the show.

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:40.740
Just make sure that you're settings and you sound good and all that good stuff because

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:45.740
nothing's worse than getting a call on the show live that goes, hello, hello, hello,

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.740
hello, can you hear me?

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:47.740
Hello.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:48.740
Hi.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.740
Hello.

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.740
Hello.

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:51.740
Are we here in the background?

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.740
Are we here ourselves on repeat?

01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:55.540
I mean, as lovely as our voices are, you know, we don't need to hear ourselves.

01:28:55.540 --> 01:29:00.180
So Echo 123 is always a good protocol.

01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:03.900
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.700
use the passphrase, beaver.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:11.820
All right, going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, they're still debating the whole scholarship

01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:12.820
thing that came up earlier.

01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:15.500
So we're gonna get into that in the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.500
So if you weren't here live, you're missing some spirited debate tonight.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.740
And I don't mind spirited debate as long as everybody stays respectful, which everybody

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:22.740
is.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:23.740
So we're cool.

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:24.740
We're cool.

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.740
But here's some more things to debate.

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:26.740
It's rapid fire news.

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.740
Let's do some other quick gaming stories.

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:29.740
Loki.

01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:35.860
This week, there was, right before the Steam sale, there was this Team Fortress 2 update

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:36.900
tease thing.

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:42.700
And they've been kind of doing that throughout the week beforehand, where people would see

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:46.300
randomly spawning bread when they would use a teleporter.

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:51.660
And they kind of had to do with this whole, I forget what they called the update, the

01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.300
Love and War update.

01:29:53.300 --> 01:30:05.580
They had this 15 minute long mini short film that they had made with the film editor.

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.780
And hilarious.

01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:12.980
And it had to do with some of the bread stuff and teleporting and there's like a bread monster

01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:13.980
now.

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:15.280
But on top of that, there's also some new actions.

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:21.520
They have a new head-butting action square dancing, conga dancing, extreme flips, rock

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.940
paper scissor.

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:28.120
They also had some new items that appeared in the game as well.

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.560
Like some more costumes, hats and that kind of stuff.

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:33.400
Dance mode icons are very important, you know?

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.120
So that's pretty cool.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.480
And definitely check out the short film if you haven't yet.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.480
It's pretty awesome.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:42.480
It's amazing that they are still cranking out updates to this game.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:49.800
And it kind of makes you want an actual film from Valve for Team Fortress 2.

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:50.800
That's kind of what you got.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:51.800
It's just a short film.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:54.000
Yeah, but I want a full length video.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.640
I want a full one.

01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.640
It's pretty awesome.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.400
You know, Loki, we don't always get what we want.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.280
I want a playable version of your game.

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.000
You will get that eventually.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.160
I'm just getting the end of the stuff done.

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.640
He promised everybody episode 557.

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:12.320
Hey, I'm hurrying.

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:17.440
If you don't produce, I'm going to just start calling you Valve.

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:20.360
No, no, no, see, I have to start.

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:24.880
I'll have to do a Kickstarter first, you know, so they don't produce, yeah.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.880
And then, yeah.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:27.880
Alright.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:28.880
What else you got?

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:36.500
Anyways, so on top of that, they've been, they started selling a text adventure game

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:49.160
actually on Steam, and this one is called Heroes Rise, and it's a text-only game.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:55.180
It's pure text adventure without any sort of audio-visual elements to it, so talk about

01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.180
old school.

01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:58.220
But you can pick that up.

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:01.620
They've got, they're on sale right now for $1.99 each.

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:08.460
They have the Hero Project, the Prodigy, and I don't know if they had another one coming.

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:12.100
I realize these are newer text adventure games, but can't you buy some of the classics on

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:14.940
Steam like Zork and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:19.220
Maybe, I don't know if they were on there, but I don't know.

01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:20.220
It's newer.

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:24.460
I mean, it's definitely an interesting genre, I guess.

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:29.500
Well, you know, some people prefer reading a book because then you can make up the graphics

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.220
yourself.

01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:35.020
I'm being serious with that comment, you know?

01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:40.780
And your graphics in your head, always running at 60 frames per second or higher.

01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:46.740
That's right, your mind is more powerful than current-gen systems.

01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:49.020
Always one step closer to the holodeck.

01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.020
Yeah.

01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.020
So.

01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:53.380
No Zork on Steam.

01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:56.380
I thought that some of the old- Good old games probably has it, though.

01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:58.900
Yeah, probably good old games.

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:00.820
I used to be on GameTap.

01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:01.820
Remember GameTap?

01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:08.380
I used to love GameTap, and then they kind of sold and went to crap.

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:11.260
But let's see, I'm looking right now to see if it's something that's available on good

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:12.260
old games.

01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.540
Yes, the Zork Anthology is available for three bucks on good old games.

01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:23.460
And speaking of Kickstarter, a game that actually was pretty interesting when I got to check

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:26.740
it out, the demo and stuff that they had, also built in Unity.

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:32.500
Cat Lateral Damage, the first person kitty simulator where you as a cat knock over shit

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:36.180
in your house and just generally piss off people.

01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:40.100
But to be a full cat sim, they had to add a few things.

01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:46.340
And with that, in this brand new video, they have the ability to take a nap, chase a mouse,

01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.340
chase a laser pointer.

01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:49.460
It is the pure cat sim.

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:55.820
And they are looking to raise $40,000 by July 11th.

01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:59.580
And I believe, let's see where they're at here real quick, they were pretty far, yeah,

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:00.580
they're gonna make it.

01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:04.100
They're at $36,218 and they've got 18 days to go.

01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:05.700
So it is gonna happen.

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:08.660
People are loving what they're seeing in the cat simulator.

01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.340
So it's pretty awesome.

01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:15.500
I was gonna see real quick if they had any stretch goals that they are adding there.

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:19.300
But definitely if you haven't gotten a chance to play the game yet, oh, here you go.

01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:22.540
New features and content that they've added since the demo.

01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:24.260
You can chase or ignore mice.

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.780
You can play with them or catch them.

01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:30.540
You can sit in a box, lie in a sunbeam or both at once, chase a laser pointer and completely

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:36.260
freak out, hack up a hairball, find lost cat toys under the couch and play with them, explore

01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:42.140
or hide underneath the bed, trip out on catnip, stand at a doorway and be indecisive about

01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:49.100
going in or out, meow using state of the art cutting edge meowing technology.

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.700
Where's ignore the dog?

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.700
Is that a-

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.860
I don't know if there's a dog in the game yet.

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:54.900
Maybe the sequel.

01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:56.260
It's pretty awesome.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:01.940
They're gonna try to get some procedurally generated houses and rooms that you can play.

01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:04.260
Lots of fun stuff.

01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:05.260
Go check it out.

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:10.580
If you haven't played the demo yet, I think you can check it out on their website, maybe

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.620
catlateraldamage.com or something.

01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:17.260
But if you go to the actual Kickstarter page, they have the web demo actually embedded in

01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:18.260
there.

01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:19.260
So if you wanna check it out, you can play it.

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:20.900
Or they have a link to it, I guess.

01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:25.340
catlateraldamage.com slash play if you wanna check out the demo.

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:28.660
Which I recommend you should if you haven't done it yet.

01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:32.100
They really should make cat lateral damage like an MMO.

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:38.340
Where we could all coexist in the same cat person's apartment.

01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:44.380
You know, the cat owner that has like 50 cats, we can all exist in that one place.

01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:48.160
And here's something that maybe even Jamie, I don't know if she wants to pitch money towards

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:54.360
a Kickstarter, but you can for $60 right now, if you pledge $60, you can make your

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.200
cat famous and they will put a photo of your cat in the game as a frameboaster.

01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.200
Aw.

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:06.720
In fact, they even had one if you pitched enough money, it was limited though, you can

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.840
play as your cat in the game.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.400
So that's kinda cool.

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.240
Fifth Dream in chat says, my cat is gonna be in cat lateral damage.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:16.680
So I guess Fifth Dream is to pony down that to get that in there.

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680
But that's awesome.

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:24.160
You know, to give a shout out to an old Xbox indie arcade game that was made by our friend

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.200
YYR, you remember about two years ago, he made Bungie Ferret Tossing, which is one of

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.040
the OLR dream games we talked about.

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:33.120
He made Bungie Ferret Tossing into a game.

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:37.920
But the opening splash screen is a, you know, please don't actually harm animals because

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:42.180
the joke is that they're explosive ferrets, but he has his responsible disclaimer that

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:46.580
says this game is a joke and you don't actually want to harm animals.

01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:49.280
And he put pictures of animals in games.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:54.860
And so Alan's cats, Maruko, who is still alive at the time, and Sanrio, who is still around,

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:58.900
they actually appear in Bungie Ferret Tossing, which is great.

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:03.980
So even if my cats didn't get in cat lateral damage, they at least will forever be immortalized

01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.100
in one video game.

01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:07.420
So thank you to YYR for making that happen.

01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:14.660
All right, um, anyhow, let's talk about some other stories, including free things, yay,

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:15.660
free things.

01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:19.540
It will involve Origin, however, so however you feel about that, although I gotta say,

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:24.140
you know, as much as warmed up to it, as much as Origin has been the laughing stock of PC

01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:29.040
storefronts and all this over the years, they've made a lot, a lot, a lot of strides in the

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.040
past couple of years.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.180
Yeah, the only thing that bugs me about Origin right now, and it's really just my sheer laziness

01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:37.300
about it, is that it auto loads when I start my PC.

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:39.100
That's about the only thing that annoys me.

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:43.120
Aside from that, though, I'm kind of over hating on Origin because I don't buy anything

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.120
on it.

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.120
So it's fine.

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:48.960
It's really funny too, because a lot of people were like, well, everybody hated Steam at

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.760
first, but then it grew into this thing that everybody loves.

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.440
So now it's like, wow, we really do see like Origin going down so far, at least a similar

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:56.440
path.

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:59.880
And if they keep giving away free shit, it's pretty hard not to like it.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.200
The only problem with the free shit that they're giving away is it was all stuff they bought

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.380
in that one EA Humble Bundle that they had.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:10.560
So it's like, oh, hey, Battlefield 3 is free, yeah, already got it, oh hey, you know, Dead

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:12.120
Space is free, eh, already got it.

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:15.320
I didn't have Dead Space, and I didn't have what they give away in Plants vs. Zombies,

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:18.960
and I didn't have that either, so I was like, oh, score.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.720
Well, one game that they were giving away for free, at least for a 48 hour period, was

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:24.720
Titanfall.

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:28.440
Now, of course, their big competitor Steam does things like this, where you can like

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:32.000
download a game for the weekend, well, Origin's got it too.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.320
Origin is making Titanfall free to download and play for 48 hours.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.720
However, this is the interesting thing about it.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:44.060
Unlike the Steam free weekend, Origin has the game free for a set period of time that

01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:47.720
starts when you begin playing.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:53.560
So you can make that weekend essentially whenever you want, so a 48 hour demo for you.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.880
Progress during this access is saved, and if you want to purchase the game after that,

01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.820
you can pick up right where you left off, so that's pretty cool, I gotta say.

01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:05.860
So Origin's stepping up their game a little bit with a very recent game there, Titanfall,

01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:08.920
which I'm sure they wouldn't mind selling a few more copies of.

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:12.100
Bayonetta 2 is a game a lot of folks are looking forward to on the Wii U.

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:15.140
I know I'm one of them, especially now that I know the original Bayonetta's gonna be with

01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:16.140
it too.

01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:17.140
That's pretty fucking rad.

01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:23.140
Well, to go in line with that, Funimation has agreed that they will release the Bayonetta

01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:27.140
Bloody Fate anime feature film in North America.

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:32.020
Bayonetta Bloody Fate, of course, based on the Bayonetta games, which sees Bayonetta

01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:36.580
the Witch battling the forces of heaven in a quest to regain her memory.

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:40.820
So there is no release date from Funimation yet, no release window either, but it does

01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:46.100
state that Funamori Kizaki will be on hand at Anime Expo in Los Angeles for a special

01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:50.220
sneak peek at the English dub, because I'm sure you're all excited about the English

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:51.720
dub.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.680
The screening is happening on July 5th.

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:59.460
I would imagine the movie should be timed around the game's release on Wii U.

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.540
I would think that's the smart thing to do, but...

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:05.740
Wonder if they'll ever make that into a live action movie.

01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:07.740
I think that might be a bit much.

01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:10.500
Have you played Bayonetta?

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:11.500
It's a little crazy.

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:16.200
They can have Angelina Jolie or something.

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:20.180
Or who they get, they can have Mila Jilovich do it.

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:21.180
Why not?

01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.180
Why not?

01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:26.900
Alright, now, could there be more functionality coming between the Wii U and the Nintendo

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:29.100
3DS in the future?

01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:33.520
Miyamoto and Takahashi over at Nintendo have talked about that they have some more titles

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:37.780
that utilize a connection between the Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS in the works.

01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:42.060
Now Super Smash Bros. will allow you to transfer character data between the two systems, but

01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.220
that's really all we know.

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:45.300
However, there was a little more that came out.

01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:49.720
Quote, with Smash Bros., because the two games have the same gameplay and the same controls,

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:52.740
that game in particular is designed where you want to start playing on the 3DS first

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:56.460
and build up your characters there, and transfer that character data over to the Wii U and

01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:57.680
play with them there.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.520
There's no real reason that we haven't done it yet, I guess it just hasn't really fit

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:03.760
into the titles that we have been making, and it's not that we haven't thought about

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:04.760
it.

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:08.000
In fact, with Wii Fit U, we created the Fit Meter, which connects to the Wii U gamepad

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.040
wirelessly and transfers data.

01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:13.120
Within those plans, we also thought about potentially having some type of functionality

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.740
with 3DS that would connect to it, but ultimately we didn't include it.

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:20.140
We also had an idea where, if there's a Wii U at home, and maybe the father or kids have

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:24.480
a 3DS, then we might think up a system where the Wii U would know that you were home before

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.340
your dog did.

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:29.360
It was kind of an interesting concept based around that, but we ended up not doing anything

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:33.380
with the idea, it hasn't really worked its way into the titles we've been developing,

01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:36.960
but there are some things we're working on that we haven't announced at E3 that do involve

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.760
some sort of communication between the Wii U and the 3DS, and then they go into a little

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.760
bit of a banter.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:43.660
We can't say the title, can we?

01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:44.660
Not really.

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:51.460
If you were to say it, they would really get excited, and they ended it with, we were thinking

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:54.060
about that with Mario and Donkey Kong.

01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:59.580
I'm sorry, whenever they start talking about, hey, we have all this stuff planned, but we

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:02.420
can't tell you about it yet, I don't fucking care.

01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:08.260
I just really don't care anymore, because it's just like, they can talk all about this

01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:11.820
wonderful plans and stuff, but it doesn't mean it's actually going to come out, and

01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:15.540
what they think is something that we'll get excited about isn't this.

01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:19.180
Don't get me wrong, there are people that love Pikmin, and there are probably a lot

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:23.720
of people that love Pikmin 3, but for a lot of people, Pikmin 3, nobody gives a fucking

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.880
shit about, and that's kind of where I'm at with this thing, it's like, cool, why don't

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.720
we talk about what exactly you're saying, you know, what kind of interaction, you don't

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.920
have to say the title, just say the interaction, like, give me an example in a generic sense.

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.960
Maybe it would give it away, I don't know.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:40.960
No it wouldn't, I'm sure.

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:47.480
JVMon in our chatroom says, please F0, yes, yes sir, yes sir, he said Mario Kart, I think

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:53.140
honestly Nintendo probably has at least a year long lifespan plan for Mario Kart 8.

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:56.100
They already talked, it's not on our show tonight, but they already announced that Mercedes

01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:01.960
DLC is going to come to America, so we know the game is capable of handling DLC, how can

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:06.980
there not be a meaty $20 DLC, because you know Nintendo doesn't skimp on DLC, they will

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:12.180
do a meaty $20 DLC pack that's like tracks, racers, cars, they're going to extend the

01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:16.460
life of that game, they don't need to make a new F0, as much as it pains me to say it,

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:20.420
because I really want a new F0, I'm going to have like an F0 track, aw that would piss

01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:24.900
me off, that would just be rubbing it, oh my god, if they made Mute City a track in

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:32.420
Mario Kart 8, I would, I'll tweet a picture of my middle finger at Reggie, I will.

01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:35.300
Actually I shouldn't, no I'm going to have to do it.

01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:45.140
There, we'll see, I don't know, it's, here's my thing, and like I mentioned before, before

01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:49.540
I had to change my plans of what I was working on and stuff, I'm just not going to wait for

01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:59.060
them, you know, it's like listen, I'll make my own fucking F0, with hookers and blackjack.

01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:03.700
Oh my god, wait, you're going to just make F0, but instead of like these futuristic races,

01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:05.700
it's just going to be hookers.

01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:08.260
Hooker race 2015 or something like that.

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:14.940
It wouldn't do anything with it, no seriously, I just, I wouldn't wait for them, just like

01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:21.500
you know, maybe my next project after I finish my game, someday hopefully, is do a new excite

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.380
truck, because I'm tired of fucking waiting for a new excite truck, it's just never going

01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.380
to happen.

01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:26.380
Hooker race.

01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:31.780
No we're not going to do a hooker race, that's silly and stupid.

01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:36.740
I can't imagine a game that you designed doesn't have a little silly and stupid somewhere in

01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:37.740
it.

01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:42.700
Oh, there's plenty of silly and stupid planned, but I kind of want to make my kart racing

01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:51.100
game, because it would be, I have a lot of notes on the design for that, but uh, someday.

01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:56.780
Alright, speaking of your notes, let's go to the foogle question of the week, because

01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:08.300
you take Facebook and Google Plus, and slam them together, and you get foogle.

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:12.540
Thank you actdeft in our chat room, excitehooker, there you go, get on it Loki.

01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:18.820
In serious news though, going to our foogle question of the week, which is about the esports,

01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:22.580
which funny enough was kind of a debate in our chat room for a little bit, but we posted

01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:26.260
that a little earlier on our Facebook and Google Plus communities, facebook.com slash

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:30.580
orange lounge radio, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, and here's the question,

01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:35.020
what do you think as a gamer about news, like league of legends becoming a varsity esports

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:39.300
team at a college in the Chicago area, do esports deserve the same sort of recognition

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:45.460
as more traditional sports, such as baseball, basketball, and soccer, p.s. happy world cup.

01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:48.660
Although I think I mentioned that towards the beginning of the show.

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:53.380
Let's start over on Facebook, and we start with an answer from Renee, my pal from my

01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:59.300
killer queens from outer space podcast, and Renee says, I work at the university's rec center,

01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:02.500
and then it kind of clicked for me, I'm like well yeah Renee's in the Chicago area, and I knew he

01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:07.940
worked, I did not realize he was, so here we go, so Renee gives an interesting perspective here,

01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:12.580
and from that perspective, I think this is a great idea that will work towards bringing students

01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:17.460
together into a community of their own, make friends in that environment, and learn teamwork,

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:22.260
leadership, camaraderie, and good sportsmanship, and give more choices to be involved with other

01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:27.380
students in university life, but I'm sure that answer's got to be a little bit biased, no,

01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:32.900
you make a convincing argument, you do, and ER says, I think it's a good thing, I'm not a huge

01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:37.300
fan of esports or sports in general, but I did play fighting games at a decent level for a while,

01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:41.220
and I can attest that it takes just as much practice to be competitive at a video game

01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:46.340
as it does a sport, Raginator says, it's about damn time esports got some recognition,

01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:53.060
JV Mon says, esports shouldn't be a varsity team in college, it's just a PC game, if gaming can be

01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:59.220
a college sport, I want varsity edition of RuPaul's Drag U with queens from the top colleges, take just

01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:05.700
as much talent and practice as games and sports, so why not, could lip sync for your life be an

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:09.860
Olympic sport, that would actually be kind of rad, because it's not that dissimilar from ice

01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:14.900
dancing, people, all right, Degenerate Johnny says, as traditional sports such as baseball,

01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:19.460
soccer, and basketball concentrate on the physical skills of athletes, so does esports in regards to

01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:24.340
the cerebral skill of gamers, however, the best part about esports is that it's competition that

01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:29.620
both genders can compete as equals, I believe as esports grow in popularity, we will see more of

01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:35.540
a variety of games enter into the group of esports games that already exist, such as MOBAs, lol

01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:41.140
Dota, RTSs, Starcraft, and digital card games, Hearthstone, Hex Shards of Fate, you know, you go

01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:44.820
down a really interesting slope though with that answer where the whole both genders compete as

01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:49.380
equals, I realize that, you know, in most professional sports right now, that's not the way

01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:55.620
it works, but there's a lot of people kind of clamoring for, I seem to remember years ago, wasn't

01:47:55.620 --> 01:48:01.060
there a woman who was like getting really far into getting into an NHL team, I want to say it was

01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:05.780
hockey, maybe SSG100 remembers this better than I do, but according, then you have like NASCAR,

01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:12.020
you know, and a factor, but obviously these are very few sprinklings of, you know, women in what

01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:18.340
have typically been male-dominated sports, so it's, that's an interesting, very, very interesting,

01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:23.620
you know, answer there in that regard, so, but it is, it's kind of a slippery slope to begin with,

01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:27.860
because I think many would argue that, you know, both genders should be competing as equals in the

01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:35.380
other sports too. Anyway, Awesome Unicorn says, well, I don't personally find MOBAs appealing,

01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:39.860
I am definitely supportive of gaming being taken seriously, I'm still a little concerned about if

01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:45.220
games with a fantasy skin like League of Legends or Dota will be taken as seriously by the general

01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:50.580
public compared to, let's say, a war-themed game with a Command & Conquer skin. Critical Myth says,

01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:54.900
I'm for it in general, but I'm not sure that a game infamous for its brutal and disgusting online

01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:58.980
environment should be the game to get the attention credibility, but I realize that's more

01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:04.180
of a function of which game the community supports more than any other reason. You know what, that's

01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:09.700
a really important answer, is that, you know, League of Legends and some of those MOBAs have

01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:15.300
really toxic online environments. They're really, really bad when you get that anonymity. Hopefully

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:22.260
this brings a little more classiness to it, but I think though, I mean, and it goes without saying,

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:27.860
there's certainly some toxic environments when it comes to, you know, shit talking in basketball

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:34.020
games and baseball games and things like that too. Unfortunately, that sort of trolling isn't

01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:42.660
exclusive to MOBAs. However, and this is important, when you can be anonymous, like in a computer game

01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:46.980
like League of Legends, it's a little easier to say some shit you wouldn't say to my face,

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:54.420
like you'd have to do in baseball or basketball. So that's something. All right. Let's see. Also,

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:59.460
we have DJ Rama S who says, frankly, it's bullshit to get a scholarship for playing a damn game. What

01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:03.940
the hell do you need a scholarship for that? You can't take courses in video gaming in that aspect,

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:08.020
and I don't see the point in it either. If they're doing that, then I expect scholarships to be

01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:12.820
handed out for computer building and networking as well. Want to impress me? Give them a scholarship

01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:18.340
designing the game instead of playing a game. It's a joke. This is some very diversifying opinions

01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:25.700
there over on Facebook. Let's go over to Google Plus and see what folks said over there because

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:29.780
I've been waiting for it to load. Fantastic live radio. Okay. We have a few comments here,

01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:34.980
starting with Redertainment who says, I'm sorry, but I can't leave my gamer hat on for this.

01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:39.860
As a member of the community, I would have a problem with my chronically underfunded public

01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:46.180
schools spending a large amount of money on a sports program, even if that sport is esports.

01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:49.620
Was this school a public school or a private school?

01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:54.900
I don't think it's... I don't... It sounded like a private school.

01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:58.660
Not to discount the opinion here, but just wanted to make sure that clarification is out there.

01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:03.940
Ronnie B over on Google Plus says, I expect virtual sports to become more and more of a

01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:08.820
serious and accepted thing in society as we head into the future. With the advancing hardware like

01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:13.700
the Rift, Glass, Kinect, Morpheus, and even some cell phones being the start of mixing the physical

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:18.740
world with a networked virtual world, entertainment will likely take on a whole new level quicker than

01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:23.700
we thought. Although the media, also the media always tries to link gaming with most tragic

01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:32.180
events. So this is a bit interesting. And lastly, Act Def says, think the problem here is or not

01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:36.740
recognized as a competitive pastime or whether it's considered a varsity thing or not. I think

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:41.780
the problem resides in calling it a sport or esport. I mean, there are other things that could

01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:47.940
get you a scholarship for college, but we need to separate physical sports from esports. Hmm.

01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:51.460
Interesting perspective there is that, you know, there are many things you can get a scholarship

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:57.460
to college for. This isn't a sport. It's an esport. Hmm. Interesting. All right.

01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:03.380
Kaijuto in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says they should give them a digital

01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:10.820
scholarship. It's good for 500 Microsoft points. I like that sassy answer. All right. Let's get

01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:14.740
back into some other news. Hey, don't forget to friend us on Facebook and Google Plus so you can

01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:23.140
answer our future questions in the weeks to come. Loki. All right. So let's see. Speaking of

01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:32.180
things we may not consider sports, there's a fake EA Sports Instagram account. And this has to do

01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:43.220
with FIFA 14 Ultimate Team. I guess EA Sports UT 2014 is the account and it's not legit. In fact,

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:53.060
it's actually trying to fish logins for Xbox Live in origin. Apparently they're offering free

01:52:53.060 --> 01:53:00.420
in-game currency on the account. And if you log in to try to get this free in-game currency,

01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:07.140
it'll ask for your login details and that's where they get you. So then you'll have, you know,

01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:13.620
people buying FIFA Ultimate Team cards on your account. Kind of like how they've done past

01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:19.220
FIFA games. Hackers are going to steal your money. Hackers going to hack.

01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:27.060
All right. Speaking of EA, you know, when Battlefield 4 launched, I don't know how many

01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:32.980
of you guys tried to get in there and play it, but online was fucked. Did you try to play

01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:37.460
Battlefield 4 online at all? Nope. This isn't the type of game that's usually up my alley.

01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:41.540
So I kind of missed this whole thing, but I did definitely saw the rants and raves on

01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:48.420
Twitter and so forth. So yeah, Battlefield 4 launched and players had months of connectivity

01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:55.700
issues. EA delayed development of the promised DLC packs in order of fixing the bugs in the game.

01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:03.860
Now, what's interesting is the CEO of EA, Andrew Wilson, has kind of owned up to some of the

01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:08.660
problems of Battlefield 4 this week, talking about, and I guess blaming it of sorts, on the

01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:14.580
game's online scope. So here's the quote, quote, for me, the situation we had was unacceptable.

01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:19.380
For the team, it was unacceptable. We have worked tirelessly since then to make sure the gameplay

01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:23.540
experience got to where it absolutely should have been at launch. And we're focused on that,

01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:28.820
and we continue to deliver that value to the player base. Now, notice there's not an apology

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:35.940
there. Now, also, he will not say that, you know, future games will be bug free, but that would be

01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:42.660
a foolish claim to make, I think. So yeah, and according to some people that got to check out

01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:48.180
the Battlefield Hardline Beta, or Alpha, I guess, I don't know, Alpha, Beta, whatever it was,

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:54.260
apparently, it plays very similar to Battlefield 4, and some of the glitches that you see in

01:54:54.260 --> 01:55:00.500
Battlefield 4, you're seeing in Hardline, so. Wow. Hopefully, the netcode should be better.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:05.460
I mean, since it's, I'm assuming using the same engine, and hopefully they can just transfer that

01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:12.180
over, but it is a different developer, so cross your fingers, I guess. It's more of like, I think,

01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:16.900
maybe, if anything, consumers can learn to be a little bit cautious, maybe not jump in immediately

01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:21.700
for day one, just kind of see how it's playing, because obviously, it's going to be a focus of

01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:26.100
a lot of the reviews, especially ever since, like, you know, SimCity and Diablo 3 and stuff,

01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:31.140
it's just got to see how those servers are handling things. Let me read the quote about

01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:35.460
not making promises about being bug free, because I think it's interesting. So again, Andrew Wilson,

01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:40.740
the CEO of EA, goes on to say, quote, it would be disingenuous for me to sit here and say,

01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:44.740
we will never have an issue again, because that would mean we are never going to push the

01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:48.900
boundaries again, and I don't want to be that company. I want to be a company that pushes to

01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:53.380
lead and innovate and be creative, but you can start to do things that give you a better handle

01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:57.620
and a better view about what the potential challenges might be. Yeah, but that's not being

01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:02.580
innovative, that's being like, you know, that's basically saying, hey, you know what, we're going

01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:09.460
to go ahead and purchase this many servers for this game, and we're going to hope that not a lot

01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:13.220
of people play it, maybe buggy at first, but we're going to save a lot of money in the long run

01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:20.980
once that initial, you know, kind of spike subsides. So did they not know how many pre-orders

01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:24.820
the game had or something? It's not, it doesn't matter, because even if they know how many pre-orders

01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:29.220
they have, they know that not everybody is playing at exactly the same time, so they're never going

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:34.820
to have enough server spots open for every single person. That's, that's the thing, that's the gamble

01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:39.700
is you could do that if you, you know, ideally you could say, okay, we know how many copies of this

01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:45.540
game we're printing, so this is how many server spots we're going to have open, but then again,

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:50.740
you're going to lose money because you're going to have all these servers that you aren't utilizing.

01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:54.740
It gets a little easier when you start using, like, these virtual servers through, I think,

01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:01.540
like Amazon and, you know, like Microsoft Azure servers or whatever, where they can scale it

01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:08.100
dynamically, and so they're not having to purchase all these servers, it's just, it's a lot easier,

01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:16.180
a lot more flexible, but I don't know. I just think it's like, you know, what was it, last year,

01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:23.300
you know, or was it SimCity, perfect example here, yeah, we saw how shitty the Diablo 3 launch was,

01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:28.420
it's not gonna be like that with SimCity, and then it was fucking terrible, so I don't buy whenever

01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:33.780
a company tells me that it's not gonna be fucking terrible after the last launch was terrible,

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:39.860
because it seems like every MMO, they don't learn their lesson, every MMO that launches

01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:45.460
has this problem too, yeah, every single one of them, I mean, some difficulties, you know,

01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:50.500
a little bit of, you know, hiccups here and there are okay, I think, I kind of expected, but when

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:56.420
it's just fucked up, you know, and we're not even talking, like, that their servers are being

01:57:56.420 --> 01:58:02.580
overrun, it's just bad netcode, like the game just wasn't working very well, that's a little

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:08.900
bit different, so hopefully they got that ironed out for the next game. All right, I think we have

01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:14.820
one more story here, and then we're gonna get to the mailbag and the FUs. All right, so game I

01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:19.300
didn't really get to play, but remember last week asking about, hey, whatever happened to Ridge

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:25.940
Racer, and one of the games that, you know, they put out last was Ridge Racer Driftopia, well,

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:32.020
apparently that didn't do too well, it was a free-to-play game that was on PlayStation 3 and PC,

01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:39.860
came out, I want to say, like, last year sometime, developed by Bugbear, and they had, like, an early

01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:45.860
access version of the game that came out in August 2013, it was like a beta, and never, I don't think,

01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:54.500
really left beta, but now it's being shut down. They're closing off the servers August 15th,

01:58:55.140 --> 01:59:01.780
and so, yeah, so much for Ridge Racer. I don't know why the FU music started playing right there, but it

01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:07.700
would seem very well timed, but yeah, so unfortunately, you know, if you wanted to play

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:13.460
Ridge Racer Driftopia, you might want to get into it now, before that, you know, they shut the

01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:18.500
servers down, but apparently it's not that great. Actdeft in our chat says, Driftopia was meh,

01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:27.620
so I want a real, like, I want a good, you know, PlayStation 4, Xbox One Ridge Racer game from

01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:34.660
Namco, like, it would be fantastic. Give me, like, a new, like, R4, you know, quality game.

01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:40.980
That's what I want to see. Actdeft is saying, it wasn't, like, bad, but god, it was pay-to-win,

01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:47.140
so that seems to be its issue. Yeah, they had, they really hoarded the last, was it the Ridge

01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:52.260
Racer game for Vita? I remember it just soured everything, kind of like, man, I was looking

01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:56.580
forward to the Vita Ridge Racer game, and then it's like, oh, it's 30 bucks, but you only get,

01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:00.980
like, four tracks, and, you know, or four cars in, like, a few tracks, and you have to buy the

02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:08.820
rest, and it's like, you know, you guys suck. All right, well, let's go to the mailbag. Every week,

02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:14.900
you guys email us, mailbag at, excuse me, participate at orangeloungeradio.com. I mentioned

02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:18.260
it's 12 years old, and we had the same email address for 11 and a half of those years.

02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:24.580
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is a place to send us an email, and we read your emails here

02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:29.380
on the show. Usually DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and reads some of her favorite emails,

02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:35.540
but since she's not here, the task has fallen to me, and we have four emails tonight. But,

02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:38.580
look, you gotta respond to these two. Without DarkSakura here, I'm gonna need your help,

02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:42.740
all right? So, let's start with this first email, which comes from our pal, Critical Myth,

02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:47.700
one of the hosts, and I suppose the namesake of sorts behind the Critical Myth podcast,

02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:51.460
which airs Monday, Wednesday, Fridays at the Voice of the East Network, vognetwork.com.

02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:56.740
John from Critical Myth writes us and says, hey, OLR crew, I was listening to the commentary on

02:00:56.740 --> 02:01:00.660
Ubisoft's fumble over the multiplayer co-op in Assassin's Creed Unity, and as a huge fan

02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:05.140
of the franchise, a few statements were made that I think were unfair or uninformed. First, Rob,

02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:09.060
at one point, you mentioned that the defense given in the written statement smacked of the,

02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:13.940
quote, I have a black friend trope. What maybe isn't apparent is that the statement made by

02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:17.700
Ubisoft is practically word for word the disclaimer presented at the start of every

02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:22.020
Assassin's Creed game. It was originally required because the first game is, after all,

02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:26.100
about Middle Eastern Arabs fighting and killing Christian Templars, and there was a bit of

02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:31.780
controversy over that at the time. In the larger context, who do we have as playable lead characters?

02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:38.340
Altair, Ezio, Connor, Aveline, Edward, Adewell, Arno, and Desmond. So, five out of eight are

02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:43.300
persons of color, or at least of prominently non-European descent. I don't think token

02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:47.460
representation is really an issue, especially when distinct cultural backgrounds are inherent

02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:52.100
to the plot and character development in the games they headline. I have a feeling, and I gotta

02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:55.460
go back to what I said last week, so I'm gonna be honest, I don't even remember, but I have a

02:01:55.460 --> 02:02:00.660
feeling I wasn't trying to say that as a direct thing. I was trying to kind of say it as a

02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:06.900
comparison, but I did neglect the fact that this is a standard disclaimer that they've been using

02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:11.700
for a long time about the whole thing, but I'm sorry, that disclaimer doesn't really get them

02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:17.300
out of the hot water of the statement that they made about, you know, essentially it's too hard

02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:23.140
to put a woman in a video game, which is what it came off as. Whether they have this history or not,

02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:28.580
you know, perception is a huge chunk of it, right? And the way the message is delivered,

02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:34.580
and unfortunately the way Ubisoft's line came out was, you know, that, oh, we just, you know,

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:39.620
we don't really have time for women. That's how it came across. You know what it really is? It's

02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:47.380
just the AI so good, this is gonna be totally gender... whatever. I don't care. It's very

02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:52.020
inappropriate of me to say this, but anyways, um, yeah, me of course. Well, let's be real,

02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:55.540
it won't be the first inappropriate thing you say on the show, so enjoy it while Jamie talks.

02:02:55.540 --> 02:03:01.140
The AI is so good, it's just, she can't decide what to wear before she goes out and, you know,

02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:06.340
and assassinate people, and so unfortunately they just, they can't get the character out there.

02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:09.460
You're only saying this because you know if Dark Sakura were here, she'd chuck her

02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:14.340
shoe at you right now, and luckily she ain't here to kick your butt, so all right.

02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:19.060
And it's, it's only mildly funny, but no, seriously, it's just, they just made excuses.

02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:22.900
All right, at least you admit it's a cheap joke. All right, uh, okay, let's go back to the email

02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:27.460
here, uh, which brings me to my second point. When Aveline was mentioned as headlining

02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:32.020
Assassin's Creed Liberation, Jamie quickly dismissed her as, quote, token female character.

02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:36.500
This is gross misrepresentation of the situation. Aveline was the lead character in what was

02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:41.220
intended to be a triple-A flagship title for the Vita, a game that received significant promotion.

02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:45.540
The entire game was centered around a woman of mixed heritage living in colonial New Orleans.

02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:50.100
That's about as far from a, quote, token female character as it gets. In fact, it aligns far more

02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:54.180
with the positive elements you cited for Tomb Raider. What might not be apparent to those who

02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:58.420
didn't play the games or follow the franchise is that players were able to choose female character

02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:03.140
models for multiplayer from the start. Even before that, one could recruit both male and

02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:08.180
female assassins to join the, quote, brotherhood. The intense criticisms of Ubisoft come not from

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:13.220
the standpoint of, here we go again, but rather, why is this an issue now? It runs counter to the

02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:18.420
past several years or games of the franchise. I understand that, and I respect that, but I,

02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:21.860
I think, and Jamie's not here to really respond to this, unfortunately, so I'm gonna have to take

02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:28.900
my best guess and try to interpret her point here, but I don't think it was necessary that,

02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:35.620
necessarily, that Aveline was a token female character in that game, but when they were using

02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:41.460
her as the defense, she suddenly felt like the token female character, because like, oh, oh,

02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:45.780
oh, but, but here, look, look at this over here, over here in this completely different game in

02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:51.620
the franchise. We did this, this whole other thing, but that still doesn't explain why you

02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:59.060
said it would take all this money to create female in co-op mode and, and all the, the clothes and

02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:04.820
all this stuff, yet Sunset Overdrive shades you in literally less than a week after E3. You know

02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:09.220
what I mean? It's just that's, that's the disconnect. And if we're going to do like,

02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:13.940
oh, well, it's motion capping and stuff like that. There's a pretty interesting movement going on in

02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:20.500
Sunset Overdrive. So, I don't know. Uh, on another topic, I would agree. Well,

02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:24.500
before we get to the other topic, I just want to say, you know, I, I hope even though we're

02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:28.980
continuing a debate here, I totally respect your viewpoint. And I understand there's a lot of fans

02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:34.740
of the Assassin's Creed series who are very frustrated by what's going on, but I'm not sure

02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:41.060
that's as much about the game itself as it is a commentary on the industry, because like I said,

02:05:41.060 --> 02:05:47.060
this whole dam has been waiting to burst. And unfortunately it took this pull quote and this

02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:50.820
circumstance for this. Oh, I shouldn't say unfortunately, because this needed to happen.

02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:55.780
It's just, if you're sitting in Ubisoft shoes or you're an Assassin's Creed fan right now,

02:05:55.780 --> 02:06:00.420
it's kind of unfortunate. I will say this. I saw a demo of the game at E3 and it looks pretty

02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:04.980
darn good. I don't usually super get into these Assassin's Creed games, but Assassin's Creed

02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:08.260
Unity looked like it might be pretty sweet and some of the co-op stuff. Yeah, it looks pretty

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:13.460
cool, but I can also see how it's frustrating where like, you know, if you're a female gamer

02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:19.140
that was hoping to be the female slashing people up, it's not there for you. And their reason why

02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:24.820
is kind of crappy. But anyway, I just want to say, I, I, I do respect the opinion and I understand

02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:29.460
why Assassin's Creed's, uh, fan base is probably a little frustrated at why is this happening to

02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:35.300
my franchise? Why did you have to open your mouth? All right. On another topic, I would agree that

02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:39.620
Nintendo came out strong this E3. What I find regrettable is that many of the games sound great,

02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:43.300
especially the new Zelda, but then I remember that I would have to deal with those awful Wii

02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:48.100
controllers and my interest takes a nosedive. If the games were fully playable using classic

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:52.660
controllers versus the game pad motion control nonsense, I'd be far more inclined to take the

02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:58.100
plunge. I think at least Smash Brothers, I mean, you can do the GameCube controller and all that,

02:06:58.100 --> 02:07:03.380
but as far as Zelda goes, they have like a Wii U pro controller that they sell and a lot of Nintendo's

02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:07.860
first party games, which is pretty much all that's on the Wii U supports that. Yeah. I think that

02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:11.540
would probably be more of a tradition, especially because if they're going to be using the game pad,

02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:16.420
it's gonna, it's gonna use that. They're not going to be using the Wii remote. They may have a mode

02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:20.420
if you want to do Wii remote and nunchuck, but I think it's probably going to be Mario Kart 8. You

02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:25.860
can do Wii remote nunchuck. Yeah. So I will say this. I mean, I, you know, everybody has their

02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:30.420
own opinion or whatever. I don't think the game pads as bad as a lot of people think it is. I

02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:35.300
mean, yeah, it's big, but when I'm holding it, it actually feels really comfortable. I prefer it

02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:40.100
to an Xbox 360 controller. That's for sure. That's the one I can't stand is a 360 controller. At

02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:46.980
least the D pad on the game pad works. Anyway, uh, one last thing I thought everyone knew that

02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:52.340
Rob's real name is Danny Fantastico. How dare you? How dare you out me on the show? All right,

02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:56.900
here it is. John from Critical Myth, uh, sending us that first email. Let's get to the next email,

02:07:56.900 --> 02:08:03.220
which the subject line is yo, which I can't help but think of that app that everybody's talking

02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:08.740
about this week. If you heard about the yo app, all you do is you said you said yo's to friends.

02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:16.580
So it just pops up on the phone. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Wow. That's like only, only like a couple

02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:23.300
decades away from was it? It is serious. It's like the flappy bird of social networking apps

02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:29.540
right now. It's like, why out of all of the social network apps is this one? The one everybody's

02:08:29.540 --> 02:08:36.100
talking about is it's stupid. And with all due respect to the creator of flappy bird,

02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:39.620
who I admire being just one person, but it's still like, why out of all the games

02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:47.060
on the marketplace are we fucking fixated on flappy bird? I don't know. All right. Anyhow,

02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:52.260
uh, this email is actually from serious turtle who sent us the subject of yo who says, I want

02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:57.140
to bring up two things. First, Jamie, good old games just had to the moon on sale for a dollar

02:08:57.140 --> 02:09:02.660
99. I bought it solely on your strong recommendation and I need another game to make me cry.

02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:07.540
I don't play too many eight bit RPGs. So that's a testament to how convincing your sales pitch was.

02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:11.540
I'll let you know what I think when I play a few hours, we'll wait, we'll wait for the followup,

02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:15.700
which good thing there'll be a followup cause Jamie's not here tonight. And secondly, I wanted

02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:20.260
to let Shane know who also isn't here. Maybe he'll hear me. Maybe he's listening to the show. I don't

02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:24.900
know. But a serious turtle said, I want to let Shane know that I'm playing Pokemon X. This is

02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:29.780
my first Pokemon game ever. And it definitely took me four to five hours to start to get into it.

02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:34.340
But now that I'm 12 hours in, I'm really enjoying it. And even though Shane sounds like Eeyore from

02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:41.700
Winnie the Pooh, maybe it's a good thing he's not in the room. I still thought that he might crack

02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:47.300
a smile at a Pokemon noob joining the ranks as always love the show and depend on your Monday

02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:54.020
podcast to start my week off right. Well, no pressure. Your loyal turtle in Philly, serious

02:09:54.020 --> 02:10:03.060
turtle. No pressure. I depend on your podcast. No weeks off for me. You better have a game plan

02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:12.020
come July. You better take the day off. All right. Next question from EA Skizy, who is taking the

02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:16.660
opportunity to turn our mailbag segment into like Ask Orange Lounge every week with his questions.

02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:22.500
But you know, I put the mailbag out there for everybody. And if Skizy is going to be one of

02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:28.500
four people. Oh no, Shane's listening to the show. Uh oh. Come here, Shane. Come here, come here.

02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:33.220
Shane just burst into the room saying, I do not sound like Eeyore. Did you hear that email?

02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:39.460
Yes. And what would you like to say to the Pokemon noob who got into Pokemon X,

02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:43.300
even though he called you Eeyore? Congratulations. And you're an idiot.

02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:53.380
Could the mic pick that up when he literally came in the kitchen and screamed, I'm not Eeyore.

02:10:53.380 --> 02:10:56.020
I don't know. I guess we'll find out. I guess we'll find out.

02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:01.860
All right. Anyhow, back to EA. The chat room's cracking up. All right.

02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:10.180
On to EA Skizy's email who says, hello, Orange Lounge guys and gal. If you could commit just

02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:16.260
one crime free of punishment, no matter the severity of the crime, what would it be and why?

02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:21.940
Jamie isn't allowed to rob any taco stands because seriously, those guys are working hard. They don't

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:27.300
need that. Come on. Take it easy people. EA Skizy from Milwaukee. And they, by the way, they do say

02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:31.940
they did hear Shane yelling all the way over there on the stream. All right. There you go. Live radio.

02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:37.220
It's hilarious. Back to, um, back to Skizy's question. Uh, what is the one crime you would

02:11:37.220 --> 02:11:41.780
do if free of punishment? Well, sadly, Jamie's not here to say how she would rob a taco stand,

02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:45.220
but, uh, I'll ask Loki. What would you, what would you, what would be your crime

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:48.340
free of punishment? Oh, something that gives me a lot of money, I guess.

02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:52.500
That's funny. Cause that's where my mind was. That is. I think the crime I would commit is

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:57.220
robbing a bank. I wouldn't hurt anybody. I wouldn't hurt anybody. I just, I just want

02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:03.300
the money. Thanks. You said free of punishment, right? I wouldn't even rob a bank, rob like the

02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:08.980
mint or something or like, you know, somehow get all the money that Comcast makes in a year or

02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:12.740
something. I don't know. Just, well, I also, I don't know. I guess I really have to give this

02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:17.540
more thought because like I wouldn't want to take money from people. I want money that insurance

02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:21.780
will reimburse or something where the money doesn't directly come out of, you know, people's

02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:27.060
accounts. I got it. I got a crime. That'd be perfect. Michael Bay direct the next star Wars

02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:36.500
film. There you go. There's a crime. That's the crime you commit of all the crimes.

02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:41.780
That'd be hilarious. Just like, let me cast, let me like write the script or whatever for the next

02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:48.020
star Wars film. It won't make any fucking sense at all. It'll be awesome. No, I don't know. Money,

02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:53.140
of course. Cause you know. You have to remember guys, I'm coming off a 13 episode marathon of

02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:58.020
orange is the new black. I'm afraid to commit a crime right now. All right. I am not going to

02:12:58.020 --> 02:13:03.860
prison ever cause they'd be crazy in prison. And I realized that was a woman's prison, but

02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:07.780
you know, men have just as much drama. If not more, I wonder if there'll be a spinoff series.

02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:17.460
All right. Anyway. Well, they, they had men in the first part of it was spoilers. OMG.

02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:24.500
I think the first episode of season two. All right. No, he didn't spoil anything. Don't worry.

02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:31.300
All right. Uh, last email tonight from dr. Noir who emails us, uh, uh, entitled gaming in Belgium.

02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:37.300
Hmm. Uh, I'm going to totally mispronounce this first sentence. Uh, because that's what

02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:43.300
happens when you send me, uh, non English words to open your emails, but born that night,

02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:50.100
madam at Mrs. Day orange lounge. Greetings from your globe trotting correspondent, dr. Noir.

02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:54.740
I just spent the last week in Brussels and I have to say, I am surprised by the absence of video

02:13:54.740 --> 02:14:00.660
games in the country. I was at first encouraged by the presence of niche of PS four. Don't worry.

02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:05.460
They'll sprout up there eventually. PS four and Vita kiosks at the airport when I arrived,

02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:11.780
but if since to find so not so much as a poster or advert for any sort of video game during my stay,

02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:17.540
not on TV print or billboards on the streets. This is surprising because even though I am,

02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:22.260
my travels often take me to business settings in much of Latin America and I don't do too much

02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:27.300
tourist exploring. I usually find some sort of video game shop at a mall or even a mom and pop

02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:33.540
store peddling use games here and there here. Zero zip nada. I wonder if this is just a fluke

02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:37.380
since I spent most of my time in the business and museum sectors, but I did go into one of the

02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:42.340
shopping districts and take the subway and buses several times and I usually see at least a poster

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:46.900
or billboard there. Hopefully some of the local Belgian listeners can confirm. Yeah, we, I,

02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:51.140
there's been at least two people from Belgium who have emailed us before, so maybe they can

02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:55.060
give perspective. Where are you hiding? Where are you all hiding? Is there, is there like a club

02:14:55.060 --> 02:15:00.180
that you have to be in over there to find all the cool gaming stuff? I don't know. Anyway,

02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:04.660
Dr. Noir continues, in any case, what I did find is a good number of board games and even managed

02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:09.140
to pick up a variation on the standard memory games for my kids, which should provide lots of

02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:14.020
fun. It's called Shadow Monsters and the twist is that it includes three pairs of scary monsters in

02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:19.220
the deck and if any of them come up and you do not match them, hijinks ensue. One of them has,

02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:24.340
you pass your one stack to the right, another to the left, and the last, my favorite, shuffles the

02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:29.460
remaining tiles in play. Also, the game matches the monster's image with their shadow, so it

02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:36.020
makes the memorization a bit more difficult and suitable for adults or older kids. I also snagged

02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:40.260
a bunch of lead figures of Roman medieval and renaissance soldiers that will see great use in

02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:46.020
my D&D games in the near future. Anyhow, I should get to my gate now, so here's to, here's a salute

02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:53.140
before 10 hours of flight time. Have a great week. Well, interesting. You know, and, and we talk

02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:56.500
about that here on the show is that, you know, we're in a very interesting perspective with this

02:15:56.500 --> 02:16:02.900
podcasting and radio or on the internet. You know, a lot of radio up until, you know, internet radio

02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:08.100
was born was confined to local news and local things, you know, but now that we have the, the

02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:12.900
power to reach the world, we really have to be mindful sometimes is that, you know, gaming in

02:16:12.900 --> 02:16:17.860
different parts of the world is so different than what it is here. So, so different and granted,

02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:22.580
although Dr. Noir, I mean, I would bet that, you know, these, our other Belgian listeners are going

02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:26.260
to email us and just be all, he was just in the wrong place. It's everywhere. It's here and here

02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:30.260
and here. And you just, you just didn't see it, you know, that type of thing, but still, you know,

02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:34.660
in other countries, you know, it's very different, you know, the types of systems that are popular,

02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:39.700
the PlayStation 4, the Xbox one, they're not out everywhere. We know how Japan feels about

02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:43.940
Microsoft's products and we'll see if history is going to continue or what have you, you know,

02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:49.620
it's very different. It would be nice to see them do okay, you know, in Japan stuff. I mean,

02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:56.020
they can't, you can't fail like completely every time and they got to, you got to have a comeback

02:16:56.020 --> 02:17:01.140
at some point, you would think. All right, well, that was it for the mailbag. If you want to

02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:05.300
participate with the mailbag segment in a future week, send an email to participate

02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:12.820
at orange lounge radio.com. Let's get into the FUs of the week and get out whatever angst we

02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:16.020
might have tonight.

02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:35.140
I'll start tonight cause rage nator and chat says, guy, your French needs work, dude. F you to rage

02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:40.900
nator. I didn't ask to speak French on the show. It was emailed. So out of respect to the listeners,

02:17:40.900 --> 02:17:49.860
I gave it my best shot. Never had a lesson. No, I didn't. I sure did. Maybe, maybe I could learn

02:17:49.860 --> 02:17:54.100
a thing or two playing assassin's creed unity or something since it's in France. Uh, anyway,

02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:59.620
in all seriousness, uh, F you the week goes to, um, I don't know. I actually don't,

02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:04.260
I don't have a whole lot of FUs things to be angsty about. Cause, um, there's a lot of good

02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:10.340
stuff coming up with days off work and stuff. So F you to just all the busy-ness that's happening

02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:19.060
before two back to back long weekends. Yeah. Busy calendar. Loki. Um, just F you to, you know,

02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:23.620
game development stuff taking three times as long as it normally, you know, you think it would.

02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:26.980
And I'm kind of used to that now. Cause that seems to be everything, you know, everything I

02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:32.260
think that we get done at a certain time, it takes about three times as long because unforeseen

02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:38.980
problems, you know, arise and that kind of thing. I just want to get to non game engine stuff. Not

02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:44.740
that it's not fun. It's just, uh, it'd be nice to build a show a little bit more like, you know,

02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:48.180
I can't really make a video of what I'm doing now because it's completely boring. You know,

02:18:48.180 --> 02:18:53.060
no one is a shit about, Oh, Hey look, you can fix your UV coordinates. Yeah. I'm excited about it

02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:58.740
because I fixed my UV coordinates. You see, you see the big picture. Yeah. So I don't know. All

02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:02.420
right. Just a couple more stories for you guys. And then, uh, we're going to get to the Skype line

02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:07.060
at one eight seven seven Gamebo LR or username on Skype, orange lounge radio. But first Loki.

02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:13.620
And speaking of unity, um, unity has officially come to PlayStation mobile. So if you, um,

02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:22.660
download the newest version of unity, which is like 4.6, 4.5, I think it's 4.5 something. Cause

02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:27.460
4.6 is not yet. Cause 4.6 is the one I'm waiting for. That's the one that has the revamped, uh,

02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:31.620
GUI, uh, infrastructure. So you can actually make menus and stuff cause right now it's a piece of

02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:39.860
shit. Um, but the new version, um, actually has unity for, um, PlayStation mobile and allows you

02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:46.740
to create, um, you know, games for that platform as well as easily port stuff from iPhone, iPad,

02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:52.340
Android devices to PlayStation mobile as well. And it allows you to kind of to publish on the

02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:57.140
Vita platform. Although if you're looking to publish on the actual PlayStation Vita,

02:19:57.140 --> 02:20:03.540
like as part of their store, I think you got to get permission from, um, Sony for that. But to

02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:09.060
get access to be able to, um, output to PlayStation mobile, you actually have to go to the PlayStation

02:20:09.060 --> 02:20:17.220
mobile website. So psm.playsation.net slash portal. And, uh, once you go there, you sign up

02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:23.860
and you get a link to download the version of unity that supports that. So that's pretty cool.

02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:29.860
And shit right now they, I think, you know, I saw a little bit of the next beta, but I think

02:20:29.860 --> 02:20:35.220
we support almost every single console platform right now on PC and stuff. So it's a pretty

02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:40.580
exciting. So once I do get to that point where I'm actually publishing something, maybe I will

02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:45.940
publish it on, it would be cool to see my game on a, on a Vita. I would be totally stoked by that.

02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:51.380
So, um, one of the reasons why I chose you in the first place. So very excited.

02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:56.340
All right. What platforms will your game be coming out on?

02:20:57.300 --> 02:21:03.780
Um, well, PC for sure. And then the rest is just kind of whatever you can get, right?

02:21:03.780 --> 02:21:10.340
Well, um, like it's gonna, I've been trying to keep everything very simple for like mobile. I

02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:15.140
don't know if it's gonna, when it's done, I don't know how it's gonna run as far as mobile goes,

02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:20.420
but I've been trying to keep everything very optimized. Um, so it's just gonna be testing

02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:24.340
to see, you know, I don't even know if it's the type of game that would work well with mobile, but

02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:29.140
I don't know. Consoles would be cool if I could do that. I just don't know what's involved with

02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:36.500
like publishing to, you know, Wii U or, um, to the Vita. I mean, obviously PlayStation, um,

02:21:37.380 --> 02:21:41.860
you know, mobile's a little different, but it's not as easy to find stuff. I don't know,

02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:45.620
it'd be interesting just to check it out. I seriously am probably going to run a Kickstarter

02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:50.580
campaign at some point, but the thing is though, is if I'm going to do that, I want the game to be

02:21:50.580 --> 02:21:56.340
fucking done or at least very, very, very, very, very extremely close to being done. Not this,

02:21:56.340 --> 02:22:01.940
Oh, Hey, look, I got playable levels. Give me money. Cause you don't, I just don't, I don't

02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:07.620
trust myself, you know, to, you know, but, uh, it would be, it's good for getting exposure out

02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:11.780
there for your game. And also it helps with like the green light process and stuff like that to

02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:17.140
get people excited about something. All right. Well, something, uh, some folks might be getting

02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:22.500
excited about is a new movie that's coming out all about video games. It's called video games,

02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:25.540
the movie, which was, uh, the result of a crowdfunding campaign. Actually,

02:22:25.540 --> 02:22:30.580
speaking of all that stuff, it will be released at theaters in North America on July 18th,

02:22:30.580 --> 02:22:35.460
but I wouldn't really expect it to see in every Cineplex across America. Um, but, uh,

02:22:35.940 --> 02:22:41.540
before the film is in theaters, the initial debut will be on July 15th via an iTunes exclusive

02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:45.380
release, which there's been a few movies recently that kind of dabbled in that. So I think it's

02:22:45.380 --> 02:22:50.740
been kind of successful. Um, the movie is narrated by Sean Astin, who is one of the Goonies, uh,

02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:55.860
also in the Lord of the Rings movies. Right. So he's done a few things there. Um, he, in the

02:22:55.860 --> 02:22:59.860
movie, it will be documenting the rise of the games industry from when it was, you know, just

02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:05.380
the little pixels on the screen to basically the gigantic, bigger than bigger budgets than movies.

02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:11.060
They are today, uh, variants film president Dylan Marchetti in a statement said, quote,

02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:14.900
everybody loves a great video game. In recent years, they've evolved into something way beyond

02:23:14.900 --> 02:23:18.980
what any of us who grew up playing an eight bit system could imagine. But regardless of whether

02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:23.700
you're up gaming until 3 AM or haven't played a video game in decades, there's something for you

02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:28.100
in this film. And we think audiences will be delighted. Well, we'll see how well this does

02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:34.100
when it comes out in about a month. So, all right, by the way, there's, uh, some other people,

02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:37.140
I should mention some of the other people in this game. The film was also produced by Cliff

02:23:37.140 --> 02:23:42.420
Pizinski, Cliffy B. Right. Uh, some of the people that are in the game, Zach Braff, Chris Hardwick,

02:23:42.420 --> 02:23:49.380
Wil Wheaton, Nolan Bushnell, Hideo Kojima, and, uh, Alison, Alison Haslis. Sorry. I always say

02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:53.540
her last name wrong. Sorry about that. But, uh, yep. There you go. Some of the people to, uh,

02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:59.220
expect in the movie. All right. That's it. We're done. We got through all the news.

02:23:59.220 --> 02:24:03.940
So it's your turn. We're open up the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype,

02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:10.420
Orange Lounge Radio. If you'd like to give us a call, uh, we will take your call and we'll leave

02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:14.260
the Skype line open for a little bit just to see if anybody's going to get through. Uh, in the

02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:18.100
meantime, while we wait for some calls, I don't know if Loki has any last minute stories. I think

02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:23.140
I have a couple Twitter topics I can pull up. I do have one thing. Uh, apparently the, uh,

02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:27.780
Dropbox account for CD Projekt Red was accidentally turned public,

02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:32.820
um, for a little bit. And, or it was, I think it was Dropbox or Google Drive or something like

02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:39.060
that. And people are able to grab the, um, uh, what was it? The build documents for,

02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:45.220
uh, Witcher 3, including all the spoilers and everything. So watch yourself out there.

02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:50.100
Don't spoil or don't, uh, check out those spoilers. If you're trying to actually save,

02:24:50.100 --> 02:24:53.300
you know, I wonder if they'll change it. The game's not due till early next year.

02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:56.740
I wonder if they'll go back and change some key things. I doubt it. It might be too late to do

02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:00.180
that. I don't know, but I'm sure some of the stuff will change because it's just a design doc, but,

02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:08.420
um, uh, I want to say someone said 36 endings. So I don't know. All right, let's go to the phones.

02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:11.380
We do have calls coming in, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:16.660
Legend of Zaku here. Hey, Zaku. How you doing, buddy? Uh, nothing much. Just killing,

02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:22.660
just killing a Sunday evening trying to, you know, uh, dull the loss. Well, not even loss,

02:25:22.660 --> 02:25:28.980
but just like last minute draw of, uh, that soccer game. Yeah. You know, I don't do a lot of, well,

02:25:28.980 --> 02:25:32.820
it's funny when I was younger, actually I played soccer for like five years when I was younger,

02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:36.420
if you can believe it, when I was in like grade school or whatever, but nowadays the only soccer

02:25:36.420 --> 02:25:43.620
I know is Mega Man. Yep. Well that, and right now I'm like, uh, playing flight simulator, trying to,

02:25:43.620 --> 02:25:49.140
you know, land, well, actually taxi a plane back to the gate. Do you get into a lot of

02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:52.820
those simulator games? Is it just flight simulator or do you like to play like farm simulator and,

02:25:52.820 --> 02:25:59.220
and Europe flight simulator? As you can see, I bought myself a little choice, you know,

02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:04.020
little messy. He's showing us on webcam, by the way, you have a messy desk, young man.

02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:11.380
Yeah. I managed to put the plane on the ground without killing people. All right. Well,

02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:14.980
congrats on safely landing the plane. Do you have aspirations to fly in real life

02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:21.460
or is it just now just, just for games? What do you have aspirations to fly like IRL like

02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:25.540
in real life or now just, just computer simulations? It's just one of those things

02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:30.820
I've, you know, put off for so many years until I went to Micro Center one day and I saw for 30

02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:35.940
bucks. I said, what the hell? I just, you know, I bought it, bought, you know, went to Best Buy to

02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:42.180
get a cheap, uh, flight stick. And then that, you know, and then from there it's been snowballing.

02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:44.660
Well, you're not the, you're not the only one that feels that way because you don't

02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:48.660
our chat room over at live dot com says flight SIM 10 is the best. I still play it.

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:54.420
Yeah. I just, uh, I mean, I'm lucky. I still had, they still had box copies over there.

02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:57.540
Well, what's on your mind. Did you, did you want to talk to us about flight Sims or was

02:26:57.540 --> 02:27:02.100
something else on your mind tonight? I guess, uh, mostly, um, the whole,

02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:08.260
I guess we'll see about E3 and how, you know, because I've been out of the loop for a while

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:15.380
and the fact that, um, a lot of games such as, uh, Kingdom Hearts three, very tight-lipped

02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:21.860
to the point where, you know, they're really not, they really have a story down, but whether or not

02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:26.500
Disney will actually let them use some of the more recently acquired properties just in time to make

02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:34.260
whatever deadline they have set forth for the game, it's yet to be seen. Like if, you know,

02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:40.420
possibility, like even the creator of Kingdom Hearts was, was stating that he would love to

02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:45.380
only if he was able to like whether or not Disney's, uh, willing to license anything

02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:49.620
in the realm of Marvel and, or Lucas or such a thing.

02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:54.580
I would love to see something like that come to fruition as I think a lot of people would,

02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:58.660
but yeah, it just, especially with the Star Wars stuff, you know, Star Wars kind of has its own

02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:02.420
video games and so does the Marvels. So I don't know, but then again, so there's tons of other

02:28:02.420 --> 02:28:06.980
types of Disney games. So I don't think anything's necessarily off the table. Um, I would think though

02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:10.580
that the creators of Kingdom Hearts kind of already know where they're going with the story

02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:15.620
and have kind of already planned out what worlds are included, but it's not like they can't, um,

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:20.740
they don't have access to rather like some of the Disney stuff that is coming out in the future.

02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:26.340
I mean, Disney has their movies planned through like, I'm sure 2018 or 2019 at this point.

02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:29.540
I would imagine they would have like a long-term roadmap.

02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:34.420
So I imagine, you know, uh, the folks at Square get privy to some of that information

02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:40.580
because like I think about like Tron, uh, not just the Tron, the 1985 Tron, but Tron Legacy

02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:45.540
was in the 3DS Tron game and that wasn't that long after the movie. So it's like, you know, it's,

02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:48.420
it is possible to get the newer stuff in there, even though the games might have

02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:49.460
a long development time.

02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:55.540
You think also, uh, then you also run the risk of a scope creep and then whether or

02:28:55.540 --> 02:29:01.940
not you're able to punt the release date further, even though you're aiming for quality,

02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:04.900
you pretty much, uh, you might get carried away.

02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:09.460
Honestly though, Zaku, I think when it comes to these games, I think we'll be

02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:15.540
lucky. We'll be very lucky if Final Fantasy 15 is next year. I honestly think at this point,

02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:20.420
I'm thinking more like March, April, 2016, like in time for the end of the fiscal year.

02:29:20.420 --> 02:29:24.900
I think that's when you're going to get a Final Fantasy 15. And honestly, Kingdom Hearts 3,

02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:29.780
not tell well after that. And like, I'm, I'm talking like 2017.

02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:34.900
I mean, so far, sure. They even have demo footage right now.

02:29:36.180 --> 02:29:37.380
But is it playing?

02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:44.900
You know, completely knowing that Tokyo Game Show is like only a few months away.

02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:51.700
And, um, hopefully if anything, because the fact that Squeenix really didn't put out as

02:29:51.700 --> 02:29:58.340
much for E3, because they're really not at a point to actually, uh, divulge any of it.

02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:02.980
Hence the reason why they're trying to spread most of the news regarding, you know,

02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:05.780
Kingdom Hearts and whatever other game they're going to come out.

02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:09.620
Don't get me wrong, Zaku, I would love to be wrong on that, but it's just kind of like,

02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:12.980
you know, these games take forever to develop and Final Fantasy 15,

02:30:12.980 --> 02:30:17.940
didn't, I mean, it's been in development since it was 13, uh, side story, whatever it was called.

02:30:18.820 --> 02:30:20.260
Loki, what do you want to say on that?

02:30:20.260 --> 02:30:23.540
I don't think, uh, I think Final Fantasy 15 would probably be,

02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:28.020
um, maybe, I think it's gonna be next year sometime,

02:30:28.020 --> 02:30:30.660
because they've already had tons of footage of it and stuff.

02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:33.380
Kingdom Hearts 3 though, there's hardly been anything for it,

02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:37.380
and I'm guessing we'll maybe see like a better reveal at Tokyo Game Show,

02:30:37.380 --> 02:30:39.860
but I would say maybe spring 2016.

02:30:40.740 --> 02:30:44.340
Yeah, yeah, that, well, as I said, it really depends on how far

02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:50.180
long they've gone in the process, whether or not A, they managed to make any, any front,

02:30:50.180 --> 02:30:52.740
you know, any progress on the actual development, and B,

02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:56.260
whether or not they have all the voice talents marshaled up and written scheduled.

02:30:56.260 --> 02:30:57.300
It's all speculation.

02:30:57.300 --> 02:31:01.940
One half is getting the game, you know, built out with all the assets and code.

02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:06.340
The other half, and the more important half, is essentially the acting.

02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:11.140
The fact that if they did decide to, you know, to go big and do like,

02:31:11.780 --> 02:31:14.740
you know, Star Wars or anything Marvel related,

02:31:14.740 --> 02:31:18.820
they have, they would have to at least schedule that well in advance.

02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:21.940
Like if they pulled the trigger on this, knowing that they,

02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:25.700
that Disney pretty much gave them the permit, you know, authorization to do it,

02:31:26.580 --> 02:31:30.660
then yeah, they would, you know, assuming they got,

02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:35.220
you know, assuming they got it a lot, a lot earlier than what we're anticipating,

02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:38.100
they might have everything ready to, you know,

02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:40.900
if they're running it concurrently, they might have everything.

02:31:40.900 --> 02:31:44.580
I do think though, Zaku, I think you're onto something when you say the Tokyo Game

02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:46.100
Show is probably going to show us a little more.

02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:49.940
I kind of expect that would be, you know, when we'll get an update, if nothing else,

02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:51.620
on at least 15.

02:31:51.620 --> 02:31:54.740
I don't necessarily know if Kingdom Hearts 3, they'll say much more on it.

02:31:54.740 --> 02:31:58.180
I mean, maybe just little sprinklings, maybe a new trailer or something like that,

02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:01.060
but I still kind of think they're pushing the 2.5 remix.

02:32:01.540 --> 02:32:08.900
So I bet at Tokyo Game Show, they give away that there's like a trailer

02:32:08.900 --> 02:32:11.220
for the third game when you beat 2.5 remixers.

02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:13.220
But see, that's the thing with 2.5 remixes.

02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:17.940
I think when they're putting that out now, that the timing of that says that

02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:21.860
three's not too far behind, because it wouldn't make sense to me to put it out

02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:25.700
that far away from three, because they've been doing one each year,

02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:28.100
and that makes you think, well, maybe it's going to be next year.

02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:30.660
But I think it's still too...

02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:36.980
Keep in mind, the remakes are essentially just mostly texture swaps,

02:32:36.980 --> 02:32:40.900
but more importantly, getting it to run on the PS3 architecture.

02:32:40.900 --> 02:32:46.340
But you're right, those take at least upwards to a year and a half of dev cycles.

02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:47.300
But either way...

02:32:47.300 --> 02:32:51.380
They're going to take you an entire year to understand anyway, so you know what?

02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:55.300
Either way, TGS or hell, even PAX East.

02:32:55.540 --> 02:33:00.100
Squeenix has, out of all the other developers aside from Ubisoft and Microsoft,

02:33:00.100 --> 02:33:02.580
Squeenix still has some sort of presence.

02:33:02.580 --> 02:33:05.940
That's whether or not they'll probably be the biggest ones.

02:33:05.940 --> 02:33:10.020
I still think PAX is really their time to push the MMOs too, though.

02:33:10.020 --> 02:33:11.060
Like 14, I think.

02:33:11.060 --> 02:33:13.700
Because you know there'll be an expansion to support for that.

02:33:13.700 --> 02:33:15.220
I kind of see that as a factor.

02:33:15.220 --> 02:33:18.660
They're probably going to push them 2.5 remix.

02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:20.500
And then they're going to save three.

02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:24.180
They're going to start teasing a lot more three in TGS.

02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:26.820
And hopefully PAX East.

02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:28.260
I'm thinking PAX East.

02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:31.700
I don't know, it's kind of like a far-fetched, wily-eyed idea.

02:33:31.700 --> 02:33:36.260
But think about the fact that there's not that many larger game devs in PAX East anymore.

02:33:36.260 --> 02:33:37.140
It's mostly indies.

02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:43.460
And you know, to a point, with the Squeenix being one of the very few,

02:33:44.420 --> 02:33:47.220
who knows how much more space they might give them,

02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:49.540
especially if they have something exclusive like Kingdom Hearts.

02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:50.660
Who knows, Zaku?

02:33:50.660 --> 02:33:51.220
Who knows?

02:33:51.220 --> 02:33:54.820
Because we could speculate for another four hours, I'm sure.

02:33:54.820 --> 02:33:56.820
But Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.

02:33:56.820 --> 02:33:57.460
Thanks for the call.

02:33:57.460 --> 02:33:58.660
Have fun flying.

02:33:58.660 --> 02:33:59.460
Don't kill people.

02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:01.220
I landed, all right?

02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:02.580
Now I gotta shut off the engines.

02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:03.140
All right, bye.

02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:07.620
Don't hit the wrong switch and you know, collide the bla-

02:34:07.620 --> 02:34:10.340
You know, like accidentally you think the thing's in park and it's in drive

02:34:10.340 --> 02:34:11.780
and you just go, boom, right in the terminal.

02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:13.380
All right, anyhow.

02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:14.660
Let's get to some more calls.

02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:18.340
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:19.380
Let's go to another call.

02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:21.220
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:21.700
Who's this?

02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:25.940
I thought we had the call.

02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:27.140
Let me try that again.

02:34:27.140 --> 02:34:28.180
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:28.660
Who's this?

02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:32.020
Hi, this is Raging Eater.

02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:33.140
Hi, Raging Eater.

02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:33.940
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:39.940
Um, you know, one quick news story that wasn't covered in tonight's show.

02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:46.420
Although Bobby Blackwell did touch on it slightly, you know, during his show earlier tonight.

02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:48.340
What, you're trying to say he's better than us?

02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:49.620
Is that what you're trying to come out here and say?

02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:50.100
Oh, no.

02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:53.380
I did not see anyone's bearing on the show.

02:34:53.380 --> 02:34:55.780
I was just saying nobody wasn't covered.

02:34:55.780 --> 02:34:56.100
Uh-huh.

02:34:56.100 --> 02:34:57.300
Them's fighting words.

02:34:57.300 --> 02:34:57.620
Yeah.

02:34:57.620 --> 02:34:58.180
I'm just kidding.

02:34:58.180 --> 02:34:58.580
What's up?

02:34:58.580 --> 02:34:58.900
What's up?

02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:00.340
All right.

02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:08.500
As we have been rumbling and hearing rumblings for the past year or so that supposedly the

02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:18.660
Games for Windows was going to be, quote, unquote, shutting down July 1st of this year.

02:35:19.220 --> 02:35:23.540
And we already started to see how that happened, too.

02:35:23.540 --> 02:35:27.220
Certainly being where we are in place.

02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:36.660
But I looked to Bobby earlier tonight, basically saying, Microsoft is saying,

02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:42.100
we're not going to take down the servers for Games for Windows.

02:35:43.940 --> 02:35:49.860
So you can continue to download what you already bought, play your games, so on and so forth.

02:35:50.740 --> 02:35:56.420
And personally speaking, I'll say this.

02:35:56.420 --> 02:36:00.020
I didn't really like Games for Windows too much.

02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:04.180
But in a way, it's kind of a good thing to keep your service going.

02:36:05.060 --> 02:36:12.340
If only because there's some content that I did buy through Games for Windows before

02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:14.260
I jumped ship to Steam.

02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:28.420
Not only that, but even for those people that have long-term Steam users, there's probably

02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:30.900
some games that they've used for a long time.

02:36:31.620 --> 02:36:37.300
Users may have bought games for Windows in one capacity or another.

02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:48.020
For example, if you have the Lost Planet games, be it original or second one, or even

02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:55.940
Street Fighter Plus Tekken, all those games use Games for Windows, even though you may

02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:58.660
have bought them on Steam.

02:36:58.660 --> 02:37:04.180
It really seems to me like Microsoft is pretty much like they're just ending a lot of the

02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:05.780
support for Games for Windows Live.

02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:08.100
But they're kind of like, we're not going to unplug the computer.

02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:11.700
But when it stops working, there's not exactly going to be anybody here to fix it either.

02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:16.980
That's kind of the sense I get from the whole thing is that, okay, they're not pulling

02:37:16.980 --> 02:37:17.780
it down.

02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:20.980
But they're not really investing another dime in it.

02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:22.340
Yeah, true.

02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:30.020
Yeah, I mean, I'm the first to admit that Games for Windows in and of itself as a service

02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:34.660
kind of pales in comparison to Steam, quite likely.

02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:38.740
I think no one's going to argue any differently.

02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:43.460
You know, in Microsoft, oftentimes, it's not the first time, and they're not the first

02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:49.140
company to do this either, who sees a good idea, like a marketplace for games like that,

02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:51.700
and tries to build something their own and make it work.

02:37:51.700 --> 02:37:53.060
And it doesn't always work.

02:37:54.100 --> 02:37:59.060
I remember a time being a podcaster for so many years where Microsoft tried very hard

02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:01.300
to make Zune cast a thing.

02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:01.860
You remember that?

02:38:02.420 --> 02:38:03.140
Oh God.

02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:05.940
Or Major Nelson's blog cast.

02:38:05.940 --> 02:38:10.340
They refused to call it a podcast because they were trying to make the Zune thing like

02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:10.820
happen, right?

02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:12.100
Stop trying to make Zune happen.

02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:15.620
Speaking of which, my wife got a hand-me-down phone.

02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:16.820
It's a Windows phone.

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:19.700
What software do I have to use to put shit on the fucking phone?

02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:20.260
Zune.

02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:20.760
Zune.

02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:22.020
Fuck that.

02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:23.540
But here's the interesting thing.

02:38:23.540 --> 02:38:27.620
But you can sit here and point off all of Microsoft's failures, but sometimes they kind

02:38:27.620 --> 02:38:31.300
of take an idea and they do pretty well with it, like the Xbox.

02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:36.180
So, you know, sometimes it's just a matter of trying these different ideas till they

02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:37.060
get one that works.

02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:40.660
But at the end of the day, if it's not making money, if people aren't loving it, if people

02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:44.180
aren't using it, then you wave your white flag of surrender defeat.

02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:44.840
Yeah.

02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:49.540
Well, Peter does, in low-key kind of touch on it a little bit.

02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:52.980
Personally, I love the Zune.

02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:55.380
Not so much the hardware.

02:38:55.380 --> 02:39:04.260
I never owned the hardware itself, but I love the Zune software, you know, the software

02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:07.060
player in their marketplace.

02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:16.180
I used it all the time before they shut that down and went strictly Xbox, 360, one, and

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:17.780
Windows 8.

02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:22.740
But, you know, as a result, I had to switch over to iTunes.

02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:24.740
But that's just me.

02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:26.660
I'm probably the minority there.

02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:27.160
So.

02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:33.460
Well, you know, there's going to come a time when even Steam is going to be gone for the

02:39:33.460 --> 02:39:34.260
next big thing.

02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:36.980
You know, whatever is next in distribution.

02:39:36.980 --> 02:39:37.860
There will come a time.

02:39:37.860 --> 02:39:40.340
It's probably going to be a long ways away, but there will come a time, you know.

02:39:40.340 --> 02:39:44.020
What I don't get it, though, just seriously talking about the Windows Phone 7 here that

02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:44.980
my wife has.

02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:49.860
It uses a standard USB cable to connect to the computer, but I have to use a fucking

02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:52.100
program to put shit on it.

02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:56.100
Whereas an Android phone, I connect to it, and hey, look, it's a drive I can dump shit

02:39:56.100 --> 02:39:56.420
on.

02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:59.700
I don't have to fucking have, like, if I want to make a ringtone, I don't have to.

02:39:59.700 --> 02:40:00.820
It has to be 40 seconds.

02:40:00.820 --> 02:40:02.020
It has to be under a meg.

02:40:02.020 --> 02:40:06.100
You have to tag the genre as ringtone for this shit to pop up.

02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:07.060
It's stupid.

02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:09.140
All right.

02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:09.940
Well, wow.

02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:12.660
Did somebody's computer crash with Loki's ring right there?

02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:13.780
All right.

02:40:14.420 --> 02:40:15.220
Rage in here, buddy.

02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:18.020
I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call

02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:20.020
and I guess rest in peace, Gabe.

02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:23.140
But at least, hey, at least you can still play Game Room for now.

02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:23.860
Oh, yeah.

02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:27.620
I'm still, in fact, I was just playing that all day, actually, so.

02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:28.180
Nice.

02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:28.740
All right.

02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:29.460
Take care, my friend.

02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:30.420
Yep.

02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:31.140
Have a good one.

02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:31.640
Later.

02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:32.340
All right.

02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:37.780
Well, I'll see if anybody else calls in 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:42.020
But meanwhile, I did see a few things on Twitter I wanted to make sure I got through.

02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:45.540
I just saw a tweet come in from Koopa Club, which I plugged at the top of the show.

02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:47.620
They just posted episode 52.

02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:53.060
So if you need more of me after tonight's OLR, go download Koopa Club episode 52, which

02:40:53.060 --> 02:40:55.140
is titled hashtag baby Jessica.

02:40:55.940 --> 02:40:57.380
It'll make sense when you hear the show, okay?

02:40:58.180 --> 02:41:00.900
Um, some tweets at the OLR accounts.

02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:02.660
Twitter.com slash OLR.

02:41:03.860 --> 02:41:08.180
Superhulk1999 said, talk about great golf games.

02:41:08.180 --> 02:41:12.900
I've not played one since Outlaw Golf 2 on the first Xbox.

02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:14.340
You a big golf game player?

02:41:15.140 --> 02:41:17.140
No, I used to play a lot of mini golf games.

02:41:17.140 --> 02:41:19.940
They used to be really big into 3D Ultra mini golf.

02:41:19.940 --> 02:41:20.500
Yeah, I am.

02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:22.500
I loved Kirby's Dream Course.

02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:24.820
I think I brought that game up like three weeks in a row now.

02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:26.340
Like on Super Nintendo, I love that game.

02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:28.820
But it's not like super authentic golf either.

02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:33.540
I would be down for like, I mean, they've got hotshots golf and then they try to do

02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:34.180
a golf game.

02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:36.180
I think there was one on Xbox one.

02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:37.380
I want to say that they put out one.

02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:41.140
I've heard the Mario golf game is pretty good.

02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:44.420
I haven't played it myself yet, so I can't attest to that, but I've heard it's pretty

02:41:44.420 --> 02:41:44.740
good.

02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:47.700
Last golf thing I played was golf in Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:51.060
How about our chatters?

02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:55.700
Do our chatters have any recommendations of really good golf games over at live.vognetwork.com?

02:41:56.100 --> 02:41:57.140
Help a fellow listener out.

02:41:57.780 --> 02:42:01.140
S2 and Hunter Matt has tweeted us saying you have to give it up to the hackers.

02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:06.020
Mario Kart 8 has been demade for Super Nintendo via a ROM hack.

02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:07.140
What?

02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:09.220
That fast?

02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:11.140
That was quick.

02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:12.820
Where's that?

02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:13.620
Apparently, I don't know.

02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:20.100
He's linking me to a story at retrocollect.com where, let's see, there's a Mario Kart 8 demake

02:42:20.100 --> 02:42:21.780
for the Super Nintendo.

02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:28.260
Let's see, it says you can't do some of the things that the courses do in the game, but

02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:32.580
the tracks from Mario Kart 8 have been brought over to Super Mario Kart as best possible.

02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:37.940
The familiarity of the hit Nintendo Wii U's courses are present in the novelty ROM hack,

02:42:37.940 --> 02:42:41.540
one which gives the timeless Super Mario Kart another jolt of life.

02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:43.140
Interesting.

02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:45.620
I want to see video.

02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:46.740
Why is there no video?

02:42:46.740 --> 02:42:52.580
I mean, they have a patch, but they have the patch that you can download, but where's my

02:42:52.580 --> 02:42:53.140
video?

02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:58.900
And apparently through the ZSNES emulator, you can play online and do online battle play

02:42:58.900 --> 02:43:00.340
on old school Mario Kart.

02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:04.740
Does that mean that they act, because Super Mario Kart has, like, a good battle mode?

02:43:06.420 --> 02:43:07.220
Maybe that's a thing.

02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:07.620
I don't know.

02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:10.420
I'm sure there's a YouTube out there for them.

02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:13.620
All right, let's see.

02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:17.220
Act Def says I heard the Mario Golf 3DS games is good.

02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:18.820
Let's see.

02:43:19.780 --> 02:43:23.700
Tiger class says you need to download Double Twist for desktop.

02:43:23.700 --> 02:43:25.380
Is that game or is that another?

02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:25.940
Oh, never mind.

02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:27.540
They're talking about something completely else.

02:43:27.540 --> 02:43:28.820
It's like, what?

02:43:28.820 --> 02:43:31.700
That is a program to sync music to Android phone.

02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:32.980
There you go.

02:43:32.980 --> 02:43:33.540
Sorry about that.

02:43:34.980 --> 02:43:36.900
That was in the midst of golf game chatter.

02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:38.900
I thought that might have been some golf game I never heard of.

02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:43.300
Any other last minute stories, Logie?

02:43:43.300 --> 02:43:45.140
I was going to mention, this was kind of a big thing.

02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:53.220
They were, some modders found that the original shaders that were used in the E3 demo for

02:43:53.780 --> 02:44:01.300
Watch Dogs were hidden inside the PC version of the game, and they enabled them, and it

02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:04.660
looks much better than it does now.

02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:07.780
I heard, though, it runs into major performance issues in some places.

02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:08.740
It's not so bad.

02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:14.580
From what I've seen, actually, they were saying that the performance is actually better, but

02:44:14.580 --> 02:44:16.340
it's a little bit buggy.

02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:21.060
It's not perfect, but they're working to fix stuff in there from the shaders and everything.

02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:25.540
But it's still, once again, developers, if you're taking something out of a game and

02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:30.020
you really don't want people finding it, remove it completely from the game.

02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:31.220
Do not reference it.

02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:33.060
Do not keep the code in there.

02:44:33.060 --> 02:44:34.260
Take it all out.

02:44:34.260 --> 02:44:37.300
All right.

02:44:38.820 --> 02:44:43.540
Well, we're not getting any of the calls, so I guess this is where I close up the Skyline.

02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:45.460
We're done.

02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:45.940
That's it.

02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:47.220
That brings us to the end of another show.

02:44:47.220 --> 02:44:50.100
If you want to participate with the show, you didn't get a chance tonight, but maybe

02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:53.060
you're listening to us at work on a Monday or at some point throughout the week.

02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:56.340
First off, a big thank you guys who support the show.

02:44:56.340 --> 02:45:00.580
Those of you that show up here live or those that listen on the podcast feed, however you

02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:05.300
do it through iTunes, through Stitcher, through using Double Twist to get it from one place

02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:06.580
to another, whatever it is you do.

02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:08.900
Thank you guys very much for checking out our show.

02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:12.260
If you liked what you hear, please consider leaving us a five-star review.

02:45:12.260 --> 02:45:12.660
Oh, here we go.

02:45:12.660 --> 02:45:13.620
Here's some pictures.

02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:16.100
On iTunes or Stitcher or something like that.

02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:17.620
We really appreciate it.

02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:20.020
Quickly, Loki, you got some pictures?

02:45:20.020 --> 02:45:20.180
Yeah.

02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:25.380
If you click on the link on that story, it shows the pictures in robhacking.net.

02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:29.940
And I mean, I can't really tell.

02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:33.140
I mean, it's all right, I guess.

02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:35.940
I just can't really tell because I've never played Mario Kart 8.

02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:40.580
I can't really tell what these tracks are, but neat.

02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:42.340
I don't know.

02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:45.540
I'm more interested in the hacks that they had for Mario Kart Wii.

02:45:45.540 --> 02:45:51.380
They had lots of cool track hacks that you can do with just a SD card.

02:45:51.380 --> 02:45:52.580
Yeah, that's cool.

02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:53.860
All right.

02:45:53.860 --> 02:45:55.780
Well, that brings us to the end of another show.

02:45:55.780 --> 02:46:00.180
So thanks again for downloading and tuning in and listening to it, however it is.

02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:03.860
We will be back, of course, next week with another episode.

02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:06.340
We'll talk a little bit about 12 years of OLR.

02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:09.780
And of course, take your calls and talk about whatever should happen in the news next week.

02:46:09.780 --> 02:46:11.700
I'd imagine things are going to ramp up a little bit again

02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:14.820
more and more as we get closer and closer to the holidays.

02:46:15.860 --> 02:46:18.260
Loki, though, before we say good night to everybody,

02:46:18.260 --> 02:46:21.620
I got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:46:21.620 --> 02:46:22.740
Loki, your final thought.

02:46:22.740 --> 02:46:27.940
My final thought is I'm building my primitives again in my game that I'm developing

02:46:27.940 --> 02:46:29.620
for hopefully the last time.

02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:32.900
So once I'm at this and I get to learn how to write a shader.

02:46:33.540 --> 02:46:36.340
So all the things I didn't want to learn, I'm having to learn.

02:46:38.180 --> 02:46:41.860
My final thought tonight is Mario Kart 8 was super fun today

02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:43.700
and I think we need to do more tournaments like that.

02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:46.340
So we've got to do something with VOG, too.

02:46:46.340 --> 02:46:48.660
I know, yes, I know there is one that has been set up,

02:46:48.660 --> 02:46:52.100
but we haven't done a very good job promoting that because E3 happened.

02:46:52.180 --> 02:46:55.300
So I think we do have to kind of have at least like a little VOG tournament

02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:56.260
or something at some point.

02:46:56.260 --> 02:47:01.380
And one of these weeks, I'm gonna have to go in and clean up the Minecraft server

02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:04.980
and put the patches up and stuff because I don't think anyone's actually playing it.

02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:06.580
I'm still paying for it, but no one's playing.

02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:07.700
We haven't talked about it in a while.

02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:10.580
So I think if you say, hey, something new is going on, we're gonna do something.

02:47:10.580 --> 02:47:15.140
Minecraft server, I just have to update everything because I know that I have to.

02:47:15.700 --> 02:47:16.420
It's been a while.

02:47:16.420 --> 02:47:18.180
It's collecting dust.

02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:18.500
All right.

02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:20.740
That's it, guys.

02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:24.500
Thanks again for downloading the show and checking it out and tuning in.

02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:27.300
That's it.

02:47:27.300 --> 02:47:27.940
We're done.

02:47:27.940 --> 02:47:29.060
Did I give my final thought?

02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:31.220
I don't even remember what I said now if I did.

02:47:31.220 --> 02:47:32.740
I'll give another final thought.

02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:38.740
My final thought is I think I might actually play some more Final Fantasy XI tonight.

02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:41.140
Maybe I'll get to level my character to like 15 or something.

02:47:41.140 --> 02:47:41.640
We'll see.

02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:45.140
Or I'll get killed again in one hit like I did earlier today.

02:47:45.140 --> 02:47:45.940
All right, that's it.

02:47:45.940 --> 02:47:50.180
We'll be back here next week to say hooray for 12 years of OLR.

02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:54.580
Thank you guys for downloading the show and tuning in and we'll see you next time.

02:47:54.580 --> 02:47:54.820
Bye.

02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:22.580
But you know they were all still true.

02:48:25.620 --> 02:48:36.580
See you next week.

02:48:50.180 --> 02:49:02.580
Bye.
