0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Did you hear? E3 happened. Thank you all for your participation, questions, updates, and feedback. Our predictions may not have come true, but it was still a very packed three and a half days. We are here to wrap up the news along with all the other goings on right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	56000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June the 15th, 2014 with the 556th episode of our show. And boy, how things can change in an entire week. I don't know how many of you guys listened to last week's show after E3 happened, but it's really funny to go back and listen to predictions.
56000	71000	But anyway, we'll be tackling everything that happened at E3 and beyond with everything else that's going on in the gaming world. Yes, there is more than just E3, believe it or not. Over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts and with me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
71000	77000	Hello Jamie Sommers. Now, something I never thought I would see happen here at Studio OLR with Jamie Sommers.
77000	78000	I'm not wearing it.
78000	79000	Yes she is. She's wearing a Snuggie.
79000	84000	I'm not wearing it. If I were wearing it, my hands would be in the holes.
84000	94000	She mentioned before the show that her legs were cold and I said, well, I have a Snuggie and she said, I'm not going to wear it. So just wrap it around your feet. I do it all the time. So she has it wrapped around her feet.
94000	99000	She's not wearing it, but that's a technicality. Technicality. It's all right.
99000	103000	Humans are not meant to be worn by clothes. We are not the slave of our clothing.
103000	105000	But you have to admit.
105000	107000	You didn't watch Kill la Kill so you won't get it.
107000	110000	You have to admit though, it's a nice blanket. I'm not paid off by them.
110000	112000	Turn on the check-ins, Rob.
112000	117000	All right. I'll get to it in a minute. Jeez. Say hello as well to tech master, Loki.
117000	118000	Hi.
118000	119000	Hey, Loki. How you doing?
119000	120000	Doing okay.
120000	124000	Good. How's your game coming? I know you're working hard trying to program a game.
124000	127000	Were you too distracted with E3 this week?
127000	132000	No, I still worked on stuff at lunch and when I had time.
132000	146000	I got my editor saving and loading and although I did find a small bug in my loading that it's not building all the objects with correct rotations in there so everything's all kind of screwed up.
146000	153000	But it saves everything and I think the rotations are in there. I just have to figure out why it's not working.
153000	159000	But it's close because I wanted to start building assets and I actually started doing that and then I put my computer in sleep mode and it crashed.
159000	164000	I'm like, hmm, I should probably build the save function here so it doesn't do that again because I lost all my work there.
164000	168000	So yeah, I just haven't really had a lot of time to work on.
168000	173000	I was disappointed to see you didn't have a meeting room at E3 booking appointments to show off your creations.
173000	176000	Yeah, I have nothing to show off. It's like, hey, here's nothing.
177000	183000	If nothing else, does it give you perspective when it comes to critiquing games?
183000	190000	Because you know you have a bit of a reputation on this show for not being shy to show your anger and frustration sometimes with gaming.
190000	194000	Is this whole experience humbling you in any way?
194000	196000	No. No, it's not.
196000	199000	That's good to know. Some things are just never going to change, right?
199000	207000	It's not. I'm just learning how to do things and still trying to figure out why this isn't working.
207000	210000	Because I thought when I programmed it that it should work correctly.
210000	215000	You put something in and you take that same something out and you do the work, right?
215000	217000	You do the hokey pokey and you shake it all about.
217000	225000	If I put an object in with a rotation of 90 and I save that rotation of 90 and then I should output it with a rotation of 90, it should be the exact same way.
225000	231000	But no. In fact, I spawned an object or whatever and I'm like, okay, how would I fix this?
231000	236000	So I did 180 in one and it rotated in one way. And 180 on the other one, it rotated a different way.
236000	241000	I'm like, wait, that doesn't work. That should be different. That should be the same, not different.
241000	245000	You know what though, Loki? All joking aside, good for you for sticking with it, especially this long.
245000	250000	And you do this too, as a lot of people I know do. You start projects and then you never finish them.
250000	256000	I mean, I'm lucky if I finish building furniture from Ikea, but you've been really working on this game thing for several months now and sticking with it.
256000	260000	Because it's hopefully going to be more income and that's really important.
260000	267000	That's what I need. I need money. So, you know, of course I'm going to keep working at it because I need to.
267000	278000	That's right. All right. Anyhow, let's also introduce the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
278000	284000	And we do have our live chatters with us and you can chat along with us live.vognetwork.com.
284000	293000	We do love our podcast listeners as well though, if you happen to be listening to us on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or TuneIn or any of the many, many podcast apps that are out there.
293000	297000	Just thanks for checking us out. I appreciate it, especially on a very busy week like this.
297000	304000	Looking at the chatters and I have a lot of people yelling at me about the check-ins, which is why DarkSakra said something there.
304000	310000	But just to remind you guys, you do get points for participating with our show at vognetwork.com.
310000	318000	You can either check in when we're live throughout the three hours that we are live on Sunday nights or you can find a passphrase that's hidden somewhere within the show.
318000	324000	And you type that passphrase on the main page once you're logged in at vognetwork.com and you will get points.
324000	327000	And what does that point give you? E-peen.
327000	333000	No, it's well, you know, we do have our own leaderboards at vognetwork.com, just like you would have on Foursquare or whatever, you know, those various sites.
333000	340000	But once in a while, we also do raffles and every point that you earn on the site goes towards a raffle ticket if you choose to enter the raffle.
340000	346000	We haven't said yet if we're doing one this month for June, probably we will. So stay tuned for that.
346000	349000	We have more information coming up on that.
349000	354000	SHA100Matt in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com also says, happy Father's Day, Loki.
354000	361000	And yes, happy Father's Day to all the dads, father figures, pet fathers, everything, everybody out there.
361000	365000	Stepfathers, all the fathers of the spectrum, happy Father's Day to you.
365000	368000	So I'm sure we have lots of gamer dads that listen to this program.
368000	370000	As long as you're responsible and have done your job.
370000	371000	Yes.
371000	372000	Then you've earned the title.
372000	376000	There you go. There you go. Which Loki certainly has. So happy Father's Day to you.
376000	380000	Did you get to do anything special for the day real quick before we get into all the big news of the week?
380000	383000	Grocery shopping. That's about it.
383000	387000	Did the kids behave on the grocery shopping trip? That would be a reward, right?
387000	391000	We had our parents watch him during the grocery shopping trip, but in the morning I tried.
391000	396000	Okay, so Josh woke up at like 5.45. Nice.
396000	404000	So I'm like, fine, I'll get you up and then I'll, because I have to kind of supervise you, I'm going to sleep on the couch.
404000	411000	So what did he do the entire like two and a half, actually it was, yeah, two and a half hours that I was out there.
411000	415000	He kept trying to wake me up every time. He just kept like, he'd jump on the couch.
415000	420000	He'd be like, you know, daddy, daddy, daddy, you know, this, this, this, you know, he's driving a car.
420000	423000	I mean, I'm like, stop. I'm just trying to sleep.
423000	425000	Alan does the same thing to me. Don't worry about it.
425000	432000	All right. Anyway, uh, Mega Man X 400 in our chat room says, I definitely can't wait to hear Loki's E3 thoughts.
432000	437000	Me neither. I have a different kickoff topic to get us there, but, but, but tease us here, Loki.
437000	443000	One word, this year's E3 in one word, Loki. One word.
444000	448000	Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. Games.
448000	453000	Well, that's, I guess that's good because if you'd come out and said, you know, movies, I don't think that would have made people happy.
453000	459000	So, all right. Well, technically, yes, there was lots of game trailers, so movies would be accurate.
459000	464000	I say one word, one word. All right. Meanwhile, I'm actually going to go over to dark soccer for tonight's kickoff topic,
464000	468000	because I think it's important to remember that I'm sure a lot of your favorite shows in the podcast you listen to throughout the week,
468000	472000	everybody's talking E3 this week because it is the big windfall of, you know,
472000	478000	this is what the rest of 2014 and most of 2015 is going to look like for video games.
478000	481000	But there's other stuff that goes on in the world that involves video games this week.
481000	486000	You know, there's conventions in some places like Jason, who's not here this week because he's driving back to Denver.
486000	491000	I know Denver, his town, they were doing a con, I think it was either this weekend or next weekend, you know, doing the thing.
491000	496000	And dark soccer, you were here at an event in the Bay Area locally that was kind of a big deal, right?
496000	501000	Yes. I went to Atari party, which last year was in Davis.
501000	507000	This year was in Sunnyvale, which is pretty much where Atari happened.
507000	512000	I mean, if you want to be serious about it. It was really cool.
512000	518000	We, as usual, brought up both of our Atari 5200 and actually another guy,
518000	524000	a couple guys here from here in Sacramento brought their 5200 and collection.
524000	528000	And so they were right next to us. So we had the table of domination.
528000	538000	Although there actually were other 5200s there because the guy who invented the Atari trackball brought his and T-shirts that I wanted.
538000	543000	He gave us this really, really good speech.
543000	552000	Dan Kramer was the inventor of the Atari trackball for the 5200.
552000	559000	And also Al Alcorn was there, who was the guy who created Pong.
559000	566000	And a few other folks from the industry, the guy that runs California Extreme, he was there.
566000	569000	Mark, really good guy.
569000	575000	So it's important to note, you know, like Atari and early Activision, a lot of these companies, you know, I remember Epyx back in the day,
575000	579000	a lot of these companies were based in the Bay Area, you know, in Sunnyvale.
579000	581000	And that, you know, it's called Silicon Valley for a reason, right?
581000	585000	So a lot of those games that were written back in the day were born of that.
585000	589000	So it sounds like this was a type of, I don't know if you want to say birthday party,
589000	597000	but like maybe like a high school reunion of sorts in some ways for a lot of these folks that, you know, are the reason we have an E3 today.
597000	602000	It's also the only place I will see more than one Jaguar in any one place.
602000	607000	So there were a couple of, we had basically systems all across the board.
607000	614000	I mean, I'm just pulling back up my photos because someone had one of the, not just, you know,
614000	620000	were there like Linksys and Atari 800 computers and the home consoles,
620000	626000	but there were other games that were by Atari that were on display on other systems.
626000	631000	Like there's actually a Pong table there, a Pong cocktail table.
631000	637000	One guy brought in his, I'll be having photos of these up within the week for the website.
637000	641000	Was this pretty much exclusively Atari stuff or did, you know, some of the other...
641000	642000	That's what I was getting to.
642000	643000	Oh, okay. Sorry.
643000	650000	But I was telling you about the one, Mod, he did an ENCOM 2600 that had light cycles inside it.
650000	655000	You know, ENCOM was the company in Tron, so he had it all Tron themed.
655000	663000	But one of the other systems that I liked that was there was the Sega SG1000 Mark II.
663000	667000	That was the precursor to the Master System and they just brought it.
667000	671000	I mean, I don't think there were any Atari games in particular on it,
671000	676000	but next to that was a new style Famicom and there were a few of,
676000	680000	there was Mario Brothers being played on it, you know.
680000	687000	But other than that, there was a person who brought in a lot of the Tengen games and just had those running.
687000	691000	There, like I said, there were a few Jaguars, a lot of the different computers.
691000	695000	There were some, there was a guy, and I ran into him a few years ago,
695000	699000	and I wish I could find his card again because I'd love to have him on the show,
699000	708000	who did a bunch of conversions of newer games for the Atari 800 and the 800 computer.
708000	713000	Like, one of them is Space Harrier. Fully playable, has voice, the music's pretty decent.
713000	717000	You know, down res some, but it was really, really, really good.
717000	721000	Since we are talking about all things Atari, did anybody bring Driver 3?
721000	723000	Not that I saw.
723000	725000	It was worth a shot.
725000	729000	I'm looking through my pictures. Yeah, there was Doom being played on a Jaguar.
729000	733000	Had some playthroughs of Rayman.
734000	740000	Which is one of the most beautiful, you know, 2D platformers from its day.
740000	743000	I'm looking through some more pictures.
743000	748000	We tried to get Pango running, but it doesn't like our digital sticks that we had to replace the,
748000	754000	because Atari 5200s are really, really shitty controllers, and were notorious for breaking.
754000	759000	So we tried to get Pango up and running, so all I could do was take a picture of Dan trying to play Pango.
759000	766000	There was copious amounts of Tempest up on the screen, and there were four arcade machines.
766000	768000	Of course, one of the great Atari classes.
768000	773000	So at the end of the day, is this just everybody with vaults like you and Dan have,
773000	777000	kind of bringing their Atari pieces of that all to one room, and it's like a show and tell type of thing?
777000	779000	Pretty much.
779000	781000	It's like, hey, this stuff's cool, come play it.
781000	790000	There were four arcade machines that were in the teen section of the library,
790000	795000	and one of them, well there was Star Wars, there was Asteroids, Centipede, and Tempest.
795000	800000	So some of the greater machines there, and of course, for the folks who were on my Facebook,
800000	806000	I did post a lot of these pictures, but I'll be reposting them on the website before too long.
806000	808000	Just sort of a wrap up.
808000	811000	And we had our copy of Jyris out, because that was one of the games we picked up,
811000	815000	because we pick up a couple of reproductions or prototypes to bring in every year.
815000	822000	So we had Jyris playing, and Dan had the trackball out, and we also have a prototype stick holder,
822000	827000	that sort of turns two controllers into twin sticks, for stuff like,
827000	830000	what game did he have that used that? I don't remember.
830000	836000	But we had some Robotron going on, and I had to explain to some kid what Evil Otto was,
836000	839000	because they were playing Berserk on the computer next to us.
839000	843000	Well, okay, speaking of talking to kids about maybe games they don't remember,
843000	850000	you know, why are events like this important? Why is the Atari and these old systems,
850000	854000	these old moldy antiques, why are they important, Dark Saga?
854000	858000	The whole point is that if you want to understand what the industry is now
858000	861000	and where it's going, you have to understand where it's been.
861000	863000	It's the same with anything, really.
863000	869000	If you don't know what led to what you have, you really don't appreciate it as well.
869000	873000	And sometimes people need to go back and play the old stuff to understand
873000	878000	why the way a game plays is more important than how it looks.
878000	885000	I showed some girl, probably 19 or so, how to play Missile Command.
885000	890000	And she's like, oh my god, this is actually really, really difficult once you get further on in it.
890000	894000	I was showing someone how to play Kix, because that's one of my top games.
894000	899000	And like, oh my god, this is so simple but so hard, the challenge.
899000	903000	And they kept coming back and playing it because it was challenging.
903000	909000	It's not the best, prettiest game in the universe ever, because damn it, Kix is annoying.
909000	915000	But it's a really fun game. We have more people playing Qbert than anything I could think of.
916000	919000	And they're like, oh, it's Qbert, he's cussing at us.
919000	924000	It's just, really, that's the part that I think you can't get past.
924000	929000	That you have to, you know, I've learned to appreciate the classics.
929000	933000	A lot of comments on history in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
933000	935000	Dungeon Buster says, history is important.
935000	938000	WhatupG says, I wish more companies would look at the past.
938000	942000	And Dungeon Buster also says, it makes me sad to know that there are people out there
942000	945000	that think Elder Scrolls started with Oblivion.
945000	949000	And, you know, speaking of the past and maybe the not so bright side about it,
949000	954000	you know, I think sometimes people often forget the video game industry crashed and burned
954000	957000	in the, you know, early, mid-ish 80s, well, 84, right?
957000	962000	It was the big video game crash when, you know, we really transitioned from the Atari 2600
962000	968000	to the Japanese, you know, consoles of Nintendo and Sega that kind of finished out the 80s
968000	971000	and caused this revival that's still going.
971000	976000	But, you know, this question comes up once every blue moon and sometimes gets laughed off.
976000	981000	But, you know, we talk about knowing where we've been and how we got there and so forth.
981000	986000	We always talk about, do you think there would ever be another video game crash?
986000	990000	Do you think there's anything to learn there from some of these old games
990000	993000	about like how to not have another video game crash?
993000	997000	Well, there was a whole bunch of saturation in the 80s, especially as,
997000	1003000	in fact, there's a really good series to watch that's like, I think it's just the history of video games
1003000	1008000	that's done by decade, not by decade, but done by year, starting with the 70s.
1008000	1015000	And there's some really famous video casters on there like the Angry Video Game Nerds on there,
1015000	1024000	Pat the NES Punk, I think. There's just a few other, you know, really, really good video personalities,
1024000	1033000	some that they've all put together. And they really went into how when one person would make an innovation
1033000	1039000	with the type of game, there would be a million, million clones out there would get so saturated.
1039000	1045000	Then you had all of these other little just no name consoles coming out, computers even.
1045000	1049000	And this is actually a discussion I had with somebody when we were at Atari Party,
1049000	1055000	how you could have so many different kinds of computers, but you had to recode everything
1055000	1059000	or redo certain lines of code just because of certain incompatibilities.
1059000	1065000	And it made it really difficult to mass market your game because of those inconsistencies
1065000	1069000	between different systems, different machines.
1069000	1077000	I honestly think that we were overcoming some of the pitfalls that were around in the 80s,
1077000	1083000	but at the same time, we've lost some of the things that really helped it to grow,
1083000	1090000	that at least kept it alive in the hearts of the enthusiasts even when the mass market crashed.
1090000	1094000	You bring up a really great point in what you said there.
1094000	1099000	And I know there's some people listening to this that are like, come on, get to the E3 talk and so forth.
1099000	1101000	You know what? E3 can bite me.
1101000	1105000	Well, but hold on a minute because there's a very important parallel here.
1105000	1110000	And I know we're going to get into this later in the show, but there were a few controversies that came out of E3.
1110000	1117000	And the talk about how much does it cost to develop a game and how a lot of these are big budget productions.
1117000	1121000	Here's one I know is a fact but not something we're specifically getting into,
1121000	1128000	but Destiny, that game that's in alpha right now, what they're saying, $500 million going into that game.
1128000	1131000	And it's this huge production, right? This is big to do.
1131000	1137000	But back in the day, back in Atari, those games, I mean, yes, there were certainly budgets.
1137000	1141000	And yes, there were, you know, the marketing and everything that had to go into that.
1141000	1148000	But at the end of the day, one guy or gal or two made the game, start to finish.
1148000	1155000	And were geniuses, in my opinion, in how to make it fit into the technology that they had.
1155000	1160000	It was even as crappy as ET was. Keep in mind, he had six, what was it, six weeks to do it.
1160000	1167000	And made a fully playable, barely playable game in six weeks.
1167000	1170000	So, that's something to be said, you know.
1170000	1177000	There's actually, and I was telling a couple people about this book while I was, while we were eating our Costco pizza.
1177000	1179000	Which, thank you, Judith, for the Costco pizza.
1179000	1184000	Judith is really cool, by the way. She's the director for the Digital Game Museum.
1184000	1187000	Really nice lady. And I'll be talking about them more later.
1188000	1196000	But there's a book out there called You. And it's by a writer named Austin Grossman.
1196000	1203000	And it's about a guy who gets pulled into a development company as a game developer.
1203000	1210000	As a, I think, as a story writer. And the lead game designer, that was it.
1210000	1212000	Just to design how the game was supposed to work.
1212000	1215000	Come up with assets for it and let the programmers worry about it.
1215000	1221000	But he was talking about how, you know, his friend who created the engine that this company runs all of its games on.
1221000	1228000	And how he and three other people, you know, were creating Rogue, you know, games based on Rogue back in the day.
1228000	1232000	And, you know, it was sort of like a parallel for a lot of the early video games.
1232000	1237000	You know, programming on an old Commodore computer or on an old Apple IIe.
1237000	1241000	And talking about how all of that led up to the games now.
1241000	1248000	And the guy has to play through all of the series of games on this engine as he's trying to find this one item hidden in the code.
1248000	1254000	You know, using, because each of the games will continue off the last one even if they're in different genre or different eras.
1254000	1259000	But it talks about how the games developed, what the styles were of the day, what the tastes were of the day.
1259000	1266000	And it actually is a really, really good parallel between what people think of modern day gaming and its roots.
1267000	1271000	And I was just getting a lot of that after having read that book and then going to Atari Party.
1271000	1275000	I was really getting a lot of that just talking to people from the industry.
1275000	1283000	And I don't think, just so I'm clear, I don't want people to think that I'm just saying that like big budget games are bad or this is bad and they're all bad.
1283000	1294000	Not necessarily, but I do feel like some of the mistakes we're seeing made in where the industry is headed and some of the problems we're having right now with some of the foot in mouth syndrome we see coming out of some of these companies.
1294000	1295000	Like Ubisoft.
1295000	1297000	You have to look to the past.
1297000	1298000	Yeah.
1298000	1313000	When, you know, it was no problem to make a character one gender versus another versus, you know, it wasn't something that like, oh well we got to think about the money, we got to think about the cost.
1313000	1321000	But the closest thing I see now to, and the other point I want to make is the closest thing I see now to those days in the Atari stuff, I see coming out of the indie scene.
1322000	1331000	Which really is one or two guys or gals with a passion project that, you know, make things from start to finish that, you know, they really put their name on.
1331000	1339000	I got to say, you know, to lead us into the E3 talk here a little bit, some of my favorite things I saw at E3 were over at IndieCade in the indie booth.
1339000	1350000	You know, where we could talk to game makers directly about these games that they're doing that, unfortunately, I think a lot of you guys haven't even heard of that are really some experiences that are really worth trying.
1350000	1361000	I would really like to take a lot of focus off of, you know, quote the big three. You know, maybe mention their consoles because we're going to be able to play some of the indie games on them.
1361000	1371000	But I would really think that people should be putting more focus on the indie gamers because more and more that's where you're seeing the quality.
1371000	1385000	That's where you're seeing. And another reason why I brought up that book, too, is because a big point made in there is how, oh, well, we're abandoning storytelling for the sake of all the first person shooters that the mass market want, you know, all the, you know, initial payoff blood and gore.
1385000	1399000	But we're seeing more and more, and I'm going to use quotey fingers and say true gamers who are wanting to go back to storytelling, wanting to go back to it being an effective way to evoke emotion, to have it actually been treated as art.
1399000	1414000	I don't think of Call of Duty as art. I think of Dominique Pomplamoose as art. You know, that's the Stanley parable. Definitely, definitely an art form of its own. It's storytelling with a very, very fucking weird twist.
1414000	1424000	You know, even Portal, you know, for being just how it was put together. It really tells a story in a very unique way and engages the mind.
1424000	1437000	I don't think that necessarily Call of Duty isn't art, but I totally get what you're saying. But for me, it's like you have a Monet versus the Thomas Kincaid gallery at the local mall. You know what I mean?
1437000	1441000	And while Kincaid was talented, his work was meant to be commercialized.
1441000	1453000	Yes, yes. So anyway, I do want to kind of transition us into E3 chatter, but real quick, if people want to attend our Atari party next year, I want more information because I'm trying to Google it. I'm finding like a Facebook page.
1453000	1455000	Yeah, it's on Facebook.
1455000	1456000	Really?
1456000	1467000	Yeah, the Atari party Facebook page. But I think they're going to be working again with Digital Game Museum, which you just go to digitalgamemuseum.org. Really, really great people.
1468000	1485000	But yeah, just look up Atari party. And you'll find galleries, but the big advertisement is through the Facebook page. Although I honestly think that I might ask Bill if he wants a web page gifted.
1485000	1486000	Nice.
1487000	1490000	And Bill's a really great guy, the guy who organizes it.
1491000	1499000	It sounds like it's getting bigger and bigger every year, too. I saw Mel B made the newspaper, the Mercury News, playing at the Atari party.
1499000	1503000	Mel and Christine were both there on the cover.
1503000	1504000	Yeah, that's great.
1504000	1508000	I ran into Neil, of course he was there, and ran into a few familiar faces.
1508000	1512000	So not only do you play the old school video games, but you run into all the old school gamers.
1512000	1515000	We had so many new friends. Also, everyone was pretty cool.
1518000	1526000	We were joking upstairs, too, about how we should just shove a bunch of pizza in our mouth and not wash our hands, and then go play everything so it could feel like an arcade.
1528000	1534000	And then we all stopped and thought about our own systems, like, no bad idea.
1534000	1535000	Bad idea.
1535000	1541000	Alright, well, hopefully it doesn't conflict with E3 next year so I can go, because I think that would be a blast.
1541000	1548000	But we do have one conflict, because California Extreme, which is amazing, amazing, is the same weekend as GamerX.
1548000	1549000	Also amazing.
1549000	1553000	So I made my apologies for not being able to go.
1553000	1556000	You guys need to coordinate your calendars better, Bay Area convention people.
1556000	1561000	There was a lot of talk about trying to schedule around certain other things.
1561000	1568000	It was really cool, though. It was just kind of great. It was very casual, too.
1568000	1569000	Good.
1569000	1570000	Which is how it should be.
1570000	1575000	Alright, well, we are going to get into some E3 chatter. I'm going to ask Loki to hit on some of the press conferences.
1575000	1577000	I do want to do some housekeeping, though, real quick.
1577000	1584000	Speaking of GamerX, that's kind of the next big convention that I know I have my eye on, and Dark Sakura has hers on, too, because we will both be there.
1585000	1590000	And this convention, of course, is running from July 11th through July 13th.
1590000	1597000	And this is really cool, on Saturday at the convention there, July 12th, the podcast cross zone panel is going to be happening.
1597000	1600000	Myself, Dark Sakura, will be there live and in person.
1600000	1606000	So if you are going to be at the GamerX convention, which is, of course, at the Intercontinental in San Francisco, come say hi on July 12th.
1606000	1613000	We'll be there and talking with some of our indie podcast buddy friend pals about kind of the art of podcasting.
1613000	1618000	And this last year was really about kind of trying to motivate people to do their own thing and get their voices out there.
1618000	1622000	This year we're going to continue that, but also talk from a little bit of a tech side.
1622000	1626000	We're going to demotivate you this year. It's too hard.
1626000	1632000	Let me tell you about all the no comments I got at E3 this year. That will demotivate you.
1632000	1639000	But we want to start to tackle some of the technical things as well as how do you promote yourself, how do you make yourself bigger.
1639000	1641000	So we'll tackle all those issues this year.
1641000	1653000	Speaking of Podcast Cross Zone, as a bit of a promotional thing leading up to that, we're going to be having an official, using my little quotey fingers, official Podcast Cross Zone tournament in Mario Kart 8.
1653000	1659000	So Mario Kart 8 fans, get a pen and paper real quick or get ready to rewind the podcast so you can write this down.
1659000	1665000	But here's the details of the tournament. It's going to be next Sunday, June 22nd, before OLR.
1665000	1669000	It's going to run from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time.
1669000	1673000	So for West Coast folks, that's 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Pacific time.
1673000	1677000	And the tournament name is Podcast X Zone or Cross Zone.
1677000	1685000	The winner will be determined from the best of 12 races. There will be a winner prize, a participation prize, and a booby prize.
1685000	1689000	But we're not encouraging people to go for the booby prize. Don't do that.
1689000	1691000	Everybody's got to try.
1691000	1693000	I've already got the booby prize.
1693000	1697000	So we're not telling you what any of those prizes are until we get a little closer.
1697000	1699000	I don't know. Maybe some of the other shows will.
1699000	1707000	So that's us, that's Koopa Club, that's Video Game Realness, that's GameBui.org, that's GameBar.
1707000	1711000	That's... I know I'm going to be forgetting somebody and I'm going to really eat shit for this later.
1711000	1719000	Us and Hoard House and all those fantastic shows that are going to be a part of Podcast X Zone.
1719000	1724000	The rules are 100 cc, all vehicles, normal computer players will be involved.
1724000	1733000	Here it is, the big code that you want. The big code 497714182468.
1733000	1741000	Here's that code one more time to put into Mario Kart 8. That is 497714182468.
1741000	1749000	And we will see you next Sunday and then live and in person at Podcast X Zone at GamerX on July the 12th.
1749000	1753000	The good news is if you can't make it live in person, because I know we have listeners everywhere,
1753000	1758000	I'm almost positive they will tape everything and put it on YouTube like a month later, like they did last time.
1758000	1761000	If you want to see the first podcast, Cross Zone Panel, that is up on YouTube.
1761000	1765000	Just search for Podcast X Zone and you'll find it. So there you go.
1765000	1773000	Since we will be at GamerX, there will be no OLR on July 13th.
1773000	1778000	We will not be having a show that Sunday as Jamie and I will not be back from the con at that point.
1779000	1782000	So just a heads up so y'all can have your calendars marked appropriately.
1782000	1784000	Okay, I think that's it for housekeeping.
1784000	1786000	Twitter.com slash OLR follow us.
1786000	1789000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio friend us.
1789000	1793000	Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
1793000	1795000	Do whatever people do on Google Plus with us.
1795000	1796000	That's like plus one us.
1796000	1798000	Yeah, plus one us and then forget about it.
1798000	1801000	Alright, just kidding Google people.
1801000	1803000	Plus one feels like RSVP.
1803000	1805000	Plus one.
1805000	1812000	Alright, so E3. I went. This is the first show I went to in probably about three years I think.
1812000	1815000	But my first show was ten years ago.
1815000	1818000	So I've been going to E3 off and on for about ten years.
1818000	1823000	And I'm just going to tell you guys, overall it was a very different vibe this year than I felt in years past.
1823000	1828000	You know, I think a lot of folks have the image in their head of like Penny Arcade.
1828000	1832000	Basically a lot of people think E3 is Penny Arcade Expo and you know, it's not.
1833000	1840000	Not every booth has just infamous lines of stations of games lined up waiting for people to play.
1840000	1846000	In fact, some companies that kind of surprised me had no stations at all of games for people to play.
1846000	1848000	One that comes to mind, Konami.
1848000	1854000	A company that I know ten years ago, we used to be right there talking about DDR and Beatmania and all that stuff.
1854000	1855000	Konami wasn't showing anything.
1855000	1857000	They don't have anything to show.
1857000	1862000	Yeah, well behind closed doors they had the soccer, Pro Evo Soccer, they had Metal Gear Solid 5.
1862000	1866000	That's it. That's all they have on their slate. That's literally it on their slate.
1866000	1872000	But I use that set as an example. Even a company like Warner Brothers obviously has a lot of big titles they have this year.
1872000	1876000	I think they had maybe two stations where they had Batman that was playable.
1876000	1881000	The rest of it, if you want to see Mortal Kombat X or Batman or all the other stuff,
1881000	1886000	you could wait in a big old line to get in a theater to watch somebody else playing the game.
1886000	1894000	And I think a big key word here about the E3 of 2014 versus the E3 of 2004 is control.
1894000	1897000	It's a really controlled environment now.
1897000	1902000	I'm kind of surprised they don't take measures to thin the crowds even more.
1902000	1905000	I'm really surprised at some of the stuff I see at E3.
1905000	1910000	But for me personally, one big reward I got out of this show this year was networking.
1910000	1914000	I met a lot of great people at the show from a lot of great companies.
1914000	1917000	Not just the big ones that we're going to get into here shortly with the press conferences,
1917000	1920000	but a lot of the second-tier developers.
1920000	1929000	I'm really pleased to report to you guys I've got at least ten different game makers that want to come on OLR and other VoG shows to talk about their games.
1929000	1931000	And that to me is the most exciting thing about E3.
1931000	1937000	Like, okay, sure. There's a time and a place for a canned presentation,
1937000	1942000	of which I personally think Nintendo is doing a fantastic job at the canned presentation game right now
1942000	1945000	with what they did at this E3.
1945000	1947000	There's a time and a place for that. That's great.
1947000	1951000	But if I'm going to be there and I'm going to be there live and in person with all these people,
1951000	1955000	I don't want the same canned thing that everybody else is getting on the internet right now.
1955000	1957000	That's the world we live in right now.
1957000	1961000	Why would I stand in line to watch a demo of somebody else playing Mortal Kombat X
1961000	1967000	when that's going to be up on YouTube and on Spike TV and all that stuff the day after the convention or during the convention?
1967000	1969000	There's no value in that for me.
1969000	1974000	I get far more value out of going over to Indiecade and talking to three game developers in the same amount of time
1974000	1977000	who are very passionate about some of the things they're working on.
1977000	1982000	So that was kind of my attitude going into this E3 was that I wanted to go meet game makers.
1982000	1986000	And I'm really happy to say we are going to get some of them coming on to OLR in the coming weeks.
1986000	1988000	Very, very happy about that.
1988000	1992000	So, yeah. That was E3 in a nutshell for me.
1992000	1997000	To answer some of the other questions that I always get coming out of E3,
1997000	2002000	Bobby, our pal Bobby Blackwell, who always comes on before us at the Voice of the East Network, he was at the convention.
2002000	2006000	We did a lot of the show together, although we had our own separate appointments too.
2006000	2008000	I know he talked about some of this on his show.
2008000	2012000	But, you know, the big questions always coming out of E3.
2012000	2015000	Who won? Who won E3?
2015000	2017000	No one.
2017000	2020000	Dark Soccer, why do you think no one won E3?
2020000	2022000	Because it's not a fucking contest.
2022000	2028000	It's not like they're racing and whoever gets to the end of the line wins everybody's money.
2028000	2031000	It's networking. It's all it is.
2031000	2035000	Maybe whoever got the most business cards won or something.
2035000	2039000	But it's not really for the gamers. It's for the industry.
2039000	2043000	So, no. There's no one fucking winning E3.
2043000	2045000	And to an extent, I agree with that.
2045000	2051000	I mean, at the end of the day, you could say pre-orders and sales and all that.
2051000	2054000	Maybe there's a game to be won with that.
2054000	2056000	At the end of the day, it is about selling games.
2056000	2060000	But if you were to ask me to grade all the press conferences and all that,
2060000	2063000	or who had the best press conference, my honest-to-god answer,
2063000	2065000	who had the best press conference?
2065000	2067000	I thought they all did a fine job.
2067000	2072000	Yes, there were high points. And yes, there were low points of each three.
2072000	2076000	And I'll talk about those. At least the big three and then the other publishers as well.
2076000	2080000	But I don't want to sit here and grade them.
2080000	2086000	Haychida just did not get the point. No one won. It is not a contest.
2086000	2088000	That's your opinion. That's what you liked better.
2088000	2090000	That's not winning. That's your opinion.
2090000	2092000	Let me read the comment, though, that's being responded to.
2092000	2096000	It's clear Sony and Nintendo won. Microsoft got a big F.
2096000	2100000	I disagree. And opinion, opinion, whatever.
2100000	2104000	But I don't think anybody failed.
2104000	2109000	In the particular case of Microsoft, everybody after last year said,
2109000	2112000	Shut up about the movies and TV and show the games.
2112000	2116000	And Microsoft came out. Game, game, game, game.
2116000	2119000	That's what people wanted, right?
2119000	2123000	And I think there was an interesting mix of stuff that I do and I don't want to play
2123000	2125000	that were shown at that particular press conference.
2125000	2129000	So I don't know. I don't really see that end of it.
2129000	2131000	Nobody won or lost E3.
2131000	2135000	The other big question I get is, what was the game of the show?
2135000	2138000	What was the game of the show?
2138000	2142000	That is so hard to answer because half of them, more than half of them,
2142000	2144000	three quarters of them aren't playable.
2144000	2147000	They're canned demos. Control, remember?
2147000	2152000	I don't know. I still think I can think of at least one that was like my game of the show.
2152000	2156000	There were definitely experiences that were great, but I don't think I...
2156000	2160000	Honestly, the game of the show for me was indies.
2160000	2164000	I liked going over to Indiecade and talking to people directly about the games they were making.
2164000	2167000	That was the game of the show to me.
2167000	2171000	All this other stuff, whatever. See you in 2015.
2171000	2174000	But I think overall, it's a great time to be a gamer.
2174000	2176000	Gamers won E3.
2176000	2180000	There's a lot of great stuff to look forward to from all three companies this year
2180000	2183000	and certainly a big chunk next year as well.
2183000	2188000	Anyhow, I went on a little bit of a tangent there.
2188000	2191000	WhatupG in chat says, Loki's was Grand Theft Auto 5.
2191000	2192000	No, it wasn't.
2192000	2193000	No, it wasn't.
2193000	2194000	Nope.
2194000	2195000	Big surprise.
2196000	2201000	Let's have you run down some of the big, big press conferences and some of the news that came out.
2201000	2205000	Remember, our audience, just the way we like to approach this with you guys,
2205000	2208000	we know if you're listening to Orange Launch Radio,
2208000	2213000	you probably already have a pretty good general awareness of what went on at all the big press conferences,
2213000	2218000	but we're here to talk about it and discuss it and hit some of those key things that came up.
2218000	2219000	So, Loki.
2219000	2222000	So, the Microsoft conference.
2222000	2227000	So, some of the stuff they kind of went over, they showed Call of Duty Advanced Warfare,
2227000	2229000	which I thought looked fantastic.
2229000	2234000	I'm very excited about it because last year's Call of Duty The Ghost game was just kind of like,
2234000	2236000	okay, something bad happened.
2236000	2237000	It's a Call of Duty game.
2237000	2241000	And before that, it was like Black Ops 2 was like, oh, hey, look at all this cool futuristic tech
2241000	2243000	and all this really interesting gameplay.
2243000	2249000	And now that's kind of been brought back now in Advanced Warfare, so I'm pretty excited by that.
2249000	2251000	And I thought it looked pretty cool.
2251000	2254000	Definitely looks next gen as opposed to Ghosted.
2254000	2258000	Forza Horizon 2 looks fantastic, very exciting.
2258000	2260000	So, that was something else that they showed.
2260000	2264000	That's going to be on both Xbox 360 and Xbox One.
2264000	2269000	Assassin's Creed Unity, which we knew was going to be something that was going to be at E3,
2269000	2274000	looked fantastic and they kind of showed off a little bit of the gameplay there.
2274000	2279000	One of the things that I thought was kind of funny, they announced DLC for Dead Rising 3,
2279000	2285000	and it was the Super Ultra Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX Plus Alpha,
2285000	2288000	which, you know, a little tongue in cheek, and that was out the same day.
2288000	2290000	That was a funny moment.
2290000	2293000	I like it when gaming companies can be a little bit self-deprecating
2293000	2296000	and kind of make fun of themselves a little bit.
2296000	2301000	Nintendo did a lot of that too, but that Capcom's a great example of that at the Microsoft thing.
2301000	2307000	They announced that they confirmed the Master Chief, or Halo the Master Chief collection,
2307000	2312000	which is on Xbox One, including all Halo 1 through 4.
2312000	2319000	Also, I guess, access to the live-action Halo Nightfall, that was their TV show they're making,
2319000	2326000	as well as a Halo 5 multiplayer beta, which people are pretty excited about as well.
2326000	2330000	Project Spark, they showed that Conker is going to be part of that,
2330000	2333000	which kind of had me scratching my head going,
2333000	2335000	Okay? That's...
2335000	2338000	Yeah, I get what you're saying, because it's like one of those like,
2338000	2344000	Okay, that's cool, but like, why are you teasing me with this, and not like a Conker game?
2344000	2347000	Yeah, for sure. Oh, sweet, they're going to bring out a new Conker game.
2347000	2350000	It's Project Spark, and I'm like, I don't care anymore!
2350000	2353000	Yeah, that was kind of a moment where it's like,
2353000	2356000	We put all our assets in there so you can make your own Conker game.
2356000	2360000	No, I want you to make a Conker game. If I wanted to make my own Conker game,
2360000	2362000	we could have made a fan game a long-ass time ago.
2362000	2364000	Where the fuck do I want to make my own Conker game?
2364000	2366000	I want you to make a Conker game.
2366000	2371000	They showed off some indie games, you know, Ori and the Blind Forest look pretty sweet.
2371000	2377000	There's a new game by Playdead, which looks a little bit similar to Limbo again.
2377000	2382000	New Tomb Raider game, Rise of the Tomb Raider, looked pretty awesome.
2385000	2387000	What else?
2387000	2391000	Phantom Dust, they showed that they're redoing that, which I'm like,
2391000	2396000	That was a real out of left field announcement, wasn't it?
2396000	2399000	Yeah, I didn't understand. I've never played the original.
2399000	2403000	Cool, I mean, they're doing a new one, I guess.
2403000	2411000	Kudos to Microsoft for recognizing that this was a franchise that maybe deserved more than it got,
2411000	2416000	and so they're giving it another chance. Kudos in that department.
2416000	2423000	They showed off some more of the Division, which, I don't know, it looks interesting, I guess,
2423000	2426000	but I just don't really know too much about it yet.
2426000	2433000	Also, my most favorite thing about the whole conference, they showed Crackdown.
2433000	2435000	I was like, yes.
2435000	2437000	I could hear you cheering all the way from where I was at.
2437000	2442000	Well, that looks awesome. I'd have to definitely pick it up if I got an Xbox One.
2442000	2446000	What did you think Crackdown, a reboot, it sounds like, versus Crackdown 3?
2446000	2449000	I'm fine with that. I don't really know.
2449000	2452000	I just wonder if they're going to have the same twist as the first Crackdown.
2452000	2456000	It seemed to have a very different tone to me, Crackdown.
2456000	2459000	It looks really impressive on a technical standpoint.
2459000	2462000	They're showing off the engine and stuff and what it can do,
2462000	2467000	and you can literally destroy anything in there in completely original ways, so that's very interesting.
2467000	2470000	I don't know, I think it looks like a pretty fun game.
2470000	2472000	Crackdown, I like the original Crackdown.
2472000	2475000	Crackdown 2 is kind of lame, but the first one was fantastic,
2475000	2482000	so I'm all down for a remake of that, or just even rebooting it with the same gangs in there.
2482000	2485000	Take note, Saints Row, or Volition.
2485000	2487000	This is what you could do with Saints Row.
2487000	2491000	Reboot that shit with the same gangs and totally mix it up.
2491000	2493000	I'd be down for that.
2494000	2496000	I'd be down for that.
2499000	2502000	What else? I think that was pretty much it.
2502000	2505000	Let me mention some of the comments from our chatroom.
2505000	2507000	Oh, Scalebound. That was the other one.
2507000	2509000	Scalebound, the Platinum game that was coming.
2509000	2515000	It looks like a cross between How to Train Your Dragon and Pokemon and Monster Hunter.
2515000	2517000	I don't know, interesting.
2517000	2522000	And they showed another trailer for Sunset Overdrive, which looks fantastic.
2522000	2526000	Yeah, they did just a trailer and some gameplay, right?
2526000	2528000	Yeah, it looks really great.
2528000	2531000	Just so you know, that was a big part of Microsoft's booth.
2531000	2534000	That was probably one of the biggest chunks of their booth.
2534000	2535000	It looks like a fantastic game.
2535000	2538000	And their money marketing going into that, which is good, because that's a new IP.
2538000	2540000	It's always nice to see that, getting that support.
2540000	2541000	It looks great.
2541000	2542000	It does.
2542000	2545000	Look at some of the comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2545000	2546000	Let's see.
2546000	2549000	Some people saying the second Crackdown not so good.
2549000	2552000	Dungeon Buster saying the second Crackdown was garbage.
2552000	2555000	Kaijuto says people forgot how bad Crackdown 2 was.
2555000	2557000	Yeah, no, I didn't forget. It was crap.
2557000	2561000	But we're far enough away from that now.
2561000	2562000	You're not worried?
2562000	2564000	Well, yeah, and they even kind of defended it.
2564000	2567000	They're all, we didn't have enough time to...
2567000	2573000	I remember correctly, I'm not sure if it's the same team that made Crackdown 2 as Crackdown 1.
2573000	2579000	And they're like, well, now we're doing all the things that we wanted to do in the original that we didn't have time to or something.
2579000	2582000	I don't know if they had to rush out the game to get that Halo 3 beta out there.
2582000	2585000	But I'm looking forward to it. I think it looks awesome.
2585000	2589000	SSG100Matt in our chat says, Sunset Overdrive looked good.
2589000	2591000	Project Spark looks like it could still be something.
2591000	2594000	Ori and the Blind Forest look like a fun platformer.
2594000	2595000	I'm still impressed with the Division.
2595000	2598000	So maybe to some there was nothing at Microsoft's presser.
2598000	2599000	I found plenty to be interested in.
2600000	2601000	And also Fable Legends.
2601000	2604000	But I wasn't really impressed by that because I've been burned on all these Fable games.
2604000	2606000	So I just didn't care.
2606000	2609000	And I know that they announced, oh, you can be the bad guy.
2609000	2610000	You can design your dungeon.
2610000	2611000	I'm like, I don't care.
2611000	2612000	It doesn't matter to me.
2612000	2618000	Blender in chat saying, I think that since there is such a debate about who won E3, gamers win.
2618000	2622000	Because the competition between the companies is so strong, they'll make better games.
2622000	2626000	I think that's a really positive way of looking at it and I kind of hope you're right.
2626000	2628000	I did find it interesting that the tone of Microsoft.
2628000	2635000	Obviously, it's no secret, Microsoft got pummeled last year when it came to E3.
2635000	2641000	They really got killed at E3 with all the policies and everything.
2641000	2647000	But this was a new year, new tone, new guy at the head of the table, a chance to establish something new.
2647000	2651000	And I did find it very interesting that this whole thing starts off.
2651000	2656000	We're excited to show you the future of gaming with our friends at Sony and Nintendo.
2656000	2660000	Very interesting kind of message, a tone there at the beginning.
2660000	2664000	Where there could have been an opportunity to take a sucker punch at Sony or something.
2664000	2665000	They didn't.
2665000	2666000	They wanted to do.
2666000	2672000	And then there was those random interludes as well with my favorite game or the first game I ever played.
2672000	2674000	Yeah, I didn't care about those.
2674000	2677000	Well, I get what they do as far as transition or whatever.
2677000	2680000	I thought it was going to lead up to something.
2680000	2684000	I thought there was a big lead up to something at the very end that kind of didn't happen.
2684000	2686000	So that was the only kind of surprise for me.
2686000	2694000	Because I thought there would be some game from the past that was making a giant comeback or a game creation thing.
2694000	2697000	Maybe that was all going to lead into Project Spark and talking about game creation.
2697000	2701000	Like, you know, these are all the games I grew up with and now I can make my own thing.
2701000	2704000	You know, I thought it would kind of have a punch line, but it really didn't.
2704000	2709000	So I think they served only as, here's a chance to put something on the TV so we can change something on the stage.
2709000	2712000	Or something like that. I don't know. It was a little strange.
2712000	2719000	Pros and cons. I mean, especially Loki and Dark Soccer, feel free to jump on into this too if you want.
2719000	2723000	You guys don't own Xbox Ones. I don't either for that matter.
2723000	2729000	I already said I'll be getting an Xbox One eventually anyway because I certainly want Forza Horizon 2.
2729000	2736000	And I want, oh my god, name escapes me. Live Radio. Alan Wake made the new game.
2736000	2737000	Quantum Break.
2737000	2741000	Thank you, Quantum Break, which wasn't to be seen at E3, which made me a little bit disappointed.
2741000	2743000	Yeah, that's probably holiday 2015.
2743000	2745000	Yeah, that's probably holiday 2015 at this point.
2745000	2750000	But, you know, still, even the Halo collection looks very exciting to me and so forth.
2750000	2757000	So, coming out of Microsoft's conference, did you see reasons to be an Xbox One owner?
2757000	2759000	Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that's the thing.
2759000	2764000	And, you know, kind of, not to spoil my impressions, everything, I kind of saw that out of all three of them.
2764000	2768000	It's like, okay, here's reasons to buy our systems and they all made a very valid point.
2768000	2772000	And, yeah, there's definitely a lot of reasons now for me to have an Xbox One.
2772000	2778000	You know, there's Forza Horizon 2, Sunset Overdrive, Crackdown, and even, you know, check out the Halo collection stuff.
2778000	2783000	So, there's plenty out there, you know, for me to pick up now.
2783000	2788000	They're showing me why, you know, where the games are, what you would want to buy.
2788000	2793000	That's the problem though, now I have to get all three and that's, you know, it's expensive.
2793000	2794000	And I don't know.
2794000	2801000	For me, the pros and cons of Microsoft's event was the pros were that I think they gave exactly what people wanted.
2801000	2803000	People wanted games. They showed a lot of games.
2803000	2810000	And there was a lot of really, you know, even though I think a lot of it was expected in a way, and I'll get to that in a minute,
2810000	2815000	there was a lot of really good looking things like the Tomb Raider sequel looked really good.
2815000	2820000	The Halo collection sounds amazing, you know, especially for people that need to catch up on that series.
2821000	2826000	Phantom Dust kind of coming back from the dead in a way is really exciting to see.
2826000	2828000	So, a lot of that's very good.
2828000	2833000	I think the one negative for me that comes out of Microsoft's press conference and the way I kind of left feeling after that,
2833000	2837000	I was like, this felt very par.
2837000	2840000	This is a very expected press conference.
2840000	2847000	Like, okay, yes, I got what I wanted, but I still have this unfulfilled feeling because where's that surprise out of Ether?
2847000	2851000	Where's that, where's that, it's out now or I was not expecting this.
2851000	2856000	And you know, honestly, to be fair to Microsoft, it really sucks.
2856000	2860000	And this just goes why secrecy is so important in the industry and so forth.
2860000	2864000	It really sucks that the cover was blown for them on the Halo collection.
2864000	2868000	Because that would have killed if they'd kept that a secret.
2868000	2870000	That would have really killed.
2870000	2874000	Well, that and like Crackdown and like all the stuff that people knew was coming, you know,
2874000	2877000	just kind of waiting for them to acknowledge it.
2877000	2888000	Right. One thing that concerns me a little bit about Microsoft is that I was actually commenting as we were listening to the press conference,
2888000	2893000	as we were driving so we couldn't watch, we were listening to the press conference and I checked out some of the video after the fact.
2893000	2897000	I was listening to it and I was commenting to Jason.
2897000	2901000	I said, Jason, I don't think there's been a Japanese developer up on that stage yet.
2901000	2905000	Now they let off with one last year with Konami and the Metal Gear Solid.
2905000	2908000	The Xbox One is launching in Japan later this year.
2908000	2911000	How are they going to sell the Xbox to Japanese gamers?
2911000	2912000	All they have is Platinum.
2912000	2919000	Yeah. After I said that, after I said that came out of my mouth, that's when they brought Platinum Games on stage and showed this, you know, scale bound.
2919000	2921000	Which to be fair, looks great.
2921000	2923000	Platinum Games, we love them. They're great.
2923000	2925000	But it's one.
2925000	2930000	And you know, the other thing they showed was Capcom's DLC for a game that's already out there.
2930000	2936000	And I know what a lot of you at home are saying. You're probably saying, Rob, what about Tokyo Game Show?
2936000	2938000	They're just sitting on it for Tokyo Game Show.
2938000	2949000	But in my opinion, why would you wait until Tokyo Game Show when the Xbox is set to launch in Japan like 30 days after that?
2949000	2951000	You need a little more time to build hype.
2951000	2958000	So I'm a little concerned that we're just going to have a repeat of the 360 in Japan when it comes to Xbox One.
2958000	2965000	I'm not convinced that they've got that support in Japan that they desperately need.
2965000	2973000	The other thing that kind of annoyed me a little bit about the whole Capcom DLC is they had all these banners and costumes and stuff for Power Stone.
2973000	2978000	I was like, ah, I want a new Power Stone game. What the hell, Capcom?
2978000	2984000	That and all the Mega Man stuff, of course, but seriously, a new Power Stone game would be awesome.
2984000	2986000	That's a series you need to reboot.
2986000	2996000	Hey, you know what, Capcom? I mean, you could put out like a billion versions of Street Fighter 4 and stuff, but how about a new Power Stone game?
2996000	3004000	Just saying. Or, hey, how about just bring Power Stone to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network?
3004000	3006000	How hard would that be?
3006000	3007000	Power Stone all the things.
3007000	3009000	I agree with that.
3009000	3015000	Akuma JP in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com who lives in Japan says, we don't care, Rob.
3015000	3021000	That's my point exactly. That concerns me a little bit because that means Sony is running unopposed practically in Japan.
3021000	3028000	Yes, there's Nintendo, but we all know Sony's hardware is packing a bigger punch and Nintendo's marching to the beat of their own drums.
3028000	3030000	So it's a very different sort of contest.
3030000	3036000	So you're telling me that Xbox is a non-factor in Japan. I'm not sure how that helps Microsoft.
3036000	3045000	You know what I mean? Isn't the competition supposed to be a good thing? I don't know. I feel like that's a hugely missed opportunity.
3045000	3051000	And Akuma JP goes on to say, Xbox 360 is dead here in Japan, so why should we get another brick?
3051000	3054000	Microsoft needs to convince you to get another brick.
3054000	3060000	Another negative-ish comment in our chat that I think is worth bringing up.
3060000	3065000	SDG100Matt says, Microsoft failed when they made it painfully obvious that they've killed the Kinect.
3065000	3070000	Has Microsoft killed the Kinect? I'll tell you on the show floor, they did demo over on the side.
3070000	3072000	They had a big old Kinect station for Fantasia.
3072000	3074000	Yeah, that's right. They did bring that up.
3074000	3078000	And on the flip side, they had Dance Central, which, you know, they also...
3078000	3079000	Oh, yeah, I forgot about Dance Central.
3079000	3084000	They did bring out Alex Rogopoulos to talk about Dance Central, although it's a download game.
3084000	3087000	I'm sure you caught that. It is not a retail game. It's a download game.
3088000	3093000	Weird because, and this was a very good question that was asked on our interactive coverage,
3093000	3095000	that I unfortunately was not able to get the answer to this question,
3095000	3099000	but will it work with all my existing Dance Central songs?
3099000	3103000	Because I'm a little worried about a digital-only $10 title that only has 10 songs,
3103000	3110000	because Konami did that on the 360, and its big drawback was that there wasn't really enough variety.
3110000	3111000	There wasn't enough songs on it.
3111000	3116000	I could see it. I don't know about it being able to transfer the songs that are actually on the disc,
3116000	3121000	but maybe DLC might be compatible with it. Maybe.
3121000	3122000	Perhaps. I hope.
3122000	3125000	Harmonix is pretty good about getting that stuff to work, you know, together.
3125000	3132000	They are, but my concern is the fact that we've gone from 360 to the 1, so that's my worry.
3132000	3134000	That's probably not going to be compatible with it.
3134000	3138000	Is it going to be able to go into the store and know I've bought these songs, so it'll bring them in?
3138000	3141000	It should. Yeah, it should, but are they going to put the effort in?
3141000	3146000	They'll just use the excuse, well, the stores are separate, sort of. We can't do that.
3146000	3152000	I did watch Dance Central for a little bit. I was not willing to walk in there and make a fool out of myself dancing
3152000	3158000	in that very public environment, but I will say the game looked very similar to the previous Dance Central games,
3158000	3162000	except the backgrounds, instead of being like you're in one static subway or whatever,
3162000	3166000	it seemed to be a little more music video to me, where you'd be in a subway,
3166000	3169000	and then the background would kind of shift, and now it's like lasers and things like that.
3169000	3175000	So it did feel like that little extra being in the 1 kind of let the visuals pop a little more,
3175000	3177000	especially with what was going on in the background.
3177000	3181000	But at its core, it really is that fundamental Dance Central game, which isn't a bad thing.
3181000	3186000	I mean, it's a great series for the Kinect, and the 1 will benefit from having it.
3186000	3189000	I just worry about the whole digital-only thing, so we'll see.
3189000	3194000	TigerClaw in our chat asking, did Harmonix show the new Amplitude at E3?
3194000	3198000	Not out on the floor where it was visible. I don't know if they had anything in a meeting room or something like that,
3198000	3202000	but I would think it's still too early. I mean, that thing just got funded,
3202000	3207000	and I think any concept stuff they had, they already put out there to get the Kickstarter funded,
3207000	3209000	so I don't think there was really anything new to say.
3209000	3214000	Well, that and they don't have a publisher for it, and I don't think Harmonix had their own booth,
3214000	3216000	so where would it be?
3216000	3224000	So yeah, those were my only things about Microsoft. Although I think, yes, there are games,
3224000	3230000	I am motivated to get an Xbox One. I did play Forza Horizon 2 on the show floor, I should mention that as well,
3230000	3235000	which the only unfortunate thing about that demo is I wasn't able to turn the cheats on and off.
3235000	3241000	That's the greatest thing about the first game is that if I suck at drifting, I'll just have the game drift for me.
3241000	3248000	Well, I couldn't do that in the demo, so I was having some problems, but the soundtrack, awesome, which you'd expect.
3248000	3251000	I do like the ability to be able to cut through anything.
3252000	3256000	Yeah, lots of off-road, the races were going off the road and all that too.
3256000	3261000	The weather effect was pretty cool, I gotta say, as you're racing and then all of a sudden it starts raining, it was nice.
3261000	3267000	So yeah, I think, and I know there's plenty of Forza Horizon fans out there in OLR land,
3267000	3273000	I think everything you guys are thinking it's going to be on Xbox One, you're going to get it, so that's exciting.
3273000	3275000	I hope they do some type of bundle for it.
3276000	3279000	I think that's all I want to say about Microsoft.
3279000	3283000	I want to check in with Dark Soccer, I don't know if there's anything we've been saying or whatever,
3283000	3285000	but anything perk your ears with the Microsoft stuff?
3285000	3287000	Nope, still don't care.
3287000	3288000	Still don't care?
3288000	3289000	Still don't care.
3289000	3290000	Why?
3290000	3293000	I just haven't seen anything that excites me.
3293000	3296000	The stuff that I want is coming out on Wii U.
3297000	3301000	Could that possibly be the point I made a minute ago about the lack of,
3301000	3306000	because if I go into your vault, a lot of the games are imported from Japan,
3306000	3311000	so could that tie into the fact that Microsoft seems to be ignoring the Japanese audience?
3311000	3312000	Possibly.
3312000	3315000	They're just not putting out the kind of games I give a shit about.
3315000	3319000	I mean, really, I really am more into the quirky games.
3319000	3327000	I like JRPGs, I like, I really, yeah, they're just not putting out anything they really care about.
3328000	3330000	I don't like Halo.
3330000	3331000	That's fair.
3331000	3333000	I don't like Fable.
3334000	3337000	I don't really like many car games.
3337000	3341000	I don't like, you know, war games.
3341000	3342000	Well, that's...
3342000	3343000	So, no.
3343000	3347000	That's fair, everybody's got what they like and what they don't, you're not alone.
3347000	3352000	A system is only as interesting as the games I want to buy for it.
3352000	3355000	Somebody in chat gave him an F, so you're not the only one.
3355000	3357000	They don't get an F, they get a big stinky poop.
3357000	3360000	All right, well, I will say this, though, for better or for worse,
3360000	3363000	because I want to make sure this gets touched on before I let Loki go on to the next one.
3363000	3370000	The games at their booth was not only the Sunset Overdrive, the Forza Horizon, and some of these things,
3370000	3373000	but they did have a big section for indie games.
3373000	3376000	And there was certainly that push, you know, to show that there are the indie games,
3376000	3381000	and they had that moment during the show where they were talking about the X, not XNA,
3381000	3384000	but Project, what is that called on the Xbox?
3385000	3386000	Project TNA.
3386000	3387000	No, somebody will say it in the chat.
3387000	3388000	No, I know what you're talking about.
3388000	3389000	But their indie movement, right?
3389000	3390000	Yeah.
3390000	3393000	And so they had some things on the show floor, like Threes was one of the big ones,
3393000	3395000	because obviously that's a big iPhone game.
3395000	3397000	That is a head scratcher.
3397000	3402000	I mean, yeah, I understand, you know, the big, the draw is that you can play it in a window or something like that.
3402000	3403000	Yeah.
3403000	3404000	While you're watching TV.
3404000	3405000	Yeah.
3405000	3406000	Yeah.
3406000	3407000	Well, there you go.
3407000	3411000	So I did appreciate, though, that they gave a lot of space to indies,
3411000	3420000	but I honestly truly feel the reason for it is because they didn't have a lot of stuff they wanted to put out there on the show floor otherwise.
3420000	3424000	So give the space to people that do want to be out there putting their games public facing.
3424000	3426000	Again, control, right?
3426000	3427000	Control.
3427000	3428000	Okay, that's Microsoft.
3428000	3429000	What's up next?
3429000	3433000	You know, speaking of Microsoft real quick, and actually this kind of goes with Sony, too,
3433000	3439000	is I'm surprised that, you know, their versions of Minecraft that they have for, like, you know, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
3439000	3442000	don't have some sort of, like, graphical, like, enhancement to it.
3442000	3446000	Like, you know how they have the Sonic Ether shaders that look fucking amazing and stuff?
3446000	3450000	It's like you'd think they'd be able to pull that off to make it look a little bit shinier.
3450000	3452000	They just say, eh, fuck it.
3452000	3453000	Yeah.
3453000	3457000	I mean, I understand part of the charm is that it's not.
3457000	3461000	No, but I understand it still can look that way and look fantastic.
3461000	3462000	No, I got you.
3462000	3463000	Whatever.
3463000	3464000	Maybe the next Minecraft 2 or whatever.
3464000	3465000	Sony.
3465000	3468000	So Sony, they had some interesting stuff to show off first.
3468000	3470000	Of course, you know, talking a little bit about Destiny.
3470000	3477000	They have a, you know, a Destiny bundle that's coming with a white PlayStation 4 in September with the launch of the game.
3477000	3484000	Some DLC for Infamous Second Son that follows Abigail Walker.
3484000	3491000	They also, surprisingly, showed off LittleBigPlanet 3, which I thought was pretty sweet.
3492000	3501000	And not only is LittleBigPlanet 3 going to have Sackboy, but there was also other characters in there as well, which I thought looked very interesting.
3501000	3504000	I did get to play LittleBigPlanet 3 on the show floor.
3504000	3506000	And the demo, Bobby and I both played it.
3506000	3513000	And the demo featured only one of the new characters, Toggle, who switches between a big fat guy and a tiny little thing.
3513000	3516000	So, like, get it? Toggle. You go between the two.
3516000	3517000	So that was kind of neat.
3517000	3522000	I like how those new characters all add new mechanics to the game.
3522000	3528000	Because you have to really consider the weight of the character is are you going to float or are you going to sink in water?
3528000	3533000	Or are you going to cause, you know, a platform to sink to launch you in the air when you toggle?
3533000	3537000	Like, it did bring something new to LittleBigPlanet.
3537000	3543000	I think if you already have your mind made up on this franchise, like, because I know some people that are like,
3543000	3547000	eh, I'm not into LittleBigPlanet as a platformer, it kind of controls weird to me.
3547000	3552000	I don't think what they're doing in LittleBigPlanet 3 is going to win you over.
3552000	3554000	But I personally think LittleBigPlanet is fantastic.
3554000	3559000	I think it's a solid platformer and I like this direction they're going in.
3559000	3566000	Yeah, and it looks like the major difference from this game versus the other games aside from the other characters is that they have more depth in there now.
3566000	3570000	They have a lot of stuff that goes in, you know, towards the background and everything.
3570000	3573000	The camera can shift back there, so it looks a little different.
3573000	3577000	And, you know, like one of the questions I asked, you know, is all the DLC available?
3577000	3585000	And they even said that all the levels online are currently compatible with that and they're going to look even better, so I think that's pretty cool.
3585000	3587000	So, of course, they have that.
3587000	3593000	They showed off a new game from From Software, which is called Bloodborne, and that looked pretty sweet.
3593000	3597000	You know, if you're a fan of Dead Rising, not Dead Rising.
3598000	3599000	Dark Souls.
3599000	3603000	Dark Souls, yes. I was thinking the other one.
3603000	3608000	Anyways, and then of course, let's see, Far Cry 4.
3608000	3614000	They showed a little bit of that during the conference and that looks amazing.
3614000	3620000	Of course, more of that was shown at the Ubisoft press conference, but that looks like a pretty impressive game.
3620000	3623000	That's kind of a must-have for me, I think.
3623000	3629000	Also, they teased, what is it, Dead Island 2, which looks pretty awesome.
3629000	3633000	I think it's going to take place in California now, which is not an island, but whatever.
3633000	3635000	Technicalities?
3635000	3640000	We actually went to a presentation for Dead Island 2 and got to see the game.
3640000	3644000	We got to see the game, not just the trailer, but they showed us an early build of the graphic engine.
3644000	3652000	And you guys know I had my issues with Dead Island Riptide, so I have to really withhold judgment on Dead Island 2 until the game is actually out.
3652000	3659000	I will say, graphically, it looks like they've made that big step up, and I think that is because they're on Unreal 4 now.
3659000	3661000	They changed their engine.
3661000	3669000	But what we saw was a pretty cool, like, it's these guys in a car and the car is driving into the town and then they kind of go.
3669000	3680000	They get in a war with other humans, so they have other humans and zombies that are both against you.
3680000	3684000	So you can lure the zombies into killing the other humans that are the enemies.
3684000	3689000	It creates this very interesting kind of three-faction game, which I think is kind of part of the twist.
3689000	3691000	It sounds like Dead Rising, almost.
3691000	3700000	Yeah, in a way. But the whole trick is that the town that they're in isn't quarantined, so it is an island, because it's been quarantined.
3700000	3705000	Or maybe California finally fell into the ocean.
3706000	3712000	Perhaps, but it's very a parody of Hollywood Hills and Santa Monica and all that stuff.
3712000	3720000	They mentioned, of course, that there's going to be a re-release of Grim Fandango.
3720000	3724000	That's something we've redone, I guess, for PlayStation 4 and Vita, which is pretty exciting.
3724000	3736000	That's more than pretty exciting. That was a great example of a WTF OMG moment that I sadly didn't get so much at a Microsoft conference.
3736000	3738000	That was great.
3740000	3745000	They were talking about Disney Infinity 2.0, and they're going to have a collector's edition.
3745000	3749000	I guess it's going to have Hulk in there for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, which I guess is neat.
3749000	3752000	It's something that separates them a little bit.
3754000	3760000	Of course, one of the more interesting things in there is that they finally did announce that, hey, guess what?
3760000	3767000	PlayStation Vita TV is coming to North America as PlayStation TV, and I think also Europe.
3767000	3781000	Now it's just PlayStation TV. You can get it for $99 or $139, and it comes with the Lego Movie video game and a DualShock 3 controller for $139.
3781000	3790000	So that's pretty awesome. Not only that, but there is also going to be a Vita version of Disney Infinity, so you can buy that for that as well.
3790000	3798000	I don't know. That's kind of interesting. I'm kind of thinking of maybe getting one, because I like the Vita games, but I just don't really want a Vita.
3798000	3806000	I've heard a lot of people really upset that Sony dropped the Vita branding from that device. I find that very interesting.
3806000	3813000	Something, if you're one of those people that's upset about that, I want you to consider who Sony's competitor really is with that device.
3813000	3815000	Well, not only that.
3815000	3816000	It's Apple.
3816000	3826000	Well, not only that, though, they're incorporating that PlayStation TV into other devices, including televisions. That's why they've dropped the Vita TV thing.
3826000	3837000	Right. And that thing is going to cost just as much as an Apple TV, so that's going to cause Apple to kind of have to step up their game in regards to the gaming on that device and so forth.
3837000	3847000	So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. I did get a chance to play Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls on a PlayStation 4, but through the TV.
3847000	3855000	They had some of those systems set up where you were actually playing on the PlayStation TV, where it was streaming from a PlayStation 4 that was elsewhere.
3855000	3861000	Probably locked away under the thing, but still, streaming from one device to the other. It actually played pretty well.
3861000	3870000	You would see artifacting every few seconds. You would see that. The image is downsampled to 720, but I think most people don't even really notice.
3870000	3876000	Well, in artifacting, it could have been from all that Wi-Fi bouncing around in there, because there's a ton of fucking shit going on in there.
3876000	3890000	I know Bobby was playing Drive Club on the same setup, and he saw a lot more of the artifacting, but when you think of a high-speed racer, the signal there has got to be a lot more data going through than a dungeon crawler like Diablo, where the image doesn't change as often.
3890000	3904000	So I found the experience to be fine. I was like, okay, yeah. I just personally don't think I really have a need for one, because I don't have a family where more than one person is trying to use the devices or whatever.
3904000	3911000	So I'm not sure I see the situation where I need one yet, but I think it's great for other people.
3911000	3921000	There's a brand new game from Suda51 called Let It Die. That was another thing that was announced that they kind of showed off there.
3921000	3931000	Also, the game streaming stuff will be coming to YouTube, so they're going to have that option available at some point.
3931000	3949000	And then, what else? I'm trying to think. Oh, yeah, of course. They showed a trailer for Grand Theft Auto 5 for the next-gen console, which we knew was coming to me, and PC, so that was pretty exciting.
3949000	3955000	Also, of course, confirming The Last of Us Remastered, which will be coming out at the end of July for PlayStation 4.
3955000	3966000	They have Ratchet and Clank Redux, which I guess is going to be a remade game for PlayStation 4, and also along with the movie that will be coming out as well.
3966000	3976000	And, of course, they announced Uncharted 4 A Thief's End, which will be coming to PlayStation 4 as well.
3977000	3984000	And then, my personal favorite out of the whole thing is they showed a new trailer for No Man's Sky, which looks amazing.
3984000	3990000	That did look pretty sweet, and a lot of people were really into that. What's the why in there for you? Why did that look great to you?
3990000	4003000	Why? Because it's just the whole fact that it's such an immersive game. It's basically all this procedurally generated universe, and it's seamless, flying from one planet to space to another planet.
4003000	4008000	It just seems really interesting, and just the tech behind it and everything.
4008000	4022000	The way they've made it sound is it might be a little bit like a DayZ or Rust or something like that, where you're playing with other players, and so you may encounter people that are hostile, or people that help you out, and that kind of stuff.
4022000	4024000	So, it sounds interesting.
4025000	4034000	Yeah, I thought that game looked really good, too. I wish there had been more of it at the show. I'm thinking it's still going to be a while before that game is actually out, but it sounded really good.
4034000	4035000	Yeah.
4036000	4038000	Anything else you want to say about Sony's conference?
4039000	4053000	I missed the last half, so I had to watch it later on so I didn't get to see it live, but I thought they had, I guess, some good, like, hey, and some more stuff we're going to show off that was kind of exciting.
4053000	4063000	I'm a little disappointed that The Last Guardian wasn't shown, but people kind of assumed that it wasn't going to be shown since there was a whole controversy that had been cancelled, and then it wasn't.
4063000	4064000	Yep.
4064000	4065000	So, I don't know.
4065000	4076000	Interesting as well that Square Enix was completely absent. I mean, I know that they came out and said they weren't going to do anything with Final Fantasy XV or Kingdom Hearts III this year, but you still couldn't help but feel like there was a loss.
4076000	4080000	Like, you just sort of expect that Square Enix is going to pop up at Sony's conference and show something.
4080000	4083000	I expect to see some more of that stuff probably for, um...
4083000	4084000	Tokyo Game Show.
4084000	4085000	Tokyo Game Show, yeah.
4085000	4086000	Yeah.
4086000	4093000	It is disappointing that we didn't see any more Final Fantasy XV gameplay. I would have liked to have seen that, but, um, whatever.
4093000	4097000	Yeah, I agree with you on that. That was too bad, but, yeah, it's kind of one of those.
4097000	4108000	Well, it's also disappointing, too, that it's not announced like, oh, it's coming out later this year or something like that, you know, because I was kind of hoping that either one of those would come out, but I guess not.
4108000	4117000	Especially, you know, Kingdom Hearts, you kind of figure it wouldn't since, you know, 2.5 Redux isn't coming out until December, so you're kind of like, eh, it's probably not coming out this year.
4117000	4130000	So, I had a great opportunity, and I must admit, in the first time in the ten years I've been going to E3, I was able to attend one of the press conferences live, and Sony was the press conference I was able to go to, so thanks to Sony for having us there.
4130000	4146000	It was pretty cool. Myself and Bobby and some of the other indie podcasters like NinjaSista from ElectricSistaHood and some of the people she travels with, we all kind of went in there and we went right into the place, and we just kept walking and walking, because they weren't, like, there was no roped off areas or whatever,
4146000	4155000	so we walked all the way down onto the floor, and I was, like, in the thirteenth row, so it was really cool to, like, kind of just be there and see it all kind of in person and, you know, just kind of experience all that.
4155000	4169000	I still walked out of there, though, certainly with pros and cons. The pros that I have is that I really think there was a great variety of games. I thought there was a lot of stuff being shown that's like, yes, I want that, yes, I want that.
4169000	4181000	I love that they brought up VibRibbon, but they showed, okay, but this was so, they showed VibRibbon, right, when they were introducing that one guy who's, like, you know, and then they went nowhere with it.
4181000	4188000	I was, like, they were hyping up how great VibRibbon was, and remember this classic and da-da-da, and then I was expecting them to say...
4188000	4190000	It didn't come out over here, really.
4190000	4197000	Exactly, right, and I was expecting them to say, and you should check this out on PlayStation Store today. Ah, it didn't happen.
4197000	4206000	So it's, like, don't tease me like that. I was mean. I was very mean to VibRibbon fans everywhere, Jamie. I had a sad for everybody with that.
4206000	4219000	One of my favorite moments of the entire press conference was the game Entwined, which I think was the third game that they showed, that was that whole, this game is out right now on the Sony Store.
4219000	4232000	What I loved about it, they were all students, fresh out of college, you know, they gave that whole, like, background about how they were all just fresh out of their master's program, and they basically started this new studio that's under Sony's wings.
4232000	4238000	Half of the individuals on the stage were women, which was very refreshing to see. They were playing the game. It was a good mix of everybody.
4238000	4251000	So it had a great story. Indie, out today, surprise, going for that art thing that maybe Sony's worried they might be losing with that game company thing this year.
4251000	4259000	So that was definitely a moment that I liked. I did check out the game when I got home. I'm still formulating my thoughts on it, so I'll talk about it at a later show.
4259000	4274000	I think the game itself is kind of, it needs some more exposition in some parts. Like, I was having a very hard time understanding the why in some parts of the game, but hopefully it's one of those games like Journey where maybe it's kind of explained better at the end.
4274000	4277000	And you get to go to a concert.
4277000	4278000	What's that?
4278000	4282000	And you get to go to a concert. Sorry, I was thinking of The Other Journey.
4282000	4291000	The Other Journey. But anyway, all that aside, the presentation at the conference, I still liked an awful lot, and I liked how they did that.
4291000	4302000	And that kind of leads me to say that one of the cons for the Sony conference for me, I thought the first half was way stronger than the second half, which isn't the way things are supposed to be.
4302000	4316000	You're supposed to have all your stuff at the end, but I thought the first half was better. And I'm going to be honest, that whole presentation where the guy came out to talk about the Playstation TV show that just got greenlit brought everything to a screeching halt.
4316000	4329000	And you could feel it in the room. And you could feel like all the people around me were kind of like, okay, I mean it's like one of those games, we like this guy, we respect this guy, this is cool sounding, but everybody's just like, get on with it. This isn't going anywhere.
4329000	4331000	Oh yeah, it was, was it Powers or something?
4331000	4351000	Powers, yeah. The problem with Powers is that they had nothing to show. Not only did they do the TV thing that Microsoft got crucified for a year ago, you know, and even the people I was sitting with were like, oh yeah, sure, Microsoft's going to get an earful over when they talk about TV, but Sony's not going to get an earful over this.
4351000	4363000	Nope, Sony got an earful about it because a lot of people didn't like that. What was most disappointing to me about that, although I understand that Sony wanted to make the point about, yay, we have this TV show, yay, it's coming, they had nothing to show for it, but concept art.
4363000	4374000	Hey, here's a wonderful idea. How about you announce something like that at, I don't know, Comic Con that's coming up, you know, in like a month. I mean, why now? Yeah. And he talked way too long about it.
4375000	4384000	Uh, Black Wolf is correcting me in chat saying it's not indie, it's a Sony owned studio. So I apologize I misspoke because I thought I did say it was a Sony owned studio that is Sony kind of backing it.
4384000	4398000	So it isn't indie in that regard, but it still had that kind of indie cred feel to it is what I meant because it was all these students that they were really taking right under the wing and bringing into this. And again, a very diverse group that was on the stage.
4398000	4400000	That was great to see.
4400000	4402000	Wait, that was Bendis on stage, was it?
4402000	4404000	Uh, during the Powers thing, yeah.
4404000	4405000	Yeah, he's awesome.
4405000	4409000	Yes, but unfortunately in this context, he brought everything to a screeching halt.
4409000	4412000	See, that's something I would have done as a separate announcement.
4412000	4429000	Yeah, or just tighten it up a little. Tighten it up a little. It went on too long. So that was a little bit of a minus for me. But otherwise, there was a lot of stuff I kind of walked out being really jazzed about. Maybe I'll roll this over to part B, but I want to talk about the Morpheus for sure later on.
4429000	4434000	And also, the other thing was PlayStation Now going into beta on July 31st.
4434000	4441000	Which I got a code for that, so I checked that out this week too, and it plays pretty well.
4441000	4454000	There's not a lot of... the games on there right now is not a lot of stuff I think you'd be like, yay, I really want to play this game. But it's enough on there to test the service and see how it responds.
4455000	4457000	And it works pretty well, I got to say.
4457000	4459000	Anything else on Sony's conference?
4459000	4460000	Nope, that's it.
4460000	4467000	Loki, I'm going to ask you the same question I asked you before. Dark Soccer, if you want to jump in too, did it sell you on a PlayStation 4? I already have one, so I can't answer this question.
4467000	4482000	I already wanted a PlayStation 4, and see, that's the thing. I'd want a PlayStation 4 for games that are maybe on both systems, but there wasn't anything that they showed at that conference that was exclusively PlayStation 4 that I must have.
4482000	4488000	That was the thing. So, no, not really. They didn't really sell me on anything with what they had.
4488000	4495000	And that's the thing, maybe I'll hold off on a PlayStation 4 and just get an Xbox One first or something, which is kind of the complete opposite of what I was thinking.
4495000	4506000	But it's, where are the games that I want to play? Are they on one system or the other system? So I'll pick whatever platform the games are on.
4507000	4516000	But then again, I don't really have to have that stuff right away, because, you know, Forza Horizon 2 is kind of the only thing that's coming, I guess that and Sunset Overdrive.
4516000	4527000	But yeah, PlayStation, there wasn't really anything that I have to have to have, although it would be nice to be able to play all that stuff I have on my backlog as far as, you know, PlayStation Plus stuff.
4528000	4537000	And then, you know, I'd be interested to see what, they're supposed to have something exclusive for Grand Theft Auto 5 on PlayStation 4, so I'd be interested to see what that is.
4537000	4547000	But really, there wasn't anything exclusive, because I don't play Uncharted. Little Big Planet, I'm kind of done with that series just because I didn't play 2, and I don't know.
4547000	4548000	Yeah, I don't know.
4548000	4550000	You might miss out. What about The Order or some of those other stuff?
4550000	4559000	Order I don't give a shit about. I don't know. It's just, there wasn't really anything that was must-have, I think, for me.
4559000	4561000	Jamie, quick thoughts?
4561000	4571000	I'm really still unimpressed. I mean, actually, I am really interested in Powers, because I, alright, Bendis wrote one of my favorite comic series ever, which was Alias.
4571000	4580000	It has nothing to do with the TV show Alias and The Pulse, which I will, to this day, rant about. So I really enjoy his writing, and I'd like to see more from him.
4580000	4581000	Okay.
4581000	4592000	Other than that, I kind of don't care. For me, it's, I'm gonna wait and wait till the games are out and maybe play them and then decide if that's worth spending money on.
4592000	4596000	But I've already decided what it is I want to get out of the season, so.
4596000	4606000	Okay. I will say this to Sony's credit. I want to also mention at their booth, they also had a large chunk of indie games, actual indie games.
4606000	4618000	They had a big chunk of them there, and I was very impressed. One of the games I got my hands on, because I saw this at the booth, and Xtafer always, my buddy over at Horde House, he always talks about this game on Twitter and how much he loves Assault Android Cactus.
4618000	4633000	Well, it's coming to PlayStation 4. It's like a, it's a Smash TV-esque kind of game, but it has, you know, different elements. It's, you know, polygon and space, and you have these things where you can switch weapons, and you do a jump dodge when you switch weapons.
4633000	4640000	That helps you get out of things. You have flamethrowers and stuff. So, fun little game. I liked it. I enjoyed it, and I was very impressed that the guy was asking me,
4640000	4650000	Oh, what do you think? You know, what do you think of the game and so forth? And I noticed he had an Australian accent, and he mentioned, Oh yeah, this game was developed in Australia. I'm one of the guys who worked on it.
4650000	4658000	So I thought that was really cool that Sony not only had the indie games on display in their booth, they had some of the guys who made them there to be the ones demoing them.
4658000	4668000	And if you listen to what I said earlier, that's what I loved most out of E3 this year, is when the people that made the games were actually there, kind of demoing them and showing that passion they have for the games.
4668000	4676000	So I was very excited about that, and hopefully getting them on a future edition of the show when the game gets a little closer to launch on PlayStation 4, because it was a lot of fun.
4676000	4682000	And it's something that is on Steam right now, but I think obviously PlayStation 4 will open it up to a different audience.
4682000	4690000	But yeah, very impressed with the number of indies in Sony's booth as well. That's it for Sony.
4690000	4692000	Should we jump ahead to Nintendo then?
4692000	4703000	Yeah, sure, why not. Nintendo, they of course have a press conference, but they have their live video direct thing, which started off really strange.
4703000	4716000	Not typical for Nintendo. They started off with animations by Robot Chicken, which I thought was very unique.
4716000	4724000	And they had also this thing where there was a fight between Reggie and Iwata. I thought that was pretty cool.
4724000	4730000	They were having fun with it, and that's kind of the vibe.
4730000	4733000	Are you saying you kind of enjoyed Nintendo's presentation?
4733000	4746000	Yeah, I enjoyed it. Some of the stuff I still don't get. They showed off their miniature figures, and seriously, what the fuck is up with Nintendo and naming shit?
4746000	4754000	Amiibo is the dumbest fucking name for... I mean, it's different, but yeah, it's just... what?
4755000	4765000	I thought it was supposed to be a play on the word Amigo, like the Spanish word for friend. I thought that's what it was.
4765000	4772000	But maybe it was just me. I don't know. That's what I got out of it. And certainly me being in the title was important too.
4772000	4777000	Yes. So they have these figures now that are going to tie in with Smash Brothers. They're called Amiibo.
4777000	4792000	And what they basically are is you use them with your tablet, and it creates this computer-controlled character that you can fight with, fight against, fight for you.
4792000	4799000	And you train it like I guess you would Pokemon or something. It levels up, and you can use it in other games, I guess.
4799000	4804000	And one of the games that it's going to be patched into later on is Mario Kart 8. They're supposed to have support for that there.
4804000	4808000	I don't really know how that's going to work, but okay.
4808000	4821000	Of course, they showed a little bit about Smash Brothers. The 3DS version they announced the date for, so October 3rd for that, which is not really in the window that they originally had, which was summer, but okay, whatever.
4822000	4831000	They showed off Yoshi's Woolly World, which is the kind of Yarn Yoshi game that's going to be for Wii U. That's not coming out until next year.
4831000	4838000	Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, which is coming out for the Wii U this holiday.
4838000	4850000	They showed off Hyrule Warriors, which is going to be September. A little trailer for Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby, which I guess was in November.
4850000	4861000	Bayonetta 2 for Wii U. They confirmed that it will be out this year in October, and not only that, but it will be coming with the original Bayonetta game as well, so that's pretty exciting.
4861000	4870000	That was a good wow moment, because how I was supposed to get into Bayonetta 2 if I've never played one. That's great that they did that.
4871000	4883000	Kirby's Rainbow Curse. They announced that that's kind of a claymation looking game coming to the Wii U. That's 2015 as well.
4883000	4898000	A brand new franchise, or I guess IP they announced, which is Splatoon, which is kind of interesting. It was Miyamoto's game, and it's a four on four third person shooter game,
4898000	4907000	but it has these school girl looking things that are actually like squids. They transform into this little girl, and they're running around shooting ink.
4907000	4917000	When you're in your own ink, you move faster, and you can transform into a squid and move faster. The whole object of the game is who can cover more of the map with your own color.
4917000	4924000	It's a shooter in that sense, and it was pretty interesting. I watched a lot of that during their live coverage, and it looks like an interesting game.
4924000	4931000	It's multiplayer only, which is definitely, knowing Nintendo's track record, different.
4931000	4938000	Wouldn't that be something? That is the whole online shebang and everything too, which I believe, because I think they talked about what voice chat is supposed to be, right?
4938000	4951000	I know that's a title that Nintendo fans are getting really excited about because it's a shooter game that's not all the stuff that comes with a shooter game.
4951000	4956000	It's Nintendo's very definite spin on that idea, which is pretty cool.
4956000	4965000	They confirmed Mario Maker, which is for the Wii U, and you'll be able to make your own Super Mario Bros. levels, both original and new Super Mario Bros. U style.
4965000	4974000	Act F is jumping in in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, saying Splatoon isn't made by Miyamoto. It's actually made by the Animal Crossing guy, if I recall correctly.
4974000	4976000	It's under his supervision.
4976000	4980000	Miyamoto, they're stretching him really thin, it sounds like right now.
4980000	4984000	Just some other quick comments about Nintendo, because I want to make sure we're getting our chatters to listen here.
4984000	4992000	Tigerclaw says, the Captain Toad game is really interesting. Nintendo literally took one of the highlights of Super Mario 3D World and turned it into a full game.
4992000	5000000	You have to kind of wonder if that was the plan the whole time. It was a backdoor pilot, as they call it in television. I don't know, it's very interesting.
5001000	5009000	Dark Tetsuya is saying, I'm curious about the integration of Mario Kart 8 with those figures. So, some of the comments there.
5009000	5012000	Well, I'm sure it's just going to be AI Racers is what it's going to be.
5012000	5020000	I personally, not to backtrack, but I wasn't completely convinced what those figures are really supposed to do.
5020000	5029000	That's exactly my thing. I don't know why they would have been better off having a Wii U Pokemon game that had Pokemon amiibos or whatever.
5029000	5032000	And then that would have been like, oh, sweet, I can trade my Pokemon.
5032000	5040000	But, there's still that part of me that's like, sweet, official Nintendo figures that I can have up on the shelf. I'm kind of excited about that.
5040000	5046000	I think that they're supposed to work with Swap Force or somehow it's got some compatibility with Swap Force in there as well.
5046000	5050000	I don't know if you're going to be able to play as Mario in Swap Force or something like that on the Wii U.
5050000	5052000	That might be a stretch, but we'll see.
5052000	5061000	Anyways, they showed off Xenoblade Chronicles X or Cross or whatever you're going to call it, and that's coming out in 2015.
5061000	5070000	And of course, they announced that Paulina from Kid Icarus is going to be a playable character as well.
5070000	5077000	And then, of course, the big hopefully expected surprise was they showed off the new Zelda game release.
5077000	5080000	They showed off a trailer for it, and it looks fucking amazing.
5080000	5084000	Seriously, that's going to sell me a Wii U for sure.
5084000	5093000	Because it's what I wanted. It's a cel-shaded, Wind Waker-like game that looks like the fucking universe from Link to the Past.
5093000	5097000	That's what I wanted. That was my Zelda game right there. There you go. There it was.
5097000	5101000	So when that comes out, I'll have to get a Wii U. But until then, maybe not.
5101000	5109000	But still, to hear you come on this show, I think a lot of people were waiting for you to get all revved up and go off on Nintendo tonight as you have some years past.
5109000	5115000	You're much more reserved tonight. You seem like a satisfied gamer after Nintendo's conference. Is that correct?
5115000	5120000	It looks impressive. They're saying it's going to be an open world Zelda game.
5120000	5123000	They're like, okay, see those mountains back there? You can go to those mountains if you want.
5123000	5135000	It just looks really impressive. If, and this is the big if, if they can pull off, because it is supposed to be in-engine, but if they can pull off in their final game, what was in that trailer, then cool.
5135000	5141000	Then yeah, that sells out on me. If it's not quite that cool, then we'll see. But it looks really good.
5141000	5145000	Act F wants me to correct you. It's Palutena, not Paletta.
5145000	5148000	Whatever, I don't give a shit. I really don't.
5148000	5151000	Hey, I'm happy to see the Kid Icarus love, to be honest.
5151000	5160000	And then of course, you know, that was only what was in the Direct. They had a ton of shit that didn't even make it in the Direct.
5160000	5167000	Like hardly any 3DS stuff in the Direct, and they were kind of spilling that out, like the Advanced Wars-esque game.
5167000	5174000	Yeah, Project Steam. They had Professor Layton versus Phoenix Wright was going to be coming out.
5174000	5185000	They had this Fantasy Life game that looks like Harvest Moon. On the Wii U, Mario Party 8, or Mario Party 10, I'm sorry, which is kind of like Bowser Party or something.
5185000	5192000	Not really shown there, but they're working on a new Star Fox game, so there's that.
5192000	5199000	Shit, I'm trying to remember what else was in there. They had a new Mario Minis game.
5199000	5203000	Was it Mario versus Donkey Kong or something like that? March of the Minis type thing.
5203000	5207000	Lots of stuff.
5207000	5217000	So let's ask the question, you know, what were the pros and cons, and is this what Nintendo needed to sell more Wii U's, which they need to do?
5217000	5218000	Your thoughts, Loki?
5218000	5230000	Well, I like the way that they presented everything and had that livestream where they had gameplay footage and stuff throughout the whole thing, so you can kind of get in-depth looks at everything.
5230000	5239000	Do you think Nintendo might be ahead of the times with this, that E3 might end up going this direction for everybody in the near future?
5239000	5251000	I think it was a great idea, because coming out of it, because I watched it for most of the three days, and I got a better understanding of what they're coming out with versus some of these other...
5251000	5257000	Cool, I know what Mortal Kombat is, but I didn't really get to see any footage of it.
5257000	5264000	I'm sure I could have watched one of those Spike TV shows or whatever that was doing streaming and stuff, but I ended up watching that most of the time.
5265000	5271000	And watching the Smash Bros. tournament, man, watching everybody get so excited about it, it's gonna be huge, I think.
5271000	5278000	I kind of agree. I think that we're a few years away from Sony and Microsoft going this route.
5278000	5287000	And I think it's gonna r- I mean, some people may not agree with me, and that's fine, but I think this is really turning into something that's really working well for Nintendo.
5287000	5295000	And I think if Sony and Microsoft can look at it and go, wow, we could really save a shit ton of money by going this route and still keep our fans happy and engaged.
5295000	5299000	I kind of think they're gonna go that way, and this could be very interesting for E3 as a show.
5299000	5302000	Here's the problem, though, with Sony and Microsoft doing something like that.
5302000	5314000	Right now, they've made a point with all these Nintendo Directs to make their president and stuff very much a face and just kind of a spokesperson of their products and everything, like Reggie and Miyamoto and all that stuff.
5315000	5324000	You kind of expect them to come out and talk about all this stuff, whereas Microsoft, I don't really expect the head of Microsoft to come out and start talking about new Xbox games.
5324000	5325000	It just doesn't seem-
5325000	5326000	Well, I think Phil Spencer's-
5326000	5328000	Yeah, he's okay.
5328000	5338000	He's getting into that role. He'll be good. And Sony, if Jack Trenton were still there, would certainly have the guy that was capable of doing it. They'll groom somebody else to do it.
5338000	5340000	I guess Major Nelson could do that.
5340000	5343000	Sure. Finding that face isn't that-
5343000	5352000	And if it went in doubt, go to a third party. And Nintendo even did that by integrating the robot chicken and the very tongue-in-cheek, poking fun at themselves stuff that really-
5352000	5358000	I mean, that guy in the audience with the press badge saying, where's Mother 3, losers? And then Reggie's setting him on fire.
5358000	5359000	Yeah, see, that's the thing.
5359000	5362000	That was a pretty awesome moment, although-
5362000	5373000	Well, at the same time, though, they were saying, oh yeah, we're going to have this special announcement for a brand new 3DS game and stuff. I was like, oh man, you watch this, it's going to be Mother 3.
5373000	5382000	And instead it was Project Steam. I was like, eh, I don't fucking care. But I don't know. It was okay. I think that they have a decent lineup.
5382000	5393000	My worry still, though, is they don't have the third party support. And even though they have these great games, and some that are going to be real- I mean, Zelda is going to sell a ton of fucking systems, but it's not until 2015.
5393000	5398000	And most likely holiday 2015. That's a lot of time for them to lose market share.
5398000	5418000	I painfully agree. There's a lot that I really love about what Nintendo's doing, and I think a lot of these games sound great, but it's like, when you spread these games out between now and holiday 2015, which is the reality of the library we're seeing, only the Wii U stuff. 3DS is a whole other thing.
5418000	5419000	3DS is fine.
5420000	5430000	It's fine. When you look at the Wii U specifically, I have that same reservation. You know, last week I talked on the show about what's the Hail Mary play going to be, and for better or worse, Nintendo didn't make one.
5430000	5437000	They're sticking to their guns, so they could reveal more, peel back the onion a little more at Tokyo Game Show.
5437000	5442000	There's still- was it Gamescom that they could announce more stuff, but I just-
5442000	5451000	Here's the thing at the end of the day. I think it's great that they've got Miyamoto working on these gamepad-heavy games that really are going to show the console.
5452000	5467000	It would have- and I love Miyamoto, guys, don't get me wrong, but it would have had five times more the impact if it had been, here is Ubisoft showing us how they are going to use the gamepads on their games.
5468000	5481000	Insert whatever third party you want there in that example I just gave. I would have been a little more excited about that, because that would be more games to fill in these long gaps we're going to have between the Splatoon, the Mario Maker, and so on.
5481000	5492000	Well, that's the thing too, it's like- not getting Miyamoto, but the stuff that they were showing, like his project robot, big robot game or whatever, kind of like dumb.
5492000	5500000	Like, I just didn't get it. It looked like something like, okay, cool, that's going to be another minigame that's on the next Nintendo Land or something like that.
5500000	5513000	So, it just wasn't doing it for me. I'm not excited about that. It wasn't like, here's this really unique idea for a game that we came up with, but now it's like, here's this game, it's a robot fighting game.
5513000	5521000	It seriously reminded me of Tank! Tank! Tank! I'm like, well, I was kind of excited about that and it came out and it really sucked.
5522000	5530000	Yeah, I'm not a big fan of this giant robot fighting thing that you're- I think you're wasting time on this, you know? It's what it makes me feel like.
5530000	5540000	There is a lot to get excited about with Nintendo, don't get me wrong, and I have to admit, I kind of walked out of it going, they make a great argument for being the second console in your house.
5540000	5555000	They make an amazing argument for being the second console in your house, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, I think Nintendo would be in a great position if every household had a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One and a Wii U, right?
5555000	5565000	That would be a great- that's kind of what the Wii was for a lot of people, was a lot of the gamers' second console, but it's just really about kind of convincing that, you know, people need to get one already.
5565000	5576000	Also, some of their- like, I've got to knock Reggie a little bit for some of his comments he made regarding like questions, you know, hey, are you guys gonna, you know, start supporting, you know, Twitch streaming or something like that on your console?
5576000	5588000	And, you know, instead of maybe- I guess it would be wrong for him to say that the hardware's not powerful enough to support Twitch streaming because that's probably the situation, but, you know, he's like, well, it's just not fun.
5589000	5599000	Twitch streaming's just not fun, so that's why we don't have it included in the console. And the same thing with VR. He's like, well, VR's just not ready yet, so, you know, when it is, you know, Nintendo will be there, but I think-
5599000	5602000	But you'll be there late with that attitude. That's the problem.
5602000	5609000	It's like, yeah, you're finally getting online now, but how many years late are you? By the time you get there, it's just gonna be too late.
5609000	5619000	The Twitch TV thing reeked of an excuse to me because he says that, yet they did all that streaming through Twitch for all three days.
5619000	5629000	I get that there's a difference between a packaged Nintendo presentation that runs a little more like a TV show versus Joe Schmo in his apartment streaming games.
5629000	5637000	But that con- I mean, I don't know. Don't Bite the Hand that Feeds You is kind of what I'm saying with that. I sort of felt that comment did feel really out of touch to me.
5637000	5646000	And if they didn't think the Twitch streaming was fun, then why include some sort of option in Mario Kart 8 to export your race highlights if they didn't think that was fun?
5646000	5656000	He had an answer for that. He had an answer for that. That's where he invoked Angry Luigi and all that, you know, and he had an answer for it, but it did feel a little bit more like an excuse.
5656000	5666000	Let's be real, guys. The Wii U isn't technologically capable of doing the Twitch streaming. That's what it really boils down to, so we have to say, oh, well, gamers don't really want that.
5666000	5674000	That's a little bit of smoke and mirrors, in my opinion. Good thing you don't need them to integrate it on the console to actually be able to do it, right?
5674000	5678000	You can get a capture card and do it that way. You don't necessarily need them to do that.
5678000	5683000	Some comments on the third-party thing. Act deft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
5683000	5688000	Sky, the thing is that third parties aren't going to save the console, and Nintendo has realized this.
5688000	5695000	WhatupG says, people mainly get a Nintendo console for Nintendo. The days of the Nintendo slash Super Nintendo are long gone.
5695000	5704000	AkumaJP says, my absolutely honest opinion, Miyamoto is out of touch. They need to get a new leader.
5704000	5714000	That's a very strong comment. I don't know if I would necessarily 100% agree in that, but I do see some of my own feeling in what he's saying.
5714000	5723000	Maybe it's not that... I certainly respect Miyamoto. He's done amazing things for gaming. Maybe my concern is I'm getting a little burned out on him.
5723000	5731000	Does that make sense? Because it's always the same faces at Nintendo. It's always the same people rolling out the games.
5731000	5735000	And don't get me wrong, they make great games, but I want to see what other people do, too.
5735000	5739000	Maybe, like to use the analogy of Dance Dance Revolution, maybe it's like he's like Naoki.
5739000	5747000	Naoki, his songs were pretty awesome at first. And then you hear the fifth iteration of Brilliant 2U in another game, and you're just like, you know what?
5747000	5753000	It sounds about the same. I'm kind of getting a little tired of it. It's not really that unique anymore.
5753000	5763000	For me, it's just... I don't know. The stuff that he's doing doesn't seem as innovative as it used to be like.
5764000	5773000	Well, I see again. I don't know how to go that far. But it's not necessarily everything he touches is gold. He's not the gaming prophet.
5773000	5780000	Because what's the sub-game that went free-to-play on 3DS? That was all him, wasn't it?
5780000	5789000	It's not that good. Sorry to say. But again, don't get me wrong. Gaming, we have so much to owe to him and so forth.
5790000	5797000	There's, I'm sure, a lot of great things still to come from him. But there's a lot of other great innovators out there, too.
5797000	5806000	And it really sucks. Nintendo can't convince them to make a game for their console. Still. That's my concern.
5806000	5812000	I think at this point, what Nintendo needs to do is really get on board with getting those indies on there.
5812000	5822000	Because that's really what's going to come down to, I think. It's so EA and Ubisoft. Ubisoft has been pretty good still supporting them even though their games have been selling that well.
5822000	5827000	Although they are holding back some titles because there's not a lot of consoles out there.
5827000	5834000	But at least they still have the support for the Wii U. EA, of course, not supporting them at all.
5834000	5838000	But I think if they got a lot more exclusive indie titles and stuff, that might help.
5838000	5845000	Because at least that way, right now I know there's a pretty decent barrier to entry for indies to get on the console.
5845000	5851000	And Nintendo could really streamline that and make it a lot more easier like Sony seems to be doing.
5851000	5856000	I think that would be beneficial for them.
5856000	5863000	Alright, so any other final thoughts on Nintendo? DarkSakura, you've been quiet, but I know you had some thoughts on Nintendo.
5863000	5865000	Want?
5865000	5869000	So whereas the other two, you were a fan of what you saw with Nintendo.
5869000	5873000	Yeah, I mean Dan and I actually legitimately talked about getting a Wii U.
5873000	5882000	Talking about which one we're going to get. Probably the one that comes with Mario Kart and the extra stuff.
5882000	5886000	If it's still available, I don't know if it is anymore.
5886000	5887000	We have ways.
5887000	5892000	Well let me ask you this though, you know I'm going to ask this. Why? Why were you sold on Nintendo where you weren't with the others?
5892000	5899000	Stuff that actually looks fucking fun. I mean seriously, it has stuff that looks fun. It has stuff I care about.
5899000	5904000	That's why I want it. The other stuff didn't look very fun to me, so I didn't care.
5904000	5906000	What? What? I mean just-
5906000	5908000	I want Hyrule Warriors by the way.
5908000	5910000	So those are the types of games that look fun.
5910000	5919000	Yeah, I want that. I want Smash Brothers. I want, um. Yeah, I want Hyrule Warriors and Smash Brothers.
5919000	5925000	Oh, that's right. That was the other announcement is your Mii can now be in Smash Brothers, which I thought was interesting.
5925000	5931000	I like their little splash, like iced tea pours on the heat or something like that. That was funny.
5931000	5935000	And Tiger Claw about the Mass Effect mentioned during EA.
5935000	5936000	We'll get there. We'll get there.
5936000	5938000	I'm just saying, no.
5939000	5940000	We'll get there.
5940000	5952000	Alright, so Wunt from Dark Sakura. It does seem like ever since Mario Kart 8 came out and leading into E3, it is kind of like you see them accelerating.
5952000	5956000	To make a little pun on the kart game, they're definitely getting into accelerating mode right now.
5956000	5959000	Maybe they stalled out for a little while, but you definitely see that acceleration coming.
5959000	5964000	We'll just have to see if it keeps them sailing through the holidays because that would be the important stuff.
5965000	5966000	Yeah.
5966000	5974000	Alright. That is it for Nintendo. I think at this point, since we're about an hour and a half into the show, let me roll over the other two into Part B to kind of start to cover some of our news there.
5974000	5980000	Because I want to make sure we cut on some of our other segments as well here, including release dates.
5980000	5986000	We need to travel around the world and check out what games are coming out to a store near you next week, if anything.
5986000	5989000	I'm not sure there's an awful lot, but we'll check it out anyway.
5989000	5994000	Next week is pretty much EA Sports UFC, so you can play Bruce Lee there.
5994000	5999000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and then on PC, Tropico 5. That is it.
5999000	6003000	Alright. Well, heading over to Japan and checking out the releases over there.
6003000	6009000	It is a little different because their games are on a different type of release schedule.
6009000	6011000	Trying to bring up those dates right now.
6011000	6016000	Looking at the PlayStation 4 this week, there's nothing until the 26th.
6016000	6020000	On the 26th, they get Watch Dogs, but that's not now.
6020000	6024000	On the PlayStation 3, there's CV Casting Voice.
6024000	6027000	No idea what that is, but that's from Bandai Namco. It's coming out.
6027000	6030000	Nothing on the 360 either in Japan.
6030000	6032000	Going to the Vita, there's a couple things.
6032000	6036000	There's Sengoku Hime 4, which is coming out.
6036000	6043000	There's also Hotaru no Niki is coming out from Nippon Ichi.
6043000	6045000	That is all on the Vita this week.
6045000	6050000	And the Wii U does not have anything this week either, so it's also a slow week over in Japan.
6050000	6055000	3DS, Pacworld, Pokemon Art Academy is probably the big release this week.
6055000	6059000	Konchuu Monster Super Battle, so 3DS seems to be having the biggest week in Japan.
6059000	6061000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
6061000	6066000	There's some stuff. What's coming out is on...
6066000	6068000	Great, and it reloads.
6068000	6074000	On the 17th, we have EA Sports UFC.
6074000	6078000	On the 18th, the Walking Dead Game of the Year edition.
6078000	6082000	And... what's the end of the week?
6082000	6084000	Oh yes, the 21st, sorry.
6084000	6088000	On the 19th, we have God of Fire, Rise of Prometheus, Pool Box World.
6088000	6093000	And on the 20th, Atelier Rosa Plus.
6093000	6097000	And... what are you doing?
6097000	6102000	And a few other things. Sorry, my iPad has decided to go crazy on me.
6102000	6105000	And Divinity, Original Sin. There we go.
6107000	6113000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, drink.
6114000	6117000	Alright, I want to touch on one other thing here before we get to the classic game of the week.
6117000	6120000	And you know, this is a controversy that came out of E3.
6120000	6125000	And I did want to touch on this. We've referenced this a little bit earlier in the show, but I think it is important to bring this up.
6125000	6134000	And yes, I'm going to go there with the whole Assassin's Creed Unity and the comment that was definitely heard around the industry about the female players.
6134000	6138000	And why is there not a female assassin in the multiplayer mode?
6138000	6147000	And in an interview with Polygon, Creative Director Alex Amancio said, in response to Why Aren't There Female Avatars,
6147000	6151000	quote, it's double the animations, it's double the voices, all that stuff, and double the visual assets.
6151000	6156000	Especially because we have customizable assassins. It was really a lot of extra production work.
6156000	6161000	The common denominator was Arno. It's not like we could cut out our main characters.
6161000	6166000	So the only logical option, the only option we had was to cut the female avatar.
6166000	6172000	Apparently originally they were going to do a female avatar, but they ended up dropping said avatar.
6172000	6176000	Which obviously had a lot of people very upset.
6176000	6183000	A lot of people making the point that it doesn't seem to be a problem for Nintendo to have an extensive line of female characters in their games.
6183000	6186000	But yet it does seem to be a problem for Ubisoft.
6186000	6193000	Naturally, Ubisoft had to do a little bit of damage control and company spokesman Michael Beadle came out later in the week and said,
6193000	6198000	we recognize the valid concern around diversity in video game narrative.
6198000	6202000	Assassin's Creed is developed by a multicultural team of various faiths and beliefs.
6202000	6207000	And we hope this attention to diversity is reflected in the settings of our games and our characters.
6207000	6208000	Whoopty shit.
6208000	6216000	That, I hope this comment doesn't come off as crass, but that very much strikes me as I have a black friend.
6216000	6226000	Yeah, no, it's, and I am very, very, very angry at them because first of all, it's actually not that difficult.
6226000	6229000	Let me finish, I will absolutely let you have your retort.
6230000	6233000	Assassin's Creed Unity is focused on the story of the lead character Arno.
6233000	6238000	Whether playing by yourself or with a co-op shared experience, you as the gamer will always be playing as Arno.
6238000	6242000	Complete with his broad range of gear and skill sets that will make you feel unique.
6242000	6249000	With regard to diversity in our playable assassins, we featured Aveline, Connor, Adewell, and Altair in Assassin's Creed games.
6249000	6252000	And we continue to looking at showcasing diverse characters.
6252000	6257000	We look forward to introducing you to some of the strong female characters in Assassin's Creed Unity.
6257000	6259000	As soon as we finish making them.
6259000	6261000	I added that last part myself.
6261000	6263000	Go ahead, Darcyra.
6263000	6271000	It's just them trying to sugarcoat, you know, oh, we fucked up, let's try to make this look like we're actually not the assholes that we are.
6271000	6273000	No.
6273000	6280000	They did have a female assassin in the PlayStation Vita version, which then also came out on, uh...
6280000	6282000	Token female character?
6282000	6285000	She was a slave, I mean.
6286000	6296000	Here's the thing. I kind of think the problem is, obviously this whole issue has been a dam waiting to burst.
6296000	6302000	In my opinion, Ubisoft is just the one who put their foot in their mouth, but it was going to happen to somebody.
6302000	6303000	Yeah.
6303000	6305000	This is not a reflection.
6305000	6307000	It's been needing to come out.
6307000	6311000	I don't think this is a reflection on Ubisoft as much as it is the industry, believe it or not.
6311000	6318000	I mean, I almost... I don't know how much I... I almost feel bad for this guy.
6318000	6320000	Don't quote me on that.
6320000	6324000	But the reason why I'm saying that is because I think what...
6324000	6332000	The problem is, this guy was responding to a very tough question, and he said something he really, really, really shouldn't have said.
6332000	6340000	He was trying to make an excuse for something that, you know, is a problem much bigger than him and his game.
6340000	6342000	Does that make sense what I'm saying, Jamie?
6342000	6347000	I don't know. At the same time, like, I understand why people want female playable characters in games,
6347000	6354000	but at the same time, I don't think anybody should be forced to have to make female playable characters in every single game.
6354000	6359000	That's what I'm saying. You know, if their choice was, we want to have, you know, male characters in this game,
6359000	6362000	and they come up with four male assassins or whatever, fine, that's their choice.
6362000	6366000	And say, you know what? These are the characters we decided to go with.
6366000	6368000	That's fine. Don't make any excuses. Oh, it was too hard.
6368000	6377000	The problem is that when you have maybe ten developers taking that same excuse,
6377000	6383000	and one here or there that's like, yeah, we're inclusive, we're making it equal footing.
6383000	6390000	You know, I mean, even, you know, BioWare, you know, they put in a female shepherd as an afterthought, I think, for the first Mass Effect.
6391000	6401000	And then later when they found that, yeah, people actually enjoyed the character, then they made something a little bit more, you know, open, but still.
6401000	6405000	For me, it wasn't necessarily what was said, but it was how it was said that was the problem.
6405000	6408000	I mean, that's what it really was bound to, because here's the thing.
6408000	6415000	If he had just come out and said, okay, you know, this is, we don't envision that the player is playing themselves.
6415000	6423000	This is a story that's told through Arno's eyes, and in multiplayer, honestly, it's just copies of Arno. That's it.
6423000	6431000	And then the developer immediately followed it with, but we do have strong females in, you know, Assassin's Creed Unity that are here and here and here,
6431000	6438000	and gave examples instead of, we'll show you later, you know, and had examples ready to give.
6438000	6440000	I think the reception would have been a lot different.
6440000	6448000	The whole thing about saying that, you know, that, you know, like I was going back to the ten developers who were saying,
6448000	6454000	oh, well, why should we have to, you know, put a female in the character just for the sake of doing it, that makes you part of the problem.
6454000	6465000	It's because you were saying it's for the sake of doing it instead of, you know what, it's a good idea to have a female character, because it shouldn't matter, gender.
6465000	6470000	Instead of, we're throwing a bone to, oh, here, just put a female character in it because we have to.
6470000	6480000	No, that's not how it is at all. We need to see more strong, independent female characters that are created for their own purpose and not just because they're female.
6480000	6491000	They just happen to be female. I don't know if that makes sense, but imagine, imagine, and I'm trying to think of something, you know,
6491000	6497000	if you have a character that's put in just because they're gay. Oh, we need to have a gay character in every game.
6497000	6509000	It's more tokenism at that point instead of, oh, and by the way, you know, I am this other sexuality. It doesn't have anything to do with my job, you know.
6509000	6512000	I think that if you're going to have a female character…
6512000	6514000	Last of Us was a great example of that done right.
6514000	6515000	Yeah.
6515000	6520000	Like the character wasn't like token, it was just like, oh, he just, you know, this is part of the story, part of the narrative.
6520000	6526000	Or like in Tomb Raider is one that did it right. I mean, the last Tomb Raider that came out, I'm saying, instead of, you know, massive wrack Laura.
6526000	6534000	I'm saying the fact that she was thrust into the situation, she, you know, it could have been a boy stuck on the ship.
6534000	6542000	You could have been, you know, her stuck on the ship. The fact is that you had a person thrust in the situation and they used their skills to persevere,
6542000	6550000	has nothing to do with her being female or whatever she was or whatever subplot with her loving her friend or whatever people are shipping them.
6550000	6556000	That has nothing to do with it. The fact is that the character was able to persevere in that type of environment. Does not matter about gender.
6556000	6557000	Right.
6557000	6559000	And that's what we need more characters like.
6559000	6560000	Right.
6560000	6570000	I would like to see more female characters that I can identify with, but I don't agree with we have to put a female in here because people are going to be mad if we don't.
6570000	6572000	No, that makes you part of the problem.
6572000	6579000	So with that being said, because I was about ready to walk out of this story going, I think this is a good thing for the industry at the end of the day.
6579000	6594000	I think we needed to get pissed off. I think as gaming fans and so forth, this is a dialogue that needs to happen within the game industry that yes, there are a lot of female gamers too that would like to see themselves represented a little better in games.
6594000	6603000	Some people are doing it right, but some not aren't necessarily doing it right. You know, Nintendo, we just talked about how it does a great job of intermixing all types of characters.
6603000	6614000	Then again, of course, they floundered a bit when it came to the sexuality issue. They've done a good job with men and women don't have the greatest track record when it comes to, you know, the sexuality spectrum.
6614000	6620000	But, you know, as far as this issue goes, they're doing well so far and making progress on the other things too.
6620000	6628000	Also, and I understand it's probably more teasing IKUMA GPS, you know, what's wrong with the big rack? And I said, a woman is worth more than her body.
6628000	6636000	But boobs are nice, but they don't have to be. But I think it's important to know women come in all shapes and sizes.
6636000	6651000	But imagine having this lump of fat and glands on your chest and trying to run in a t-shirt and bra. That's not very, that's the same reason I disagree with the boob cup armor, you know what I mean, Rob? Like the bull bras?
6651000	6665000	Because you actually need to strap the girls down to be effective in battle rather than having them, you know, move painfully or being stabbed through them maybe or falling the wrong way and having that cup go into your sternum, for example.
6665000	6669000	You know, fucking men. Don't let men design armor.
6669000	6671000	So do you think that-
6671000	6672000	And you know what I mean by fucking men.
6672000	6680000	Do you think that this ultimately was something that needed to happen to our soccer or are you afraid that it's going to result in tokenism?
6680000	6693000	I think it's going to have to be approached very carefully. And the whole problem is that if it hadn't been all this patriarchal bullshit in the first place, we wouldn't have to have this discussion.
6693000	6698000	So really, I blame a few thousand years worth of male dominated history for this.
6698000	6700000	But we can't change the past. We can only change the future.
6700000	6716000	Exactly. And that means learning from it. Learning what happens when you deal with degrading somebody into a token place, making them there out of pity rather than giving them a true and honest place within that framework.
6716000	6723000	And so that's going to have to be the approach to be taken. How can we do this respectfully instead of just throwing a bone?
6723000	6730000	All right. I'm sure this discussion could take up a whole three hours on its own, but we have a busy show tonight. So I invite your feedback.
6730000	6735000	Participate at orangeontradio.com or we'll be taking some calls a little later in the show.
6735000	6739000	One thing. There was a question asked about man boobs.
6740000	6751000	I've never seen them make boob cups on male armor unless it's Batman. So not an issue. Strap it down.
6751000	6757000	If you want to see a great job of armor that objectifies men, go play Final Fantasy 14.
6757000	6765000	Amen. Or actually, and I was watching because I don't watch Watch Once Upon a Time, but I've been looking, trying to get into it.
6765000	6770000	You see an example of female armor done right. Look at Mulan. Just saying.
6770000	6778000	All right. Let's take a trip down memory lane to a time when, you know, it was a strong female.
6778000	6781000	We took off our armor and ran around in bikinis.
6781000	6794000	All right. We're going to take a time when things were a little simpler and maybe a little more innocent in the gaming industry with a classic video game where Dark Soccer is going to go into the gaming archives and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking out this game.
6794000	6799000	It's the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer. What have you picked this week?
6799000	6804000	Ninja Golf. Because Ninja Golf is fucking amazing.
6804000	6808000	Ninja Golf is an Atari 7800 game.
6808000	6810000	Sorry. That was loud. Sorry, guys.
6810000	6815000	Good luck finding a 7800 that has a working power supply because ours is dead.
6815000	6820000	Anyway, it's a beat them up with golf.
6821000	6826000	It's just so freaking weird, but it's a fun little game.
6826000	6840000	Basically, you start off with your hole, you aim the ball and shoot for the green, and then you run toward the ball like a side scroller fighting different enemies, which include other ninja gophers because I guess Caddyshack or some reason.
6840000	6849000	Birds, giant frogs, sharks and all kinds of crap, which I think it's funny that when you get to a sand trap, it plays like an Arabian Nights theme.
6849000	6853000	It's kind of funny, but the enemies depend on the environment they're in.
6853000	6859000	So like there's water hazards with snakes and, you know, you get underwater fighting and all kinds of stuff.
6859000	6862000	And then you have to fight a dragon before you get to each hole.
6862000	6867000	It's just a fucking weird game. I don't really know what else to say about it, except that is a fucking weird game.
6867000	6870000	Have you ever played Ninja Golf?
6870000	6874000	I had never heard of it until you picked it for tonight's classic game of the week.
6874000	6876000	I thought I'd seen everything.
6877000	6879000	No, I've never heard of it.
6879000	6884000	It really is just crazy. I mean, there's really nothing else to say about it.
6884000	6893000	I don't even know if it was that popular of a game, but it's just, I mean, it's like you get, you have a health bar.
6893000	6897000	How many golf games do you know have a health bar, by the way? Just saying.
6897000	6901000	Did Kirby's Golf have a health bar? It might have.
6901000	6910000	I don't know. But you can die on the field. You have different music playing. Most of it's just sound effects.
6910000	6913000	I just really can't say anything else about this game. It's weird.
6913000	6916000	I don't think it's ever had any kind of re-release.
6916000	6921000	Although I think there was a nod made to it for Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
6921000	6923000	So I don't know.
6923000	6925000	What the shit is this game? Now he's like fighting a dragon.
6925000	6928000	I told you, you fight a dragon when you get to the hole.
6928000	6930000	This has nothing to do with golf.
6930000	6933000	Are you sure? How much golf have you played?
6933000	6934000	You know what, if this was-
6934000	6938000	I'm missing something. If this is what was on TV, I'd watch it every day.
6938000	6946000	If this was golf, I would fucking play it. I would be a caddy as long as I get lots of realistic armor.
6946000	6952000	And according to our resident Kirby expert, Akdeft, Kirby's Dream Course did have a health bar.
6952000	6959000	Ha. So we have Ninja Golf to thank for Kirby's Dream Course, clearly. Clearly.
6959000	6961000	Mmm.
6961000	6965000	What the hell, DarkSakura? What the hell? There it is.
6965000	6968000	Your classic game of the week, Ninja Golf.
6968000	6972000	Which I had played yesterday. Fucking weird game.
6972000	6974000	And the whole time you were like, what?
6974000	6979000	I'm like, what am I playing? Oh my god, what am I playing? Is that a gopher? Do they get this from Caddyshack?
6979000	6981000	Oh my god.
6981000	6983000	That's pretty fantastic.
6983000	6987000	Isn't that awesome? And I love how you can actually see the little green in the bottom corner.
6987000	6988000	You can watch where you're going.
6988000	6990000	Check out that multi-layer scrolling going on in the background.
6990000	6992000	And see where your balls are.
6992000	6993000	You can.
6993000	6995000	Hey, stop objectifying men.
6995000	6997000	I'm not objectifying men. I'm talking about golf balls.
6997000	6999000	Oh, okay.
7001000	7006000	Are you a ball washer, Rob? Have you ever worked as a second job as a ball washer?
7006000	7008000	Um, no comment.
7008000	7012000	Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week, Ninja Golf on the Atari 7800.
7012000	7014000	I like that. That was a good pick.
7014000	7018000	Alright, there it is. We're going to be back though. We have plenty more show to come.
7018000	7020000	We still have two press conferences we've got to get.
7020000	7023000	Dark Soccer's got a few things to say about EA's press conference.
7023000	7025000	Loki wants to talk about Ubisoft's press conference.
7025000	7027000	We've got a whole lot of rapid-fire news as well.
7027000	7031000	And I still have to talk about Project Morpheus at some point and that whole thing.
7031000	7037000	So we will try to make time for that as well as your calls and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
7037000	7049000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio. Episode number 556 of our show for this June 15th.
7049000	7052000	In progress here with part B starting off right now.
7052000	7055000	And we are running awfully long because of all the news tonight.
7055000	7057000	You know, it's kind of a big week in gaming.
7057000	7059000	So we do want to get right back into things.
7059000	7063000	But I do want to just quickly say on the show next week, this is tentative.
7063000	7067000	I'm not going to guarantee that these guys are going to be here because we're still trying to work out this deal.
7067000	7073000	But tentatively on the show next week, we'll have an interview with a representative from the game Marvel Heroes.
7073000	7077000	The free-to-play game that some are saying is Diablo-esque.
7077000	7080000	So stay tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook for all the details.
7080000	7084000	They are arranging to be here live so you guys can ask your questions about the game.
7084000	7088000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio or Twitter.com slash OLR.
7088000	7094000	Also, our 12th birthday is coming up. It is on the 23rd so we will be celebrating it on the 29th.
7094000	7098000	June 29th coming up. The 12th anniversary of OLR.
7098000	7100000	I thought it was 13.
7100000	7104000	No, we started in... Oh god, it is 13, isn't it?
7104000	7105000	13.
7105000	7109000	I forgot my... This show is so old, I forgot its age.
7109000	7111000	I thought it was 12. I thought we started in 2002.
7111000	7113000	No, we did. You're right. We started in 2002.
7113000	7115000	I don't know... That's how you know you're old.
7115000	7117000	Here's how I know that.
7117000	7121000	And because I was talking to someone about that the other day saying,
7121000	7123000	Oh yeah, I've been doing this for like 12 years.
7123000	7124000	It was 2002.
7124000	7129000	It was because I had the newspaper articles still on my desk and so I'm like...
7129000	7132000	It says we started in 2002.
7132000	7138000	I remember in 2001 I was living somewhere very, very, very, very different from where I was in 2002.
7138000	7141000	This show would not have happened with where I was living in 2001.
7142000	7144000	Yeah, it was definitely 2002. So it is our 12th birthday.
7144000	7146000	But yeah, that's how you know you're getting old.
7146000	7147000	The show is almost in height.
7147000	7150000	Oh, wait. Shane's making a cameo on the show.
7150000	7152000	Hi, Shane. How's it going?
7152000	7153000	Fine.
7153000	7155000	Yeah, that's right. What did you say about the show?
7155000	7156000	It's almost in high school.
7156000	7158000	It is junior high this year.
7158000	7159000	Yeah, it's going to get beat up.
7159000	7161000	Why? Why would you beat up our show?
7161000	7163000	Because it's such a nerd.
7163000	7165000	All right, wait. Real quick though, Shane.
7165000	7166000	Now the nerd kids are cool though.
7166000	7169000	Real quick, Shane. Tonight is all about E3.
7169000	7171000	So real, real quick thoughts on the show.
7173000	7175000	Just to be honest, I was a little bored with it.
7175000	7178000	There were a few surprises that were awesome.
7178000	7183000	I think I expected more, especially after last year was just kind of like a blowout.
7183000	7189000	This year seemed really tame and they just played it a little conservatively for my taste.
7189000	7194000	And Konami having two games at their booth, two? That's just sad.
7194000	7197000	I mean, my roots, they hurt right now.
7197000	7201000	I know, I know. All right. Anyhow, thanks for popping in there.
7201000	7204000	We have so much more news to get to, so we need to get to it.
7204000	7207000	Let's start off with some rapid fire news. Loki.
7207000	7215000	All right, so starting things off, not only did they announce, was it Rise of the Tomb Raider,
7215000	7225000	but they also had Lorecroft and the Temple of Osiris, which is a brand new game
7225000	7228000	kind of along the lines of the Guardian of Light.
7228000	7232000	I don't know if it's an exact sequel to it. I guess it is a sequel.
7232000	7237000	It's going to be available, I want to say, probably on the digital storefronts.
7237000	7240000	And basically saying, hey, you know what?
7240000	7244000	We got a lot of positive reception regarding Guardian of Light.
7244000	7248000	And we figured, let's go ahead and create another one.
7248000	7252000	And not really sure what they've changed.
7252000	7257000	I guess a four-player co-op now, so that's kind of cool, because I think the first one was only two.
7257000	7263000	And yeah, no real time frame, though, when it's expected out, though.
7263000	7269000	I'm guessing since everything seems to have been 2015, that that's probably going to be 2015.
7269000	7272000	Because right now, they are saying the release date is coming soon.
7272000	7274000	That's a safe assumption, then.
7274000	7279000	Although, to be fair, if it is going to be ready relatively soon,
7279000	7283000	they could do it as part of the summer of Arcade that they do every year.
7283000	7289000	So maybe if it's close to being done, it could be coming out in the early part of August.
7289000	7292000	I guess we'll have to wait and see, then.
7292000	7298000	Also, Alienware, they had a console that they were showing off.
7298000	7302000	It's not necessarily a console, more it was originally going to be a Steam box.
7302000	7308000	But now that that whole delay on the Steam controllers being available,
7308000	7315000	they've kind of converted it into its own PC that hooks up next to your TV.
7315000	7318000	It's going to cost $550.
7318000	7327000	It comes with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, as well as a fourth-generation Intel Core i3, as well as CPU.
7327000	7335000	They're saying that it's going to have a custom NVIDIA Maxwell GPU with 2GB of RAM,
7335000	7347000	500GB SATA3 hard drive, Bluetooth, Ethernet, and it's going to have Windows 8.1, as well.
7347000	7351000	HDMI, all that fun stuff.
7351000	7357000	I don't know how powerful that is, but for $549, that's pretty reasonable, at least.
7357000	7360000	But, I don't know, I wouldn't buy one.
7360000	7364000	I'd rather build my own. It'd probably be a lot cheaper, anyways.
7364000	7367000	All right. Well, speaking of Steam consoles, guess what?
7367000	7372000	Civilization V is now available for Steam OS, as well as Linux.
7372000	7378000	So, you know, I love me some Civ games, and Civilization V is now available on those platforms.
7378000	7384000	It's also on sale, up to 75% off some of the other bundles as well, even though those bundles don't necessarily work.
7384000	7388000	I got that bundle. Was it the Humble Bundle that they had, the E3 Ticket one?
7388000	7391000	They had a bunch of random shit in it, but it has Civ III in there.
7391000	7393000	Oh, does it? That's pretty cool.
7393000	7396000	Except Civ III, in my opinion, is the weakest one out of the whole series.
7396000	7402000	Yeah, whatever. I only paid a dollar. I didn't want to get the Mortal Kombat arcade collection.
7402000	7407000	It's still like ice cream. It's still pretty good, even if it's a bad flavor.
7407000	7411000	All right. Also, I just wanted to quickly give a shout-out. At some point in the show,
7411000	7417000	we were able to see a presentation involving Civilization Beyond Earth at E3,
7417000	7419000	and I gotta say, I'm really liking how that game's shaping up.
7419000	7425000	It looks really good. I mean, it's running on a high-end PC, which has come a long way since Civ V was first developed.
7425000	7428000	So yeah, I'm really excited about that.
7428000	7433000	They have some new little features there, like some squares will have poison gas.
7433000	7435000	The tech tree's very different looking.
7435000	7440000	You can launch satellites that will change how some squares in a certain area react,
7440000	7443000	like giving combat bonuses or being able to see different things.
7443000	7447000	So yeah, I'm definitely interested in picking up Civ Beyond Earth.
7447000	7450000	That was pretty cool to see at E3.
7450000	7456000	Also, one thing that is not so cool to happen after E3 is getting laid off.
7456000	7462000	Now, luckily, we all are invested in this very company that we do our program on,
7462000	7466000	so we don't have to worry about things like that. We also all have our own individual day jobs.
7466000	7471000	But for some people to make a living off of video game media, this is a pretty shitty time to get laid off,
7471000	7473000	the day after E3.
7473000	7480000	And yep, three-quarters of the staff, they're saying, at game trailers were laid off.
7480000	7486000	This is because digital content distributor Defy Media acquired some of these companies from Viacom,
7486000	7489000	and now three-quarters of them have been laid off.
7489000	7492000	Various tweets going off from some of the staff who have been let go.
7492000	7497000	Best of luck to you guys as you find employment elsewhere.
7497000	7499000	That is a really shitty time to do that.
7499000	7502000	Thanks for all your hard work during E3. Here's your severance check.
7502000	7504000	Womp, womp.
7504000	7506000	DarkSagra.
7506000	7511000	Well, on other news, there have been some announcements made for Final Fantasy XIV.
7511000	7514000	That is super happy stuff.
7514000	7521000	First of these are job classes coming out. One of them is Rogue, which, super cute, especially with the kitty girls.
7521000	7524000	The other one is Ninja, which, duh.
7524000	7528000	Although, I didn't see anything about the gun class that we kept hearing about.
7528000	7530000	Did you see anything about that?
7530000	7531000	Not at this time.
7531000	7536000	Another thing is that marriage is coming up, well, not marriage, eternal bonding ceremonies.
7536000	7542000	But it can go, it's not bound by race, creed, or gender.
7542000	7550000	So, you can get hitched to whoever you want to and have a messy divorce just like everyone else.
7550000	7557000	It should be noted that was a change in policy from what was originally stated for Final Fantasy XIV,
7557000	7561000	that the marriage would be limited to the opposite gender.
7561000	7565000	And, you know, very cool shift in what they did there.
7565000	7567000	Kudos.
7567000	7572000	Also, about personal housing, they're supposed to be coming through in 2.3.
7572000	7579000	Well, the personal chambers will be introduced in 2.3, but the housing will come in 2.3.8.
7579000	7582000	And more emotes, like slapping people.
7582000	7585000	Yay. Come over here so I can slash slap you.
7585000	7587000	And you know what? How about-
7587000	7588000	Slash bite me.
7588000	7592000	I want a bite me emote where you just smack your butt.
7592000	7594000	Bite my ass.
7594000	7599000	And then, um, this one's stupid.
7599000	7602000	They're doing Final Fantasy VII G-Bike.
7602000	7607000	And I watched some of it and, you know, that was actually my least favorite part of Final Fantasy VII,
7607000	7610000	was when you race the bike and play Road Rash.
7610000	7613000	I don't like Road Rash. That's Dan's game.
7613000	7616000	I'm like, the fuck, Cloud? I don't- No!
7616000	7620000	No, stop. And I don't want to play a whole game of nothing but that crap.
7620000	7621000	Just give me a remake.
7621000	7623000	Well, what if I do want to play a whole game full of that crap?
7623000	7626000	Well, you can play a whole game full of that crap. It's coming.
7626000	7629000	I don't have to waste my money on it.
7629000	7630000	Fair enough.
7630000	7633000	No crap for me, thank you.
7633000	7639000	Alright. Well, let's get to some, hopefully, non-crap answers in our Fugu Question of the Week.
7640000	7642000	It's not here, Google.
7646000	7650000	Like you guys would ever give crappy answers. Come on, you guys are great.
7650000	7655000	Alright, we are going to get to the Fugu Question of the Week, where we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7655000	7658000	You take those words, you throw them together, you get Fugu.
7658000	7661000	Alright, here it is. And, of course, we asked about E3.
7661000	7665000	What is the one piece of news you were most excited about this week and why?
7665000	7667000	I tried to keep things positive.
7667000	7669000	You know, there's a lot of people that sit there and go,
7669000	7672000	Oh, fuck E3. Fuck all these trailers. I'm fucking bored.
7672000	7675000	F- to everybody. This year sucks. Gaming sucks.
7675000	7678000	And there's some people I kind of look at and go,
7678000	7681000	Why are you playing video games? Video games are supposed to be fun.
7681000	7683000	Clearly, they're not fun for you. Please leave.
7683000	7687000	Go do something fun. Maybe camping is fun for you. I don't know.
7687000	7694000	But anyway, so to keep things positive, I wanted to know what were people getting excited about with E3 this year.
7694000	7696000	So, let's go to Google Plus first tonight.
7696000	7702000	ActDeaf says, This might come as a surprise to all of you, but I was really excited to see the new Kirby game.
7702000	7705000	What? Huh? Get out.
7705000	7707000	Yeah, ActDeaf, excited about a Kirby game.
7707000	7710000	Seriously, though, Kirby Canvas Curse is one of my favorite of the series,
7710000	7713000	and seeing its successor is quite great, especially for the Wii U.
7713000	7718000	Flaco Jones says, The one game I was most excited to see was LittleBigPlanet 3,
7718000	7721000	but the company who surprised me most was Nintendo,
7721000	7725000	and the number of titles they announced was Splatoon and the Yoshi game topping my list.
7725000	7730000	Travis H. replied and said, Uncharted 4, A Thief's End, FTW.
7730000	7734000	That means for the win, just in case you didn't know.
7734000	7737000	Fabrice A. replied over on Facebook and said,
7737000	7741000	I like the surprise Rainbow Six Siege game Ubisoft showed at the end of their conference.
7741000	7745000	Looked like a decent, solid game. Simple, but with a lot of tactics involved.
7745000	7750000	KJ replied and said, I was interested in what Nintendo had to say in their announcements,
7750000	7754000	and wow did they deliver. Every game announced is exclusive to Nintendo hardware.
7754000	7758000	Andy R. said, Final Fantasy Type Zero. Kinda wish it was on Vita.
7758000	7762000	Feels like it should have been since it was originally a PSP game, but I'll buy it regardless.
7762000	7768000	Redertainment said, Given that US Open is currently being held and my history playing the franchise,
7768000	7772000	I was most excited by the news about EA Sports PGA Tour.
7772000	7775000	Given the development of the golf club and the failure to deliver on a product this year,
7775000	7778000	I'll be watching the development of this game very closely.
7778000	7781000	Yes, Redertainment, but does it have Ninja Golf?
7781000	7786000	Does it? Do you fight a dragon when you get to the hole? Do you? Do you?
7786000	7787000	Alright, uh...
7787000	7793000	It's possible that you might in like the next EA... was it PGA Tour game?
7793000	7795000	Why would they do that? You never know.
7795000	7800000	They have like fantasy courses in there. There was one they showed off that was Battlefield.
7800000	7805000	They had like an aircraft carrier crashing into an island, so yeah maybe.
7805000	7808000	When was the last time we had like an Uber like miniature golf game?
7808000	7810000	I like miniature golf games.
7810000	7812000	We need to do the Golfland Tour.
7812000	7813000	I... I...
7813000	7820000	No seriously, we do the courses in Roseville, then we move on to Milpitas, then we move on to Sunnyvale, then you know...
7820000	7823000	And then we have a sad at how they've all deteriorated over the past ten years.
7823000	7826000	We go find where Arcade Infinity used to be and cry.
7826000	7831000	We'll try to play what's left of the courses at the mine shaft.
7831000	7833000	Like a furniture store.
7833000	7838000	And the place that's like that horrible little hole in the wall that's tucked away.
7838000	7843000	Oh, the Sunrise one? Yeah, it's like where they store police swap vehicles now.
7843000	7844000	That place closed.
7844000	7846000	But they had a Para Para machine for the longest time.
7846000	7847000	I'm not gonna let it stop me.
7847000	7849000	That place closed like four years ago. Where have you guys been?
7849000	7851000	Yeah, but they had a Para Para machine.
7851000	7852000	That's exactly it. They did.
7852000	7854000	And they'd be like, how'd you learn how to do them dances?
7854000	7858000	But if the holes are still there, then you can play golf.
7858000	7861000	Alright, moving on to other comments.
7861000	7864000	Our pal Jeremy from Koopa Club says,
7864000	7868000	I'm most excited for everything Nintendo announced, plus a few standouts from Xbox One,
7868000	7873000	Sunset Overdrive and the Halo Collection, and the indies, Abzu and No Man's Sky.
7873000	7877000	Jeremy, I said one thing, not five. No, I'm kidding.
7877000	7879000	Our pal Captain Spike from Game Buoys said,
7879000	7884000	Phantom Dust, the return of an incredibly underrated, superbly designed game.
7884000	7886000	I hope this time it finds the audience it deserves.
7886000	7892000	Haters are unstylish and poorly educated.
7892000	7894000	Did you like that, Jamie? Are you gonna use that in a sentence?
7894000	7897000	Haters are unstylish and poorly educated.
7897000	7899000	Yes.
7899000	7902000	Our pal Ian, also from Koopa Club, said,
7902000	7906000	Zelda having more of a spotlight than the mainstay series.
7906000	7909000	A lot of talk about the character shown in the Zelda,
7909000	7912000	because some people thought it was actually Zelda as the hero,
7912000	7916000	but in fact, it is Link. Just a very different looking Link.
7916000	7918000	It looked exactly like Link. I don't know what p-
7918000	7921000	They just don't remember what Link looked like.
7921000	7922000	It's been so long.
7922000	7926000	It's like, dude, that is totally Link. I don't understand how you can mistake that.
7926000	7931000	He looks so fan of him, though. Yes, he always has. So, come on.
7931000	7936000	Ronnie B says, I guess knowing Mirror's Edge is still alive and seems well invested in.
7936000	7940000	Dar Tetsuya says, a toss-up between Zelda, which sounds like it'll be epic,
7940000	7944000	Devil's Third, which sounds like a crazy fun action shooter with online multiplayer,
7944000	7948000	and Splatoon, more multiplayer but with a neat new twist.
7948000	7952000	AZHP says, my favorite part of E3 was when Aisha Tyler took the stage
7952000	7954000	in the first five minutes of the Ubisoft conference and said,
7954000	7958000	it's 4.20 up in this bitch, and the whole audience cheered.
7958000	7962000	Apparently, everyone in the games industry is super excited for weed.
7962000	7967000	I don't know about everybody, but certainly there's a-
7967000	7972000	Some of the imagination in your games comes in cigarette form.
7972000	7977000	Anyhow, Tigerclaw says, I thought Nintendo had a pretty good presentation for E3.
7977000	7980000	There was no way anyone can top Robot Chicken after that.
7980000	7983000	I was excited that they finally announced a new Star Fox for Wii U.
7983000	7985000	Captain Toad was a bit of a surprise,
7985000	7988000	turning one of the best moments of Super Mario 3D World into a full game.
7988000	7992000	Splatoon looks like a third-person shooter that would be fun to play online.
7992000	7996000	Codename Steam looks like it could be a really cool game to play on the 3DS.
7996000	8000000	Awesome Unicorn says, I really enjoyed the presentation of Yoshi's Wooly World.
8000000	8005000	The inclusion of the yarn store and someone crocheting the prototype Amigurumi
8005000	8009000	made the entire thing feel so thoughtfully and lovingly designed.
8009000	8013000	I like that presentation, too. I love that they were in a yard store.
8013000	8015000	Or a yard store. A yarn store.
8015000	8018000	What? What?
8018000	8021000	At yard stores, do they have yard sales?
8021000	8025000	I'm going to kick you out into the yard, and good luck,
8025000	8027000	because it's like Jumanji in our backyard right now.
8027000	8028000	All right.
8028000	8032000	Ospher says, the reveal of No Man's Sky at Sony's conference.
8032000	8035000	The game looks so beautiful, especially once you took off in the ship
8035000	8038000	to get lost in a galactic dogfight before exploring other worlds.
8038000	8041000	It's new and unique, just what I was looking for at this year's E3.
8041000	8045000	Last but not least, Raginator says, the reveal that you can build decks from scratch
8045000	8050000	in constructed format in Magic 2015, which is a feature that people have been clamoring for.
8050000	8052000	Thanks for all the answers, guys.
8052000	8055000	Very interesting to see. It does seem like across the board.
8055000	8058000	Again, I don't like to pick winners and losers for E3,
8058000	8062000	but considering the situation Nintendo's been in for the last few months sales-wise,
8062000	8065000	you definitely are seeing a lot of love for Nintendo coming out of this E3.
8065000	8070000	I mean, hell, even Loki was pretty positive about Nintendo coming out of the show this year.
8070000	8074000	So, you know, props to them on a good showing.
8074000	8076000	But again, I don't think anybody else was bad.
8076000	8080000	I just think everybody had room for improvement,
8080000	8082000	but everybody did what they needed to do as well.
8082000	8085000	So it was an exciting year to be a gamer, I think.
8085000	8089000	All right, I am going to let Loki touch on the other two conferences,
8089000	8091000	but can we go back to Sony a moment?
8091000	8095000	Because I want to talk about, I got to play Project Morpheus,
8095000	8097000	and it was a very kind of chance thing.
8097000	8101000	And I got to say, I'm going to be honest with you guys and up front about something,
8101000	8103000	you know, kind of peel back the curtain a little bit.
8103000	8107000	I try very hard in the commentating I do on video games.
8107000	8111000	I don't know if I like to call myself a games journalist because I don't get paid to do this.
8111000	8113000	This is really a hobby, but we love to commentate.
8113000	8117000	But even so, I try very hard to make sure I'm impartial.
8117000	8124000	And, you know, I do call companies out sometimes in a constructive manner when I feel it's needed,
8124000	8126000	and I try to do that equally for everybody.
8126000	8130000	But I also fanboy a lot over a lot of stuff from a variety of different companies
8130000	8132000	because I love video gaming.
8132000	8137000	But I got to say, coming out of this E3, the Lord is testing me.
8137000	8142000	Because to put things into perspective, I had kind of a mixed thing with Nintendo.
8142000	8145000	I met some very nice people that worked in Nintendo, and that was really cool.
8145000	8148000	But at the same time, I know Bobby was trying to get some answers to questions,
8148000	8151000	and they gave him a very like, no, you're not media.
8151000	8153000	You need to have an appointment to ask these questions.
8153000	8157000	You know, you need to stop asking questions and, you know, so this whole thing.
8157000	8160000	Whereas some of the questions that our users were answering,
8160000	8163000	Nintendo had no problem answering for other outlets just a day or two later.
8163000	8166000	So that was a little irritating there.
8166000	8170000	Microsoft, we were just flat out told we weren't a big enough thing
8170000	8172000	to be able to ask the questions that we were asking.
8172000	8174000	Gee, thanks, guys.
8174000	8178000	Meanwhile, Sony, thanks to a twist of fate and, you know, kind of some of that networking
8178000	8181000	and meeting some of the guys at a VR mixer that we did,
8181000	8187000	they invited us upstairs for a private session to take a look at Project Morpheus
8187000	8189000	off the show floor in the upstairs area.
8189000	8192000	Like I said, I'm being really, really tested.
8192000	8194000	This is in addition to only being invited to the Sony conference.
8194000	8196000	I was being really tested this year.
8196000	8198000	But I still come out.
8198000	8200000	There's things I love and things I think can be better
8200000	8202000	about all the companies across the board.
8202000	8205000	So that all being said, yes, we did meet some of the guys
8205000	8207000	that are actually some of the engineers on Project Morpheus,
8207000	8210000	one of the VR mixers, and they invited us.
8210000	8212000	And I want to give a shout out to Reverend Kyle,
8212000	8214000	who does a lot of work in the VR community
8214000	8217000	and has his own like VR podcast that he works with and so forth,
8217000	8220000	was very instrumental in helping us to meet them
8220000	8224000	and invite us upstairs with him to check out Project Morpheus.
8224000	8228000	And when we got up there, I noticed the room was pretty empty,
8228000	8231000	and all they had was they had some TVs around the room
8231000	8233000	and some things set up.
8233000	8236000	One thing they were demoing was kind of like a medieval-type game,
8236000	8238000	and I think you guys saw this in the trailer,
8238000	8240000	where there was like archery and there was a dragon
8240000	8242000	and they had a PlayStation Move set up.
8242000	8245000	But the one that caught my eye was a game they actually weren't showing on the floor.
8245000	8248000	It was a game called Street Luge, or it was a demo more than anything.
8248000	8251000	You guys know the luge in the Winter Olympics, right?
8251000	8253000	When those sledders go flying down like...
8253000	8254000	Street luges.
8254000	8256000	Yeah. Well, they also have like street luges, right,
8256000	8258000	where you go down the street in the middle of traffic.
8258000	8260000	So here's how they set it up.
8260000	8262000	They had me lie down sort of in this bean bag.
8262000	8264000	They had a bean bag on the floor.
8264000	8266000	Imagine when you sit in a bean bag, what does your body do?
8266000	8269000	Your feet go out, but your back goes back slightly,
8269000	8271000	so it feels like you're in a luge, right?
8271000	8273000	So then they put the helmet on and they fit the helmet on me,
8273000	8277000	and you control the luge by moving your head left and right.
8277000	8279000	And as you move your head left and right,
8279000	8281000	your thing goes to the left and it goes to the right.
8281000	8282000	But you are going through...
8282000	8285000	Now imagine, you know, again, you've got the VR glasses on,
8285000	8287000	traffic, and you're going into oncoming traffic,
8287000	8290000	and the whole thing is you want to get behind a car
8290000	8293000	just long enough to catch its drift to increase your mileage,
8293000	8295000	but then you want to get out of the way
8295000	8297000	because you don't want to hit the car.
8297000	8300000	And then there are certain trucks that you can actually luge under them
8300000	8302000	and get even more speed that way.
8302000	8304000	And then at the very end of the course,
8304000	8307000	you like are in oncoming traffic.
8307000	8309000	But you don't die or anything when you get hit.
8309000	8311000	You just lose a lot of speed.
8311000	8314000	I got to tell you, that whole sensation of lying in the beanbag with my feet out,
8314000	8319000	doing this luge thing with the VR headset was pretty fucking cool.
8319000	8323000	And this is just one tech demo.
8323000	8324000	I mean, it was like a two-minute tech...
8324000	8326000	It wasn't like a full-fleshed game.
8326000	8329000	I don't see this as something that's going to be like $50,
8329000	8331000	a thing that moves the Morpheus.
8331000	8335000	But this is definitely a mini-game in Wii Sports.
8335000	8337000	And if the Morpheus is going to succeed,
8337000	8339000	it needs its Wii Sports, right?
8339000	8342000	Not exactly Wii Sports, but you know what I mean.
8342000	8346000	It needs its definitive game that tells people they need a Morpheus.
8346000	8348000	Watch him get an X Games license.
8351000	8354000	The other kind of neat thing about the Morpheus,
8354000	8356000	and I think a lot of people aren't really talking about this,
8356000	8359000	but it's some of the behind-the-scenes things that happen
8359000	8362000	because it's not just the glasses that talk to the PlayStation camera,
8362000	8364000	although that's a big part of it.
8364000	8366000	That's how it knew if I was moving my head left or right, right?
8366000	8369000	Because the glasses emit the light, and the camera sees that light,
8369000	8370000	so I can see that.
8370000	8374000	But what's cool is that the glasses tie into a separate box.
8374000	8379000	That box has a separate GPU and a separate processing,
8379000	8383000	so that it actually isn't taking all that oomph away from the PlayStation 4,
8383000	8386000	because what that means is that what's being shown on the screen,
8386000	8389000	on the television, is what I'm seeing in glasses,
8389000	8391000	just in the TV format.
8391000	8395000	So other people sitting in the room see exactly what I'm seeing,
8395000	8399000	just I'm seeing it in a very different, very real manner.
8399000	8402000	And I've got to say, that feeling of going the 100 miles an hour
8402000	8403000	as you're gaining speed or whatever in the street,
8403000	8405000	it was really, really cool.
8405000	8409000	It was an effective freaking demo, I've got to say.
8409000	8412000	So, yeah, I got to try Oculus, too.
8412000	8416000	I played a game called Eve Valkyrie with the Oculus,
8416000	8419000	and that was a cool experience, too.
8419000	8421000	VR is coming, you guys.
8421000	8424000	This is all about what is going to be that game.
8424000	8427000	If Sony can find its Wii Sports,
8427000	8429000	it's going to have a heck of a package here in this thing.
8429000	8432000	Because, yeah, I mean, you could pass around this glasses or whatever
8432000	8434000	at parties, and people can kind of take their turns doing things,
8434000	8436000	and everybody can watch them do their thing,
8436000	8439000	because the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to render it on the screen
8439000	8442000	while this little box controls what's being rendered on the Morpheus.
8442000	8443000	And?
8443000	8446000	It's not that whole split image thing you see when you see Oculus streams.
8446000	8448000	And you'll be able to stream it, because?
8448000	8449000	Yes, that's a huge thing, too.
8449000	8452000	You'll be able to stream it, because the PlayStation 4 streams to Twitch.
8452000	8456000	I don't know if the camera can shoot you and do the detection.
8456000	8457000	I mean, I didn't ask that question.
8457000	8458000	Probably could.
8458000	8460000	I don't see why it couldn't.
8460000	8463000	So you'll be able to watch live streams of people on Twitch
8463000	8466000	playing these VR Morpheus games and getting all into it and stuff.
8466000	8468000	It's going to be interesting.
8468000	8470000	But, again, what is that game?
8470000	8472000	These tech demos are cool and all,
8472000	8476000	but tech demo, you know, a $200, $300 accessory.
8476000	8478000	I'm making those numbers up. I have nothing to go off of.
8478000	8481000	I'm wondering if we'll see this next holiday, 2015.
8481000	8483000	I don't know. I don't know.
8483000	8486000	I mean, obviously, if they're showing it at E3 now,
8486000	8488000	they're getting closer and closer.
8488000	8495000	And, you know, these demos could be mini games in a larger collection.
8495000	8498000	So that was my, I mean, I got to play the street luge thing twice.
8498000	8501000	I got to kind of see the archery thing and the fighting the dragon
8501000	8507000	and the cool thing with the move where you would swing the controller
8507000	8509000	around in a circle above your head,
8509000	8511000	and that's the mace that you're spinning around
8511000	8514000	getting ready to attack the dummy with, like really neat little things like that.
8514000	8518000	But, again, is that going to be a game that convinces the soccer mom
8518000	8523000	to buy a $300 PlayStation 4 accessory for her family
8523000	8526000	or, you know, gamer dad to buy one for his family
8526000	8530000	or college kid to save up the money and buy one for his dorm room?
8530000	8533000	You know, is it going to have that game? I don't know.
8533000	8536000	But I got to say, as far as the technology goes,
8536000	8540000	you cannot, I'm sorry to say, you cannot judge these VR things
8540000	8543000	until you've tried them. You have to try them.
8543000	8545000	Whether it be Morpheus, whether it be Oculus, whether it be whatever,
8545000	8547000	you got to try this for yourself.
8547000	8548000	It's a really neat sensation.
8548000	8550000	So that was my time with the Morpheus,
8550000	8554000	and big thanks to the guys at Sony for inviting us up there to take a look,
8554000	8558000	even though we might be a small company.
8558000	8561000	All right. Let's see.
8561000	8565000	Oh, I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
8565000	8570000	SSJ100Matt says, the real losers of E3 were our bank accounts and wallets.
8570000	8572000	Oh, yeah, sort of.
8572000	8576000	SSJ100Matt says, so I have to ask, Rift versus Morpheus,
8576000	8579000	which parts of each did you like?
8579000	8581000	Ooh, that is such a tough question.
8581000	8585000	You know, now that we know Facebook is acquiring Oculus,
8585000	8588000	I don't know if it's going to be just for games.
8588000	8591000	I think games are going to be a big feature and an important feature,
8591000	8594000	but I think they're going to do a lot of other stuff with it, too,
8594000	8599000	whereas with the Morpheus, you know, you have all that dedicating,
8599000	8601000	processing stuff for games.
8601000	8603000	It is a gaming device.
8603000	8607000	I don't see them doing necessarily a lot of other stuff with this.
8607000	8612000	It is like PC versus console.
8612000	8613000	Many households have both.
8613000	8615000	There's room for both in the industry,
8615000	8617000	and I kind of think that's what it boils down to.
8617000	8623000	As far as the whole, like, how did it look, they looked very similar to me.
8623000	8627000	I mean, the look inside, that whole part didn't really change.
8627000	8631000	What was different were the types of demos I was playing.
8631000	8634000	So it's just going to be very interesting to see what the different,
8634000	8637000	you know, console versus PC can bring to the table.
8637000	8639000	I think it's too soon.
8639000	8640000	Excuse me.
8640000	8641000	I have the hiccups.
8641000	8642000	Live Radio Guy's worst nightmare.
8642000	8648000	It's too soon to tell a little bit what these consoles are really going to do
8648000	8649000	to distinguish themselves,
8650000	8653000	but I definitely see the room for them both to grow in their own different ways.
8653000	8655000	Anyway, I need to take a drink of water.
8655000	8657000	So, Loki, why don't you take us back to press conferences.
8657000	8658000	All right.
8658000	8663000	So, yeah, the press conference we had next, I believe, was EA.
8663000	8665000	I think they were first.
8665000	8666000	Yeah, EA was first.
8666000	8670000	And so they had, you know, they showed EA Sports PGA Tour,
8670000	8674000	which, like I mentioned, it's Frostbite 3,
8674000	8678000	and this time, you know, Tiger Woods being dropped from the cover.
8679000	8683000	And they're going to have some fantasy courses in there as well,
8683000	8686000	including one that they teased that was based off of Battlefield.
8686000	8690000	So they had, like, this giant aircraft carrier crashing into an island.
8691000	8692000	I don't know.
8692000	8693000	Whatever.
8693000	8694000	Cool.
8694000	8697000	And it's supposed to be, I think, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8697000	8699000	I'm guessing early next year.
8699000	8702000	The Sims 4 coming out September 2,
8702000	8706000	and they were showing off some of the new emotions, I guess, in the game,
8706000	8708000	and you can even kill somebody with emotions.
8708000	8710000	So, neat, I guess.
8711000	8716000	Criterion teased a new game that they didn't really have a title for yet,
8716000	8723000	but it was kind of this off-road, like an off-road extreme sports type thing.
8723000	8728000	They've got, like, ATVs and jet skis and wing suits and helicopters
8728000	8729000	and stuff like that.
8731000	8732000	Looked really cool.
8732000	8735000	Kind of like a new, I don't know if it's going to be a burnout game,
8735000	8737000	but I'm pretty excited about anything they make.
8738000	8740000	Battlefield Hardline, they showed that a little bit.
8740000	8743000	That's that brand-new Battlefield game that's all about, you know,
8743000	8745000	kind of bank heists and stuff,
8745000	8748000	where you're going to have, you know, the criminals and the police
8748000	8750000	and the whole thing along with that.
8750000	8753000	And, you know, Levolution stuff is still, you know, in there.
8755000	8757000	They showed off Mirror's Edge a little bit.
8757000	8760000	They kind of did, like, I don't really know.
8760000	8762000	It's more concept art and concept gameplay.
8762000	8766000	They didn't really show off anything, you know, final.
8766000	8770000	They teased a little bit of Star Wars Battlefront, you know,
8770000	8773000	and did a little bit of the concept art for that.
8773000	8777000	They showed, you know, concept art and stuff for Mass Effect,
8777000	8779000	you know, the next Mass Effect game.
8779000	8781000	They haven't really said much about it.
8781000	8786000	And then, you know, showed off trailers for NHL 15 and FIFA 15,
8786000	8788000	which looked pretty nice.
8788000	8790000	And those are both out in September.
8790000	8793000	Now, Dark Soccer, I'm sure you have some opinions
8793000	8797000	on the BioWare portion of this press conference.
8797000	8800000	Thank you for showing us your tech demo,
8800000	8803000	which, I mean, at this point I didn't expect them to have anything,
8803000	8807000	oh, playable this, okay, yeah, you have a Krogan yelling.
8807000	8812000	Yeah, you've given us the same lines you gave us for Mass Effect 3.
8812000	8816000	And also they had some, you know, footage of Dragon Age Inquisition.
8816000	8817000	Oh.
8817000	8819000	Now that I'm excited about.
8820000	8823000	So, I think the reality just has to set in, though, Dark Soccer,
8823000	8827000	that Mass Effect is looking more and more like a spring 2016 title.
8827000	8828000	Yeah.
8829000	8830000	Fine.
8831000	8833000	They do have that other new IP they're working on,
8833000	8835000	which, you know, we knew that was happening,
8835000	8838000	but we didn't know a lot about it, except that it's contemporary, apparently,
8838000	8840000	is the only thing that was really slipped in there.
8840000	8841000	Yeah.
8841000	8842000	So, yeah.
8842000	8843000	It's too soon to tell.
8843000	8847000	Like, that whole seemed to be like a bone, not so much for the gamers,
8847000	8849000	but maybe, I guess, investors or something like that.
8849000	8850000	It's being worked on.
8850000	8852000	What was it I told you before the show?
8852000	8854000	Promises or lies until they happen?
8855000	8856000	That's right.
8857000	8861000	If wishes and musts were clusters of nuts, we'd all have a bowl of granola.
8863000	8867000	Well, and there's also The Sims, where, you know,
8867000	8869000	I was seeing some of the stuff about moving houses around,
8869000	8874000	and, you know, apparently, woohoo is a skill.
8876000	8877000	Okay.
8877000	8878000	Interesting.
8880000	8881000	It's more of the same.
8881000	8884000	I'm probably gonna play it once the modding community catches up
8884000	8888000	and makes everything pretty, and not just that crappy, weird style
8888000	8889000	that all The Sims stuff does.
8889000	8893000	You know, this is the problem I have with EA and The Sims,
8893000	8897000	and I guess whatever's left of Maxis, you know, behind it.
8898000	8904000	If the fan community is doing this, why don't you do that, too,
8904000	8908000	and make it look like, apparently, how the fan community wants it to?
8908000	8914000	You can get really, really, really good textures if you put some effort into it.
8915000	8916000	The game will run it.
8917000	8918000	Try it out.
8920000	8923000	I just wonder what songs are gonna be ruined in Simlish.
8923000	8924000	Can't wait to see that.
8924000	8926000	I don't know. Some of the Simlish ones are funny.
8927000	8928000	All right.
8929000	8931000	Anything else on EA's conference, guys?
8933000	8934000	Mirror's Edge.
8934000	8936000	That's pretty much it, I think.
8936000	8938000	I mean, Battlefield Hardline looks interesting.
8939000	8944000	It looks more exciting than what they've got for Grand Theft Auto V's heists.
8945000	8947000	So, I don't know. It'll be interesting.
8947000	8950000	Although, I'm a little hesitant, just because of all the crappy netcode
8950000	8951000	that they had for Battlefield 4.
8951000	8953000	You know, it's gonna be one of those wait-and-see things.
8954000	8955000	Right.
8955000	8956000	I hope they learn their lesson.
8957000	8960000	Tigerclaw, the point of The Sims is not to be fucking realistic.
8961000	8963000	The point of The Sims is to have them die.
8964000	8966000	Well, now, wait a minute, Dark Soccer.
8966000	8968000	Everybody plays the game differently.
8968000	8971000	What if somebody wants to see a realistic representation of themselves in the game?
8971000	8972000	Then don't play The Sims.
8974000	8976000	I mean, you can have a job as a ghost catcher.
8978000	8980000	You can have a job as a ghost catcher.
8982000	8983000	The Sims is-
8983000	8984000	You can have alien babies.
8984000	8988000	The Sims is similar to Tomodachi Life in that regard for me,
8988000	8992000	where it's like, here's the fan fiction version of your life.
8994000	8995000	Does that make sense?
8995000	8996000	This is your fan fiction life.
8997000	9000000	Eating watermelons does not guarantee a boy.
9003000	9006000	Apparently, if you eat a certain fruit, like right before you're about to give birth,
9006000	9009000	then you have a baby of a particular gender.
9009000	9010000	I had no idea.
9010000	9015000	I wanna know if I eat a watermelon-apple hybrid, if I will have a hermaphrodite.
9015000	9016000	Maybe.
9016000	9019000	That would be awesome, and then my kid could just decide to be whatever.
9019000	9020000	There you go.
9020000	9021000	Moving on.
9021000	9023000	Anything else for EA's conference?
9024000	9025000	No.
9025000	9026000	Alright.
9026000	9027000	One more to do.
9027000	9028000	How about Ubi?
9028000	9029000	Ubisoft.
9029000	9031000	Of course, they had Aisha Tyler hosting again.
9031000	9036000	They showed off some more footage for games that were in other conferences,
9036000	9037000	including The Division.
9037000	9040000	They showed off more Assassin's Creed Unity.
9041000	9043000	They showed The Crew, which looks interesting.
9043000	9045000	That's actually coming out this year now.
9045000	9048000	They're gonna have a closed beta, I guess, July 23rd,
9048000	9055000	and it reminds me a little bit of that one game, Fuel,
9055000	9059000	where you can drive across country, except not as boring,
9059000	9064000	but you're apparently gonna drive from the east coast to the west coast.
9064000	9069000	Granted, it's not an exact representation of the entire United States.
9069000	9071000	It's very kind of summarized.
9071000	9075000	But they've got that where you can play that.
9075000	9078000	Almost looks a little bit like Forza Horizon in that sense,
9078000	9080000	where you can kind of just drive wherever you want.
9080000	9082000	So very cool looking.
9082000	9087000	They showed off some stuff for Just Dance 2015.
9087000	9093000	They also announced this Just Dance Now app that's gonna be available for smartphones.
9093000	9097000	And the way it works is if you have a device that's like a smart device
9097000	9102000	that you can stream content to, apparently you pull up a certain website,
9102000	9107000	link it with your phone, and then you pick your song on your phone,
9107000	9110000	and you kind of dance with what's on the screen,
9110000	9112000	and your phone picks up the movements,
9112000	9114000	and you can actually play Just Dance that way.
9114000	9116000	I thought the tech was interesting.
9116000	9119000	Not necessarily a game I'd play, but it's a neat idea.
9119000	9121000	So I give them credit there.
9121000	9124000	They have a new fitness game called Shape Up,
9124000	9127000	which looked like kind of a bunch of, like a cross between,
9127000	9134000	like a Kinect sports type game and the Wii Fit stuff,
9134000	9137000	where it's a bunch of mini games that get you exercising.
9137000	9139000	They are kind of goofy.
9139000	9142000	And then the last little tease that they had,
9142000	9145000	oh, they showed some more Far Cry gameplay,
9145000	9149000	including that you can do co-op in it,
9149000	9152000	and at least on PlayStation 4.
9152000	9154000	I'm not sure if it's on Xbox One or the other systems,
9154000	9158000	but if you have a friend that doesn't have a copy of the game,
9158000	9160000	they still will be able to play co-op with you
9160000	9162000	without owning a copy of the game.
9162000	9164000	I forgot about that little tidbit.
9164000	9166000	That was quite a neat little piece of information, wasn't it?
9166000	9169000	That's like something we haven't seen since like the DS.
9169000	9172000	You know, where you can like beam Mario Kart to your friend,
9172000	9175000	but they can only play a Shy Guy type of thing?
9175000	9177000	Yeah, so it was interesting.
9177000	9182000	And then the last little tease that they had was Rainbow Six Siege,
9182000	9185000	which is, I guess, a brand new,
9185000	9187000	I'm not really sure what the premise of it is,
9187000	9191000	other than like SWAT teams are rescuing hostages and stuff like that.
9191000	9193000	And so they had, you know, the mode they're shown.
9193000	9196000	One person, you know, one team was the hostage takers,
9196000	9199000	and the other ones were, you know, kind of the SWAT team.
9199000	9203000	And very dynamic as far as like you can blow holes in the walls
9203000	9205000	and stuff like that in the house,
9205000	9208000	and you kind of attack from different entry points and stuff.
9208000	9210000	Looked interesting. I don't know.
9210000	9212000	A little bit different for Rainbow Six series.
9212000	9214000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,
9214000	9217000	TigerClaw says, you know what was missing at the Ubisoft press conference?
9217000	9219000	They didn't announce a new Rayman game.
9219000	9220000	You know, that's a good point.
9220000	9223000	There was a lot of rumble about a Prince of Persia game
9223000	9224000	that was supposed to use the Rayman.
9224000	9226000	That didn't come to light.
9226000	9228000	Well, they also have that World War II game.
9228000	9230000	Oh, yeah, there was that.
9230000	9231000	The Ubi artist thing.
9231000	9233000	I don't remember what it was called, though,
9233000	9235000	but it had the dog in it before.
9235000	9237000	I think it was World War II or World War I.
9237000	9239000	It looked kind of interesting.
9239000	9242000	Yeah, kind of got the feels going at the conference.
9242000	9247000	So they had that, and then they did have some rabid stuff that they didn't show.
9247000	9251000	They have an interactive TV show that's supposed to be coming out,
9251000	9254000	along with, I think, their TV show that they have currently.
9254000	9256000	I'm not really sure.
9256000	9259000	They didn't really announce too much about that.
9259000	9262000	So overall thoughts on Ubi's conference?
9262000	9265000	They have some good games coming.
9265000	9267000	There wasn't anything that really...
9267000	9270000	The last few years, Ubisoft seemed to have the best...
9270000	9272000	Valiant Hearts.
9272000	9273000	Thank you.
9273000	9277000	Ubisoft had the strongest conference, I thought, the last couple of years.
9277000	9279000	They showed off some really impressive games,
9279000	9282000	but they didn't show off too much new stuff this year.
9282000	9287000	I think maybe some of that is because they showed it off at other...
9287000	9291000	The other three had stuff from them,
9291000	9293000	so maybe it wasn't that big of a deal.
9293000	9295000	But I don't know.
9295000	9296000	They have some pretty strong games coming.
9296000	9297000	Far Cry looks awesome.
9297000	9299000	Assassin's Creed looks awesome.
9299000	9303000	I'm kind of interested in the crew game.
9303000	9306000	Rainbow Six Siege might be interesting.
9306000	9309000	And definitely The Vision looks neat.
9309000	9311000	So they have some pretty cool games coming,
9311000	9314000	but there wasn't anything really surprising.
9314000	9316000	The only thing that was annoying, though,
9316000	9320000	was how long they went on with some of the things like the Shape-Up demo.
9320000	9324000	The Shape-Up demo was so long.
9324000	9327000	It just drug on and on.
9327000	9329000	That was the problem with some of these demos.
9329000	9330000	It's like, okay, we get it.
9330000	9331000	Okay, we get it.
9331000	9333000	Stop.
9333000	9334000	All right.
9334000	9335000	Well, there it is.
9335000	9338000	That's all the big press conferences
9338000	9341000	and kind of our little take on it and you guys in our chat room.
9341000	9345000	Again, if you have further thoughts on something maybe we didn't touch on,
9345000	9347000	be sure to email us for a future show.
9347000	9349000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9349000	9352000	Speaking of emails, I think now is a good time to get into the mail bag.
9352000	9354000	So we'll have Dark Soccer open up that mail bag,
9354000	9355000	and then we'll close out maybe, Loki,
9355000	9358000	if there's a couple other things you want to touch on news-wise
9358000	9360000	that maybe doesn't have to do with any of the press conferences,
9360000	9362000	we can talk about some of those.
9362000	9363000	So let's get to it.
9363000	9366000	And then we'll open up for some calls at 1-877-GAMELR
9366000	9368000	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9368000	9372000	But let's have Dark Soccer dive into the email bag.
9372000	9376000	Every week you guys send us emails to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9376000	9377000	because you want to participate, right?
9377000	9379000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,
9379000	9381000	and Dark Soccer will pick out some emails that she enjoys
9381000	9385000	or that she hates and wants to call you out on air.
9385000	9387000	Dark Soccer, what's in the mail bag tonight?
9387000	9389000	First one. There's four of them.
9389000	9391000	What's up, Orange Lounge?
9391000	9393000	What's up?
9393000	9396000	I was just responding in kind.
9396000	9400000	The 555 show is great. Lots of good E3 prep. Thanks much.
9400000	9403000	This person really likes ellipses.
9403000	9407000	This week's question is a little different and definitely silly.
9407000	9411000	If you could get down and dirty with any one superhero from the Marvel Universe,
9411000	9414000	who would it be and how would you ask them out?
9414000	9418000	Make sure Allen knows this question is posed specifically for hypothetical single Rob,
9418000	9420000	so Allen can't get mad.
9420000	9422000	Take it easy, gang. EA skeezy.
9422000	9424000	Allen wouldn't care. He thinks this question.
9424000	9426000	Allen's in the kitchen right now and probably thinks this question is funny.
9426000	9429000	Oh, here he comes. Uh-oh. Uh-oh, here comes Allen.
9429000	9431000	You want to say something to this emailer?
9431000	9433000	It's Marvel, right? Yeah.
9433000	9436000	If Chris Evans' Steve Rogers asked you out, I'd be like,
9436000	9438000	I'm not. I wouldn't even be mad.
9438000	9440000	You'd go on right ahead.
9440000	9443000	Like, yeah.
9443000	9445000	Getting jealous or angry? No.
9445000	9447000	Not when it's Chris Evans.
9447000	9450000	See? Nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about.
9450000	9453000	Good answer, by the way. Can I just take that answer?
9453000	9456000	Don't sleep with Quicksilver because it'll be over really fast.
9456000	9459000	No.
9459000	9463000	While I really have no leanings,
9463000	9466000	I'd actually have to go with Wolverine for one reason.
9466000	9470000	Experience. Lots and lots of experience.
9470000	9475000	How about Colossus from X-Men?
9475000	9477000	In Ultimate Universe, he is gay.
9477000	9480000	Oh, that's right. Perfect.
9480000	9484000	Loki? I have no idea. I don't even follow comics anymore, so
9484000	9486000	I don't fucking know who anybody is.
9486000	9488000	I can't even think of like...
9488000	9491000	X-Men? Is he? No, I don't watch the X-Men movies now.
9491000	9493000	Alright, alright. I don't know.
9493000	9495000	Any of the slutty looking ones.
9495000	9498000	I'll pick any of them. I mean, honestly, I don't even think it's...
9498000	9501000	As long as it's maybe not She-Hulk because that could be weird, but like, you know,
9501000	9503000	it doesn't really matter.
9503000	9507000	Maybe not like Rogue because I don't want to die, but you know,
9507000	9510000	anybody else, you know, I'm sure.
9510000	9512000	I'm pretty impartial of it. It doesn't matter.
9512000	9514000	I do have a number two, by the way.
9514000	9516000	That would be Carol Danvers.
9516000	9519000	Because, oh my god. Hot.
9519000	9521000	Thank you for your question.
9521000	9523000	Weirdo.
9523000	9525000	Next email.
9525000	9526000	Yeah.
9526000	9528000	Hey, OLR peeps.
9528000	9532000	I hope you're all doing well, especially after all your running around at E3.
9532000	9535000	I came across the VOG Network after starting my new job late last year
9535000	9537000	and have been hooked ever since.
9537000	9539000	Orange Challenge Radio, the Bobby Black Wolf Show, and Horde House
9539000	9541000	are, in my opinion, the best castes out there,
9541000	9544000	so I thought I'd make an effort to write in and let you know
9544000	9547000	how much your listeners appreciate what you do.
9547000	9548000	Thank you.
9548000	9550000	Yes, thanks.
9550000	9553000	Anyway, the last week you were chatting about listeners around the world,
9553000	9555000	so it seemed like the right time to give you a shout-out
9555000	9558000	from the land Titanfall forgot, South Africa.
9558000	9562000	Not that that stopped most of us from playing Titanfall, anyway.
9562000	9565000	Pausing here. We need a map of the world
9565000	9568000	so we can start pinning where we're getting calls from.
9568000	9572000	You know, Miss Victoria was here yesterday.
9572000	9574000	I can't remember if she was on the show before.
9574000	9576000	I think she was on one episode of OLR a long time ago,
9576000	9578000	and she said there's a blank spot in our new studio right there.
9578000	9579000	There is.
9579000	9581000	So I think we should get a map of the world.
9581000	9583000	And corkboard.
9583000	9586000	As a rental, you don't want to put holes in the wall.
9586000	9589000	Well, you should see one of our bedrooms because there's holes everywhere.
9589000	9591000	But anyway, yeah, you're right.
9591000	9594000	We'll get a corkboard map of the world thing and put the little pins in it,
9594000	9596000	and so we'll put one in South Africa.
9596000	9598000	Okay. But we didn't know. We didn't get what town.
9598000	9600000	I mean, I could just assume it's Johannesburg
9600000	9603000	because that's the only town, you know, but maybe somewhere else.
9603000	9605000	There is more to South Africa than Johannesburg.
9605000	9608000	I know, but that's the only one I ever hear about.
9608000	9611000	Being a South African online, you wouldn't believe the comments
9611000	9613000	I get from other foreign players.
9613000	9617000	So I'm going as far as asking if we have electricity down here in South Africa,
9617000	9621000	to which I can only facepalm and tell them the only story they'd believe,
9621000	9624000	that we have lions running on a treadmill somewhere to power everything.
9627000	9630000	My mind goes to Mean Girls and that scene.
9630000	9633000	But if you're from Africa, why are you white?
9633000	9636000	You just can't ask people.
9636000	9639000	You just can't ask people why they're white.
9640000	9642000	I haven't even seen that movie and I know that line.
9642000	9646000	You don't have to see Mean Girls to be able to quote it effectively.
9646000	9647000	I need to see it though.
9647000	9649000	Do they have Mean Girls in South Africa?
9649000	9651000	You should ask the lion to generate that for you.
9651000	9652000	Tell us what part.
9652000	9657000	Actually though, I watched a good number of series about what people go through
9657000	9659000	in some of the poorer parts of South Africa.
9659000	9661000	It's actually pretty crazy.
9661000	9665000	Even while things have been supposed to be improved after apartheid ended,
9665000	9669000	there's some places that really I think could use some charitable touches.
9669000	9671000	So anyway, moving forward.
9672000	9675000	I've heard a lot of these comments in my day online.
9675000	9677000	Things like, do you ride elephants to school?
9677000	9679000	Are all of you black?
9679000	9681000	Do you have a pet lion? And so on.
9681000	9684000	I was wondering if any of you had to deal with an online stereotypes
9684000	9687000	or if you believe in online stereotypes and if so, what are they?
9687000	9690000	All the best and keep up the good work, Screeze.
9690000	9695000	Well, I'm a woman so I got told to get off the radio and make a sandwich
9695000	9697000	by some shit on Digg.
9699000	9703000	Well, what was the last time Digg has been brought up?
9703000	9705000	I think that just wrapped itself up there.
9705000	9706000	Exactly.
9706000	9708000	Although that wasn't, to be fair, it wasn't the site's fault.
9708000	9710000	It was some jackass commenter.
9710000	9715000	Well, being a gay gamer certainly comes with stereotypes of its own, right?
9715000	9717000	Like I think some people expect me to come out here and go,
9717000	9720000	oh my God, it's E3.
9720000	9724000	You know, that whole, you know, okay, Hante mama, yes.
9724000	9726000	You know, no.
9726000	9729000	I like RuPaul's Drag Race. Don't get me wrong. It doesn't mean I live it.
9729000	9733000	So certainly there's those stereotypes.
9733000	9734000	Loki, what's your...
9734000	9737000	Do you sit in your underwear and scratch your butt while playing Battlefield?
9738000	9743000	Yeah, I was going to say, Loki, as a straight white male waspy guy
9743000	9746000	who plays video games, what stereotypes do you face?
9746000	9748000	I don't face any stereotypes.
9748000	9751000	I am the stereotype.
9751000	9754000	I just saw the best conversation in chat, by the way.
9754000	9755000	Was that?
9755000	9758000	Bobby Singh, people assume my race based off my gamertag,
9758000	9761000	and Kaijuto asks, they think you're a wolf?
9763000	9766000	I think it's Native American is what he's getting at.
9767000	9769000	Well, as far as Black Wolf's name goes.
9769000	9770000	But I still thought they'd think...
9770000	9772000	We actually had that conversation over this week.
9772000	9775000	Something about gamertags, and I said something about your,
9775000	9779000	it sounds, your name, Bobby Black Wolf, sounds like it's Native American.
9779000	9781000	But as you guys know, that's not his real name,
9781000	9784000	just as Rob Roberts is not my real name, shock and awe.
9784000	9786000	So, anyway.
9786000	9788000	And Jamie Summers isn't her real name either.
9788000	9790000	I'm really not the Bionic Woman, y'all.
9790000	9792000	And guess what? Loki isn't his real name.
9792000	9795000	But, true facts, I was named after the Bionic Woman.
9795000	9797000	I know. That's an awesome story.
9797000	9799000	Was that it for the South Africa email?
9799000	9800000	Oh, yeah. For that one, yeah.
9800000	9803000	Thank you for the email. That was very nice.
9804000	9805000	Yes, thank you.
9805000	9806000	We're going to get a map in.
9806000	9808000	Tell us where you're from so we can put a pin,
9808000	9811000	other than South Africa, because that's really generic.
9812000	9814000	Hey, OLR crew.
9814000	9817000	Last week you all put out for the call for people who went to the event
9817000	9820000	to watch Sony's E3 press conference in a movie theater.
9820000	9821000	We did? Oh, yeah.
9821000	9822000	We did.
9822000	9824000	We went and figured I'd give some impressions
9824000	9826000	and an email for Dark Sakura to wade through.
9826000	9827000	Oh, thank you.
9827000	9829000	Ooh, gold star for this person already.
9829000	9831000	You get a stale Twinkie.
9832000	9834000	A gold Twinkie award.
9835000	9837000	We bronzed a Twinkie for you.
9838000	9839000	It's been in the deep fryer.
9839000	9844000	By the way, one of our, the guy who was behind Atari Party,
9844000	9846000	his Jaguar died.
9846000	9847000	So he's like, I don't know what I should do with it.
9847000	9849000	I was like, bronze it.
9849000	9852000	You can then be the only person to have a bronze Jaguar.
9852000	9853000	Anyway.
9854000	9856000	Got there and was given a badge with a code on the back
9856000	9861000	that ended up being good for Destiny and Battlefield betas
9861000	9863000	plus $5 a PSN credit.
9863000	9865000	On the plus side of the event it was awesome
9865000	9868000	to get to see some of the trailers on the big screen.
9868000	9870000	Some of the more cinematic trailers like the Phantom Pain trailer
9870000	9873000	during the conference were great on the big screen
9873000	9876000	and with the full sound system.
9876000	9878000	There's also some extra content after the normal stream,
9878000	9882000	mostly consisting of developer interviews focused on Destiny and No Man's Sky.
9882000	9885000	On the down side, it may have just been my theater.
9885000	9887000	The internet connection was on and off.
9887000	9889000	We had some serious artifacting on the stream
9889000	9891000	and the stream dropped once or twice.
9891000	9893000	The sound system was bad for non-trailer stuff.
9893000	9896000	Audio, such as normal speech from the presenters,
9896000	9899000	was not really geared to the theater sound systems.
9899000	9903000	Another downside was not being able to tweet snarky comments during it.
9903000	9907000	I didn't want to be the ass with his phone out in the dark theater.
9907000	9909000	Well, I appreciate you. Thank you.
9909000	9914000	PS is a side note about all the journalism and Twitter comments I'm reading during E3.
9914000	9918000	Can we stop caring about who did or didn't win E3?
9918000	9920000	Thank you. Oh my god, thank you.
9920000	9922000	You get two Twinkies.
9922000	9925000	Gamers won E3. One of them isn't stale, by the way.
9925000	9927000	It's deep fried.
9927000	9929000	Gamers won E3, in my opinion.
9929000	9932000	As a PS4 Wii U Vita 3DS owner,
9932000	9935000	I saw games that I want to play coming on all those platforms.
9935000	9937000	That's all I care about.
9937000	9941000	And I'm going to say that's from Andrew R.
9941000	9943000	Well, a gold Twinkie for you.
9943000	9945000	That was a very good report. Thank you.
9945000	9947000	You know what's funny, and let me tell you some differences
9947000	9950000	between what I'm reading or hearing from your email
9950000	9954000	and the experience of actually being there in the actual facility
9954000	9956000	where the conference was taking place.
9956000	9960000	The artifacting happened during the Batman thing.
9960000	9963000	That actually happened in the theater for us too.
9963000	9965000	And we thought, or at least I did at first,
9965000	9968000	and the guy sitting next to me thought it was intentional
9968000	9971000	because of the whole way the Scarecrow broke in right after that.
9971000	9973000	I thought, oh.
9973000	9975000	In the theater, we all kind of did that whole,
9975000	9977000	oh shit, it broke, oh shit.
9977000	9979000	But then the Scarecrow came up and we were like,
9979000	9981000	oh, okay, oh, get it, oh, I get it.
9981000	9983000	That was a joke. Oh, okay.
9983000	9985000	But it sounds like that actually wasn't supposed to happen.
9985000	9990000	It just happened at, I guess, a decent time to kind of get away with it.
9990000	9993000	But yeah, so they had some problems there in the theater as well.
9993000	9995000	But all the sound was fine for us.
9995000	9998000	I will say this though, you guys got all that stuff,
9998000	10003000	like the VIP badge and the PlayStation Now codes and all that stuff.
10003000	10005000	They didn't give that out of the conference.
10005000	10006000	We didn't get any of that stuff.
10006000	10009000	So you guys got some extra stuff in the theater.
10009000	10011000	To be fair though, they did hand out the PlayStation Now codes
10011000	10015000	at E3 on the floor, so we did get our chance eventually.
10015000	10019000	Yeah, none of this other stuff you're talking about.
10019000	10021000	Was that it for e-mails, Star Sakura? Was that four?
10021000	10022000	There's one more.
10022000	10023000	Oh, one more.
10023000	10024000	I'm just making up names for everybody.
10024000	10025000	Oh, okay.
10025000	10027000	Like, I said Agduff's name is Fernando.
10027000	10029000	And Tigerclaw's Ivan.
10029000	10031000	Because I said so.
10031000	10034000	Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
10034000	10037000	I almost bought Sing Star Abba last night because it was five bucks.
10037000	10040000	Buying Sing Star Abba is always the right thing to do.
10040000	10042000	But I didn't because I bought a book instead.
10042000	10044000	And Dan got his multi-card.
10044000	10045000	Fuck your book.
10045000	10046000	You know what?
10046000	10048000	Read a fucking book and maybe you're-
10048000	10050000	Listen to some Abba.
10050000	10055000	Read a fucking book and your vocabulary will be more than 2,000 words, Rob.
10055000	10056000	Listen to some-
10056000	10058000	They consist of fuck shit cock.
10058000	10062000	Listen to some Abba and you'll be more glamorous, Star Sakura.
10062000	10064000	Bitch, I'm fabulous.
10064000	10066000	All right, I got nothing. Next e-mail.
10066000	10068000	Dear OLR Gang,
10068000	10071000	Although I'm not generally vocal about social justice in video games-
10071000	10073000	Oh, next. No, kidding.
10073000	10077000	I have been attempting to watch the industry with a more critical eye
10077000	10082000	since these issues are being more openly discussed with campaigns such as
10082000	10084000	One Reason Why or Mii Quality
10084000	10087000	and videos such as Tropes vs. Women in video games.
10087000	10092000	As a result, I couldn't help but notice Nintendo's strong public showing this past week at E3
10092000	10095000	not only in regards to my personal opinion of the entire event
10095000	10097000	but also in regards to the female representation
10097000	10101000	both in their games and the human presenters, developers, and game players.
10101000	10104000	As far as games go, both Super Smash Brothers and Hyrule Warriors
10104000	10107000	presented a wide array of playable female characters
10107000	10111000	plus who prominently featured the female inklings in their promotions
10111000	10115000	and for better or for worse, Bayonetta is a game featuring not only a powerful female protagonist
10115000	10122000	who I snarkily imagine is a woman who is so much harder to animate than any female
10122000	10124000	Ubisoft refuses to put effort into animating
10124000	10128000	but also exclusively featuring a female on its box art.
10128000	10131000	Also, onto the flesh and blood side of things
10131000	10134000	the Treehouse presenters appeared to be made up of a sizable number of women
10134000	10139000	there were female developers featured demoing during the Treehouse streaming round tables
10139000	10142000	and the Super Smash Brothers Invitational Tournament featured
10142000	10146000	a nearly equal amount of female players and celebrity guests to male.
10146000	10151000	I want to know your opinions on Nintendo's current and potential future treatment of women in games and gaming
10151000	10157000	considering their most iconic series is very frequently featured the exact type of treatment of women
10157000	10159000	that is now being criticized.
10159000	10164000	I am especially interested in your opinion on Nintendo's intention to target young female gamers
10164000	10166000	in the next demographic.
10166000	10168000	Thank you for the great show each week.
10168000	10170000	Sincerely, Awesome Unicorn.
10170000	10173000	Well, Nintendo, I mean, that was a lot of questions at the end.
10173000	10175000	That's okay though.
10175000	10177000	Nintendo does a great job, I think I can answer this one real quickly.
10177000	10181000	Nintendo does a great job of showing how easy it really is.
10181000	10183000	It's not that hard, people.
10183000	10185000	It's not that hard.
10185000	10189000	And Nintendo does do a really good job of creating great characters.
10189000	10193000	And it took them a while to get there, I mean, right?
10193000	10196000	You go to some of the early Nintendo games and it still kind of fell into that rub
10196000	10199000	but you really have seen where Nintendo's kind of grown in.
10199000	10203000	Yes, we want to reach all types of gamers including the young females
10203000	10206000	so we have a lot of strong characters from all over the spectrum.
10206000	10209000	I would still argue, like I said earlier in the show,
10209000	10212000	they have some things to learn when it comes to sexuality and so forth
10212000	10214000	but they're moving in the right direction
10214000	10218000	so okay, I'm not going to get all Tumblr on you.
10218000	10220000	I like that you said that.
10220000	10224000	Anyway, the whole other thing too
10224000	10228000	is that they really are getting away from the damsel in distress trope.
10228000	10231000	Like, I mean, just look at Twilight Princess.
10231000	10236000	While, yes, the character of Midna, not my cat,
10236000	10242000	was in a position where she needed to ask help of the main character,
10242000	10246000	she was also right along there with him and did her part.
10246000	10252000	She was weakened because of something, not because of being a woman.
10252000	10257000	And so that was pretty rad to me.
10257000	10270000	I do like that they're bringing in some of the various princesses, goddesses, and Smash Brothers
10270000	10273000	and having them still be pretty and kicking ass
10273000	10276000	but I think we need to see more.
10276000	10283000	If they want to target the young girls, it should be in a role that isn't necessarily frilly or cutesy or pretty.
10283000	10286000	It needs to be in a role of capability.
10286000	10287000	Bayonetta?
10287000	10290000	Well, no, that's not for young girls.
10290000	10292000	Very true, very true.
10292000	10300000	But I'm saying, cooking mama's great, but mama needs to also have some other jobs.
10300000	10302000	Well, she gardens.
10302000	10306000	That's gardening grandma.
10306000	10310000	You guys need to see the stare I just got from Darzaka in the studio.
10310000	10321000	But anyway, to answer the question, the discussion of targeting certain people is really weird to me.
10321000	10323000	It's always been a weird thing in this industry to me.
10323000	10325000	I'm just kind of like, put things out there for the people.
10325000	10332000	But I also understand that the young girls, if we are to stereotype and generalize,
10332000	10335000	which I suppose you have to do when you talk targeting,
10335000	10342000	there's probably a lot that get really put off by the severed heads and blood and guns.
10342000	10347000	So in that regard, Nintendo, to target them, is smart.
10347000	10350000	That's just smart business at the end of the day.
10350000	10357000	Because when the rest of the gaming industry isn't speaking to them, we might be making games that are in a regard.
10357000	10362000	That's not to say there aren't some young women out there that would like to sever some heads and play the blood and gore games.
10362000	10363000	There's certainly plenty.
10363000	10364000	I love beheadings.
10364000	10366000	I'm not the one receiving them.
10366000	10371000	Did you see that Assassin's Creed Unity thing where the guy got beheaded and you see it through his eyes?
10371000	10373000	I could just hear my mother, Rob!
10373000	10375000	This is gross!
10375000	10377000	You went to LA for this?
10377000	10379000	You spent all your money going to Disneyland.
10379000	10381000	You should be saving money.
10381000	10383000	This is gross.
10383000	10385000	This is gross.
10385000	10387000	Anyway.
10387000	10403000	But to generalize again, or what you have to do when you're talking targeting, I understand that Nintendo is trying to make games for people that might feel left out otherwise.
10403000	10405000	And that's just smart.
10405000	10410000	You know what I hear when I think of demographics and targeting groups and everything?
10410000	10416000	I'm thinking you're reducing us to numbers and not respecting your customers.
10416000	10421000	That's how the market works, but that's also...
10421000	10427000	Don't get me started. That's going to be a big socio-political economic rant, so I won't go there.
10427000	10431000	We're already past midnight on the East Coast, so we've got to keep it moving.
10431000	10433000	Was that it for email, Zoe?
10433000	10434000	That was it.
10434000	10440000	If you want to send something to the mailbag, participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send us an email.
10440000	10443000	Again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
10444000	10447000	Loki, any other E3 tidbits you want to touch on real quick?
10447000	10450000	I'm going to pull up my notes and see if there's any other games I want to talk to you about.
10450000	10455000	I don't remember if we mentioned this or not, but Devil's Third is now a Wii U exclusive.
10455000	10464000	The game is originally going to die a slow death, and Nintendo has decided to go the route of Bayonetta 2 where they're funding the release of it.
10464000	10466000	So that's kind of cool.
10469000	10471000	Let's see. What else?
10472000	10477000	I guess they had a portable Steam machine or someone that was shown off a prototype of.
10477000	10482000	It actually looks like a portable device that's built into a Steam controller.
10482000	10486000	They call it the Steam Boy.
10486000	10492000	Apparently, he's going to have a quad-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of built-in storage.
10492000	10498000	I'm not sure if they'd be able to run a lot of games on it, but you need a guess. I don't know.
10499000	10508000	One demo I saw at E3, an invite presentation, and I got to say this was not a game that was on my radar, but it is now.
10508000	10512000	I was very impressed with the preview we had for The Witcher 3.
10512000	10517000	I'm going to be honest, I haven't really played the first two games, so this was really my introduction to the series.
10517000	10520000	I definitely saw a lot of Skyrim-esque elements in it.
10520000	10526000	My understanding is that some of the combat in the first two games is really hard.
10526000	10528000	For that reason, it might not be accessible.
10528000	10533000	I didn't get a lot of answers to those concerns in the presentation we were getting.
10533000	10537000	Which, of course, when the game makers are playing the game, they make combat look easy.
10537000	10539000	But I will say it looked cool.
10539000	10545000	I'm going to tell you what really struck me about The Witcher 3 was that the art direction was really good.
10545000	10553000	We saw this scene where you had an older lady that was communicating to these spirits in this tapestry.
10553000	10556000	And she would put her hand up to the tapestry and she got possessed.
10556000	10562000	And that whole thing where her eyes would turn white and she's speaking of the three women in the tapestry through her own voice and all that.
10562000	10565000	And just the direction of that scene felt very movie-like to me.
10565000	10569000	The whole presentation of the game felt like cinema.
10569000	10571000	And that was really cool to watch.
10571000	10579000	I hope the game is as smooth for me, who might not be as good at those types of games, offhand, as it was for the person demoing it.
10579000	10587000	If so, I think there could be a really great game here for the Skyrim fans with no Fallout being announced this year either.
10587000	10590000	That could be a huge thing to fill in the gap for them.
10590000	10599000	Yeah, I was kind of surprised that they didn't have anything announced from Bethesda really, aside from their free-to-play game and then they had Doom.
10599000	10604000	But it's kind of hoping for Fallout 4.
10604000	10608000	Bethesda had a couple games that were shown off that we were able to get our hands on.
10608000	10611000	I did not get to play Battlecry, but I know Bobby did.
10611000	10615000	He was a little iffy on it because it was more of a first-person shooter.
10615000	10617000	But here's the thing about Battlecry.
10617000	10622000	It's not Team Fortress 3, but it's Team Fortress 3.
10622000	10629000	It's very heavily, it's got a lot of those types of elements in it.
10629000	10631000	Bethesda would probably frown on me saying that.
10631000	10633000	But I'm just saying, when I'm looking at it, I mean that's not a bad thing.
10633000	10636000	I love Team Fortress 2. I would love to play another game like that.
10636000	10640000	I'm kind of looking at it going, this really sounds like it's just Team Fortress 3.
10640000	10642000	But it looked really good.
10642000	10645000	But while he was playing Battlecry, I got to go play The Evil Within.
10645000	10652000	And they had that all set up with the dark room, with the headphones, and it's a scary game.
10652000	10658000	If you like your scary games, and it's another one of those games where my mother will not be happy that I'm playing it because it's very gross.
10658000	10664000	I was lighting things on fire, and you know, it was a trip.
10664000	10667000	But yeah, if you guys like your Silent Hill and Resident Evil, this game's right up your alley.
10667000	10670000	I'm also disappointed that there wasn't a new Silent Hill game.
10670000	10674000	Well, Konami's got nothing. I'm telling you, somebody's going to buy them to get those IPs.
10674000	10676000	Wait.
10678000	10680000	Anything else you want to share?
10680000	10685000	This is kind of a little funny thing. Apparently there's a brand new commercial, I actually checked it out.
10685000	10689000	A brand new commercial starring Aaron Paul from Breaking Bad.
10689000	10697000	That is turning on people's Xbox Ones, because in the commercial he is using the voice commands for the Xbox One.
10697000	10704000	And if you happen to be watching TV near your Xbox One that has the Kinect enabled on it, it is turning your system on.
10704000	10708000	And maybe possibly launching Titanfall, because that's what they do in the commercials.
10708000	10711000	It's kind of annoying people.
10711000	10715000	Yeah, I can imagine. Did you know the PlayStation has those voice commands too?
10715000	10719000	I didn't realize that until Jason was over the other day and I'm doing something on the PlayStation.
10719000	10722000	He starts fucking with me by giving those commands.
10722000	10725000	PlayStation! It comes up.
10725000	10727000	Stop it!
10727000	10729000	I don't know. I thought that was funny.
10729000	10731000	Yep.
10731000	10733000	And then...
10733000	10735000	What was it?
10735000	10742000	Mojang has released a new EULA regarding, I guess, monetization.
10742000	10752000	Basically, frowning upon private Minecraft servers that charge for in-game items or XP boosts or stuff like that.
10752000	10762000	Because you can do some plugins for Bucket and Forge and stuff where you have people donate money or something to your server and you give them perks.
10762000	10764000	That type of thing.
10764000	10766000	Well, apparently Mojang doesn't like that.
10767000	10773000	They call it free-to-play, even though it's not really free-to-play, because you can buy a copy of it.
10773000	10778000	But besides any of the updates, all that stuff is supposed to be free.
10778000	10790000	So apparently they are putting that into the EULA to prevent that, but basically frown upon it, I guess.
10791000	10797000	I definitely need to shout out some more indie games here, because I did talk about a lot of great ones around the show.
10797000	10800000	And I want to give this one a shout out, because I kind of think this one is going to be huge.
10800000	10802000	And you'll never guess where I saw this one, Loki.
10802000	10806000	In the corner of IndieCade, Ouya was there, really pushing a lot of the indie games.
10806000	10808000	And this was one of the games that was on Ouya.
10808000	10811000	So very interesting to see how they're kind of starting...
10811000	10813000	They're probably trying to think about...
10813000	10819000	They're probably getting a lot of the feedback from gamers like you who don't really see where the future is in the Ouya.
10819000	10825000	So it really seems like they're really trying to partner up with a lot of the indie developers to get things on Ouya and PC.
10825000	10828000	You know, really have an easy publishing platform.
10828000	10830000	And I've got to say, this game looked really good.
10830000	10834000	One of them that I saw, which is called Neverending Nightmares, was a game that I saw.
10834000	10838000	It's coming out Fall 2014, Windows, Macs, Linux, Ouya.
10838000	10846000	And if you guys look up this game, which you can, over NeverendingNightmares.com, the art style in this is very unique.
10846000	10848000	And it is a psychological horror game.
10848000	10851000	And it's based on the developer's struggle with mental illness.
10851000	10854000	And I actually talked to the guy who had made this game.
10854000	10858000	I'm hoping to get him on a future episode of OLR when the game is a little closer to release.
10858000	10862000	You know, it was really fascinating to talk to him and kind of hear about the game.
10862000	10869000	And kind of what caused him to make this game to help him kind of deal with what he was going through with this.
10869000	10873000	I thought that was very brave of him to basically make that,
10873000	10877000	yes, this is what the game is about. This was how I coped with mental illness.
10877000	10881000	So, I thought that was really cool. And I think this one's going to, I kind of think this one's going to blow up.
10881000	10884000	So, keep an eye on that one. Neverending Nightmares.
10884000	10886000	So, that was a very cool game.
10889000	10892000	Any other thoughts? Loki, Dark Sakura?
10892000	10896000	Let me, I'm going to go ahead and open up Skypline. 1877 Game OLR.
10896000	10898000	Or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10898000	10902000	If you want to call and talk to us about E3, I'm going to try to make it brief tonight because we are running long.
10902000	10904000	Which, you know, usually this week does.
10904000	10908000	But if you do have a comment or something you want to say about the show, we invite your phone calls.
10908000	10910000	Please let us know. 1877 Game OLR.
10910000	10912000	Or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10912000	10916000	I did have a tiny thing to mention. Not that it's E3 related, but it's a neat looking mod.
10916000	10921000	It's a mod for Skyrim called Vendain. V-E-N-D-A-Y-N.
10921000	10925000	That basically turns the landscape into pure evil.
10925000	10931000	It just looks like this near apocalypse, medieval world. It's pretty cool.
10931000	10933000	So just thought I would mention it.
10933000	10935000	Very cool. Are you going to check that out?
10935000	10938000	I might. If I get around to playing anything.
10938000	10941000	You will, you will. Alright, let's get to some calls.
10941000	10944000	We do have a call coming in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10944000	10946000	Hey, hey, it's Rama. How is everyone doing tonight?
10946000	10948000	It wouldn't be a show without you, Rama. What's up, buddy?
10948000	10954000	But of course. I kind of want to get into this whole Ubisoft thing really quick.
10954000	10958000	Because this was something a few of my friends were talking about.
10958000	10964000	Let me just say this. I apologize now if I ruffle any feathers.
10964000	10966000	It's not meant to be.
10966000	10972000	The views and opinions expressed on the show do not necessarily reflect those of VoG or OLR Studios. Sure, go ahead.
10972000	10974000	Thank you, good sir.
10974000	10980000	I believe if you sit there and you look at a game, if it has great gameplay value,
10980000	10986000	great story, graphics, replay, all of that, great storyline.
10986000	10997000	But if the main hero of the story and the game is not a minority or this race or that creed, so on and so forth,
10997000	11003000	I don't see that as a big deal. If that's how the storyline plays, that's fine.
11003000	11011000	You've got to accept that. You just can't turn off the entire game or entire franchise because of that one thing.
11011000	11016000	Now, if the people behind this game say something along the lines of,
11016000	11019000	and you know this is what they said,
11019000	11024000	yeah, we were just too cheap to add in all these extra features so you can change your character and so forth.
11024000	11028000	That's when it's wrong. That's when it's not fair.
11028000	11032000	The fact that you can spend this much time to create the character,
11032000	11039000	you mean to tell me that the French do not have an extra million francs or however the currency is
11039000	11047000	to add in the feature or add in the ability to make your hero a heroine or this or that.
11047000	11050000	They can't do that.
11050000	11055000	I think the difference here between what you start your story with,
11055000	11060000	where you have that narrative that's like reading a book or watching a movie that's about a particular character,
11060000	11064000	that you're confined to that narrative, whatever it is.
11064000	11071000	Although one could make the argument that when you see the same type of person in that narrative over and over and over again,
11071000	11077000	we might be making progress a little bit in the gaming industry, but we have a long way to go, right?
11077000	11081000	But the real issue here was because it was the multiplayer element, I think, that came into it.
11081000	11086000	It was a little interesting that you just saw the four people who all looked the same.
11086000	11091000	That was, I think, where people kind of looked at that and went, but all people don't look all the same.
11091000	11094000	So why did you do that? Why isn't there a woman up there?
11094000	11097000	And then that was the answer we got. Well, it would be too expensive.
11097000	11102000	That was what it really boiled down to.
11102000	11107000	Yeah, pretty much, because the fact of the matter is I'm not surprised that Ubisoft said this,
11107000	11113000	because then again, we did have to wait about two years for DLC for Scott Pilgrim vs. The World of the Game.
11113000	11116000	Meanwhile, they were too busy working on Assassin's Creed.
11116000	11117000	Yeah.
11118000	11121000	So, I mean, I understand where everybody's coming from.
11121000	11125000	I mean, at that point, if you want to turn your back on the series, that's fine.
11125000	11130000	But the sad part is there's so many people that are up in arms about this.
11130000	11134000	If 100 people are up in arms saying they're not going to buy the game because of this,
11134000	11138000	another 100 people are going to roll right in and just buy the game.
11138000	11142000	Well, and you know that there's people out there that say they're not going to buy it,
11142000	11145000	but they were never really intending on buying it in the first place.
11145000	11149000	Yeah, they were just saying it, you know, to throw their voice out there, to support it.
11149000	11151000	Like, yeah, I'm down with that too, I'm down with that.
11151000	11153000	Hello, game stuff? Yeah, let me get a pre-order on that, thanks.
11153000	11157000	Yeah, that all being said, though, I kind of go back to what I said earlier.
11157000	11158000	This is a dialogue.
11158000	11164000	This is one piece of a greater dialogue that's been needing to happen in the gaming industry for some time.
11164000	11169000	And I think as these younger gamer girls that Nintendo's targeted, as we talked about earlier,
11169000	11173000	are starting to grow up and get older, a lot of them are looking back going,
11173000	11174000	this is some bullshit.
11174000	11175000	Mm-hmm.
11175000	11181000	And I think this is a dialogue that's been brewing for some time,
11181000	11184000	so it's not going to end with this E3 story.
11184000	11189000	Yeah, on a side note, and I'm going to get out of here,
11189000	11194000	a friend of mine worked for a gaming company and part of her job was translating games,
11194000	11197000	and one of the companies she translated against was a French company.
11197000	11202000	And she had to go through and tell them what was acceptable and what was not acceptable.
11202000	11206000	Now, in the game, they had a giant portable stereo.
11206000	11209000	Now, we know them as boomboxes, right?
11209000	11210000	Mm-hmm.
11210000	11215000	When they translated the game for detailing the change, what was acceptable was not acceptable,
11215000	11219000	they called the boombox a ghetto blaster.
11219000	11223000	Yeah.
11223000	11227000	I heard that term in, like, the 80s.
11227000	11231000	Yeah, but nowadays you don't want to say ghetto blaster.
11231000	11233000	Things have changed, right?
11233000	11235000	So, you know, those are words, yeah.
11235000	11242000	Yeah, so it's like, I think Ubisoft and a few other countries need to kind of get on the ball
11242000	11245000	to understand that there are certain things you can't say
11245000	11249000	and there are certain things you don't say in order to get your point across
11249000	11253000	and kind of make the people happy, you know?
11253000	11257000	And with all the money that that series has made,
11257000	11262000	I don't see a big issue of dropping another million euros to them, but you know what?
11262000	11265000	Make it a complete multiplayer, complete character customization, all this, all that.
11265000	11267000	I don't see the problem.
11267000	11270000	All right, well, Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls,
11270000	11274000	but any quick other, quick, quick, quick thoughts before we let you go?
11274000	11277000	Mighty No. 9, Xbox One.
11277000	11281000	Oh, heck yeah. When's that out? Does that have a release date yet?
11281000	11286000	I don't know, but that might just be worth it for me to go down and get my Xbox One, because, yeah.
11286000	11290000	I think it's out on everything, though, like PC, and it's coming out a bunch of places.
11290000	11292000	It's not exclusive to Xbox One.
11292000	11294000	I hope not.
11294000	11296000	All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy.
11296000	11298000	All right, you too, bro.
11298000	11301000	All right, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11301000	11304000	Lots of people trying to get in tonight, so we'll try to get to them all.
11304000	11306000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
11306000	11307000	Hey, what's up, guys? This is Kai Judo.
11307000	11309000	Hey, Kai Judo. What's on your mind?
11309000	11312000	Not much. I'm just going to... Wait, let me see if I can hear you. Say something again.
11312000	11314000	Hi, Kai Judo. You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
11315000	11319000	I'm just going to put my two cents in to what the previous caller just mentioned.
11319000	11322000	I'm going to make this quick so you can get to new calls.
11322000	11324000	I like that this is happening.
11324000	11330000	This is a great time in gaming that people are finally getting their voices out there
11330000	11333000	and telling these developers what they really want.
11333000	11339000	I think the main problem is that I don't think minority...
11340000	11346000	I'm a minority as well, so I'm not saying minority like you or other people or whatever.
11346000	11352000	I think that a lot of minorities, a lot of female gamers, they just don't see a balance out there.
11352000	11354000	It's not that they want to change every game.
11354000	11361000	It's not like they want to go in there and change current games into females or black males or Puerto Ricans or whatever.
11361000	11366000	We want to see games that have diversity and we want to see a balance
11366000	11370000	because right now it's just a flood of the same old stuff that's coming through.
11370000	11373000	I think that's the main issue there and that's what really needs to be addressed.
11373000	11379000	I do want to see different types of games come out with female characters, minority characters.
11379000	11381000	It can't just be Rockstar doing all this.
11381000	11384000	We've got to have other developers involved.
11384000	11387000	I like this. I like what's going on here.
11387000	11389000	I agree. I think this is good, this conversation being had.
11389000	11391000	I want to read this comment in chat.
11391000	11393000	It's from our pal Bobby Black Wolf.
11393000	11396000	I don't know if this is a tongue-in-cheek thing or what, but let me just read what's here in chat.
11396000	11401000	Black Wolf says, James Bond needs to be a black female in the next movie.
11401000	11405000	It makes me actually feel like I shouldn't do anything in life anymore since I'm a straight white male.
11405000	11409000	If I'm doing something, I'm taking that opportunity away from a minority.
11409000	11418000	Well, to clarify, I don't think anyone's saying eliminate the straight white male or let's rid games of straight white males.
11418000	11420000	The key word is diversity.
11420000	11422000	They can show some of that spotlight.
11422000	11428000	Nobody's saying, get rid of Nathan Drake, he sucks, or replace Nathan Drake.
11428000	11433000	But I think it's a lot of people saying, but it sure is refreshing when we get a Lara Croft as well.
11433000	11439000	Right. Like I was just saying earlier, we don't want to change what's currently there.
11439000	11445000	I don't want to change Bond into a black woman or a Chinese woman or anything like that.
11445000	11448000	It's just that we want to see variety in there.
11448000	11455000	I think that the same way movies are supposed to somewhat reflect what goes on in life and society,
11455000	11457000	I think games should also reflect that.
11457000	11459000	There's a lot of diverse gamers.
11459000	11463000	I get on Xbox Live, and I'm not just talking to a straight white guy.
11463000	11467000	I'm talking to a gay African guy.
11467000	11472000	I'm talking to a lesbian Russian girl.
11472000	11474000	It's all different types of people out there playing.
11474000	11477000	I think that games really need to reflect that.
11477000	11483000	There was that statistic out there that it's like, what was the headline?
11483000	11489000	Something like, there were more beheadings in the press conferences than there were women on stage.
11489000	11494000	I know you laugh, but it's kind of one of those things.
11494000	11496000	It's a sad reality.
11496000	11500000	Again, I'm not saying eliminate the men, make it all women.
11500000	11504000	I'm just saying, I thought half of the population is women.
11504000	11505000	More than half, actually.
11505000	11508000	Why aren't we getting a little closer to half?
11508000	11518000	I believe that actually the last census, or combination of census, that women actually made up 52% of the overall population.
11518000	11522000	Guys, you're the minority.
11522000	11527000	Again, I don't wish to devalue or whatever.
11527000	11531000	The gal that's the head of 343 Studios is a great person and so forth.
11531000	11535000	It's not like they're invisible, gone, not there.
11535000	11542000	But you kind of look at it and you go, yeah, this industry does seem to go one way or another.
11542000	11543000	Correct me if I'm wrong.
11543000	11551000	Wasn't there a woman as the lead for the whole Assassin's Creed series?
11551000	11554000	Not that I'm saying a playable character, but the actual woman that's developing it,
11554000	11560000	the head of the entire team for the Assassin's Creed games, I thought was a woman at one time.
11560000	11562000	Yeah, that was the first one.
11562000	11563000	She stepped down or whatever.
11563000	11565000	The very first one, apparently.
11565000	11567000	Only the first one, I thought it was still the same.
11567000	11570000	And that's just what I wanted to mention.
11570000	11573000	Another thing that we have to address, I'm not sure if it was that woman.
11573000	11575000	I'm pretty sure it was her.
11575000	11580000	But that first E3 that she had prepared in where she was talking about Assassin's Creed,
11580000	11586000	she got so much hate from these, I mean, we got to assume that they were guy gamers,
11586000	11589000	but we really can't say for sure because they were hiding behind screen names.
11589000	11591000	But they gave her so much hate.
11591000	11596000	There was so much negative stuff thrown at her and a lot of other women that developed video games.
11596000	11600000	I can't remember when it was, but it was actually when I first started listening to all games.
11600000	11604000	I think it was Scott Rubin was doing a show and he had some guy on there
11604000	11608000	and he was the biggest douchebag prick I've ever heard.
11608000	11610000	I literally wanted to call him because he was such an asshole.
11610000	11617000	He was promoting some type of a comic that someone did where they were jizzing all over this girl.
11617000	11619000	You guys remember that?
11619000	11622000	I don't and I guess in that regard, I'm kind of glad I don't.
11622000	11624000	With all due respect to our friends over there.
11624000	11626000	It was awful.
11626000	11628000	He kind of chuckled about it and I'm like,
11628000	11632000	how can you even let us come back like this on the air?
11632000	11635000	I forgot what the full argument was.
11635000	11637000	You'd have to ask him about that.
11637000	11639000	It was awful, man.
11639000	11641000	Just to clarify from the chat room,
11641000	11647000	Jade Raymond was the developer there that did Assassin's Creed 1 and 2.
11647000	11650000	Thank you to the folks there in chat speaking up there.
11650000	11656000	Well, Kaijuto, a conversation that will be continuing in the industry for years to come, I'm sure.
11656000	11658000	Take care, my friend.
11658000	11659000	Alright, thanks.
11659000	11661000	Bye.
11661000	11664000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR.
11664000	11667000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11667000	11669000	Any other quickie three thoughts, Loki?
11669000	11670000	I'll check in with you.
11670000	11671000	No.
11671000	11672000	Alright.
11672000	11673000	Wrap this stuff up.
11673000	11677000	We'll do one other quick, quick, quick call and try to end things.
11677000	11681000	S2100 Matt asked in chat, did you guys meet up with Scott and try his ice cream?
11681000	11683000	We actually looked.
11683000	11686000	We found the truck and we went over there, but he wasn't there.
11686000	11687000	We weren't able to say hi.
11687000	11689000	I guess he was on a break or gone or something, but we tried.
11689000	11690000	We tried to go say hi.
11690000	11692000	Alright, let's go to the phones.
11692000	11693000	We do have another call coming in.
11693000	11694000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
11694000	11695000	Who's this?
11695000	11696000	Hi, this is Reginator.
11696000	11697000	Hey, Reginator.
11697000	11698000	How you doing?
11698000	11699000	I'm pretty good.
11699000	11700000	How about yourself?
11700000	11701000	Good.
11701000	11703000	I see you're trying to send video, but for whatever reason, we're not receiving, which
11703000	11707000	is a bummer, but I'm sure you look fabulous, as does your kitty.
11707000	11710000	Quickly, we don't have a lot of time left.
11710000	11712000	What's on your mind, buddy?
11712000	11723000	I know E3 is a big news topic of the week, rightfully so, but one topic that hasn't been
11723000	11737000	touched yet is the upcoming steam sale, presumably starting tomorrow at roughly 10 a.m. Pacific.
11737000	11742000	Because my wallet is crying out in pain that a steam sale could possibly be incoming, but
11742000	11744000	yeah, there are those rumors out there.
11744000	11748000	Well, it's not really rumor because steam pretty regularly has done these summer sales,
11748000	11749000	right?
11749000	11755000	Well, it was confirmed there was a foreign advertisement that had the steam sale dates
11755000	11756000	or something there.
11756000	11757000	Oh, boy.
11757000	11759000	It was like June 19th, I think.
11759000	11773000	And in fact, a badge has shown up in everyone's profiles, well, under profiles that's called
11773000	11774000	Mystery Badge.
11774000	11775000	Oh, interesting.
11775000	11778000	So, put two and two together.
11778000	11779000	It's coming.
11779000	11781000	But anyway, two part question.
11781000	11782000	Okay.
11783000	11788000	You kind of sort of answered part of the question.
11788000	11792000	A, are you and your wallet ready for the sale?
11792000	11801000	And also, is there anything that you're kind of sort of hoping would go on sale?
11801000	11806000	And if so, what is that game or games?
11806000	11807000	Good question.
11807000	11809000	I open it up to my lovely co-host as well.
11810000	11816000	Is there something that you hope goes on sale that you would like to buy?
11816000	11818000	And are you ready for a steam sale?
11818000	11820000	I have to look at my list.
11820000	11821000	I'm always ready for a steam sale.
11821000	11822000	Yeah.
11822000	11825000	I'd have to pull up my wish list, but I know there's some other indie games that are on
11825000	11826000	my list ready to go.
11826000	11827000	I just haven't picked them up yet.
11827000	11829000	I'm just kind of waiting for a sale.
11829000	11831000	Things like UnEpic and yeah.
11831000	11832000	Indie games.
11832000	11835000	I will probably load the crap up on indie games.
11835000	11838000	Those are the ones that tend to go really cheap, like two, three bucks.
11838000	11841000	I'll probably load up on some of those.
11841000	11846000	I actually found that the steam tags is a really good way to find a lot of new games.
11846000	11848000	Just to kind of throw that out there.
11848000	11850000	My wish list won't load.
11850000	11851000	Your wish list won't load?
11851000	11853000	Apparently I can't have it.
11853000	11855000	It says that I've got GamerX to save my money for.
11855000	11856000	Yeah, it was.
11856000	11861000	The dates were leaked by a banner for pay safe card.
11861000	11862000	It's a website.
11862000	11865000	I guess they have their electronic payment company or something.
11865000	11869000	It says summer sale the 19th through the 30th of June.
11869000	11870000	There we go.
11870000	11872000	I want The Cat Lady.
11872000	11873000	That's a thing.
11873000	11875000	Yeah, it's a game called The Cat Lady.
11875000	11878000	I want the Adventure Time game.
11878000	11879000	And Blockland.
11879000	11881000	And I want the BloodRayne game.
11881000	11884000	Steamworld Dig, I forgot is something I wanted.
11884000	11886000	Dark Souls, I still don't have.
11886000	11888000	So that is absolutely something I want.
11888000	11891000	And I forgot there's some Telltale things I want too.
11891000	11896000	Which, by the way, got to see a sneak peek of Tales from the Borderlands and a play through of the first few minutes.
11896000	11902000	I'm not even super into Borderlands, but that was a fun demo that they showed at the first little bit of the game there.
11902000	11905000	But Wolf Among Us, I still definitely need to check out.
11905000	11908000	And my MMO side wants The Secret World.
11908000	11910000	By the way, I have The Secret World.
11910000	11911000	Do you?
11911000	11913000	It's not bad. I bought it when it went on sale last time.
11913000	11914000	Oh, nice.
11914000	11915000	It was pretty good.
11915000	11917000	I should start playing it again.
11917000	11920000	But now the big ones on my list is The Cat Lady.
11920000	11922000	And I want the Adventure Time game.
11922000	11925000	I got, what's the other big one on my list?
11925000	11927000	Blockland, an epic.
11927000	11930000	The new BloodRayne game that's actually a side-scroller.
11930000	11932000	It looks pretty fun, actually.
11932000	11933000	Nice.
11933000	11936000	And Dream and Child of Light and Jazzpunk.
11936000	11937000	Okay.
11937000	11939000	All right. Well, Rageinator, I love the question.
11939000	11941000	I got to let you go, though. We're way past time.
11941000	11943000	I got to wrap up for the night.
11943000	11944000	But good luck.
11944000	11945000	All right, here we go.
11945000	11946000	All right, bye.
11946000	11949000	Hope you make it through a Steam sale unscathed.
11949000	11950000	I've got to wrap up, you guys.
11950000	11952000	We are running way long tonight.
11952000	11954000	But thank you very much for those that did get through.
11954000	11956000	If you did not get a chance to get through tonight,
11956000	11958000	please don't forget you can send your thoughts.
11958000	11961000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
11961000	11964000	And it's time to wrap up another very busy episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11964000	11966000	But hey, this is it.
11966000	11968000	2014 in gaming. You're looking at it.
11968000	11970000	So despite some of the little surprises here and there,
11970000	11974000	we have a lot to look forward to for the rest of the year.
11974000	11978000	Thank you guys very much for downloading our show and checking out the show.
11978000	11980000	Whether you're listening live or you're listening on the podcast feed,
11980000	11982000	thank you very much for your support.
11982000	11984000	If you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
11984000	11986000	Help us spread the word of mouth.
11986000	11989000	And then maybe someday Microsoft will answer our question
11989000	11991000	if we tell enough people about the show.
11991000	11993000	No, they won't. They're Microsoft. Trust me.
11993000	11995000	If they have a Microsoft way of doing things,
11995000	11997000	even dealing with them on the retail side,
11997000	12001000	it's just like there's a vibe you get.
12001000	12002000	It's hard to describe.
12002000	12005000	Just saying, when you stop listening to Community,
12005000	12007000	that's when you get the E3 like you did last year.
12007000	12010000	I'm just saying, here's the reality.
12010000	12013000	My question didn't get to which I'm, when I say me,
12013000	12016000	I'm speaking on behalf of independent media in general.
12016000	12018000	I know we are not the only ones fighting this battle.
12018000	12021000	But when I don't get my question answered
12021000	12024000	so that the guy from the L.A. Times can go into the presentation
12024000	12030000	and then write his headline about how Nintendo is bringing the PlayStation 4 out this year,
12030000	12034000	okay, those are the people you want to invite to talk about your games.
12034000	12037000	Okay. Just remember that headline, folks.
12037000	12040000	They hardly ever go off script.
12040000	12043000	Well, they went off script on that one.
12043000	12045000	Somebody went off script.
12045000	12047000	All right, anyway, so yes, spread the word.
12047000	12050000	Please tell a friend or two about the show or leave us a nice review.
12050000	12052000	We really appreciate reviews on iTunes.
12052000	12054000	Stitcher is a huge one too.
12054000	12056000	We've gotten a lot of support from Stitcher.
12056000	12058000	I want to thank folks who listen to us over there.
12058000	12061000	And yeah, we've been pretty consistently top 25 show in gaming.
12061000	12063000	It's really awesome.
12063000	12065000	We're not telling you what to do.
12065000	12067000	We would never, but we would really appreciate it.
12067000	12068000	Yes.
12068000	12069000	All right.
12069000	12070000	That's it. We're going to wrap up.
12070000	12072000	Let's go around to everybody's final thoughts for the night.
12072000	12073000	Loki, you're ready to get out of here.
12073000	12074000	Sorry for holding you late.
12074000	12075000	No, no big deal.
12075000	12078000	My final thought is I fixed my problem that was in my game.
12078000	12080000	I fixed the bug.
12080000	12082000	That works, I think.
12082000	12084000	It works in the editor.
12084000	12085000	I'm just worried.
12085000	12087000	I think I can implement it in the regular game.
12087000	12089000	Well, good luck to you.
12089000	12092000	My final thought tonight is it's time to go get about five more trophies
12092000	12095000	and entwined because that thing is a trophy pinata.
12095000	12097000	And a pretty decent game.
12097000	12099000	I'll tell you more thoughts on it next week.
12099000	12101000	Last but not least, Dark Sakura.
12101000	12102000	I think I'm going to go home and go to bed.
12102000	12103000	I'm tired.
12103000	12104000	Sleep is good.
12104000	12110000	But for those listening live, I did a little treat for the old school.
12110000	12113000	Just for the live folks, huh?
12113000	12117000	For those that are listening on podcast, you got to be here live sometime.
12117000	12118000	All right.
12118000	12119000	Thank you guys very much for being here tonight.
12119000	12124000	Next week, episode 557 with hopefully, fingers crossed, holding my breath,
12124000	12126000	Marvel Heroes next week.
12126000	12128000	And of course, the latest and greatest, the E3 Fallout
12128000	12131000	and whatever else comes up in gaming news next week.
12131000	12132000	We'll do it all over again.
