The next year of gaming and electronic entertainment is about to be revealed as we are less than 24 hours from the keynotes by all our favorite gaming companies.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All about impending AAA titles, new accessories, and future Steam sale fodder.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All this, listless, and more coming up on the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with our 555th episode.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's right, episode 555.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
For this June the 8th of 2014 on the eve of Video Game Christmas, as a lot of people refer to it.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's right, the Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 kicks off.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Technically the expo starts Tuesday, but all the conferences and some of the early meetings are starting tomorrow.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Microsoft kicking things off at 9am, but we're kicking off E3 in our own way tonight.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My name is Rob Robertson, joining me in the studio as always.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hi.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How are you Jamie Summers?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm okay.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's new with you? Anything new and exciting in the world of Jamie?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
She's been working a lot at the, I always want to say Lolcat, but it's LoCat.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll tell you why I didn't go with Lolcat.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because Lolcat already exists in Homestuck, it's the land of little cups and tea.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I work at the land, hey.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Jason in a mic or we can't hear it.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah, the Homestucks get it anyways, so that's why I went with LoCat, the land of cubes and tech.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That works, that works. It's a good way to kind of, you know, have the anonymity so people don't necessarily know your employer and all that good stuff.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Except that now I know more people, more and more people that work there, and apparently people I work with know friends of mine.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Like one of my co-workers games with Becky's husband.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's random.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And another of my co-workers who I play D&D with knows Travis.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, I was going to say I have co-workers that know people that I used to do Rocky Horror with back at the Birdcage, so that's always something.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He knows Travis from a cast before the one that you were in.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, that's old school.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Isn't that right?

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, that's old school.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Wasn't that like the one right before Understandation?

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It was, yep. Absent Friends, 95 or so in Sacramento.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So yeah. And I was just like going, the moment he mentions names, because he mentioned names of people I don't know all the time, he's like, I know him.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You do? Yeah?

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So lots and lots of networking, IRL, and of course at the E3 Expo this week, lots of networking there.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We are going to miss you, Dark Soccer. I understand that, you know, work takes precedence because you did just start that job not that long ago, so you can't exactly take a week off.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But you'll be missed.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, you know, I'm actually kind of glad I'm not going.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah, why's that? Just?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Just because with as busy as I've been and a little tired and on edge, it means I don't have to be around massive groups of people and double my medication.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, I actually can understand that because I was talking about this at the end of Bobby's show, but I've been just really exhausted too, and I know some people see E3 as a vacation.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't get me wrong, I'm very fortunate to go, I'm very happy to go, I realize I'm lucky a lot of people would give a lot to be able to go to the show.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But it's just one of those things where I'm like, it's not just like, teehee, fun, cosplay, play games, all that, it's some serious, like, you know, you gotta run from place to place, you do these meetings, you have all these kind of serious things going on.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It is work. It's fun work. I know, I managed to cute my way into tons of the press kits we weren't supposed to have the few years I did.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, you were so good at that.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And then hanging out with my buddy Krista, who worked for LucasArts at the time, and going into the Q&As with her, because she was like, oh, she's with me. Bye, bye.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's the shit, that's how I got to play Popula Cross at first. And they were like, you know what the hell this game is? I was like, yeah, and thanks to Loki here, I now have the game and have to play through it.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There you go.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But I don't know, as long as one of us, or a few of us are going, I don't feel bad about not going. Honestly, it's a little too much for me.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's a good way to look at it. Are you gonna try and play the at-home game?

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, I'm actually not.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're just gonna kinda come absorb everything next week at the show, or bits and pieces here and there?

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I may watch a thing here and there, but my plan for the week is work.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I have a hard time believing if they pop out a new Mass Effect trailer, you won't be doing 90 miles an hour on the way home to go watch it.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:46,000
At that point I say, bitch, please. This is me we're talking about. I mean, of course I'm gonna see stuff I'm gonna get excited about, but honestly, I've decided that the week is actually gonna be spent on myself.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Because with my new schedule, I'm working in closing shift, so I work 1130 to 830 now, that means I can actually get up in the morning and go back to the gym instead of doing it after work when I'm dead tired.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You know, that's what I did last year. I did kinda the home game, and I'm using my quote-y fingers, covered E3 from home, but that just basically means I supported Bobby and all that with what he was doing.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I did end up driving down there later in the week, and we did the Disney 3 thing, but earlier in the week, you know, I just kinda hung out and it was a great kinda charge the batteries, so I think you'll have a good week.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, bye.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You get all the good stuff on next week's show.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But hey, you got to play an Ouya.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Alright, Techmaster Loki always has something to say. I did get to play Ouya last year when I-

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes, because it is disappointing as owning an Ouya.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I didn't walk away from the Ouya experience last year with the heap amount of negativity that you have for it now. Granted, it wasn't out yet. I was seeing demos of some games that were probably the better games that were on the system.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, and also to be fair, there are a lot of games now I think are more polished than they were when I had it, but no.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, and there's still stuff that they're cranking out as well, so you know, they're still trucking along, doing their thing, and it's still a very low-cost alternative to get some of this other stuff, so it'll be interesting.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But yeah, the experience last year was kinda funny in that regard that I actually picked Bobby up at the Expo, because you can- I don't know if they like people knowing this, but you can go in the- like, the LA Convention Center is practically a public place.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You can walk in, it's very easy, you just can't get past the line to go to the hall. You can't actually get in the hall, but you can look through the window and see everything that's going on, do all that, and there's some stuff that's on the outside, like the Ouya was in the parking lot last year.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Not that I'm saying you should all go down to the Convention Center and make it more crowded than it already is, but the fact of the matter is, it is in the heart of downtown LA. It's next door to the Staples Center. There's a lot of activity down there.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm gonna finish all these puzzles this week, and that's one of the most exciting things about E3, honestly, is finishing these fucking puzzles on my DS, because a new one pops up every other day, it feels like. So, I'm excited.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm gonna be totally watching everything. I've been watching everything.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:04,000
All right, I'm going to our chat room before I introduce our fourth in-studio co-host tonight. I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because of course we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern is the time to be here. And, let's see, I'm looking at Brad from Pod Culture, starting us off, saying, Ouya isn't that bad, they just had bad timing.

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It is actually a neat little bit of kit. And then, let's see, Dungeon Buster says, All the Mass Effects in our chat room. I'm sure there's a lot of people hyped for that.

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If there is a new Mass Effect trailer, Dark Soccer, it's gonna hit tomorrow. You could possibly be 24 hours less than away from Garrus on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, possibly.

84
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If they hear it while I'm at work, I'm just gonna have to watch it during my break.

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're gonna have to take a personal, like, I have severe diarrhea, I need to go to the restroom right now.

86
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Why are you going to the bathroom with your headphones? Because I'm going to be shitting loudly. I don't want to hear it.

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sorry, I was-

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm gonna bring a change of underwear with me to work.

89
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I was watching an episode of Orange is the New Black last night, maybe- alright, anyway, I'm just- anyway, I'm not gonna go there.

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Alright, say hello. He was watching this with me last night. Say hello to VX JasonXV.

91
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm melting! I'm melting! God, it's fucking hot up here.

92
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It is hot. Welcome to Satan's Butthole, California.

93
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And it's funny, because it wasn't terribly different, you know, I was here just a week ago, and things haven't changed that dramatically.

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And I grew up in the desert, and God, the Bay Area has spoiled me. And I don't even live there. What the hell is this?

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, here's the good news. I checked the weather for LA next week. 70s and 80s.

96
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Nice. I'm very happy to hear that.

97
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Especially if we're doing the Disney thing later in the week and being outdoors all day, it's very nice news to hear.

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because Disney in 100 degrees, not as fun. So, very good to hear it.

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
In fact, I believe if I caught this correctly, this is not your first E3.

100
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It is not my first E3. This is my second in a decade exactly.

101
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Your last one, we were at together for DDR Freak.

102
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
2004, absolutely.

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That was also my first E3, and I remember we went to the Dear Friends concert together. That was one of the first times you and I ever hung out.

104
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That was the year of the thumping floor.

105
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That was the year of the thumping floor.

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Thumping floor.

107
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We went to some presentation, and it was on this big diagonal, and people were sitting on the floor, and they put subwoofers on the floor.

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sure that made for the interesting experience for the attendees.

109
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So, a decade later, I'm going to tell you, the show's changed a lot. An awful lot.

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No more Kensha Hall, rest in peace. Which is really sad.

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You'll be able to see down there, and it's a bunch of parked cars. You're like, what the hell?

112
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Of course, I don't know if the layout of the convention center's changed at all because of the construction for the farmer's field football.

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It doesn't seem like it based on the booth maps and things I'm seeing Bobby's posted on VOG Network under our interactive coverage, E3.vognetwork.com, which I'll come back to later.

114
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But you can actually see the booth maps, and it doesn't look like it's changed, so I guess they didn't really start that construction yet.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I remember watching E3 coverage, people that were livecasting throughout the whole week, and when I was there in 2004, everything was very open, like booths.

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There wasn't really these dividing lines. There were decorated walls and everything that was being showed off.

117
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The biggest walls that I can think of are either supporting beams or squares ramp up to their back wall in their inner enclave showing off Final Fantasy XI.

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Ah yes, the theater.

119
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, that's exactly what it was. But then when I watched it a year or two ago, everybody had these big enclosing, draping curtains everywhere, which seems to be really terrible to accommodate that many masses of people.

120
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But we'll see.

121
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We'll see. We'll see. Also, very important question that's going to be burning on everybody's mind. It's your first trip to Disneyland, if I'm not mistaken, right?

122
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It is not.

123
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, I thought it was.

124
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It is my first as an adult or anything close to it.

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay.

126
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I haven't been to Disneyland since I was seven or something.

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay, your first time truly at Disneyland as an adult, so what are you looking for? I know you're not a coaster guy, but what are you truly looking forward to most at Disneyland?

128
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I actually am looking forward to going back on Star Wars The Experience.

129
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There you go.

130
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because that was a... I've never been a rollercoaster guy. I cried the first time I went on it because the motion and the experience just overwhelmed me.

131
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's very different.

132
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, they redid it two years ago.

133
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's completely different.

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Is it still shuttles and mass rows sitting?

135
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes, but it's still...

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
High definition, 3D.

137
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Sure, sure. And I'm looking forward to that, but it'll just be funny to be in that line, look and see those little triggers that I'll be able to remember.

138
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Sing Star Trek while you're in line for me.

139
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Are you going to cry again? Do I have to hold your hand or something?

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Maybe in happiness and not in sensory overwhelming fear.

141
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Alright, sounds good.

142
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sure... I haven't thought about Disneyland for a long time because I've never made plans to go there.

143
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know if Zen still listens to the show, but Zen is a buddy of ours that is sometimes at the Star Wars gift shop at Disneyland.

144
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So Zen, if you happen to be working Friday, have some tissues ready for me, please. As a personal favor, I would really appreciate that.

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It'll be really interesting. I've been on a whole recollection kick for the last year or two.

146
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And it'll be fun to just kind of be around and see what I personally specifically remember from being there before.

147
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But it'll be fun. I'll be around great people. I assume a lot of other E3 attendees will be there as well, so fun networking potentials to be made there.

148
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And yeah, this is going to be an insane week for many, many reasons, but I am completely looking forward to it.

149
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Alright, sounds good. Alright, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Actually, I do have a few things I want to mention from the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Vidpower talking about the Movie Theater Sony Conference experience.

152
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Vidpower says they sold out of tickets here eight hours after the announcement.

153
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't think any of us are doing that.

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No, they sold out of everywhere, but I think a lot of people started buying... or not buying, ordering tickets to get a certain beta code.

155
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, I think that's what's going to be giving away there? The PlayStation Now or whatever?

156
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's for Battlefield Hardline.

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, okay.

158
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Apparently. The rumor is for PlayStation 4, the beta for that.

159
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Interesting, interesting. So, well, Jason and I are fortunate enough, we're going to the Sony Conference, the real deal in LA.

160
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But yeah, I'm curious. Those of you guys that go to the movie theaters, I really want to hear kind of what that is, because that's a really new thing.

161
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And to get all these common Sony fans in one place to watch it is a really fascinating idea, so I'm really curious to hear how that goes.

162
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I want some Vidpower, I don't know if you're going, but anybody who is going, I definitely want to hear your thoughts on that for next week's show.

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Let's see. I read this name as Village Idiot is Matt, and I was like, oh, that's kind of a rude thing to say to Loki, but it's actually Village Idiot's Matt.

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Which I'm guessing is another Matt. It says, is it true that the Ouya controller sucks? One of the only things keeping me from trying it out.

165
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes, it's not good.

166
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Is it better now, though, than when you had it?

167
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No, because they did have another controller that was a redesign, and I ended up getting a replacement because mine was broken.

168
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It had a really terrible dead zone in it. The new one worked, it wasn't that great, though.

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I think they have yet another one, but the thing is, you don't give a shit because you can sync your DualShock 3s to them, and most games support them.

170
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
In fact, I think most games support them because the original controllers suck, and you can even use an Xbox 360 controller hooked up via USB and stuff.

171
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There was a lot of options, but I only played with the DualShock.

172
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I didn't think the Ouya controller was that terrible, but it is certainly no DualShock, I'll say that for sure.

173
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Alright, let's get into kickoff topics. We've got a couple things tonight.

174
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I want to talk E3, but I want to talk about one of the big, big stories that's going around right now.

175
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm sure a lot of you guys have caught wind of the rumor, rumor has it, that's been going around.

176
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
IGN ran a report last night that says, The Last Guardian has been cancelled.

177
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That they had, on good authority, I think their Russian side or whatever, had something that said that The Last Guardian was cancelled.

178
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Well, one of the producers over at Sony said, we had a good laugh about that story this morning.

179
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So, then they had to go back and modify the headline to say, The Last Guardian may be cancelled.

180
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And now it's coming out like, conflicting reports that The Last Guardian is cancelled.

181
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And this caused one of my good friends, Captain Spike from Game Buoy, to say on my Facebook, the old classic line,

182
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
you can't spell ignorant without IGN. Which, you know, not to dog pile on IGN, but it's always fun to kind of poke fun.

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Obviously, they ran on some information they thought was legit and Sony's coming out and flat out denying it.

184
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What do you guys think is going on? What do you guys think is the status of The Last Guardian?

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Which, may I remind you, was first talked about in 2007. It's the new Duke Nukem Forever.

186
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Hopefully, it'll end up a better game if it's not cancelled.

187
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I think it's IGN being full of shit.

188
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

189
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I really, honestly, whenever I see anything like that, I wait until I get an official word.

190
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If I remember correctly, it was, I think, because I didn't even read the article, I think I glanced at something on NeoGaf or something,

191
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but I thought it was due to a mistranslation or something, or they took something one way and then took it another way.

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Honestly, here's what it comes down to.

193
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
They ran it because of page hits.

194
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So, now they had a good chance, and it seemed like it's something that makes sense to run that,

195
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and if they could be first with the story, then they get lots of page hits, and it just happened that it ended up not being true.

196
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Nonetheless, they still got tons of page hits. People were talking about it, and most people forget about this mistake in a few weeks.

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So, it's just page hits.

198
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Alright. Anyway, just a note, we're still recording right now for the podcast, but wouldn't you know it, our live feed just went down,

199
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
so right now our live listeners can't hear us.

200
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
E3 has taken another service down.

201
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh my gosh.

202
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The rush is too much.

203
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's very frustrating, very frustrating, especially on a big show such as tonight,

204
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
which is, you know, the weird thing about an E3 prediction show for a show like us who tapes on Sunday night,

205
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
literally we're going to have like three quarters of the answers tomorrow.

206
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I mean, and Tuesday is when the rest of it with Nintendo and, you know, the show floor opening up.

207
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So, to do the predictions now is like really for the live audience.

208
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I realize there's two distinct groups that listen to our show, right?

209
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There's the live folks, and then there's the folks that listen to the podcast, most of them Monday morning.

210
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So, you know, hi to you guys that listen on the podcast feed, but I bet some of this is going to be hilarious to listen to in retrospect,

211
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
because for all we know, Sony rolls out that last Guardian Trail tomorrow, and, you know, all of this is for naught.

212
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hey, we weren't the ones that said it was canceled.

213
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's true. We were not the ones that said it was canceled, so.

214
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And this is when I sit back in judgment.

215
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If this show comes last after the day's coverage, then answers, answers, answers, answers, answers, predictions.

216
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, at least we can gauge ourselves.

217
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I think it does put Sony in an interesting pickle where they kind of need to say something on it.

218
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
They need to give an update on the game.

219
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't think that'll necessarily happen at the press conference.

220
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I mean, well, maybe it was always planned. We don't know.

221
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can bet that the script for tomorrow's press conference is iron tight.

222
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
They are not going to change it, with the exception of if they may have some counter moves planned for Microsoft.

223
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Like there could be like a script A, script B, script C kind of thing.

224
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
We have cracked down three.

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Well, who knows? Anything is possible depending on what Microsoft does.

226
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They throw the first pitch, so, you know, Sony gets to respond to that in the position they're in.

227
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But you can bet that thing is scripted.

228
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
They're not going to just suddenly say, oh, now we have to talk about The Last Guardian because IGN's got a big mouth.

229
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But I do kind of think it puts them in a position where they're going to have to say something.

230
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If it's not part of their planned press conference, then they're going to have to put out a press release or something that says the status or drop a quote to GameSpot, the biggest competitor for IGN or something.

231
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Pull a Nintendo, show the logo on the screen, say, coming 2015.

232
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Well, Sony's also in a unique position where they have that app, too, that they're doing on the PlayStation 4.

233
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So they could always drop something into that, too, if they wanted to. I don't know.

234
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You know, again, there's a lot of questions about this game, so I think many of us would like an update. So, we'll see.

235
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Anyhow, speaking of wanting an update, let's talk about the other half of the kickoff topic I wanted to do tonight.

236
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And that is your own personal thing you want to get out of this year's E3. Like, what's the one thing you're, like, really curious?

237
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm not talking prediction because that'll be later, but I'm talking, like, what are you genuinely curious about?

238
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What is the thing you want to see more information about at the show?

239
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll start with Jamie because I have a pretty good guess what she might say, but sometimes she surprises me.

240
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Well, apart from Mass Effect stuff.

241
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Okay, that was my guess.

242
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I actually want to know if any of the previous characters played in Dragon Age or Dragon Age 2 will have any real bearing or appearance in Dragon Age Inquisition.

243
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Gotcha. So, Dragon Age Inquisition isn't that far out from release, so you want, like, those final details. Like, who am I going to be able to play? Who am I not? What's going on?

244
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Also, I'm super happy about it, though.

245
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What?

246
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Like, Vivienne looks amazing. Some of the characters just look really nice. I'm trying to be hopeful about it and hope that they don't pull, you know, what they did with Mass Effect 3.

247
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Different script writers! It's done! It's over! No.

248
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's see. Going to our chat room because the live listeners did come back, thank heavens, over at live.vognetwork.com.

249
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
WhatupG says, Kevin Butler comes on stage. Last Guardian this.

250
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know if Kevin, I think the Kevin Butler thing's kind of dead. I don't know. I don't know.

251
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Loki, what about the thing you most personally want to see at E3 this year?

252
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I just want to see a reason to buy any of these new systems, to be honest. I mean, because, I don't know. I just, I want to see new stuff. I want to see, like, the stuff that hasn't been announced yet.

253
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't give a shit about fucking Fable Anniversary or Halo Anniversary. I want to see some new shit. That's what I want to see.

254
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So it's games specifically, not peripherals. It's like, where are the freaking games?

255
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't even know if there would be anything peripheral-wise that I'd be even interested in. I mean, I don't know. I guess Project Morpheus might be neat to see if they had any information like when that's actually coming out or something.

256
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But I don't think that they're going to have any of that so early. Honestly, I'd be interested to see a little bit more on Sunset Overdrive. Anything from Sony because I don't even know what the hell they have coming out for the rest of the year. Nothing new, at least.

257
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And then Nintendo. Shit, give me a fucking reason to buy the Wii U. I mean, because Mario Kart's cool, but I need something. I'm not going to invest $300 to play one game.

258
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Or, I guess, two because you get a free game. But I'm not going to invest $300 to buy a handful of games.

259
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Funny enough, though, a lot of people did.

260
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's cool, but see, I did that with the Wii, and the Wii has collected dust for several years now, so I'm just not going to do that. I need a reason. Because eventually, Mario Kart will get burnt out, and then it's going to be like, okay, what now?

261
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So, I just need to see why I need one of these consoles. I mean, I want a new console. It'd be kind of cool to have one, but I need a game that I'm really excited about.

262
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Like, it would be totally awesome to see a new Saints Row game. I would be down with that. As long as they just don't go fucking crazy. I would just reboot the shit. I mean, seriously, it's beyond ridiculous right now.

263
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I hope they go back, they tone it down a bit. It'd be nice.

264
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Now, some of you guys out there might be kind of a little surprised that Loki doesn't own a new console, but there's plenty of people that haven't made that plunge yet. Plenty of plenty of people.

265
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
In fact, I'm looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, and SHA100Matt says,

266
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Actually, this E3, more than last year's, will weigh a lot more in my decision making in buying a console. And Dungeon Buster says, I'm still not buying a system yet either.

267
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Three of the four of us in this room right now have not taken the plunge yet.

268
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, I thought Dark Soccer, you guys had a PS4 at home. I guess I'm home.

269
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
No.

270
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, why did I think that?

271
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Dan just spent $500 on a new driving rig.

272
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
No, then I'm the big consumer whore in the room.

273
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And how?

274
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But I don't have a one.

275
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Shocking.

276
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And to address Bobby, Saints Row 4 is so successful they need to go back and boot it when it wasn't selling that well.

277
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Do remember that there is quite a bit of difference in time from the game that came out last year versus the original game that came out in 2006.

278
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Quite a few more people have bought the consoles since then.

279
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I think they could also do it. The very first game that came out was a little more serious. I was trying to be a competitor.

280
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Saints Row 2. Saints Row 2 had a perfect balance between crazy and kind of toned down, and the story was fantastic.

281
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And you know what? Just building off of that and just going a little bit crazy like they did with Saints Row 3, I think that was fine.

282
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's just when you get to, like, they're fucking in space in, like, you know, the Matrix and shit.

283
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's not even fucking original. It's so ripped off of everything, and it doesn't make any sense anymore.

284
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That's the thing. It's cool that they have a superhero game now, but it doesn't make any fucking sense.

285
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And yeah, okay, that might be the point, but it's just, it's not Saints Row anymore. It's another fucking game that they have the Saints Row title on.

286
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's fucking Lords of Shadows, okay? That's what it is.

287
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
S2100mattinchat says, Loki has a new console. It's called a baby.

288
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I already had a baby.

289
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Does it have a power switch? Alright. I'll talk about mine.

290
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The thing I am most curious about at this year's E3, I want to see if Nintendo makes a Hail Mary play.

291
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:07,000
That is, you know, and I realize they may not. I realize we may know most everything that's happening with Nintendo between Smash Brothers and Bayonetta.

292
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Like, we have a pretty good idea what their holiday lineup looks like.

293
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But, you know, out there in the media, the Wii U has been getting dogpiled a little bit.

294
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yes, there is a little sparkle, a little glimmer of hope with what's going on with Mario Kart 8.

295
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But whatever Nintendo's plan is for this E3 was thought up long before the sales figures for games that came out just last week came in.

296
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So, I'm very curious to see what Nintendo's Hail Mary plan will be, if there is one.

297
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I mean, I fully realize it may be par for the course, but there's that part of me that goes,

298
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
okay, for all the crap we've given Nintendo over the years about they don't get online, they don't get online, Mario Kart 8, it didn't go down.

299
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The YouTube thing actually works out pretty well. It's become a meme.

300
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It's so, the level of detail in the game is so well done, it's down to that level.

301
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You kind of go, could there be more of this coming from Nintendo that we just don't know about yet?

302
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And could it really make us go, wow, like, I never thought Nintendo was going to do that and they finally freaking did it.

303
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Like, I'm talking like, if they came out and said Pokemon MMO and just put it all out on the table.

304
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You know, that's the type of like Hail Mary thing I'm talking about, where it's like they finally do something we never thought they would do.

305
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And it's in a fit of desperation, in a sense, to win back the public.

306
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Because Nintendo, I mean, I have a lot of friends, especially, that will loyally support Nintendo through a lot and will defend Nintendo through a lot.

307
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You know, Nintendo is a very big brand that a lot of people really kind of, you know, tie to and connect with.

308
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And I think they're always going to have that little group, but I'm really curious, what are they going to do to really push the envelope and open it up to everybody?

309
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Will they finally make the Pokemon console game that they've always refused to make?

310
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm not talking stadium, I'm not talking, I'm talking like the RPG adventure or the MMO.

311
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm talking, are they going to do, are they going to do a Metroid that looks like a freaking Halo game?

312
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That's online and, you know, shoot them up, player thing, because, I don't know, they think that's what people want.

313
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I really want to see, like, what is that thing where Nintendo really breaks the mold we've all come to expect from them.

314
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So, we'll see. That's what I'm looking forward to see, but we'll see.

315
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And vidpower in our chatroom kind of backs that up. Good guy Nintendo, free servers, didn't go down when Mario Kart 8 came out.

316
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So, but, to be fair, it's one game. It's one game. Alright, you cracked the seal.

317
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Now let's, you know, let's see the waterfall of games that you're going to have next.

318
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Alright, Jason, how about you? Lastly, you. What is the thing you personally want to see more of at E3?

319
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
E3 is at a really, really strange time in, like, the course of video game development right now.

320
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And I say that because Nintendo has been around since, the Wii U has been around since 2012 and everything else since the end of 2013.

321
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:04,000
The point I was going to make was that I'm looking forward to seeing games that are going to have that not release window polish on them.

322
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And I think that's still going to hold true, but I think that they're not nearly developed far enough yet that it will be as meaningful as I want it to be.

323
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But that's really what I'm looking forward to this year is just that, like, this year to me is going to be future outlook.

324
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Like, maybe holiday season, but probably getting us to next E3 when everything new is actually going to be on the show floor.

325
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You know, there's a lot of talk about all these games that are being delayed to 2015.

326
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There's so many of them, we don't even have them all in our show world tonight. In fact, one I know that's not on the show world, it was big news.

327
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The next Batman game pushed to 2015, which is huge news, right?

328
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, I kind of knew about that a few weeks ago.

329
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Why didn't you say something?

330
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Well, because it's financial year 2015, and I thought that was sometime in October.

331
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh, okay, gotcha.

332
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I didn't realize it was actually next year. If I had known when their fiscal started, I would have been able to drop that bombshell a few weeks ago.

333
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, it's just... I don't know. I'm not surprised, because that's a pretty ambitious game. Sorry.

334
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Go ahead.

335
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I was just going to say, so Jason, what I think I'm hearing from you is that you want to see even beyond all these games getting pushed back to 2015.

336
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You're like, what is the life vision for these consoles? What does the life expect to see? Is that kind of what I'm hearing?

337
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
To an extent.

338
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Like, you want to see the five year plan.

339
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's more than just consoles, too, because it's also things like the new Unreal Engine that just came out a couple of months ago.

340
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
There are an Oculus continuing its theme, Project Morpheus, coming up and actually doing something.

341
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like, right now, all of these technologies that have hit in the last six months or so, they are a thing now.

342
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So we're going to get a tiny, tiny little glimpse about what that's going to mean for gaming.

343
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Probably not in the next year, because this shit takes forever to develop, but it's going to be the seeds, the inklings for the next one or two years.

344
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You should go to the Game Developers Conference next year. I think you might get more there, but...

345
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Don't need to spend more time in the Bay Area, but I probably will.

346
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I understand.

347
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah, there are coworkers. Me and a couple of coworkers are trying to drum up support and we're trying to make a bigger deal about gaming within our company and going to these kinds of events.

348
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Co-workers of mine have been at GDC, and if timing works out, I would absolutely love to do that.

349
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah, as I've said on the show, I'm not exactly a full-time gamer, I'm also not a developer, but I'm kind of gravitating towards engine production development and interest in that thing on a technical level.

350
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And so, my answer falls right in line with that.

351
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Now, next week's kickoff topic, I'm going to actually give you seven days notice on the kickoff topic. Next week's kickoff topic will be, were you satisfied with what you saw?

352
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So I'm going to follow up and see if Dark Soccer got the Dragon Age and Mass Effect info she wanted. I'm going to see if Loki found a reason to buy a console.

353
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
No, my answer is no.

354
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You don't know yet. Sit down.

355
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I do know, because here is the fucking Nintendo E3, whatever you want, live from the treehouse, because it's like a fucking kid's meal at Burger King or something.

356
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's going to be too much fucking 3DS, not enough Wii U, and it's just going to be yay. That's about it.

357
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
If it's a treehouse, does that mean there's going to be a new Donkey Kong Country?

358
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
No, I don't know what the fuck the treehouse is supposed to be, but that's what they call their fucking event.

359
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But that's what it's going to be. It's mostly 3DS, because that's where the money is right now.

360
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I hope Iwata didn't go to E3, because he's coming over to kick your ass.

361
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Bring it on. That guy can't be that tall. I'm sure I can take him.

362
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, anyways, last bit. You know what I'd love to see? I know this is such a long shot. I think Half-Life 3 being revealed would be more likely.

363
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'd love to see a new console DDR.

364
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah, that'd be nice.

365
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That's just never going to happen.

366
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That'd be nice.

367
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Alright, Jason, I know you're not going to be, or will you be here for the next show? Are you back to Colorado?

368
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I haven't decided. I think, you know, we're driving back on Saturday. I think I should get home, which means driving all day Sunday and most of Monday.

369
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Gotcha.

370
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But I haven't actually decided yet, so perhaps see you folks next week.

371
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Perhaps. We'll Skype you if nothing else, just to figure out if you got to see your long-term vision or whatever, and I'll let you know if Nintendo...

372
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I think mine will probably be pretty easy, because I think you're all going to be feeling it if I feel it.

373
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So, anyway, I want to do housekeeping first, and then do our gaming week, which I know is a little out of order, but I'm going to use housekeeping, of course, to promote what we're working on at VoG Network.

374
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
E3.vognetwork.com. It is our live, interactive coverage at the Voice of the Geeks network of the E3 Expo.

375
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Myself, Bobby, Jason will be like half us and half his day job, so two and a half times the coverage we had last year when it was just one person.

376
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What happens is that we are the second place to go for all the information.

377
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Look, we're not delusional. We know y'all go to Twitch or IGN or GameSpot, whatever, one of those sites, to go figure out what's breaking at E3 and see everything for the first time and see all those press releases turned into articles and all that stuff.

378
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That's great. Go to those sites. Absorb the information. Get everything you can on the games.

379
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But then, when you're kind of sick of reading the same thing over and over and over again, and you've got this burning question that isn't being answered anywhere else, come on over to E3.vognetwork.com and ask it.

380
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,000
We are your voice out there on the show floor. We can't guarantee everybody's going to talk. We can't guarantee everybody's going to answer your question. We're not going to get the runaround, but we're going to try.

381
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And usually we found, I'm just kind of warning you guys from years past, the bigger the developer, the less willing they are to go off script.

382
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So if you want Square Enix to talk about Final Fantasy XV when they flat out said it's not the show this year, you can try, but the answer's probably going to be Fat Chance.

383
00:33:45,000 --> 00:34:02,000
However, some of these other developers that are pretty open and want to talk to their people, like I'm sure the folks, if there is a Saints Row 5 or a Saints Row reboot of that type of thing announced, I'm sure they'll be more than happy to talk about those games and answer those types of questions.

384
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Still buy it, whatever it is.

385
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Of course you will. You know you will.

386
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I know.

387
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You know, the folks that make The Witcher are pretty good. Those games that aren't necessarily the AAA titles, but are kind of like just below that are usually pretty good about talking up their stuff at E3.

388
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So ask away, we'll try, if nothing else. Funny enough, and I just said that, but probably the biggest break we got last year was we got a Disney scoop.

389
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Thanks to the interactive coverage, you know, they announced Disney Infinity last year and they talked about all these figurines and somebody went under our site and said, you know, I've seen all this talk about the figurines.

390
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Nobody said about how much are they going to cost.

391
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So Rob and Bobby, I want you to find, well actually it was just Bobby last year, Bobby find out how much those figurines are.

392
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And he did.

393
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Wasn't my main question.

394
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It might have been, was it your question? I don't know, somebody.

395
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
No, my answer.

396
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
No. Bobby got word on the show floor, you confirmed it, basically.

397
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I already know how much they are.

398
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Anyway, so yeah, that's the kind of good stuff that's going to come out of the coverage. E3.vognetwork.com. Check it out.

399
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Alright, and that's all I have for Housekeeping. We will be back here next Sunday. There will be sadly no special shows during the show.

400
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
What we're going to try to do is use that time to book interviews for future episodes.

401
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I may try to record some stuff there to play during future shows, but that's that.

402
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
We are looking at having a live interview on the show on the 22nd, actually.

403
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But I will talk more about that next week because I don't have everything signed and dotted and all that.

404
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And I don't want to promote something I don't know for sure.

405
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So something, I'll tell you this, it's kind of a neat game that a lot of people are talking about right now.

406
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So we'll hopefully have more info for you next week on that.

407
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Alright, meantime, let's go into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.

408
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We'll go through this pretty quick.

409
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Dark Sakura.

410
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So far just Animal Crossing, although I did actually manage to get a little bit of time this afternoon to play through some Final Fantasy XIV and just hit the level I've been trying to get.

411
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So now I get to do like five quests and then grind for another two levels until I can get the next bit of my story quest.

412
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So no one will still do that dungeon with me. The D-whatever, DD.

413
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm just never on when you are.

414
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I never remember the name.

415
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Dazmiel, Darkhold, whatever.

416
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah, whatever it's called.

417
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That's an interesting one.

418
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
If I wasn't gone all next week, I'd help you.

419
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's okay.

420
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You'll get it.

421
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, so I've really had a very minimalist week.

422
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Alright.

423
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

424
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I only played Goat Simulator version 1.1.

425
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I only played a little bit of it because they have a lot of stuff that they added.

426
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
They added a whole new section of the maps.

427
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,000
If you go into the tunnel now, it'll allow you to travel to some coastal town thing that they made.

428
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's got all sorts of crazy stuff.

429
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It has its own theme park and you can stick your tongue to the rollercoaster and do some stuff with there.

430
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Plus they have goat parkour in there now and you can ride a skateboard and ride a bike.

431
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The only thing I didn't like about it is that the goat, they seem to have increased the speed of the goat really really really fast now for some reason.

432
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm not sure why that is.

433
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So it's kind of hard to control sometimes because it doesn't run like it used to.

434
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But it's still silly.

435
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's still a fun game.

436
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So definitely check it out.

437
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
If you bought it earlier, check out the new patch because it was free.

438
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Lots of stuff in there.

439
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Including Minecraft, which I haven't found yet, but there's a ton of stuff in the game.

440
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That's it. That's all I played.

441
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Alright.

442
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, map.

443
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Jason, how about you? How was your gaming week?

444
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I did finally get a chance to play Mario Kart.

445
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It did come in on Monday and I've played a couple of multiplayer and a couple of solo rounds.

446
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I don't think I have anything else particularly interesting to add on top of what you did, but it is a great game.

447
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It runs so well.

448
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I have clips from my personal favorite races up on YouTube.

449
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That replay feature, I completely agree with the point that you made in that these are going to get really old really fast.

450
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And by the time that everybody else figures them out and starts posting every single one because they can, we're going to be like, yeah, we saw that.

451
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But the actual mechanics for not just 100% defaults of how it makes the replays, but also the little tweaks.

452
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,000
If anybody out there listening has Mario Kart 8 and has not hit edit replay highlights or something like that, you can choose the racers to feature.

453
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You can bump it up to 60 seconds, 30, 45, or 60.

454
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You can also do all, but it's worthless unless you're going to watch it because you can only post up to 60 seconds to YouTube.

455
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Right.

456
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But you can actually tweak these tiny little things about the race and it makes it a lot better because we're not just seeing one person zoom around racers at opportunistic times and all that kind of stuff.

457
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But the replay feature is grand.

458
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
For as being hands off as it is, they did a wonderful job.

459
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm enjoying that game thoroughly and unfortunately it's at a place I'm not going to be full time.

460
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Anyways, whatever, no big deal.

461
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I played that while I was killing time before coming up to Sacramento yesterday, more Titanfall.

462
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And I think there was something, but I'm totally 100% drawing a blank.

463
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I went to Scandi again and that was fun.

464
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I actually got to use the headphone ports for all three, Technica, Popn, and 2DX.

465
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And it makes a difference because I have big over the ear headphones and you kill all of the other arcade noise, mostly, and just hear game sounds.

466
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And it's very, it makes the experience quite a bit better.

467
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah. Oh, oh, that's what I was going to say.

468
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Does anybody in this room know what the term yak shaving means?

469
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Well, it certainly conjures a particular image to mind.

470
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
In the quick summary of it is that you need to go check the mail.

471
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's a sub-zero blizzard outside.

472
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So you need a coat.

473
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You don't have a coat.

474
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You need to go shave your yak to get the fur to make a coat.

475
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's a series of steps that you fumble over in order to actually accomplish one thing.

476
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
That was my week in a nutshell.

477
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I bought a recorder for E3 and systematically failed to be able to put micro SD cards that I had and ordered to use.

478
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And to top it all off, I was putting them in backwards.

479
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I discovered that today.

480
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Sony's instructions are terrible because the words tell you when you put a Vita or M2, whatever their brand is, when you put a Vita card in, the contacts face you.

481
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
When you put a micro SD card in, you put a label towards you.

482
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
The two of them are opposite.

483
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I didn't notice in the diagram that facing you is the back of the recorder.

484
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So despite the fact that I could just pop it and put it right in while looking at the face of the unit, no, it's backwards!

485
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Fuck you, Sony.

486
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Thank you.

487
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But it's working, and I have more battery capacity and SD cards than there is time in the week, literally 24 hours times 7 days a week.

488
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So I'm ready, I hope.

489
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Alright. My gaming week, I also played more Mario Kart, which I talked extensively about last week, so I won't repeat myself, except to say that I finally played some 4-player matches.

490
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Still disappointed you can't get one of those people on the gamepad by themselves.

491
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I do notice a little bit of a framerate dip in those matches, but it's not the end of the world.

492
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm getting really nitpicky at that point when I get into that. Still a lot of fun, and that's the most important thing of all.

493
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Also on the Wii U, I finally got to play the Wario. It's not WarioWare, it's like Game & Wario, it's just another mini-game collection.

494
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah, okay, it's a mini-game collection, party games, you know, I had five people over here last night.

495
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It was fun for that, and that's, you know, it was cute.

496
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You play this game where you launch people onto platforms, and then like, as you land, you might knock other people off, and the platforms move. It's silly. Silly stuff.

497
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I played Rob's NES Remix and NES Remix 2. It reminded me of Dance Master Mode from DDR. I completely forgot that.

498
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Super fun.

499
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You unlocked Clu Clu Land for me.

500
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I unlocked the first stage of Clu Clu Land.

501
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yay!

502
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Okay, also, a game I've been spending a little more time with this week, I bought, it came out, and some of you might be surprised to hear I bought this, but I picked up on the 3DS since I had some credit on the Nintendo store from buying all this other stuff, and I had the Nintendo Wii U Deluxe, so I get all that 10% back or whatever, and now that store is across both the Wii U and the 3DS, so I was able to get Tomodachi Life at a discounted price.

503
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Now, yes, there was a lot of controversy around this game, which we got into a couple weeks ago on the show, and I said my piece, but I think it's important to realize that Nintendo did apologize for that, and I think the gaming community as a whole, for the most part, accepted Nintendo's second apology. Unfortunately, it took them two times to get it right.

504
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:31,000
But I decided, you know what, I like these type of sim games anyway, I was a fan of Animal Crossing, I'm gonna check the game out. I realize some of my GLBT family does not feel the same way, and there's some people out there that feel very strongly that Nintendo screwed up, and we should not be buying Tomodachi Life.

505
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:43,000
However, if people continue to hold grudges against me for my entire life, for things that I've had to apologize for in the past, and with 555 episodes of this program, I've said some stupid shit I've had to apologize for in the past.

506
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:51,000
If people held grudges against me for the rest of my life, I wouldn't like that very much, and that would be really sad and depressing that there would be literally nothing I could do to make things right.

507
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:00,000
My point is, they apologized, let's move on. That being said, I want to put that whole controversy behind us and kind of evaluate the game as a game.

508
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Well, alright, I guess I should get this out there. It's really, really easy to kind of get what I want in that sort of like romance department, so here's what I did.

509
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You can't change the gender of a Mii that you import from your own, like Mii Plaza or the Miis that are saved on your system and so forth, but what you can do is you can make a new Mii, and you can make it a male or female, and all the same facial features, beards, lipstick, mole, beauty marks, whatever, are the same same, male or female.

510
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:39,000
You can do whatever you want. You want to make Conchita worst? You can. So what I did is I created Alan in the game as a female, and he knows that I did this.

511
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And so, his character and my character, funny enough, are getting into a relationship right now. They're doing that whole courting each other, having long walks on the beach thing. It's really adorable.

512
00:44:49,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So it really wasn't that hard to work around. So I say that both as a pro and a con, in that the pro is that if you really want to set up a same-sex relationship, as long as you're willing to overlook a few things such as misgendering, but I just kind of giggle it off.

513
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You know, it'll keep referring to Alan as a she, but I just think of it as like an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race. You know, like, how is she, though? How is she a girl?

514
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And I just kind of picture it like that in my mind, and it's fine. If you're willing to kind of overlook that little bit of silliness, it works just fine, and it's really easy to set up.

515
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But the con that I also say to that is that it was really easy to set up, and I'm buying a little less and less that it would have taken a lot for Nintendo to fix this.

516
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm not a programmer, so I'm not really going to try to get into it, but I just kind of think if Nintendo had really wanted to do it, they could have.

517
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But I do think at the end of the day, they were a bit lazy and probably ignorant, which, you know, okay, they've apologized, you know, I've done some lazy and ignorant things in my life, you know, whatever.

518
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:06,000
We'll move on and see what happens in the future. Anyway, now I'm really done with that topic, but I felt like I had to tell you the whole story on what's going on there.

519
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Let's talk about the game itself, and kind of just trying to look at it from that neutral standpoint.

520
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The game is really nothing like Animal Crossing, in my opinion. I know we kind of keep comparing it to that, but it really isn't like that at all.

521
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's a little more like a, honestly, it plays like a Facebook game, and I realize that can be seen as like a negative, but that's really what I think it is.

522
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You check in on it once in a while and, oh, somebody wants to be fed, or oh, somebody wants new clothes, and oh, they want to feed me, feed me, burp me, burp me.

523
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So, it's Nintendmes instead of Nintendogs.

524
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Actually, that's not a bad way to look at it. It's almost like Nintendogs with people is almost a better way to look at it than Animal Crossing.

525
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Ironically, there was also the Sony game that came out this week that was Nintendogs, but they talked like people, and that was weird.

526
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So, anyway, but what are you rewarded with for, you know, feed me, feed me, change my clothes, do whatever, tell me about if this person and I would make a good match or whatever.

527
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You get rewarded with story, and it's very much a fishbowl game. You're looking at these little virtual pets, which is why I think maybe Nintendogs is kind of a great comparison, because you're rewarded with the story.

528
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And when you have like 30 or something villagers in your little town that are all based off me's that you made, either me's made off celebrities, me's from people you know with these QR codes and so forth, you kind of get these little stories.

529
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And so, this causes you to be able to go to other people and to go, Loki, he'll never guess what you did in my town. Oh, my God, you were acting so stupid, and you would not believe that you're in a relationship with Lady Gaga, who I imported a me that looks like Lady Gaga to my town.

530
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And it's like those little silly story sharings. It's very quirky. There's a lot of like, you know, let's sing karaoke. You don't actually sing karaoke, but you watch your characters sing pop songs and make these silly music videos.

531
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And there's this nightly news element in it where you hear about the crazy antics that your me's are getting into and me's on the street will be interviewed, which are the me's there.

532
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So, I mean, that's what it is. Essentially, it's this big, you'll never guess what the people in my sim are doing, which is, again, kind of goes back to The Sims. The Sims, you know, was a big thing like that.

533
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:39,000
He'll never guess what I did in my house. Okay, so I built a pool, and I had everybody go in the pool, and then I got rid of the ladder, and you'll never guess what happened, right? Those are the kinds of stories that we create out of these types of games.

534
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And that's what you do get in Tomodachi Life is those stories and that aspect of it, but the game aspect, you guys, is really, really weak.

535
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:04,000
There's no fishing like in Animoid. There's no bug catching. There's really none of that. Sometimes you get into a, pick a card out of my hand and let's see who gets a pair first, or here's a picture zoomed in three times the regular amount.

536
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:12,000
What could it be? There's really crappy throwaway minigames like that that you can play that sometimes they'll want to play, but it's nothing.

537
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It would be hilarious if it's just so, like, disturbed. What is it? It's my penis. It's my penis. Whoa, that was unexpected.

538
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
No, no, nothing like that.

539
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Lady Gaga.

540
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Sometimes there's, they have a lot of weird items and things in the game, but that's really it.

541
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So, here's the thing, the bottom line on this game. I do think it serves a cute purpose, and for people that want a nice little distraction, it's a polished game that allows you to kind of interact with the people.

542
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It's like a Facebook game. If you're the type of person that doesn't mind checking in with a Facebook game every, you know, day or so for a good 15 minutes to just kind of check on people and so forth, Tomodachi Life is a very polished version of that game.

543
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But if you're looking for a game, you're not going to find it here. And I, for that reason, kind of give it, I'm tepidly positive on this game.

544
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I'm not, like, super enthusiastic positive. I kind of think it does what it needs to do. I'm not sure it's worth $35 at the end of the day.

545
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I think this is a $20 game, not a $35 game. Or this is a game that Nintendo will give away a year from now to get you to buy something else.

546
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I kind of don't think $35 is worth it for this game. And that's what I have to say on Tomodachi Life.

547
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:39,000
If you disagree with me, you can always email us in your thoughts on the game. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send something.

548
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm looking at her chat to see if anything has come up on that, what I was just talking about. Dark Tetsuya says at Live.vognetwork.com.

549
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So it's sort of like a soap opera or not quite that deep? Well, is a soap opera really that deep, Dark Tetsuya?

550
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It's a telenovela, let's put it that way. It's a telenovela. It's a little bit like that. So, yeah, there you go.

551
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news now that we've all gone with our gaming weeks and talk about what really is going on in the gaming world this week. Loki.

552
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Alright, so this kind of leaked out based off of people being at the convention center early and taking some photographs from the inside, kind of looking at booths being constructed and stuff.

553
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And one of the things that was spotted at Nintendo's booth was this big old banner for something called Mario Maker.

554
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And it kind of shows a picture of the Super Mario Brothers 1 style graphics with someone placing a piranha plant with a stylus.

555
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So what is it? You know, is it something for 3DS? Is it something for Wii U? No idea, but it looks like a game that revolves around making your own 2D Mario levels.

556
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Is it a game for both, wiggling eyebrows?

557
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It could be. I mean, shit, if the Wii U can't handle 2D Mario, which it should be able to since it runs on Virtual Console, and it's also an NES Remix, I think that they could probably handle this.

558
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Hey, maybe it's based off of the engine that runs NES Remix since they kind of remix the games there anyways.

559
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Maybe you could be absolutely right, actually, on that. Thoughts? You and I were joking before the show. You kind of said this on an earlier show.

560
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah, I only said this like, I don't even know how long ago, but yeah, it makes sense. I think it was back when I was saying how Nintendo doesn't really want to put effort into some of these games at the release.

561
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Like, for example, Virtual Console and stuff like that. They'll re-release a game and they won't really add that many features into it.

562
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, just add a game that people like, like Mario Brothers or something. Add a level creator and have a way where you can share levels and stuff like that. There you go.

563
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,000
All your community creates the content for you. You have to do no work other than building that editor, which you probably have anyways.

564
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Although I don't know if I want to believe the rumor or not. I mean, we're going to find out in two days anyway.

565
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You know, I feel like this is a very logical step for Nintendo. It makes a lot of sense. So if it's a made-up thing, it's a really good and convincing made-up thing because this is something where I could see Nintendo going in this direction.

566
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's essentially Little Big Planet starring Mario in a way. And I think that's a really good thing for Nintendo right now.

567
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Because if you think about it, they don't really have a lot like it. I mean, back in the day, you could edit Excitebike tracks, but what could you really do with that?

568
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Even here in the States, we didn't have the Famicom Disk System, so you couldn't even save what you did. It was like, come over and I'm going to design a track while you do something else and you can play my track.

569
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And there's been like little editing in that way. I think maybe some Super Nintendo games had like three slots. You could save things. Like little things like that.

570
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But nothing that I can think of that's really incorporated the internet. Like I'm really trying to think on something that kind of does that create and share that really Little Big Planet is based on the Nintendo universe. I'm drawing a blank.

571
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Smash Brothers Brawl. Which also had a limit of what, like four or five stages I think. If I remember correctly.

572
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Still, I would argue there's a pretty significant difference between something of that caliber and taking a game like a 2D platformer like Mario and opening that up to everybody to kind of do their own thing.

573
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Look how many ROM hacks there are for Mario. We're going to have asshole Mario officially.

574
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And I think a lot of people have been wondering, why doesn't Nintendo just embrace this? Everybody wants to hack the game.

575
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,000
When I talk about Nintendo making a Hail Mary play and doing something that none of us expect, this is kind of in line with that.

576
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I have an answer to that question. Swap, note, spot, pass. That's why.

577
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So do you think there is a concern that people will make levels that are giant blocks that say fuck, shit, cunt as you run through the level and Nintendo's worried about having to police that?

578
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It may be community created, but it's still moderator curated. Like yes, they will have to enforce that kind of thing if it is publicly accessible for everybody. Even if it's not, they probably have to.

579
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Like this is the Nintendo Network and Miiverse and all of this stuff where people drive the content. Yes, that's true, but Nintendo has very, very, very, very strict social guidelines.

580
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So they can't have everything doing this. They have just enough that they have manpower.

581
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I wish they'd do this with the original Mario Kart and make their own track editor would be awesome.

582
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Well, you never know. I mean, I just see with Nintendo getting more and more into the online thing, again, this makes, because I could see you could share your levels on Miiverse quite easily.

583
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And Nintendo does have that moderator thing in place. So maybe like little big planet, there'll be a way to report offensive levels and they'll be able to look at it.

584
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Like there's probably a way they can look at the file on their screen and just see the level all at once and see if anything offensive is in it and take action that way.

585
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So I don't know. So maybe Nintendo is going to start to embrace this and logically it makes a lot of sense. I hope it's true.

586
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It seems like it also seems like a stupidly easy thing for Nintendo to make. Doesn't it?

587
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And also like something that they could do for one, two, three world. I mean.

588
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yeah. Like one of the best parts of NES Remix 2 was that whole, I'm playing as the princess in Super Mario 3. That's so trippy, but awesome.

589
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Like that was, that was like one of the highlights for me. So yeah, you're right. If they could kind of fuse all that together, if Mario Maker is not just Mario one, or maybe it's Mario one to start.

590
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But if you want the DLC for Mario two and three, you got to buy the virtual console game and now it'll come with it.

591
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Who knows? Who knows? It'll be interesting to see what Nintendo gets into with that.

592
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
If Mario Maker comes out, let's hypothesize you owned a Wii U. Let's say Mario Maker comes out. It's a $30 game. Would you buy it?

593
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
For 30 bucks? No.

594
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
30 bucks? Still too much, huh?

595
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:13,000
There'd have to be some significant stuff in there. And I just, honestly, if I want to play ROM hacked Mario games, there's plenty of them out there.

596
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:24,000
There's plenty of them out there that do even like trippier stuff than just rearranging the levels. You know it'd be, well, Metroid would be cool too, because I've seen a lot of ROM hacked Metroid stuff.

597
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But anything ROM hacked sometimes is pretty, you know, interesting, especially when you're, you know, redesigning levels and there's some pretty cool levels out there.

598
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
There's even custom storylines for Earthbound Mother 2 and Mother 3.

599
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm curious for Jamie and Jason's thoughts on this real quick, but going to the chatroom at live.voggetnetwork.com, Blender says LittleBigPlanet has a strict policy and will remove levels.

600
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So, you know, it's not like this format of having levels and moderating them and so forth doesn't already exist somewhere else.

601
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And if I remember correctly, they even outright, well, no, I've played custom levels that have eye taken, camera taken photos. Never mind.

602
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But they probably moderate those much more strictly because the real world and a camera and part of your level.

603
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Yep. Time to penis. Although I did play a level once that was all pictures of Parker Posey, it was great. That was my favorite.

604
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Because then you could take the stickers and put them in your own levels. It was this really creepy, like, Parker Posey stalking thing. It was hilarious.

605
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
But while you have the mic, your personal thoughts on Mario Maker and if it's something that would interest you.

606
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Ask me on Tuesday.

607
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Cop out.

608
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm going to see it on Tuesday.

609
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I just want, ideally, I just want, and this is probably selling me a Wii U, I just want Excite Truck Maker.

610
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
That's what I want. I just want Excite Truck Maker because the game was perfect. You just need more levels. That's all you needed was more levels.

611
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Jamie, quickly, your thoughts?

612
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I don't think it's enough to make me want a Wii U.

613
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Not enough to make you want a Wii U, but let's, let's hypothesize you already had a Wii U. Would the game itself be something of interest to you?

614
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Maybe.

615
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Maybe.

616
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I mean, I spend most of my time in the Sims building houses, so I'd be, probably just do nothing but build shit all day.

617
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
To never be used.

618
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
The design side of you, I think, would twitch a little bit, like, getting to do this.

619
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Here's another interesting thing. What if it was not just making Mario levels? What if it was like Mario Paint?

620
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Hmm.

621
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I pay enough for Photoshop.

622
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
That was actually the initial reaction I had when I first heard about this news.

623
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:29,000
You know, there has been a lot of clamoring for a return of Mario Paint. You know, we haven't seen that in a very long time, and the Wii U seems like an obvious play.

624
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I mean, we have games that are very similar, like Art Academy on the 3DS and so forth, like, it's not out of the question that we would get some type of return of Mario Paint.

625
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
As long as it has the Flyswatter game, that's all I want.

626
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Alright.

627
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
ActDeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Mario Paint. I would like that.

628
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Alright. Let us go to our next story, which has to do with Xbox.

629
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:00,000
The Xbox One controller. I remember this. Jason, you brought an Xbox One controller and a PlayStation 4 controller to the studio once, and I was like, why did you buy these controllers?

630
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You were like, yeah, I wanted them, and someday I'll be able to use them on the PC.

631
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Yep.

632
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Well, guess what? That day has come, Jason.

633
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It's actually sitting eight feet away from you right now.

634
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Is it really?

635
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Yeah.

636
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
They're in my little black bag over there.

637
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Microsoft has released the official drivers for Xbox One for the PC, so it will support 32-bit and 64-bit Windows PCs.

638
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Any game that currently supports the Xbox 360 controller will support the One controller, and as soon as you install the drivers, you can start using that controller and connect it via a micro USB cable.

639
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Native controller support will come in a Windows update that is to come in the future, but they wanted to get the drivers out there ASAP so that people can use it on the PC.

640
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And I'm going to be honest, the Xbox 360 controller makes a great PC controller. I use it all the time.

641
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So I kind of want an Xbox One controller just to – because, you know, again, the D-pad on the 360 drives me nuts, so I imagine it's a lot better on the One.

642
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I'd also like to see some of those PC games support those rumble triggers. I'd be interested to see how that is like.

643
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Yeah. It would be cool.

644
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Well, one game that you could use that controller on as well when it comes out is Dead Rising 3.

645
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Of course, Dead Rising is already out on the Xbox One, but if you don't own a One but somehow have a controller like Jason, the game is coming to Steam.

646
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Capcom announced earlier this week that it will be on PC, and it's part of their E3 2014 lineup.

647
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:39,000
We don't know when, but it seems like it wouldn't take too long to put together, so I would think this holiday season, if not maybe something more like August, just in time for all these new drivers.

648
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You could play Dead Rising 3.

649
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

650
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I have some stuff, but it's not happy stuff.

651
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Aww.

652
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
But we knew this was coming one day.

653
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
The PSP?

654
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Mm-hmm.

655
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Womp womp.

656
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh, do I have to get the sound effect board again?

657
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
No. I did all the sound effects we need.

658
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Okay, fine.

659
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,000
It is going to be ending later this month. Bye-bye. At least in Japan.

660
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,000
It also is discontinuing it in North America. Of course, the shipment's already discontinued up here.

661
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's going to continue on in Europe for a little while, and it's going to be continuing in Latin America, some of the other Asian countries, but it's officially...

662
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,000
But I bet Fry's will still sell the UMD's movies, trying to get rid of that last stock that they have.

663
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
They'll eke any penny they can out of that, and then maybe I'll buy some.

664
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
There you go.

665
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
But I mean, it's almost ten years old. I guess that's...

666
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It seemed like the PSP was still kicking in Japan, though, so it was kind of a surprise to hear this.

667
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Buy the Vita! We'll force you to buy the Vita.

668
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Maybe that's part of what it is.

669
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
That's kind of what I think it is.

670
01:02:49,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah. But the only bummer about the PSP is that anytime I think of the PSP, I'm going to inevitably think of the PSP Go, which in retrospect was probably just a little bit ahead of its time.

671
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I mean, a digital-only platform. It's really funny. The PSP Go, in a way, was doing some of the things the Xbox One wanted to do with the digital-only.

672
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And it didn't work out so well.

673
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
People bought them, though. I mean, some people did.

674
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I kind of think if the PSP Go were to come out today, it might actually have done a little better.

675
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
PSP Go or PSP No?

676
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
No.

677
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Yeah, there is a much better network that could have actually supplanted it with games and with a lot more games nowadays, especially with the addition of PlayStation Plus.

678
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I was going to say, PlayStation Plus alone would give that thing a lot of value.

679
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
God knows I have, like, six purchases for a system that I don't own.

680
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Yeah, right? So...

681
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And also, they added, was it the Xbox Live Gold stuff already?

682
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Mm-hmm.

683
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So, since now, fucking Sony won't let me register those PlayStation 4 games anymore since I don't own a PlayStation 4.

684
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But on Microsoft now, you can do the Xbox One games, and I can do it even though I don't have an Xbox One, so...

685
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
All right.

686
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Get in on that shit.

687
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
All right, Loki, why don't you continue on?

688
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
All right. So, moving on here, let's see.

689
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
This is kind of neat.

690
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:27,000
You know, good old games, they've kind of had a pretty decent service going along with all their older games that are DRM-free.

691
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Now, if you want a kind of similar integration with stuff, as Steam does, they have their own client that they announced called Galaxy.

692
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And now, Galaxy is going to have cross-platform support, as well as for those playing online, and it's also totally optional.

693
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So, if you want to have that in there, you'll be able to earn achievements, access your library, also the multiplayer stuff.

694
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And it's kind of a neat little front-end for all these games you may have through GOG.com.

695
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
But, you know, if you don't want that and you want things the way they are now, you don't need it.

696
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So, that's kind of cool.

697
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I didn't actually watch the livestream, but I guess that was part of their Witcher announcement, I think, as well, when they were talking about that stuff.

698
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I'm curious to check this out, because I have a very small library on good old games.

699
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Yeah, all the free stuff that they've given out.

700
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I actually have bought things on good old games.

701
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I bought when they released Sid Meier's Covert Action.

702
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Those of you that have listened to the show for a long time know I have this really awkward boner for Covert Action.

703
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Which, you know, was a game from my childhood I just loved, even though the critics weren't really into it.

704
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Even kind of looking back in retrospect, I'm like, this game was kind of stupid.

705
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
But it was Carmen Sandiego, but with guns and killing people. It was awesome.

706
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So, I will always have a soft spot for Covert Action.

707
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Battle chest, Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Space Quest, Descent...

708
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I think those are the things that I actively bought from there, because they make cross-platform DOSBox emulation for all those old games.

709
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
You got a little library growing there.

710
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I'm downloading Galaxy right now.

711
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I think it is a good service overall.

712
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I think some of the games are sometimes a little pricey, but usually it's for a reason.

713
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
They're the games we really, really, really enjoy.

714
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But, you know, it's just hard.

715
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I mean, what is the value of a game like that?

716
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
But then again, I also pay five bucks for things on Virtual Console that some would say,

717
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
What the hell are you spending that money on?

718
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I'm a liar. I'm not downloading it right now.

719
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
It's not out just yet. I will download it when it's actually out.

720
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
We're not downloading it on this bandwidth. We're having a hard time keeping the show up tonight.

721
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Hey, hey, that outage wasn't our fault. Nobody knows what I'm talking about right now.

722
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Well, the live listeners sure do.

723
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
All right. Let's move on to you, Jason.

724
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Continue the conversation.

725
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So, Valve has officially embraced the fickle nature of game and game development by updating their early access fact,

726
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:12,000
warning that users may be playing games that will never actually be released, or worse, could be scrapped outright.

727
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
The statement updated to read,

728
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
It's up to the developer to determine when they are ready to release,

729
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and some developers have a concrete deadline in mind,

730
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
while others get a better sense as the development of the game progresses.

731
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Doug Lombardi, who's the director of marketing at Valve, said along with this,

732
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
that the changes to the fact are intended to help set customer expectations

733
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
of what may or may not happen over the course of development of an early access game.

734
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
We frequently iterate on Steam features as we gather feedback and find areas for improvement.

735
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
In this case, it became apparent that further clarifications would help customers

736
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
evaluate their potential purchase of early access titles.

737
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
We think of Steam, early access, and game development as services that grow and evolve best

738
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
with the involvement of customers and community.

739
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And this is really super surprising to me because don't some early access games

740
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
cost like full price for what you would buy for a new game?

741
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yes, they do.

742
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I've seen a good number of like $10 or $15, but I have definitely also seen like $50 early access games.

743
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Like Arma 3, Arma 3 was early access and I think it was like $40.

744
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I bought AudioSurf on early access, I think there was another one I bought too,

745
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
but I mean those were more indie titles, they were like $10, $15.

746
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Yeah, and they were also early, like,

747
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Wasn't that actually even before early access was officially a thing?

748
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I think AudioSurf in particular is one of the early,

749
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I mean it was released as an early, early game and it's still really being developed, so.

750
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It's a very interesting feature, don't get me wrong,

751
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
and we have a lot of the same arguments that we do with Kickstarter that these things may not pan out.

752
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
The difference is that because it's an early access game, you are playing something,

753
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
so you get something out of it.

754
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
But, like any game, if it requires server components especially,

755
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,000
if the source disappears, then well, your game may eventually disappear as well.

756
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Steam had to do legal cover your ass, so, you know, that went into the fact.

757
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Well, we'll see how people keep to early access in light of this news.

758
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And this is actually new to me, I haven't followed a lot of early access stuff,

759
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I've heard, I saw Arma when it came out most recently, DayZ was a big thing,

760
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I've seen a couple of others, but I've never bought them, I've never jumped into it first hand.

761
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:40,000
But apparently, a game has already been halted and not cancelled,

762
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
but Towns was halted and it's going in via Steam Greenlight,

763
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
and then Earth Year 2066 was outright removed last month,

764
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
apparently due to dishonest marketing, which I didn't hear anything about.

765
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
That's very interesting, but apparently these are,

766
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I don't want to say reactive changes, but they're certainly happening after the fact,

767
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
there's already precedent for this kind of a problem,

768
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and now it's in Steam's official information, so take that as you will.

769
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Hi, GameGuru in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

770
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,000
paying for a broken game, sigh, but if that's what people want, dot dot dot.

771
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
It's your money spending on what you want, right?

772
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Yep.

773
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Alright, so hopefully you're getting an accurate portrayal of what your money is going to buy,

774
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I think that's a very important thing to know.

775
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Anyhow, DarkSakura.

776
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:32,000
One other point about what money controls is money controls things like layoffs,

777
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
which Nintendo has decided to consolidate their European operations,

778
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and they're laying off 130 employees.

779
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Now, keep in mind, for some people, that's a small town,

780
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:51,000
so they said that they're closing the headquarters in Gossa's time,

781
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I guess I pronounced that right, because I know what the little B sign is,

782
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
it's a sss, it's an extra sss.

783
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Anyway, that's in Germany, and is moving their operations to Frankfurt,

784
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
so they're losing 130 employees.

785
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Not so permanent.

786
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Huh, Nintendo has more offices in Europe than just Germany, though, right?

787
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yeah, this is just one office, but I mean, it almost seems to me like it's the start of something else, so.

788
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Take it as you will.

789
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It's unfortunate, but with some of these sales we're seeing and so forth,

790
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
it's not surprising that something's happening somewhere,

791
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
but yeah, I mean, again, this is a very important year for Nintendo,

792
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
they've got to really start making some of that money back on Wii U,

793
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
so it really should have been last year, but you know, Nintendo has tons of cash on hand,

794
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
let's not forget that, they've got tons and tons of cash on hand, so.

795
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
What happened to It Prints Money?

796
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
That's why they have cash in hand.

797
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
That's why they have cash on hand.

798
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
But the 3DS, you know, it's probably not doing,

799
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I think the reason why some people think the 3DS is disappointing

800
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
is because A, you know, you have the ever-growing mobile market and so forth,

801
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
but B, it's not meeting expectations,

802
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
but I think the expectations were set really, really high to try to offset what's going on with the Wii U,

803
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
but for all practical purposes, it seems like the 3DS is still doing very well,

804
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
a lot of people own them, and the game is still making a lot of games for them.

805
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Seems to be in a better spot right now than the Vita,

806
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
and I'm not really dogging on the Vita, I realize there's a lot of great games out on the Vita and so forth,

807
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
but it's not exactly nearly as rampant as the 3DS adoption is, so.

808
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Anyhow.

809
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
All right, let's travel around the world and check out release dates.

810
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Let's see what is coming out soon from a company you love,

811
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
although with the three-week, probably most of it isn't really announced,

812
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
but we'll see what is on deck anyway. Loki.

813
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Not a whole ton of stuff coming out this week.

814
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I've got Enemy Front on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

815
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:51,000
and How to Train Your Dragon 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and 3DS.

816
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
That is it.

817
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
All right, let's go to Japan and check out what is coming out there in the Japanese release dates.

818
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:05,000
On June 12th on the PlayStation 4, Thief gets its Japanese release from Square Enix on June 12th.

819
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Fighting Commander 4 also coming out on the PlayStation 4 on June 12th.

820
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Nothing for Xbox One, because remember, that isn't out in Japan yet.

821
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Very interesting to see. I'm very curious. That was almost like a runner-up for me.

822
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:24,000
How is Microsoft going to get into the Japanese market there at E3?

823
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
All right, Shane walked into the studio and is dying to say something here. What?

824
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I have breaking news.

825
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Okay, what?

826
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Can I borrow your phone charger?

827
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Couldn't you, like, text me that or something?

828
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yes, she can borrow my phone charger. Oh my god, was that really worth interrupting the show for?

829
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
You jerk. Get out of here. All right.

830
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's in my room. You want to brave that?

831
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Or give me a minute and I'll come get it.

832
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:06,000
All right, on the PlayStation 3, it's probably over by where Alan's underwear is, but I'll let him figure that out on his own.

833
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:18,000
All right, on the PlayStation 3, Fighting Commander 4 on June 12th, One Piece Unlimited World R, as well as Ratchet & Clank Giga Saikyo TriStar Pack.

834
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
It looks like a compilation there on the PlayStation 3 this week.

835
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,000
And Thief, also making its way to the PlayStation 3 all this week on the 12th.

836
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:32,000
On the Xbox 360, Thief gets its release there in Japan.

837
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And on the PlayStation Vita, One Piece Unlimited World R from Bandai Namco, as well as Iyu Densetsu Anno Kisuke Evolution from Falcom comes out as well.

838
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And last but not least, I'm going to check the Wii U to see if anything is out this week on the Wii U.

839
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
One Piece Unlimited World R is there as well.

840
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
And I can't forget the Nintendo 3DS, except they are not actually having any releases this week.

841
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
But Pack World is slated for June 19th, so there's that.

842
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And Pokemon Art Academy, speaking of those Art Academy games, that's all on the 19th.

843
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
All right, moving on. To Europe, DarkSakura.

844
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,000
There's some stuff coming out in Europe, and for a moment my system has been slow, so you ready?

845
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
On the 13th of June we have Inazuma 11 GO Shadow & Light.

846
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Spread tires, I guess, on PC.

847
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Enemy friends on Xbox 360, PS3, and on PC.

848
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
That looks to be about it.

849
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
A general lack of stuff.

850
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And since Rob and Shane are now braving the depths of the scary, scary bedroom, I will just go ahead and say that Loki has the new story.

851
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Yeah, of course.

852
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
So this is kind of disappointing, especially when it turns into lawsuits.

853
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:00,000
But apparently the composer for the Halo series and now the upcoming Destiny game, Martin O'Donnell, is suing Bungie.

854
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Because apparently he was fired without cause, according to his claim.

855
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And due to that, he was not paid his, I guess, accrued time off.

856
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
The unused vacation, paid time off, sabbatical time, and other benefits that they had promised to pay him.

857
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And now, because of this, I guess he is seeking twice the amount of withheld wages along with compensation to cover legal fees.

858
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And I guess also filing another grievance against both the CEO Harold Ryan and Bungie.

859
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
But I guess they haven't really said what that is over.

860
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
And I don't know, it doesn't really say.

861
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So he has another grievance, but it doesn't really say what it's for.

862
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I guess separate from the whole paid time off thing.

863
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Well, when you leave a company, you are supposed to get all that time off.

864
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And apparently he says, like most companies, they have a policy based on that they are supposed to be paying that stuff out.

865
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Well, we'll see what develops in court.

866
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
But like most things, it will probably be settled out of court with a gag order.

867
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So we'll never hear about it again.

868
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Alright, one thing you're still going to hear about, and you're going to hear plenty about it next week, I'm sure, is Mortal Kombat X was officially announced.

869
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Now I want to point out, unlike when we had Final Fantasy X-2, which a lot of people mistakenly called Final Fantasy X-2, this is Mortal Kombat X, not X.

870
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And that's per the Twitter of, I believe it was Ed Boon that came out and actually said that.

871
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
But isn't it the tenth game still?

872
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
It is.

873
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:46,000
So calling it Mortal Kombat X is not necessarily wrong, but they are going to be marketing the game as Mortal Kombat X.

874
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:54,000
But you see, with a game like Mortal Kombat, you think extreme or extreme violence or whatever, so it makes sense.

875
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:07,000
But anyway, Mortal Kombat X was officially announced this week to no one's surprise, because you remember on last week's show we were talking about that the posters were spotted and we knew this was coming, there was a countdown to a countdown.

876
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Well, the official trailer hit, and it was Sub-Zero and Scorpion fighting with some little rap music.

877
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
What, they're going to be in the game?

878
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Yeah, I know, right?

879
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
That's so shocking.

880
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
That was playing in the background.

881
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And while I'm watching this trailer, all I can hear is my mom in the back of my head, that is so, Rob, that is gross.

882
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
That is a gross game.

883
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Because, like, you know, it's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

884
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
So we're watching, and it looks like the x-ray attacks are back, but it doesn't, like, fade to black now.

885
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
You kind of see that in real time.

886
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:43,000
And that whole little thing where, like, he frickin' decapitated Sub-Zero at the end or something and put the spear through his head, like, it was very, very explicit.

887
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And I was like, even I was like, that is, that is gross, Ed, Ed Boon, that is gross.

888
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Well, the whole thing was like CG, but I did, if it's assuming, I'm assuming that it's going to be based off of what the actual gameplay is like.

889
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So, if that's the case, it looks like they have the environment attacks that they had in Injustice, which is kind of cool.

890
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:13,000
And then, what was I going to say, I don't know, I don't like the whole CG trailer thing, and I really didn't like the music choice for that trailer.

891
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
It was just very off-putting.

892
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
What did you want, techno? You want the old mortal combat?

893
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Yes! Yes, that's exactly what I wanted.

894
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Come on, I mean, dude, you had a perfectly good theme song, you don't need to change it up.

895
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Just, I mean, if you want to go cliche with it, you can have a little bit of, you know, a little bit of bass, you know, have a drop in there or something like that.

896
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:43,000
But have it be the fucking original, well, the original movie theme. Was it the movie or the game theme? It wasn't the game theme.

897
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
No, it was like made for the movie.

898
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Anyhow, yeah, and Act F says, I don't think the trailer music should be any indication of the music in the game. I agree with that, it never is.

899
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:01,000
But no, no, it is, because it says, you know, that's the artist, and it was a special song by that artist in the game. So that song is in the game.

900
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Wow, really? Interesting. I wonder if they're going like EA soundtrack style with it or something. Warner Brothers does have a record label.

901
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I suppose.

902
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Be interesting.

903
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
But they really need the original one. Or just mix it up, you know?

904
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Tigerclaw agrees with you in our chatroom, saying they could have done something like a dubstep of the original MK Techno song.

905
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Mortal Kombat!

906
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Yeah, I would like that. I would admire that.

907
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:41,000
WhatupG says that Ed Boon says, waiting to see Scorpion's second fatality. Oh god, I can only imagine.

908
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Alan Alchemy in our chatroom says, I wouldn't mind a proper sequel to the reboot from two years ago. It was really good in the story narrative from there.

909
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The story only covered Mortal Kombat 3 and a little bit of 4. I'm not sure, but Mortal Kombat 4 is kind of where I think a lot of people felt the series started to kind of decline a little bit.

910
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:06,000
So I'm kind of curious as to how they'd want to retell some of that. Although, I would like Tanya to come back. I like playing as her in Mortal Kombat 4.

911
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Rumor that's brewing right now is that you're going to have variations of the same character. So you'll have three Scorpions.

912
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And it's not talking like Cyber Skorpion and Scorpion. It's just like you'll have these distinctive little changes within the characters.

913
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
They just have to rip off Mario Kart, don't they?

914
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Custom Karts that your Mortal Kombat characters ride in.

915
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Village Idiot's Matt in our chat says, are we really going to panic about the music? The video is fucking sweet.

916
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I like music in a video game, don't get me wrong, but I don't think that's the only song that's going to be in the game.

917
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And even if I maybe didn't like it personally, at the end of the day, I could always mute it and play my own thing.

918
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Do the consoles let you do custom soundtracks anymore? Actually, come to think of it, I don't remember if the new ones let you do that.

919
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
They're just like, hey, hey you guys, I know you like the on off switch, we just added that in.

920
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Well I guess it shows you how often I actually use that feature, so maybe I shouldn't be complaining about it.

921
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Alright, anyhow, let us take a trip back. We're going to go back in time a little bit.

922
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:20,000
We're going to go back in time to when you couldn't have a full CD soundtrack in your video games, you couldn't do that.

923
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Yes you could.

924
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
You had bleeps and bloops and you liked it.

925
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Oh, is this game a little newer where you could have a CD?

926
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,000
No it's not, but back in the day, even, you know, 20 years ago we had CDs.

927
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I suppose with your 10 year rule we did have the whole Symphony of the Nights over 10 years old, right?

928
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Well, even 20 years ago we still had CD music.

929
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Fair enough, but I know, see I get prepped on what game you've picked and I know this is a bleep bloop game.

930
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I was six years old, Rob. Six.

931
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Six years old, alright.

932
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
You probably couldn't see over the edge of the cabinet.

933
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Which sadly means most of our listeners probably weren't born.

934
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Well, dammit, they need to play it.

935
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Alright.

936
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Because, fuck your age limitations.

937
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
What is the game of the week already, DarkSakura?

938
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Pango!

939
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I did this one just for you, Rob.

940
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I love Pango, it's one of my favorites.

941
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Dan suggested it too.

942
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Oh yeah?

943
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Yeah.

944
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Pango is a red penguin.

945
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Why he's a fucking red penguin in the Arctic, I have no idea. Antarctic, I mean.

946
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
So anyway, you play on an overhead maze and you have ice blocks.

947
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
And Pango has to fight the snow bees.

948
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
These green blobby things.

949
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Not the bees, not the bees!

950
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Snow bees, Rob, snow bees.

951
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And you have to basically eliminate all the snow bees.

952
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:43,000
And steal bonuses and three different diamonds that are dispersed throughout the maze.

953
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
So it's a joystick button game, you know.

954
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:54,000
You can actually shake the walls to paralyze snow bees and then run over them and get points.

955
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
You have 16 levels and they repeat once you reach the 17th.

956
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Basically, when you kill different snow bees on the way, new ones will hatch from eggs that are within some of the ice blocks.

957
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Some of the blocks that have the eggs will flash at the start of the level, but you have to have really good memory to remember that.

958
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,000
You can get rid of the eggs by crushing the blocks that they're in.

959
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And then like I said, Pango can push a side wall that can vibrate and stun a snow bee and then they get 100 points for walking over them.

960
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
When all the snow bees are gone, you go on to the next level.

961
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
You have diamond blocks that are unbreakable.

962
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And if they are collected in a horizontal or vertical line, then you get an extra 10,000 points if they are aligned without being next to a wall.

963
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And 5,000 if they are against a wall.

964
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
They also, by aligning them, will temporarily stun all snow bees.

965
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
After 60 seconds, go by without any deaths.

966
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:11,000
The game goes into sudden death, where the music tempo and the snow bees get faster and basically the snow bee gets to live and you have to start over.

967
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Lather, rinse, repeat.

968
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Yeah.

969
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:26,000
There is an easter egg that in the attract mode, if you push two joysticks up and press two action buttons and one button of start game, it will show the credits for the game.

970
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And then the game will reset.

971
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
You can actually stop the waiting by pressing the start one button.

972
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
So yeah, you get different points for killing different things.

973
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And it has intermissions.

974
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,000
It has six intermissions every even numbered round.

975
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:50,000
They have six penguins that are doing dancing or marching around or shaking their booty in one of them.

976
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
The third one, the penguins stop and salute.

977
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
The fourth one, the penguins face the player and then exit the screen in a line, kind of like the aliens in Space Invaders.

978
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
The fifth one, Pango is revealed to be playing a cocktail table by himself.

979
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,000
And in the sixth version, Pango appears from behind the cocktail table playing peekaboo.

980
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And then it repeats.

981
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:18,000
So, there were different versions of Pango and some of them had different music.

982
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Now, this very first one here used popcorn as the theme music.

983
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And it took a little while to draw the maze at the start of the game.

984
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
The second one had original music and faster maze drawing.

985
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
So, of course, the second version was also harder.

986
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,000
So you had Pango, which is Pango's set one revision seed that played popcorn.

987
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And then Pango 2, Pango 2U, Pango 3U, and Pango 4.

988
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Pango 4 being the fastest and hardest.

989
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It was fast and hard.

990
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So there's been many, many versions.

991
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
We've had versions on the Atari 2600, 5200, which I have a 5200 version,

992
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, and the Game Gear.

993
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Then Bondi Electronics did two Sega license handhelds of Pango.

994
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
One was an LCD pocket game, the other one was a tabletop version.

995
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
There was Peppenga Pango that came out on the Sega Master Drive in Japan,

996
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
which I need to have this now.

997
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And then there were some clones.

998
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
There was Penge for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.

999
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And Capcom did one called Don't Pool, which was part of Three Wonders,

1000
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
which I think I've reviewed Three Wonders before, that was a Pango clone.

1001
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Hijimaru is really similar to this, too.

1002
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Hijimaru.

1003
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Sorry, Hijimaru is really similar to this.

1004
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Yeah.

1005
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
There were other remakes that came out.

1006
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
There was an 8-player version, too, in 2010.

1007
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:55,000
It was on location test at a Sega Shinjuku Nishiguchi that was there in 2012.

1008
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
May 2012.

1009
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Then Club Sega Akihabara Shinkan did another one in July

1010
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
that was a four-game compilation that was called Gensin Love Plus Pango.

1011
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And so then there were just all kinds of different other versions.

1012
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And then that compilation one came out on the Xbox 360 as Gensin Love Plus Pango.

1013
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:25,000
As far as the highest Pango score, according to Twin Galaxies, which whoop-de-shit,

1014
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Rodney Day of Canberra, Australia, has the world record of Pango

1015
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:38,000
with 1,110,370 points since August 13, 1983, and no one has broken it since.

1016
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Also, Pango makes a cameo appearance in Up and Down.

1017
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
If a player manages to pass the first four rounds in less than a minute each,

1018
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:53,000
he will appear in the water of round five riding a surfboard that Pango will.

1019
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
You know, I played a game back when I was super young

1020
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,000
that was an awful lot like this but had slightly different mechanics.

1021
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
It was an old, old, old DOS game, predominantly black and white.

1022
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
It was called Pango, P-A-N-G-O.

1023
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Its theme was also popcorn.

1024
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
You had a shooting mechanic and it also had a gravity mechanic,

1025
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
so if you built up to a boulder it would come down and squash the enemy,

1026
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
which, hell, if I can even remember what the enemies were.

1027
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But this is striking a lot of familiar feelings for a game

1028
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
that I haven't played in literally two decades.

1029
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Oh, my God, Rob, if you still have it, you totally need to play the raver's choice.

1030
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Volume four from DDR.

1031
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
That's actually one of the many reasons why we all learn about popcorn in our youth

1032
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
because it was just everywhere.

1033
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
It was, you know, the traditional...

1034
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Which I believe was my first eight.

1035
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I don't even remember how hard that game was.

1036
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,000
You heard Dark Sakura talking there about how many freaking clones and stuff there were,

1037
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
so it doesn't surprise me at all that whatever computer you were playing on

1038
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
probably had this, you know?

1039
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
It was an old-school straight-up PC.

1040
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I'll call it a bootleg because it wasn't a direct copy.

1041
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Like I said, the character was a car, not a penguin.

1042
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I don't remember what the enemies were, but I'm pretty sure they weren't living things,

1043
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
traditionally living things.

1044
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
But, yeah, it was a great game.

1045
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I'm not entirely sure how I missed Pingo.

1046
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
All right. Is that it then?

1047
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Your classic game of the week, courtesy of Sega.

1048
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Pingo pen.

1049
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Although I think that the name Pupunga Pen is actually pretty funny.

1050
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Watching the guy play that game kind of hurt me a little bit

1051
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
because he wasn't crushing the ice blocks that had the eggs in them.

1052
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
No, I had one that was better than this guy.

1053
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
It was really good.

1054
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
But at the second round, the music was replaced with a remake,

1055
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
with like an OC remix and then another one.

1056
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I was like, nah, I want the music.

1057
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
We need authenticity here.

1058
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:00,000
If you look up Pango playthrough or something, you'll find the really good one first.

1059
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Surprising that with all the Sega circle jerk we see,

1060
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
we don't usually see this game show up with all their remakes.

1061
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Although I want to say it did show up in that Sonic collection.

1062
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Did it show you the version that the one they had at Pasquale's finally died?

1063
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I think we beat it into submission.

1064
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
That was the only place that I knew of in town that still had a working Pango.

1065
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Rest in peace.

1066
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
All right, we're going to take a break, guys.

1067
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come on this, the eve of E3 2014,

1068
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
including in our next segment, List List.

1069
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
We haven't done a List List since last year.

1070
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
We did one at the end of the year for our 2014 predictions.

1071
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
It's about time.

1072
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
So yeah, it's high time we bring some OLR games back.

1073
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
The prequel show is perfect for that.

1074
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,000
If you have started listening to OLR this year, you've never heard an OLR game.

1075
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I'm sorry.

1076
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I know, I'm sorry.

1077
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I'm very sorry if you just started listening to this game.

1078
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
You got 500 episodes to catch up on.

1079
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Get to it.

1080
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
All right, we're going to take a break.

1081
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
When we come back, plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1082
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Don't go anywhere.

1083
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
We will be right back.

1084
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, June the 8th on the eve of E3.

1085
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Now, I imagine there's got to be some of you guys that are going to be listening to this at work,

1086
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
you know, later in the week or whatever.

1087
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I don't know if our Monday crowd will still be listening because, you know,

1088
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
the press conference is going on, but it'll be really funny that there'll be all this news out there

1089
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
and you'll get to see what was right and what was wrong.

1090
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
It's always funny to kind of take a look back.

1091
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,000
One of those being wrong, of course, that, you know, The Last Guardian's not canceled.

1092
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Well, actually, it just came in.

1093
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Somebody had sent me this.

1094
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I'm sorry.

1095
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I forgot who sent me this tweet about this.

1096
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Oh, actually, I think this went to the Twitter.

1097
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Oh, for OLR, Redertainment just sent this.

1098
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,000
IGN actually issued an official apology for that article in the first place.

1099
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Steve Butts, who is, I guess, that's his name, who I guess is the editor-in-chief over at IGN,

1100
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
basically said, I made the call to post this.

1101
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I had credible information.

1102
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Obviously, the Twitter post makes that.

1103
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It was an error.

1104
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,000
And basically, we retract the story and kind of went into this whole no one care about how it happened.

1105
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
So there it is.

1106
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
So IGN did officially apologize for that.

1107
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
So we'll see.

1108
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I guess if it was Polygon making that mistake,

1109
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
they would be filming a documentary about how they made that mistake.

1110
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
And then they would be engaging in Twitter spats with people about how they're right.

1111
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
We'll talk about a little bit of that later.

1112
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news

1113
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
and quickly talk about a few other things going on in the game industry before E3.

1114
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Although I have to ask, Dark Sakura, before the show tonight,

1115
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
you brought me like a big bag of, it was British candy, right?

1116
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
From our friend Robert in England.

1117
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
All right.

1118
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Well, thanks, Robert, for the candy.

1119
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
You're getting me on a sugar high here before our list list.

1120
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
He's done a bunch of stuff.

1121
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
A lot of it I've been trying to share the wealth,

1122
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
and I had it ready to bring the week we didn't do a show.

1123
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
And then I forgot it last week.

1124
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,000
You know what I'm hooked on that I need to get me some of is HP sauce.

1125
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
You can get it easily.

1126
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
They sell it at Safeway.

1127
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I know.

1128
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
But I need to get me some of that.

1129
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
You know what's better than HP sauce?

1130
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
How's the Safeway today?

1131
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Daddy's sauce.

1132
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
It actually is the brand is Daddy's, not Daddy's sauce.

1133
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I'll get both.

1134
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
All right.

1135
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
There it is.

1136
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Go get it at Touch of Britain in North Highlands.

1137
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Trust me.

1138
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
And then have food there.

1139
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

1140
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
SSG100Matt says,

1141
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Hoard House always gets me into trouble whenever I listen via podcast.

1142
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
You're welcome.

1143
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
SSG100Matt also says they're apologizing, IGN,

1144
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
because they don't want to get kicked out of Nintendo's after party at E3.

1145
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Wouldn't that be Sony's, though?

1146
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

1147
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
God, you're so mature.

1148
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Alan Alchemy says,

1149
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Steve Butts of IGN went on record as saying,

1150
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Grow up.

1151
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I read that differently, Rob.

1152
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Or that is,

1153
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Grow the F up.

1154
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Oh, my God.

1155
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I was just trying to stick with the syllables you put in there.

1156
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Let's move on with some rapid fire news.

1157
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Now what we need now is some sort of, you know,

1158
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
mashed up song with a girl's butts about their whole mistake.

1159
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
You know, called Steve Butts.

1160
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Witcher 3, the Wild Hunt, finally got its reveal this week.

1161
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Or at least an extended reveal, which they announced the release date.

1162
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
February 24, 2015.

1163
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
It'll be coming out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.

1164
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
In both retail and digital formats.

1165
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Of course, on GOG Games.

1166
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Or GOG.com, obviously.

1167
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I'll be there.

1168
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
And then, this is kind of exciting.

1169
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Crytek announced, or I should say Deep Silver announced,

1170
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
that Crytek's going to be doing the sequel to Homefront.

1171
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
So, Homefront The Revolution, that's going to be coming out sometime in 2015.

1172
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Also on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1173
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And I'm pretty excited about that.

1174
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Because the original game looked pretty cool.

1175
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And be curious to check out the new one when it comes out, eventually.

1176
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
So I'm sure that's going to be something we'll see at probably E3.

1177
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Probably. Probably.

1178
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Jason?

1179
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Alright.

1180
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
The news we have all been waiting for.

1181
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Harmonix has finally given a release date to...

1182
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Disney Fantasia Music Evolved.

1183
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Some people are looking forward to it.

1184
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
It looks like it...

1185
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Harmonix's touch on things is very much in line with mine.

1186
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
They have officially dated Disney Fantasia Music Evolved for October 21st

1187
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
to be released on the Xbox One and Xbox 360.

1188
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Disney Fantasia explores the vivid imagery and music of Disney's symphonic film,

1189
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,000
but with a modern spin and a conductor-like wave of the arm in front of Kinect.

1190
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
So the much...

1191
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
And they've actually...

1192
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I remember...

1193
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I don't know if we've reported on it every time,

1194
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
but I think it's been a long time.

1195
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
And they've actually...

1196
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I remember...

1197
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I don't know if we've reported on it every single time,

1198
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
but every single time that Harmonix has a reveal for this game,

1199
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
more and more of the soundtrack is revealed.

1200
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
And it's always seemed a little weird to me because they're always very modern,

1201
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and I wouldn't even call them poppy songs in most cases,

1202
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
but at any rate, they have good songs going into it.

1203
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,000
And the reveal that accompanied this announcement on this turn was a new level,

1204
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
the neighborhood, a new world, rather, the neighborhood,

1205
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
a surreal glimpse of 1980s New York,

1206
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
with a pastel sky bursting behind skyscrapers.

1207
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:34,000
And the songs announced are M.I.A.'s Galang and the Who's the Real Me.

1208
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
For all of you importing fans out there, Retro Game Challenge 2,

1209
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
the fan translation of Game Center CX2, has arrived.

1210
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Done by Aaron in Japan, as everybody knows him as.

1211
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Well, not everybody, but people who maybe started with Bomani and stuff

1212
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
probably remember that name, yeah.

1213
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
The DDR crew, as it were, knows Aaron,

1214
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
the last name that I have never been able to pronounce successfully,

1215
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
as Aaron in Japan.

1216
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And not just text, but graphics as well,

1217
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,000
so that any Japanese symbols, symbology that isn't just straight-up words

1218
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
have been translated into English.

1219
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Go forth and enjoy it, because these games are quite fun.

1220
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
This is great that the community went to get this game translated,

1221
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
a real missed opportunity to not put this game out.

1222
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I mean, I understand maybe the first one didn't do so hot,

1223
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
but it was such a cute little game,

1224
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
and people, I think, really missed out by not checking it out,

1225
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
so I'm glad people get to...

1226
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I wish people could have got to do this the legal way,

1227
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
but desperate times.

1228
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Like everything else, well, they brought it, they did bring it here,

1229
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
so I'm pretty sure that licensing has a huge amount to do with this,

1230
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
because I would imagine that the TV station that airs Game Center CX

1231
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,000
has large claims to it, and probably has high licensing, likeness,

1232
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
something-something rights to it.

1233
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Yeah, but...

1234
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
The legalities, whatever.

1235
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
But it's here, and everybody can import and hack their legitimate copy

1236
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
to play it in English.

1237
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Sure.

1238
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
All right, lastly, Dark Soccer for Rapid Fire News.

1239
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Well, there is some news about an actual TV series, kind of TV series,

1240
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
more like a short interactive TV show that's going to be on Xbox One,

1241
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Xbox 360, and PS4 in November.

1242
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
It's called Rabbids Invasion, the interactive TV show,

1243
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,000
so it's a CG animated show that's based off of the Rabbids,

1244
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
and it will require a Kinect or PlayStation camera,

1245
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:36,000
and lets you do little mini-games like matching poses or egg fights

1246
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
or stuff like that, and it's up to four players at a time,

1247
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
so that's kind of neat.

1248
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
And there is something I'm kind of excited about.

1249
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
It's Marathon Gamers, if anyone hasn't heard of them.

1250
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
It's a group of friends who have a small charity organization

1251
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
who will be doing the summer marathon of friendship to raise money

1252
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

1253
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
The group actually is from Huntsville, Alabama,

1254
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
so that's why I kind of have a big interest in them.

1255
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:10,000
It's a 48-hour marathon gaming session on June 20th on Stitch.

1256
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
So they're going to be playing Left 4 Dead, Mario Party,

1257
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
all kinds of games, and you can contribute.

1258
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
It will start June 20th at 2 p.m. Central Time,

1259
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:29,000
and you can join it on twitch.tv forward slash marathon underscore gamers,

1260
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
or you can go to marathongamers.org and check them out.

1261
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Please, please, please, please, please help them out

1262
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
because they're doing a great thing.

1263
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
All right, excellent.

1264
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I like giving shout-outs to the charity streams,

1265
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
lots of good stuff out there.

1266
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And they're from my home state.

1267
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
All right, let's get into, we've been hyping this up all night.

1268
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:56,000
It is time for us to bring back the segment known as Listless.

1269
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
All right, here is the way that Listless works.

1270
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
It's been a little while since we've played this game,

1271
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
but I'm going to explain the rules one more time here, okay?

1272
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
We are going to put together as a highly scientific method

1273
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
for us to determine the definitive list.

1274
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Once we have put this together, there is no arguing with it.

1275
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
It's done. It's definitive.

1276
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
We've compiled it. You voted on it. It's done.

1277
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
And yes, you will have a chance to vote on the list

1278
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
and help make this a possibility.

1279
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Head on over to live.vognetwork.com if you wish to play.

1280
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Those of you that listen on the podcast feed, I'm sorry.

1281
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
You can't play for now, but we are looking at in the next year

1282
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,000
expanding this segment so that you can actually vote during the week as well,

1283
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
but that will be later on.

1284
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
So for tonight, just the live chatters getting to participate in Listless,

1285
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
not Piss Piss, Kajuno, List, List, L-I-S-T-L-E-S-S.

1286
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Okay, here's how it works.

1287
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Tonight we're going to have five people in studio,

1288
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
and we are all going to compile the first list,

1289
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
and we do that by naming our top three.

1290
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,000
So we'll have five, and we'll take that down to, or we'll take that up to 15.

1291
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Then comes round two where we all vote something off the list.

1292
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Now remember in the upgraded Listless rules that we did last year for 2.0,

1293
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,000
if a host has two answers removed from the list,

1294
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
the third one gets immunity.

1295
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
That way nobody's list gets completely decimated.

1296
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
So we will each eliminate one answer.

1297
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And also in case of a tie.

1298
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
It wasn't there in case of a tie.

1299
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
The host's choice that wasn't picked gets the break of time.

1300
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Oh, you're right. I am breaking the engagement.

1301
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
You're throwing it way back. That's all right.

1302
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
It's been a little while. It's been a little while. All right.

1303
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:38,000
So anyway, so with, and they're talking in chat that it sounds like List List,

1304
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
like a like like or something in Zelda.

1305
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
No, that's the joke.

1306
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
That's the joke, you guys. That's the joke.

1307
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
All right. Anyway, Crystal Waters, I love you,

1308
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
but I'm going to take your volume down there in a minute.

1309
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Let's see. What else do I need to say about this?

1310
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
So we're up to 10, and then you guys over at live.vognetwork.com

1311
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
are going to get to vote for your top two answers.

1312
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
You're just going to click them.

1313
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
It's going to pop up right there on the screen.

1314
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
You click your number one, you click your number two,

1315
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
and then you submit, and there it is.

1316
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
We compile the votes and read the answers here a little later on the show.

1317
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
So let's get to it.

1318
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
All right, Crystal, you can come back now that we're ready to actually start making this list.

1319
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
So let's put it up on the board.

1320
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:22,000
The question tonight, what are we most looking forward to at E3 2014?

1321
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
We're going to put that up on the board,

1322
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
and those of you over at live.vognetwork.com will be able to see that pop up on your screen.

1323
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,000
While we wait for that to pop up, we're going to introduce who's playing along tonight.

1324
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Of course, Techmaster Loki.

1325
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
And Loki, celebrities on game shows always are promoting something.

1326
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
So what are you promoting tonight?

1327
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I'm promoting... I don't know.

1328
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Promoting apathy.

1329
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
All right. Apathy, people of America.

1330
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Loki's promoting apathy. All right, fair enough.

1331
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Dark Sakura, of course, is here tonight participating as well.

1332
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Dark Sakura, what are you promoting tonight?

1333
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Flatulence.

1334
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Flatulence.

1335
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
All right, there it is. All right.

1336
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Dark Sakura's here as well.

1337
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I am here as well, and in good Rob Roberts fashion, I'm promoting myself.

1338
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E if you wish to follow me on the Twittersies.

1339
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Also joining us tonight in studio is Jason.

1340
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I'm promoting the Melancholy Awareness Association of America.

1341
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Oh, are you a sad panda?

1342
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
For their sake, I am.

1343
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,000
All right. And last but not least, joining us in studio, speaking of apathy.

1344
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Oh my God. All right, say hello, everybody, to Shane.

1345
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Hello.

1346
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Hi, Shane.

1347
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Hi.

1348
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
This is why I have you take Jamie's mic. I can actually hear you on that one. How are you?

1349
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I'm fine.

1350
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And what will you be promoting tonight?

1351
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I'm going to promote the charity Pediatric AIDS. We give babies AIDS.

1352
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
What? That's not even funny.

1353
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I thought it was.

1354
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
No, it's not.

1355
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Look at these people in here. They're laughing.

1356
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
It's awkward laughter because you're weird.

1357
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
He means AIDS and, you know, assistance.

1358
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Yeah.

1359
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Butlers.

1360
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Duh. We give them puppies and walkers.

1361
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
What were you thinking?

1362
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
A 70s diet drug, clearly.

1363
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
All right.

1364
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
What?

1365
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Let's get into building the list. We're going to create the definitive list with the top answers.

1366
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Let's start with Jason. What is your first answer for the board?

1367
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Of course you had to start with me. I've been wrenching this last five minutes trying to figure out what the hell I'm going to say.

1368
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Well, I need at least another.

1369
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Oh, hopefully we steal all five of those. So you have this agony.

1370
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:42,000
You all can give your answers along in chat as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

1371
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,000
If you want to help out the hosts by putting some answers up on the board, live.vognetwork.com.

1372
01:45:47,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Because we have to pay this one forward, I will go with, despite the fact that they have no official show floor present, Val will bust through the arena, interrupting somebody else's keynote, Kanye style, and Half-Life 3. Go get it.

1373
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Sorry for the awkward silence. I'm writing it down. Hold on.

1374
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,000
All right. There it is. So, Val, will Kanye interrupt a keynote with Half-Life 3?

1375
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
So you are basically just totally swiping Bobby's winning answer from last year.

1376
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Ah, that's not cool, man.

1377
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Is what you're doing.

1378
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Yeah, well, like I said, I'm paying it forward. I'm paying it forward, dammit.

1379
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
We're going to start that way.

1380
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Paying it forward, plagiarizing, saving.

1381
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Fine.

1382
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
That's what I'm going to say from now on. Oh, I can't plagiarize that. I've been paid forward.

1383
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:40,000
We'll put it up on the board and see how that goes. Shane, your number three answer.

1384
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Okay, so I totally wrote down five things, so I thought it was five for some reason, so I will say my number three is,

1385
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Microsoft realizes we need a new Alan Wake fix and puts a show in production for their dumb Xbox One TV show initiative.

1386
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Kind of like Twin Peaks, because that's what that game really is.

1387
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
So an Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One, essentially.

1388
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
All right, let's put that up on the board. That's a nice, non-offensive good answer from you. I like that.

1389
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
All right, Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One.

1390
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
All right, let's go now over to Dark Sakura.

1391
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Dark Sakura, the lovely Dark Sakura, with her number three answer.

1392
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I'll get a Mass Effect sticker. I'll bring it back for you.

1393
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Is your mic off, Dark Sakura? I don't know why.

1394
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Yeah, Shane turned my mic off. Thank you, Shane.

1395
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,000
All right, so Dark Sakura's answer was Mass Effect anything.

1396
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
But you know what I would really like? An HD remix of the first three.

1397
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
There's those rumors going on up there.

1398
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Without having to use mods like I've already done. I pretty much already play Mass Effect HD remix, just saying.

1399
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Fair enough. All right, Mass Effect anything is up there on the board. There it is.

1400
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Let's go over to me and my number three answer.

1401
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:06,000
My number three answer tonight is the Microsoft Game Shows Return.

1402
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I'm talking one versus a hundred and that stuff. Come on.

1403
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
And you say mine was a gimme. Come on, Rob.

1404
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Whatever. This is something you obviously quite want to see. You bring up a lot.

1405
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I think every list list I talk about how I want to frickin' that thing to happen there.

1406
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
What's that every episode?

1407
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
All right, Microsoft's Game Shows Return. Putting that up on the board.

1408
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
All right, Loki, last but not least with your number three answer tonight.

1409
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Well, you know, I could say something serious, but what fun would that be?

1410
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:44,000
So like I came up with the chatroom earlier, it's going to be Red Dead Redemption Cross Midnight Club.

1411
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
It's drift horses with neons.

1412
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Hey, I'd play that a couple rounds at least.

1413
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Red Dead Redemption Cross Midnight Club. So drift racing with horses.

1414
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Old west drift racing.

1415
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Sort of like Wendy Okupa and that little carousel cart or whatever that is.

1416
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Except these horses are going to have thumpin' bass and undercarriage lights and all that fun stuff.

1417
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
All right, fine. There it is. It's up on the board there. Red Dead Redemption Cross.

1418
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Vin Diesel's going to have a cameo because why not?

1419
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Why not? Why not? All right, let's go to the number two answers.

1420
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Jason. Yeah, everybody do it. Where have you been, Shane?

1421
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I started with all the agonizing. Fair answer.

1422
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Jason.

1423
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
No, there is actually one legitimate one.

1424
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
All right.

1425
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
At least one. I still have to think of a good number one.

1426
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Google's acquisition of Twitch confirmed with bonuses.

1427
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
With unforeseen things that were not announced in the deal.

1428
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:51,000
The reason why all this is taking place and not just, hey Twitch, move into our data centers.

1429
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Yes, Google, the acquisition as was rumored, what, two weeks ago and then just disappeared.

1430
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Finalizes with new features to come as a part of it.

1431
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:06,000
All right, so I'm going to throw that up on the board as Google Twitch acquisition confirmed with perks.

1432
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Exactly correct.

1433
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
All right, there it is. You talk about safe answers. All right.

1434
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I actually don't think, in reality, I actually don't think that's a very safe answer.

1435
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
All right, well, we'll see. All right.

1436
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Going to Shane's number two answer. Shane, what is your number two answer?

1437
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:26,000
My number two answer is giving the fans what they want. Konami announces they're done ruining Silent Hill.

1438
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And that's it. That's it. There's no new game. There's no actual game. It's just an apology.

1439
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
You know what? We're done.

1440
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yeah, they're not going to make any more.

1441
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
All right, they're going to take it out back and shoot it.

1442
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Yes.

1443
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
All right, sounds good. They're just going to let Pyramid Head cut it up. Here it is.

1444
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:52,000
But we are proud to announce Silent Hill Lords of Sirens, the spinoff game.

1445
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Straight up action.

1446
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Konami announces they are done ruining Silent Hill. There it is, Shane's number two answer.

1447
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Dark Sakura, your number two answer, please.

1448
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
X Tango returns.

1449
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Oh, I was in one of the Tango halls.

1450
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Ah, that's amazing. X Tango, one of the games we saw many years ago that never happened. Nothing ever happened with it.

1451
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
It was fun.

1452
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
It was a music game where you would put in commands in the characters of Tango.

1453
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
It was great.

1454
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:25,000
It was great, yeah. Whatever happened to it? The internet. You know what? If that game was around today, it would have had a Kickstarter.

1455
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Let's kickstart X Tango.

1456
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
All right.

1457
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I will do this shit. You watch.

1458
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
And then it will sell a million copies.

1459
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Time for my number two answer. My number two answer. Okay, I'm going to go like really crazy talk with this.

1460
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
This is fanboy wank. Everybody get your splash zone.

1461
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
F zero and just finish it raw.

1462
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Nope, nope, nope, nope. Worse.

1463
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Get your plastic tarp over your head for the splash zone wank that's about to happen. You ready?

1464
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
All right, so here's the thing.

1465
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
The Wii U is going to go online in a big way.

1466
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:03,000
And I'm not just talking about like the Dragon Quest X game we've been waiting for.

1467
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:09,000
The reason why Phantasy Star Online 2 has been delayed? Wii U exclusive.

1468
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive.

1469
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Oh, the people in the room seem receptive to that. I thought you'd all boomy for that answer.

1470
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Boo.

1471
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I mean, why are you boomy?

1472
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
It's wank, but let's not say that's a bad idea.

1473
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
That'll never happen. Although, I mean, I guess if they have any chance of an MMO coming to them, you know, coming from Sega.

1474
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Because for some reason Sega loves Nintendo, ironically.

1475
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Why not? Sega and Nintendo are kind of in bed together. It would make a lot of sense.

1476
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,000
If Nintendo really wants to come all out there and be like, bam, we're online, that would do it.

1477
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:49,000
And then Microsoft would be like, bam, we're online with motherfucking Destiny, which is way better than that fucking game.

1478
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Not for everybody, though. Is Anna Banana-Chan in Destiny? I don't think so.

1479
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Nobody's going to understand that joke.

1480
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
It could be, if you name your character.

1481
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Shane understood it. Alright. Loki, last but not least, your number two answer.

1482
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Okay. Sticking with my completely serious answers here.

1483
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I would love to see just an unusual announcement, coming from any of the big three, I guess, of President Cat 2, Prepare for Kittenfall.

1484
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Oh, that's good. President Cat 2, Prepare for Kittenfall.

1485
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:34,000
What's the general synopsis of President Cat 2?

1486
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:41,000
It's just, you know, mech suits and kittens and everything that the internet loves.

1487
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:47,000
All wrapped in the one nice package. It's got the casual angle, it's got the hardcore angle.

1488
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
It's got cats.

1489
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Alright. Here is the board so far.

1490
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Valve, will Kanye interrupt a keynote with Half-Life 3?

1491
01:53:54,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One, Mass Effect anything, Microsoft's game shows return, Red Dead Redemption cross Midnight Club,

1492
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Google's Twitch acquisition confirmed with perks, Konami announces they are done ruining Silent Hill,

1493
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:13,000
X-Tango returns, Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive, and President Cat 2, Prepare for Kittenfall.

1494
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Man, the elimination round tonight is going to suck.

1495
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,000
These are all really good answers, but we still have one more set of answers to put up on the board.

1496
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Jason, what is your number one answer?

1497
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:30,000
So far as I know, I don't recall if this developer has a booth and I don't know that I've heard any specific news about it.

1498
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 on the show floor.

1499
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 in a tiny tent.

1500
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 in a tiny tent next to the Capcom booth.

1501
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.

1502
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
And that's Jason's list.

1503
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Shane, what is your number one answer?

1504
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,000
It's a little long. You can condense it easily though, I'm sure.

1505
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Sony and Take-Two announce a partnership to bring the PS4 version of BioShock Infinite to Project Morpheus for amazingly fun virtual rail swinging.

1506
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Sony plus Take-Two, 3D BioShock Infinite.

1507
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
BioShockulous.

1508
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
BioShockulous.

1509
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
But it's not Oculus.

1510
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
BioMorphius.

1511
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Alright, Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite. That's probably the best way I can condense that.

1512
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Any particular reason you went that route, Shane?

1513
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I really liked that game and I didn't want to be too predictable tonight.

1514
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:40,000
So I did not talk about Elite Beat Agents, Pokemon, Mass Effect. I did talk about Silent Hill, but I killed it.

1515
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Alright, Dark Sakura. That is Shane's list. There it is. Dark Sakura, what is your number one answer?

1516
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:52,000
A game that features an all-female cast not written with any misogynistic tendencies in mind.

1517
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
As in, no hyper-sexualization, they're written intelligently, and don't need no man.

1518
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
How the fuck am I supposed to condense that?

1519
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Let's see, I'm going to put all female cast and credit developed video games.

1520
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:10,000
No, because I have seen men that write women well. Brian Michael Bendis writes a very good woman, for example.

1521
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Murphy Brown the video game.

1522
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
No. That's bullshit.

1523
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Non-sexist all-woman game. There we go.

1524
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:24,000
What was that Fox sitcom back in the late 90s?

1525
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I don't know. I don't watch that damn show.

1526
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
That's... I would not call that non-misogyny.

1527
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Alright, all-female game with zero misogyny. That was the best way I could condense that there.

1528
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Yes.

1529
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
So I'm going to put that up on Dark Sakura's board.

1530
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
And if anyone wants a good example, look at Claymore.

1531
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Alright.

1532
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,000
All women, no romantic subplot. None of that shit.

1533
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Alright.

1534
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
It's not a chick flick show.

1535
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
There it is, that's Dark Sakura's list.

1536
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:04,000
My number one answer is that... what will happen is that finally, after all these years, it will be a Half-Life 3 teaser shown at E3.

1537
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,000
But then halfway through the teaser, GLaDOS interrupts it and says,

1538
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Oh, were you getting your hopes up? And the 3 shifts into a Portal 3 logo.

1539
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
So GLaDOS...

1540
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Oh, that would piss everybody off.

1541
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:24,000
GLaDOS, Valve trolls Valve is my answer, basically. Valve trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer.

1542
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
How in the hell are you going to summarize that?

1543
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,000
GLaDOS turns Half-Life 3 into Portal 3, I guess.

1544
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
That would be fantastic.

1545
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I just put Valve trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer, and you guys already heard the rest of the answer there.

1546
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Alright, let's go to Loki, and dare I ask it, the last one on the list, your number one answer.

1547
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:52,000
My number one answer, I mean, I don't know, I can't think of anything really great and just cheesy, so I guess I will be somewhat serious.

1548
01:57:52,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Even though they haven't made the movies in a long-ass time, and the games weren't that great, I would love to see Rockstar do a new Matrix game.

1549
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Because the version of, was it, their game, The Warriors, was one of the best movie adaptation games I've ever seen.

1550
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:22,000
And The Warriors, I mean, that game came out way after the movie, obviously, so I would love to see him go back and take over that franchise.

1551
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:27,000
So turn a mediocre franchise into a really good one through a video game?

1552
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Yeah.

1553
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Alright, awesome.

1554
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I got it.

1555
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
What?

1556
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Goonies.

1557
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Oh, wait.

1558
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Too late, too late.

1559
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Alright, there we go, Rockstar does a new Matrix game, so there it is, here are the 15 answers up on the board.

1560
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Valve, will Kanye interrupt a keynote with Half-Life 3?

1561
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Google Twitch acquisition confirmed with perks.

1562
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.

1563
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One.

1564
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Konami announces they are done ruining Silent Hill.

1565
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite.

1566
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Mass Effect anything.

1567
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Extango returns.

1568
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
All female game with zero misogyny.

1569
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Microsoft's game shows returns.

1570
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive.

1571
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Valve trolls Valve with Portal 3 trailer.

1572
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Red Dead Redemption cross Midnight Club.

1573
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,000
President Cat 2 prepare for Kittenfall and Rockstar does a new Matrix game.

1574
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
This is an awfully big list.

1575
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
It's time to trim it up a little bit.

1576
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,000
This is going to be a very tough round tonight, but it is all part of the process, folks.

1577
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:25,000
And if you want to egg on the host, you should be shouting in chat right now which of these is not worthy of the list.

1578
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Jason, you get the lovely distinction of going first, but that means you can take any one of these out that you want.

1579
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Jason, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1580
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Oh, man.

1581
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:41,000
You know, the jokes don't quite reach that bar as obvious dumb to get rid of.

1582
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
And all the serious ones are really, really good.

1583
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
This is a really hard decision.

1584
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:52,000
But I'm going to say just for plausibility and obvious and gimme, Mass Effect anything.

1585
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Oh, alright.

1586
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Only because it's not a stretch. It's the only reason.

1587
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Alright. You want to keep us living in Wackyville.

1588
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Alright, fair enough.

1589
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,000
So in Jason's quest to keep us living in Wackyville, sorry DarkSakura, but you know you're going to get Mass Effect anything anyway.

1590
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Alright, it is stricken from the list.

1591
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Shane, which of these answers is not worthy of the list?

1592
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I'm sorry, Jason, but it's just past its reference time.

1593
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
The Kanye one with the valve thing.

1594
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
That's years old.

1595
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Are you only distributed because of the Kanye reference?

1596
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Yes.

1597
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
No, it wasn't his edition.

1598
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Never mind. Okay.

1599
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Well, plus we're not going to repeat last year, Jason.

1600
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
It's time for a new year, so I understand.

1601
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
If he didn't eliminate that one-

1602
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
It's not over until it happens.

1603
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Alright, so there it is. It's not worthy of the list.

1604
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
It has been stricken from the list.

1605
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,000
So DarkSakura has the distinction of going next.

1606
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1607
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I'm actually going to take off the Alan Wake TV show.

1608
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Oh, an Alan Wake TV show. Why that?

1609
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Because I don't really like Alan Wake.

1610
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Alright, it is stricken from the list.

1611
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Sorry, Shane, but it wasn't going to happen anyway.

1612
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Alright, it is stricken from the list.

1613
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I like how these have been all tier three.

1614
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Yeah, it's been all tier-

1615
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Well, let's see what happens because I'm going next.

1616
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
It's my turn to eliminate an answer.

1617
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Oh, God, this is hard.

1618
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I'm going to break the trend here and I'm going to make-

1619
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I'm unfortunately going to take a second answer off of somebody's list.

1620
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
And Jason, it's going to be you.

1621
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I'm going to take Google's Twitch acquisition off the list.

1622
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
How? I'm offended.

1623
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I just-

1624
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
It's not really game news.

1625
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
You're completely safe.

1626
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
It's a little safe.

1627
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
It's kind of the same reason you took the Mass Effect thing off.

1628
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
It's a little safe and I just-

1629
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I don't know, it's a little bit like-

1630
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
With bonuses.

1631
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
They're going to say something that's just really fantastic.

1632
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I know, I know.

1633
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Oh, they're not an independent company.

1634
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
But we're all running off the assumption it's already happening.

1635
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
That's my problem with it.

1636
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
So I'm sorry, Jason.

1637
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I'm not supposed to have predicted that it won't come to pass.

1638
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
All right.

1639
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:08,000
But the good news, Jason, this means Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 has immunity.

1640
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
So there it is.

1641
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,000
So Loki, that out of the picture, which of the rest of these is not worthy?

1642
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Loki's whole list is going to survive.

1643
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I can't believe this.

1644
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1645
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Well, just because I don't know what else they possibly could show at E3 because they only have what-

1646
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:31,000
I mean, granted, it is a pretty decent game, Metal Gear Solid 5 and Pro Evo, I guess, 2015.

1647
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:35,000
But I don't think that Konami is done ruining Silent Hill.

1648
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Considering that there's all these popular horror games coming out, especially in the indie scene,

1649
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,000
they're going to ruin that game until it stops making them any money.

1650
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Hasn't they already done that?

1651
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Oh, I think that there's going to be a next-gen Silent Hill game.

1652
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I bet there will be.

1653
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
So there will be.

1654
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Look at how-

1655
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I feel like there'll be a third movie.

1656
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
I want to point out, look at how we treat our guests on this show.

1657
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Look at Shane's list, also down to one answer with Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite.

1658
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Dark Soccer gets through with PAR with only one of our answers getting eliminated.

1659
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Myself and Loki unscathed.

1660
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Imagine that.

1661
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,000
How the hell did that happen?

1662
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Well, it's like they said, orange is the new black.

1663
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
You guys take care of yourselves.

1664
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Of your own.

1665
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I will say this.

1666
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
I was very tempted to go with the Red Dead Redemption cross midnight club,

1667
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
but it seemed like too many chatters were really excited about that answer,

1668
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
so I didn't eliminate that.

1669
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Pure pressure.

1670
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
All right, fine.

1671
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
All right, pure pressure.

1672
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
All right, so here it is.

1673
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,000
With those five eliminated from the list, we are left with the following.

1674
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
X-Tango returns.

1675
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.

1676
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite.

1677
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:41,000
All-female game with zero misogyny.

1678
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I almost took that off the list too,

1679
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
only because I'm sorry, Dark Soccer.

1680
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
It's not going to happen this year.

1681
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
It's sad, but it's one of those things that's like it's a sad state of affairs,

1682
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,000
but let me put it this way.

1683
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I'm looking on Twitter.

1684
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Some people are at E3 and hanging out and all this stuff, and it's going on,

1685
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
and somebody has already overheard the phrase fucking F-A-G-G-O-T

1686
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
already out on the show floor walking around there,

1687
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
and I'm kind of like and these are the same people

1688
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
that then go post on the comment section of the websites.

1689
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Why do we need a gamer X, or why do we need a safe space,

1690
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
or why do we need this social movement, or what?

1691
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:23,000
But it's not that I disagree with that answer.

1692
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
It's that sadly, I just don't think it's going to happen.

1693
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Or as I like to say, not all men, but too damn many.

1694
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
All right, but it is still on the list, so we'll see.

1695
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Also, Microsoft's game shows return.

1696
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive.

1697
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Valve Trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer.

1698
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Red Dead Redemption cross Midnight Club.

1699
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,000
President Cat 2 prepare for Kittenfall.

1700
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
And Rockstar does a new Matrix game.

1701
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,000
So this is now in your hands, folks that are participating

1702
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,000
over at the Voice Geeks Network, live.vaganetwork.com.

1703
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I'm updating the list right now, and in just a couple seconds here,

1704
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
you will be able to answer.

1705
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,000
So you're going to click on your number one and your number two choices there

1706
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:09,000
as soon as the message pops up at the bottom of the screen, and there it is.

1707
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
You can click your number one and your number two and click the answer button.

1708
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
We will compile the list and read the answers a little later on in the show.

1709
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Looking at our chat room over at live.vaganetwork.com.

1710
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Some other answers that didn't make it.

1711
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,000
VidPower says, funny slash serious answer.

1712
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Rare working on some non-banjo-kazooie 3 game.

1713
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Let's see.

1714
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Kaijudo, though it does say Grand Theft Auto 6 with a female lead.

1715
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Could be interesting.

1716
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
So there you go.

1717
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Your turn to vote over at live.vaganetwork.com.

1718
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
We will see what the definitive list ends up being tonight.

1719
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
You know, to be fair, Kaijudo, they actually did have, it wasn't a lead,

1720
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:53,000
but they had a pretty decent secondary character in Grand Theft Auto 4

1721
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
that was a female.

1722
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,000
She was kind of like a drug boss, so that was kind of cool.

1723
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
All right, and Kaijudo in chat also says,

1724
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,000
can I take them all off the list and start a new one?

1725
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Sure, all you have to do is create your own blog.

1726
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
There you go.

1727
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
But as far as OLR list goes, nope, you're stuck with that.

1728
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
That's part of the scientific process.

1729
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
We don't always agree with science, Kaijudo, but we're stuck with it.

1730
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
So there you go.

1731
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Let's now take this opportunity to go over to the FUGL question of the week.

1732
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
You take Facebook, you take Google, you slam it together, you get FUGL.

1733
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:35,000
We're going to ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities,

1734
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
and we're going to read some of our favorite answers right now on the show.

1735
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,000
And tonight's FUGL question of the week is, of course, about E3

1736
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
and in line with what we just did.

1737
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Give us one prediction for one of the big press conferences,

1738
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Microsoft EA, Ubi, Sony, or Nintendo.

1739
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Try to be a little risky in your prediction,

1740
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:58,000
saying, I think Microsoft will talk about Halo isn't exactly going to impress everyone with your predicting ability.

1741
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
This is your last chance to make your big prediction,

1742
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
so you can be the guy or gal, of course, who says,

1743
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I called it, as people love to do on the internet later this week.

1744
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Because, you know, they're going to talk about Halo 5,

1745
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
and somebody's going to be like, totally called that.

1746
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Totally called Halo 5, because there's always that guy that's like, no shit.

1747
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
All right.

1748
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Guys, guys, guys.

1749
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
It's going to be a new call of duty.

1750
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Totally called it.

1751
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
All right.

1752
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Going to some of the answers over there on Facebook and Google,

1753
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
starting with Facebook.

1754
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Tiger Claw says, my prediction for Nintendo is going to be,

1755
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:32,000
they reveal a brand new Star Fox for the Wii U,

1756
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:37,000
fully utilizing the gamepad touch screen, reminiscent of Star Fox Command on the DS.

1757
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:42,000
So either that or a new Metroid game on Wii U that's a 2D side scroller.

1758
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
So there you go.

1759
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:48,000
And then likes to insert that same answer about Gabe Newell and Half Life 3

1760
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
that already got eliminated from the list earlier.

1761
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
All right.

1762
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Let's go to the next answer, which is from Rob H., who says,

1763
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
fingers crossed Rare comes back with a good perfect dark

1764
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:05,000
and an HD remake of Blastcore, free with Blastcore 2 on both 360 and Xbox One.

1765
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Oh, God.

1766
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
He is my new best friend.

1767
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Oh, if there was a new Blastcore,

1768
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I would buy whatever system it's on in a heartbeat,

1769
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
which I guess would be the one in this case.

1770
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Renee, our friend from Killer Queens from Outer Space,

1771
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
was on episode 13 of that show, so check it out.

1772
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Renee says Square Enix announces more updates on Kingdom Hearts 3,

1773
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
revealing new worlds from forgotten animated features,

1774
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
such as the Black Cauldron, Song of the South,

1775
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
you're right, Song of the South,

1776
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
and the unforgettable Donald Duck's World War II propaganda cartoon.

1777
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Wow.

1778
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
That's a pretty bold answer.

1779
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Well, the Black Cauldron is, they at least have Disney pins for that.

1780
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Fabrice A. replies on Facebook.

1781
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
No, wait, wait, wait.

1782
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
It's not something we're saying.

1783
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
You know what would be hilarious?

1784
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Is if they had, oh, God, what the hell was that movie?

1785
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Of course, now that I think it,

1786
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I can't remember the name of the franchise,

1787
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
but the Nicolas Cage movie,

1788
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:56,000
where he's going and searching for the artifacts and stuff like that.

1789
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
National Treasure.

1790
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,000
National Treasure.

1791
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Wasn't that a Disney movie?

1792
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Wouldn't that be hilarious to have that as like a world that they go to?

1793
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
A world of Nicolas Cage, absolutely.

1794
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Exactly.

1795
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
All right, Fabrice A. replies and says,

1796
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Microsoft announces another price drop for Xbox One and Xbox 360.

1797
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Sony announces Shenmue 3.

1798
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Wait a minute, that's quite flipping the script.

1799
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I always thought it was supposed to be Microsoft that was supposed to have that.

1800
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Burr replies and says,

1801
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Sony announces Home 2.0 for PlayStation 4.

1802
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I'd be curious to see if they would continue Home.

1803
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
You know, it certainly has its fans over on PlayStation 3.

1804
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
There's quite a vocal community over there.

1805
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
I'm kind of surprised they haven't done something on PlayStation 4 yet.

1806
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
So, curious to see what happens with that.

1807
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Fifth Dream replies and says,

1808
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
My predictions are Nintendo announces the long-awaited Pokemon MMO.

1809
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Sony gives a release date for Project Morpheus, which arrives with the new VR Home.

1810
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Microsoft announces Kinect 3.0, which looks suspiciously like a Power Glove.

1811
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,000
And Final Fantasy XV gets a surprise release at the end of the week.

1812
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Well, that's a little bit of a stretch, but wouldn't it be fun?

1813
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Andy R. replies and says,

1814
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Sega breaks back into the console biz with a new system available next Tuesday.

1815
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Would be a very Sega thing to do.

1816
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Dark Charger replies,

1817
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Nintendo will finally adopt a subscription model for their classic games.

1818
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Thank you, I like that answer.

1819
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Rageinator says,

1820
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Gabe Newell will walk on stage with a one last thing line,

1821
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
rips open a jacket to reveal a t-shirt with a 3 on it,

1822
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
then spikes the microphone, not simply drops it.

1823
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Awesome Unicorn says,

1824
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:29,000
I really don't care what the announcement is, but I just want someone to pull a Beyonce,

1825
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
and Nintendo has shown a willingness to do that with their lesser titles,

1826
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,000
such as the surprise Inazuma 11 release.

1827
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Can you imagine the insanity and sheer excitement of an announcement

1828
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,000
that Super Smash Bros. for the 3DS will be available on the eShop,

1829
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
following their digital event?

1830
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Again, that's really wishful thinking,

1831
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:49,000
but I think you hit the nail on the head with the whole surprise,

1832
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,000
under the radar title, anything's possible.

1833
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Something like Mario Maker is a prime candidate.

1834
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
It's not going to be on the eShop during the event.

1835
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,000
If anything, I'm guessing at this point since we got a July announcement already

1836
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:07,000
of the Wii Sports Club thing, it's going to be August.

1837
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
And Hitstun lastly on Facebook says,

1838
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Nintendo responds to fan feedback by bringing back Mario Kart 64's Block Fort

1839
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
in Smash Bros. Trolls.

1840
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I like that answer.

1841
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,000
And going over to Google Plus and reading some of the answers over there.

1842
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Why don't I see the answers over here?

1843
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Hello, Google. Come in, Google.

1844
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Where are my answers?

1845
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Oh, there they are. Way down there. Hi.

1846
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Let's get to the comments on this one.

1847
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Colin M. replies and says,

1848
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Nintendo announces a new minigame collection for the Wii U.

1849
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Possible Mario Party U.

1850
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Well, Colin, with all due respect, that's a safe answer.

1851
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,000
A minigame collection on the Wii U? You don't say.

1852
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
All right, at least he throws a possible title out there.

1853
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
We'll see. More Mario possibly.

1854
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
ActDeft replies and says,

1855
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Nintendo adds streaming to the Wii U.

1856
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Probably not happening, but wouldn't it be awesome?

1857
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
And when Nintendo's new revenue sharing thing for YouTube,

1858
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
it just might happen.

1859
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I don't think that box is powerful enough,

1860
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
but you never know. You never know.

1861
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:14,000
It may not do HD, but maybe a virtual console,

1862
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:17,000
like a lounge where you can watch other people play virtual console games.

1863
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
They could do their own thing with it.

1864
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
They wouldn't necessarily have to adopt Twitch. Why not?

1865
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:25,000
They could backport replays, highlights into every other game.

1866
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,000
If Xbox 360's Game Room technology allowed for the recording

1867
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
of playthroughs of classic video games,

1868
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
they could do it with Nintendo.

1869
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:38,000
It would take a clever work around for the lower technology.

1870
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Even the 360 was more powerful than the Wii U.

1871
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,000
It would take the bad letter E for Nintendo.

1872
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
That E word being effort, and they don't do it.

1873
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,000
All right, sorry, redertainment last but not least,

1874
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
with The Question Knight saying,

1875
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:55,000
With the recent moves by Microsoft to make a previously premium app available to all

1876
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
without needing a gold subscription,

1877
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Microsoft will need to announce something to make being a paid subscriber to Xbox Live worthwhile.

1878
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
That something is what I think Microsoft will announce.

1879
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
I don't quite know what that will be,

1880
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:09,000
but my gut is telling me something involving Comcast, Time Warner, and or DirecTV.

1881
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Could you possibly be meaning their own channel?

1882
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Because it seems to be the direction we're heading in right now, but we'll see.

1883
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
All right, that does it for the Google Question of the Week.

1884
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio,

1885
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,000
or on Google Plus, google.com slash plus, orange launch radio, all one word.

1886
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,000
We still have some more gaming news for you all, so let's get to it. Loki.

1887
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:33,000
All right, so let's see, Mario Kart did pretty well.

1888
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,000
At launch, it sold over 1 million units, 1.2 million during its debut week,

1889
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:44,000
and making that the fastest selling Wii U game to date.

1890
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
So, of course, you know, Reggie's pretty excited about that.

1891
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,000
They said, you know, the early response of Mario Kart 8 demonstrates that the best days for Wii U are still ahead.

1892
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:58,000
This year's E3 is just days away, and it will be all about future games for Nintendo platforms.

1893
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,000
No shit! It's going to be about future games for Nintendo platforms?

1894
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I thought they were going to be talking about the Xbox!

1895
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:09,000
That's the dumbest fucking statement he could make, but whatever.

1896
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Hooray for Mario Kart 8.

1897
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:19,000
By the way, this was the article that may have gotten me into a little bit of trouble on Twitter this week.

1898
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I might have had a big ass sassy mouth, and I might have written a tweet that my buddy Godfrey over at Gamertag Radio retweeted,

1899
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:33,000
and somebody over at Polygon might have seen it and had an issue with something my sassy ass mouth had to say.

1900
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:41,000
And I basically said something to the effect of, you know, well, Mario Kart 8 sells 1.2 million in its first weekend,

1901
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
which is what Polygon predicted it would sell in its entire lifespan.

1902
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Way to go, games analyst! Thumbs up emoji.

1903
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:52,000
And I got a little reply from a guy that works at Polygon.

1904
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:56,000
In fact, I think he's kind of a high-up mucky-mup over there, Ben Kucera.

1905
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,000
And he basically replied saying, should I bring up the conversation here?

1906
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Well, like I say, my policy on analysts and why I don't really like to talk about analysts on the show,

1907
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
you can't spell analysts without anal.

1908
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I just, I'm the, if I'm going to be analyzing stuff, I'm going to do it my own way.

1909
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:19,000
I'm not going to, you know, quote some dude that's got, you know, well, see,

1910
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,000
at least this guy has a little bit of experience in the industry,

1911
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,000
not necessarily someone that just crunches numbers all day long.

1912
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
So, all right, I'm trying to bring up the conversation I had.

1913
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
So here's the tweet that started off.

1914
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I put, so, Mario Kart 8 sold in a weekend what Polygon predicted it would sell in a lifetime, right?

1915
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Got to love games analyst, thumbs up.

1916
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,000
And that got, by the way, seven retweets and ten favorites.

1917
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:47,000
So Ben Kucera replies and says, it still needs to sell over four million more units

1918
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:52,000
or nearly a one-to-one ratio with a tiny Wii U install base to prove the point.

1919
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Everyone is happy the game is a hit,

1920
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,000
but it's a long ways from beating the second worst selling title in the series.

1921
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:05,000
At least try to understand what you're criticizing before you start the smack talk colon P.

1922
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:09,000
And I'm like, oh, it's going to be like, oh, you're going to come at me like that?

1923
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Back rolls? Okay.

1924
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I'm going to start calling you crazy eyes, I hope you know.

1925
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,000
My sassy mouth might have replied,

1926
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
because I was like, well, he was kind enough to let me know his thoughts,

1927
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
so maybe I should reply in kind.

1928
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:28,000
So I wrote back and I said, assuming Wii U install base doesn't grow significantly this holiday.

1929
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Admittedly, it's an uphill climb,

1930
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:35,000
but I think what was overlooked in the original analysis was Wii U adopter makeup.

1931
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,000
It's small, yes, but fiercely Nintendo loyal.

1932
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:42,000
To say 20% here means 20% here didn't turn out to be accurate,

1933
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,000
but we will see when and if the install base grows.

1934
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
And that's when he wrote that tweet that said at least know what you're criticizing.

1935
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,000
And I wrote back and I said, here is what I'm criticizing.

1936
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
I realized the article's main point was lowest selling,

1937
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,000
but, and I put a little screen cap there of where they showed,

1938
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Mario Kart 8 Wii was going to sell 1.2 million units overall.

1939
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:07,000
And I said, in this internet ADD reading age, these pictures can truly wield many words.

1940
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:11,000
And then I said, for what it's worth, I think your site overall is typically better balanced.

1941
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
There's other sites that sensationalize way worse.

1942
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I'd never give them attention by calling them out on Twitter, which is true.

1943
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,000
But, okay, Shane's desperate to say something on this.

1944
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
What'd you want to say on this, Shane?

1945
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,000
All right. Yes, Shane, what?

1946
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
I wanted to say first, I think Polygon has always been bad ever since they launched

1947
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:35,000
and gave themselves all that media hype about, look at the behind the scenes crap that we're doing.

1948
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Yeah, it was a little silly, but it was years ago, to be fair.

1949
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
And Bobby can't ban me from talking right now,

1950
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:45,000
so I would say Polygon is more sensationalist than Kotaku lately.

1951
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And Kotaku's a lot more readable than Polygon has been in a while.

1952
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Interesting. All right.

1953
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,000
I don't know. I don't visit that website.

1954
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:00,000
And I don't know how much longer I'll visit the other if that continues to be the trend.

1955
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:04,000
I did not get a reply to my little retort, just saying.

1956
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Little thing there.

1957
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:09,000
All right. Anyway, did you get all of your stories out, Loki?

1958
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
No. I was also going to mention that Watchdog sold 4 million copies.

1959
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:20,000
So that did pretty well, considering that it was slightly delayed from when they originally thought it would be out.

1960
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:25,000
It's interesting, because going back to the conversation we were having about exactly those same two games last weekend,

1961
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:31,000
you made the point that you see a lot more Mario Kart media than you've been seeing Watchdog's media.

1962
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Call it selective bias, and that may be the case, but like...

1963
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Yeah, I think that's the case.

1964
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:41,000
In the week and a half that we are now in for both of those games' release,

1965
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I've seen a fair amount of trailers, a lot of online coordination,

1966
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:50,000
a lot of Twitter and other coordination to play games online, and a lot of stuff for Mario Kart.

1967
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I have seen three Watchdog spoofs, one by Mega64, another...

1968
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:06,000
No, I've seen one. I'm actually... I think I'm confusing it for like a picture.

1969
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Oh no, there was somebody that I follow that has a game deconstruction talking channel on Blip.

1970
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
He might still be on YouTube.

1971
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:24,000
He was deconstructing that apparently one of the Watchdog missions is you have to kill someone in prison that knows who you are by avoiding the guards.

1972
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Except for the fact that the prisoner was scheduled to be executed anyways. Why not just let things run its course?

1973
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:34,000
So I was seeing a lot of deconstructions and spoofs about the content of Watchdogs,

1974
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:39,000
and there may be a third example in there, I don't remember what it is, but those two chiefly I can remember right now,

1975
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:45,000
and I see a lot of fun, hey this game is fun, let's fucking play it, coming out of Mario Kart.

1976
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Yeah, it's gaining a lot of steam, and look, I totally get the idea that the game,

1977
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,000
if the Wii U doesn't get a bigger install base, then that game isn't going to sell more copies.

1978
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
I totally get that, because there isn't much of an install base for the Wii U,

1979
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,000
but I don't think it was fair to say because it sold 20% here, it's going to sell 20% here,

1980
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:11,000
because that's assuming that those people that bought the system are exact same proportional make-up of the people that bought the system over here.

1981
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
So that was my issue with that whole thing. Anyway.

1982
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Moving on, let's talk about, speaking of Nintendo, I kind of referenced this briefly earlier in the show,

1983
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:26,000
but I'm sure a lot of you guys heard that Satoru Iwata is actually not going to be at E3 this next week.

1984
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:31,000
He will not be making the show, which, you know, usually he'd be in behind closed doors meetings anyway, doing interviews.

1985
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,000
It would be very hard to catch him out on the show floor, very rare.

1986
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:39,000
But his physician has actually advised him to not travel overseas.

1987
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Now, this won't really have a big impact anyway, because again, he was really only there for meetings and interviews anyway,

1988
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:53,000
and he can tape appearances in Japan for this Nintendo Direct thing that they're doing anyway, so it just kind of works out.

1989
02:20:53,000 --> 02:21:00,000
But regardless, there's certainly that area of mystique of, oh, he's sick enough to not be traveling overseas.

1990
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Hopefully this is just one of those abundance of caution sort of things, and there isn't something really wrong,

1991
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,000
because that would be a real bummer to hear that Iwata's sick or something.

1992
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Sick enough to not be a sardine for 14 hours is not necessarily very sick.

1993
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:17,000
You could have an ear infection, the flight would be fucking miserable, and you would skip it.

1994
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Yeah. So, you know, again, hopefully this is just a move out of an abundance of caution.

1995
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,000
E3 can be really, I mean, it can really wear down your immune system and stuff, too.

1996
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Just, you know, the constant on-the-go stuff, so, you know.

1997
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Con plague.

1998
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Yeah, exactly. So, I can see why he'd want to stay home if the doctor, you know, tells him to.

1999
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I'll probably get sick from the damn thing, I always do, but I'll take my vitamin C supplements just in case.

2000
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

2001
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I have some stuff. Actually, what I have is a system that doesn't want to help me today.

2002
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:53,000
But this is something really good, and this is something that affects us.

2003
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Because we're going to be there, Rob.

2004
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
We are.

2005
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
We're going to GamerX.

2006
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Woohoo!

2007
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:02,000
And it looks like that there will be major game publishers who are showing some support.

2008
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Well, Major is kind of like, oh yeah, okay, I guess you're kind of major.

2009
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:14,000
But they are giving support to the convention, so is Ubisoft and NIS America.

2010
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:19,000
So they will be there for the second and last GamerX.

2011
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:27,000
So I think that that's going to be good that we're seeing, you know, I wish that we would have enough more support.

2012
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:32,000
I mean, because we have BioWare there, IndieCade, Cards Against Humanity, a bunch of others.

2013
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I wish that we had enough to see enough support to go for another con.

2014
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Yeah, I hope they'll be convinced to do a third year.

2015
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,000
But, you know, we're going to go, we're going to have fun, and we'll party like it is the last one.

2016
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I had a great time last year, we're going to have a good time this year.

2017
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
There's going to be a panel.

2018
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
The panel's going to be happening Saturday at 2 o'clock.

2019
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Podcast Cross Zone Returns for its second panel.

2020
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
We're going to do it a little differently this time.

2021
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:58,000
And DarkSakura, you are offered a spot up on the panel if you'd like to speak on it.

2022
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,000
I said yes.

2023
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Okay, I couldn't remember if you said yes or not, so I didn't want to push you.

2024
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:06,000
No, I'm just totally not going to go, and I'm just going to sit in the back and heckle and throw shit.

2025
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Well good, the good news is we made room for you on the panel, so you're going to be up there.

2026
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I'll be there.

2027
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
I'll be good, and we're going to have a lot of other guest speakers up there too, so this will be fun.

2028
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
And then folks in the audience as well.

2029
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
We need to discuss cosplay, Rob.

2030
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Oh boy, I need to discuss losing 25 pounds, but yes.

2031
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,000
No, no, no, no, no.

2032
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Oh come on, Rob, if a guy who is a foot shorter than you and probably three times your weight can cosplay Sailor Moon, you can cosplay anything.

2033
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
That's right.

2034
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,000
If we can have Manfay, you can cosplay anything.

2035
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Well that makes me feel better.

2036
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Alright, let's go over to Loki.

2037
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Alright, so this is kind of goofy, but Devolver Digital is on, let's see, they're actually planning on localizing Pigeon Dating Sim.

2038
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Hataful Boyfriend?

2039
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Yes they are.

2040
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Oh my god, that game is the best.

2041
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,000
They are localizing Hataful Boyfriend.

2042
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Even though it's already been done.

2043
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:11,000
They have a fantastic press release to go along with that, you know, talking about, you know, Love is for the Birds, you know, the NEST hardcore pigeon dating sim for fans everywhere.

2044
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Basically, you know, they were talking about how there's, what was it, a lot of games based on first person shooters and stuff and they thought that the demographic of semi-realistic pigeon dating simulations are the next great frontier in video games.

2045
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
I love their humor.

2046
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
But yeah, they're going to be working on that.

2047
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,000
So it's going to be available, playable at E3 by appointment only.

2048
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:43,000
And it's going to launch during the summer on PC, Mac, via Steam, Good Old Games, Humble and other digital storefronts.

2049
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Shit, we need to hit Devolver Digital as soon as we get into the LACC.

2050
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Continuing on, games that will appear in America, will appear in general, despite the fact that the dating sim had been done previously but is getting localized.

2051
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Shovel Knight was kickstarted last year, a couple months, a few more months than just last year.

2052
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:13,000
It was originally slated for just a $75,000, it originally wanted $75,000, it wound up with $300,000.

2053
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:27,000
The Yacht Club Games has confirmed by Backer News Release, which is public so everybody sees it anyways, that the 8-bit inspired adventure game Shovel Knight will be here on June 26th.

2054
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Get ready for the greatest 8-bit inspired adventure game to sweep you off your feet and deliver pure fun directly to your soul with shovels.

2055
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I'm looking forward to checking it out, it looks so cute.

2056
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Did you back it? I backed it.

2057
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
I did not back it.

2058
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I actually still have yet to back a kickstarter.

2059
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:49,000
You know what, I actually have another kickstarter game I just got and I haven't played it yet, that Mung to Sleep.

2060
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:54,000
That's that one that's the horror game that's done from the perspective of a two year old.

2061
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Alright, well, let's take this opportunity to get some listener feedback in a segment we do every week here where you guys can participate with the show by emailing us to our mailbag.

2062
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is our email bag.

2063
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Yeah, do it.

2064
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:15,000
And Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag head first and find an email or four or five.

2065
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
I dipped a toe in.

2066
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,000
You dipped a toe in?

2067
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,000
There were only two so I dipped a toe in.

2068
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Just two? Alright.

2069
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
And my toe has been freshly washed today.

2070
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Then two emails to read tonight on the show.

2071
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us your e3 thoughts.

2072
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,000
My toe smell of lemongrass.

2073
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Hello again, OLR gang.

2074
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:36,000
I very much agree that Mario Kart 8 could be a tipping point for gamers to jump in on the Wii U.

2075
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I have not purchased any of the next gen consoles, mainly because of the we'll fuck you over less than the other guy mentality that Sony and Microsoft assumed initially.

2076
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:51,000
However, Nintendo is starting to build game steam with their newer releases and they may be the winner of my next paycheck.

2077
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
That's funny.

2078
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
The specifics about the pod mentioned last week.

2079
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Our show is called The Village Idiots.

2080
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,000
It can be found on iTunes, Stitcher or at villagepodcast.bestpro.com.

2081
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Well, hello Village Idiot Matt.

2082
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Nice to make the connection.

2083
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:06,000
There's the connection.

2084
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:11,000
That's the guy I felt bad last week because I'm all like, you could have given yourself a promotion.

2085
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
So he did email it back and give a promotion.

2086
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,000
That's great.

2087
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:19,000
We also host a show on the same RSS feed called Popcorn and Profanity, which is a film pod.

2088
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:27,000
All updates on our show can be found on our homepage villageidiotspodcast.blogspot.com or twitter at villagepodcast.

2089
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:31,000
We should be getting more content up soon, but I am in the process of beginning a new job.

2090
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Nursing!

2091
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Good.

2092
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
So forgive us if it takes a little time.

2093
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
You know what?

2094
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Nursing is a little bit more important than podcasting.

2095
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
So, um...

2096
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Slightly. Only a slight bit though.

2097
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Nurse away.

2098
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Gamers unite.

2099
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Thanks again and keep up the good work.

2100
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Matt, Raging Janitor.

2101
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I like that name Popcorn and Profanity because that's definitely my living room when watching a movie.

2102
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:58,000
And, um, I'm actually going to go ahead and list locations since it's an email.

2103
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Fargo, North Dakota.

2104
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Oh, okay.

2105
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:05,000
I think you were the first person from North Dakota I've ever conversed with in any form in my life.

2106
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:06,000
There you go.

2107
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,000
I'm serious.

2108
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Alright.

2109
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Which is kind of sad.

2110
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
I want to go there someday.

2111
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Worldwide show.

2112
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Yeah.

2113
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,000
There's listeners everywhere at Orange Lawns Radio, even North Dakota.

2114
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
It proves that there are, you know, when we get Delaware that'll be different.

2115
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Or Iowa.

2116
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
We've had Iowa, haven't we?

2117
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,000
We've had Iowa.

2118
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Hi, Iowa people.

2119
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Heart.

2120
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Shout out.

2121
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Iowa in the house.

2122
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
I would like to find fellow people that live in Alabama and not, you know...

2123
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
You've already met some of those though.

2124
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:37,000
No, I was in Louisiana and in Florida, but I've only met like one person in Alabama and I think he moved.

2125
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Oh.

2126
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
One of the Florida people now is a coworker.

2127
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Okay.

2128
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
How funny.

2129
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
At Locat.

2130
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Only is an at-home locatter.

2131
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Gotcha.

2132
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
So funny.

2133
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,000
What's up, Orange Lounge guys and gal?

2134
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Thank you.

2135
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Black Wolf reminding us the Rob D was in Iowa.

2136
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I met him at Anime Central years ago.

2137
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I love the Rob D.

2138
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,000
He's a nice boy.

2139
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Where is he these days?

2140
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Go on.

2141
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
He was a nice boy.

2142
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:06,000
I do believe it was the Rob D who delivered...

2143
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Is that who I got?

2144
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
No.

2145
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
I'm going to have to go back and recheck this.

2146
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Okay.

2147
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
But I will say this.

2148
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
He had the bomb radio voice.

2149
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
He had a great, like Jason does, he has a great radio voice.

2150
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,000
And he used to do that show on all games about the history.

2151
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
It was like this day in gaming.

2152
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
T-dig.

2153
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,000
That was it.

2154
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
It was a fun little show.

2155
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Well, may I continue with the last and second and only other email?

2156
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
All right.

2157
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
What's up, Orange Lounge guys and gal?

2158
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Thank you for recognizing me.

2159
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I feel like you guys are my Monday morning saviors.

2160
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:41,000
So much work to do on Mondays and your gaming nonsense and news keep me smiling all day.

2161
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Aw, shucks.

2162
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
We're a big oxymoron.

2163
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:49,000
One, I would love an explanation on Jamie's crazy love of tacos.

2164
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Never caught the history on that one.

2165
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Plus I have some recipes to share if she's interested.

2166
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Okay.

2167
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
My taco thing is actually burrito love.

2168
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Okay.

2169
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I've been lying to me all these years.

2170
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Fuck yeah.

2171
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Okay.

2172
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Wait, wait, wait.

2173
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I really, really love tacos because when I finally got...

2174
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
After being in California for years and years,

2175
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I finally got introduced to real tacos going to a little taqueria across the street from where I worked.

2176
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
And I'm like, they're not folded.

2177
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:14,000
These are fucking good.

2178
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
They're loaded with yummies.

2179
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Taco Tuesday.

2180
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
And that's where Taco Tuesday was born.

2181
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Which I still don't understand how we're supposed to answer the question.

2182
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Like, what's so great about a taco?

2183
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Have you had one?

2184
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Like, it's a taco.

2185
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:36,000
It's a slightly sweet corn tortilla with delicious meats of any variety you could think of.

2186
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
And the place that I would go to even had tongue tacos.

2187
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Ew.

2188
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Rob tongue is meat muscle.

2189
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,000
It's muscle.

2190
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
You shave the bumpy bits off it, it tastes like meat.

2191
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I don't know when that happened.

2192
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,000
I was about to say something and out came a burp.

2193
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
I'm sorry.

2194
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
I'm sorry, listeners.

2195
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
That's what happens when you have too many tacos.

2196
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,000
No, that comes out the other end.

2197
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
But my true love...

2198
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
What?

2199
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
You nasty.

2200
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
So? You got it wrong.

2201
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
This show. This show.

2202
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:15,000
No, seriously. I just was about to open my mouth to retort something.

2203
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Which I forgot what my retort was.

2204
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
My retort was Choco Taco. That was my retort.

2205
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Choco Tacos are pretty damn good.

2206
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:24,000
But never ever ever put marshmallows on anything ever.

2207
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Anyway, my true love is burritos.

2208
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Because burritos are like...

2209
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Especially carne asada with potato and cheese.

2210
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Just like that. Or fish or fish burrito.

2211
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
I love fish tacos too.

2212
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Because I go that way.

2213
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I love tacos, really.

2214
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Tacos, you can hold them in.

2215
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
I discovered a new love and I hate fast food.

2216
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:52,000
But oh my god, I love the crispy shrimp things from Del Taco.

2217
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I hope our emailer is happy with this turn of events here.

2218
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Because I literally can't even right now.

2219
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Tacos are...

2220
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Tacos are life.

2221
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
How can you deal with the four of us in this room then?

2222
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:09,000
It's a job.

2223
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Because you literally can't even...

2224
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Weren't you going somewhere?

2225
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:16,000
See, Agdeft agrees with me.

2226
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:19,000
And SSJ100Matt agrees that carnitas are good too.

2227
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:23,000
I like it that I bring up shrimp.

2228
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
And SSJ100Matt brings up carnitas.

2229
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
We're like the trafiest Jews that ever traffed.

2230
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Taco Lounge Radio. Live at VOG Network.

2231
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Every Sunday night at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern.

2232
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I just...

2233
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I can't.

2234
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Two, I'm a huge...

2235
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Well, if you can't, I already done can't.

2236
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
So, get a new contraction.

2237
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Bitch, no.

2238
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Hearts.

2239
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Two, I'm a huge comic books collecting nerd and I've taken plenty of crap for it.

2240
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:55,000
What were the things that you did or still do that people called you nerd for besides gaming?

2241
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Comics.

2242
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:04,000
I had the entire run of like the 80s through 90s Wolverine all up until before I moved out here.

2243
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Like, from the mid 80s up through the late 90s.

2244
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:12,000
And then I gave them to some guy because I knew he'd like them and I couldn't take them with me.

2245
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
This show?

2246
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
I needed Brockie.

2247
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
You think I'm kidding?

2248
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
We've had this show for like 12 years.

2249
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:24,000
This show has been on a long time even before I was seeing Alan.

2250
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:27,000
And so I would go out on dates with guys and, you know, so what do you do for fun?

2251
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Well, I have a long running podcast on the internet about video games.

2252
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Oh, cool.

2253
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
I don't play games.

2254
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
And then turns out...

2255
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
I'm gonna walk this way.

2256
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Turns out they do play games, just not video games.

2257
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
If you know what I mean.

2258
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I also larped in college the first time.

2259
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:57,000
My friend Ashley and I used to sit in study hall and create our own tabletop RPG.

2260
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Drawing maps and everything.

2261
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
It was fantastic.

2262
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Loki, is there something nerdy you still do that you get made fun for?

2263
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,000
I mean, your wife kind of teases you about everything, doesn't she?

2264
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Yeah, pretty much everything.

2265
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
I had one other.

2266
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:15,000
My friend Courtney and I would sit and quote the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies.

2267
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Verbatim.

2268
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Ever since... We did this all the way through middle school.

2269
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:21,000
That's pretty nerdy.

2270
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:24,000
And then she went to a different high school than I did, but we did them for part of the sole reason,

2271
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,000
because this other girl named Catherine, who lived around the corner from my house,

2272
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,000
and her mom and my mom were friends.

2273
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:37,000
She used to talk with her mouth full of food and it was gross, so we just started quoting turtle movies.

2274
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:41,000
It was awesome. I still have those movies memorized, I swear.

2275
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Alright, rest of the email.

2276
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Fuck.

2277
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
I was going to see if you could remember any of the movie, but then I realized it's really a road I don't want to go down.

2278
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Question.

2279
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Do you like penicillin on your pizza?

2280
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Read the rest of the email.

2281
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
You guys are freaking sweet. Keep the show coming.

2282
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:05,000
P.S. Thanks for playing my demo track last week while answering the question.

2283
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I know you didn't have to. Muchas gracias.

2284
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:11,000
And I'm not doing it for other people, because I don't want to open the floodgates.

2285
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
You play my song, play my song. No.

2286
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,000
DJ, play my song now.

2287
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
You heard that song?

2288
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
He gets to do it because he thought of it first.

2289
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Alright, unless you want to do a new intro.

2290
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:28,000
I'm not doing a redub of the turtle movies in my voice, because I can't do the New York-y accent.

2291
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Unless I did it like an old Jewish man.

2292
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
You could be Splinter.

2293
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Imagine Splinter instead of having his fake Kevin-class Japanese accent.

2294
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:46,000
You know? Sound like an old Hasidic man from prom heights.

2295
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Mel Brooks, basically.

2296
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
No. No, no, no. Of course.

2297
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Alright. Is that it for emails?

2298
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Chevy Nova?

2299
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Alright, there it is. That's it for the email.

2300
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,000
You get it!

2301
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Participate at orangelaungerator.com is the place to send your emails.

2302
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Alright, I am closing up the listless votes right after this segment, so if you haven't voted,

2303
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:13,000
log into the site right now and vote listless, or you are screwed and you don't get to participate.

2304
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:19,000
So here it is. The FUs of the week time. Why? Because tradition?

2305
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Because fuck.

2306
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Fuck you to act deft for sending me a picture of a chibi Deadpool riding a pig screaming tacos.

2307
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Oh my god, that sounds amazing.

2308
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
I want this shirt now.

2309
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,000
What?

2310
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:51,000
I want this shirt with every fiber of my being, because he also kind of looks like Gur.

2311
02:36:51,000 --> 02:37:00,000
That's exactly Gur. The whole thing is it's a parody of Gur writing, because he did the thing where he yelled tacos.

2312
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
I love tacos.

2313
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:08,000
But, but, but, I will, I'm going to correct the entire Deadpool fandom.

2314
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
These are two fuck yous.

2315
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Number one, Deadpool's not a mutant. In the comics, Deadpool's not a mutant.

2316
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Number two, Deadpool actually does not like chimichangas. He just likes the word.

2317
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:23,000
That had been proven in an issue of Cable and Deadpool.

2318
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Well, it's important.

2319
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:27,000
When he comes by, he's saying chimichanga, chimichanga, and she's like, what would you like for dinner?

2320
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Enchiladas.

2321
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Because he doesn't actually like chimichangas, so.

2322
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
I know way too much about comics.

2323
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
There were Deadpool cosplayers at Phantom Man. They were really good.

2324
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:44,000
They should totally have a 90's sitcom show called Cable and Deadpool.

2325
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Well, they were sort of like an old married couple, kinda, you know, in the comic.

2326
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
They even made jokes about it.

2327
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:58,000
However, what I might do, I'm thinking about doing this, Rob, for the convention if I can't make another cosplay.

2328
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I'm thinking about making a head pool.

2329
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Do you know what head pool is?

2330
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,000
No.

2331
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
The undead head of Deadpool from another dimension.

2332
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
This is a long FU segment.

2333
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:10,000
FU to people who get their comic facts wrong.

2334
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Alright, Jason, you're FU of the week.

2335
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:18,000
FU to California for having the bump strips on the inside of your lane and not on the line or over.

2336
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:21,000
It's just fucking annoying.

2337
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
There's a lot of weird shit in this state, isn't there?

2338
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
65 mile an hour speed limit on the highway.

2339
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
I think some of them are also wake up bumps.

2340
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Yeah, but they're not supposed to be inside the lane.

2341
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
You'll get to see 70 on the way to LA tomorrow.

2342
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:38,000
I have already driven that once before. Twice before. Possibly thrice before.

2343
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Oh fine.

2344
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Tigerclaw, I am going to correct you then. A mutate is not someone who has been experimented on by using mutant DNA.

2345
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:48,000
A mutate is a person who has just been mutated post birth.

2346
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Nine o'clock, people. Nine o'clock.

2347
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Marvel universe, go catch up.

2348
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
And FU to 100 degree weather.

2349
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Lowkey.

2350
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Yeah, just FU to the weather. It's too fucking hot.

2351
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
I don't want to go outside.

2352
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:02,000
My FU of the week goes to the migraine I had last night that was killer.

2353
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Oh my god, it was so awful.

2354
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:07,000
I was watching Orange is the New Black because that show was amazing.

2355
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:11,000
And like halfway through the second episode, I started getting this massive headache.

2356
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,000
And I think I might have just OD'd on meat.

2357
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:17,000
And the reason why I say that, get your minds out of the gutter.

2358
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:21,000
The reason why I say that, we went to this, Flaco Jones had a little birthday thing over the weekend.

2359
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,000
And we went to this Korean barbecue place. It's not far from where I live.

2360
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:28,000
And it's really good, but I ate a lot of meat, you guys.

2361
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:31,000
A lot. Because it's all you can eat and you just put it on the grill.

2362
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:34,000
You grill it yourself because I guess that's how it's cheap.

2363
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
And I ate a lot of meat.

2364
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:39,000
I think I gave myself a meat migraine.

2365
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:43,000
FU to Rob. We're talking about a lot of food because I have had no appetite for the last week.

2366
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Is it a meat grain?

2367
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
A meat grain, yes it was.

2368
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,000
I've never been to Korean barbecue.

2369
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
You should go somewhere. It was fun.

2370
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,000
I've never been.

2371
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,000
You guys will have an OLR date.

2372
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Alright. It's time to figure out who won List List, you guys.

2373
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:01,000
It's over. It's done. We're wrapping it up here.

2374
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:10,000
List List tonight is time to figure out what is the thing you are most looking forward to at E3 2014.

2375
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:13,000
It's time to reveal the definitive list.

2376
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Here it is, your top three answers.

2377
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:21,000
In a tie for third place. We have a tie for third place tonight.

2378
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:25,000
A tie for third place, Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.

2379
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:31,000
And an all female game with zero misogyny.

2380
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Go you.

2381
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Go feminism.

2382
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Alright. In second, Well Feminism got third place tonight. Let's see.

2383
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Hey, this is better than what we normally get.

2384
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I feel bad laughing at that. That was actually a really good singer, actually.

2385
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
It's fucking true.

2386
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
It's sad, but alright.

2387
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Alright, here it is. Your number two answer.

2388
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:58,000
The definitive list. So again, number three, Mighty No. 9 playable and all female game with zero misogyny ties.

2389
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Number two, Phantasy Star Online 2 is a Wii U exclusive.

2390
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Dun, dun, dun. Even though it's already on PC.

2391
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Loki's rolling his eyes really far back in his head. What?

2392
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Whatever, I just don't think it's going to happen.

2393
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:23,000
And the number one answer tonight, Valve Trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer.

2394
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:24,000
That would be fantastic.

2395
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Number one and number two. What, what, what, what?

2396
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:32,000
You listening, Bobby? I got number one and number two this year.

2397
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:36,000
That would piss off so many people. It would be fantastic.

2398
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I think it would be hilarious and I would actually rather another Portal than another Half-Life, but that's me.

2399
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Because I actually liked Portal better than Half-Life.

2400
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,000
If you guys don't believe me, it's not making it up, guys. It's right there. There it is.

2401
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,000
I personally like Portal better than the rest of Half-Life.

2402
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:54,000
It announced third sequels for all their other franchises except for Half-Life.

2403
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Everything else gets a third game. Fuck Half-Life.

2404
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:03,000
I would have thought that President Cat 2 Prepare for Kittenfall would have topped the list for sure, to be fair, Loki.

2405
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
It just, fourth place. It just missed it.

2406
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:06,000
That's all right.

2407
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:07,000
I was a little surprised there. All right.

2408
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Technically fifth because there was a tie for third.

2409
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Oh yeah.

2410
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:15,000
If you to myself are signing myself up to putting listless in the video because god damn it, it's time consuming.

2411
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Sorry.

2412
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Oh god, this is the worst week for that too.

2413
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:18,000
We have 15 answers.

2414
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Oh shit.

2415
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Have fun. Good luck.

2416
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,000
All right.

2417
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Oh no.

2418
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Masochist much?

2419
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Maybe I'll just skip it this week. All right, there it is.

2420
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Let's do a couple more stories then we're going to open up the phone lines quickly.

2421
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:34,000
We don't have a whole lot of time for calls because we're running a little long.

2422
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
We're past 9 o'clock already so let's get to it. Loki.

2423
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:40,000
All right, lots of apps are coming to the Xbox One and Xbox 360.

2424
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Some of the new stuff that's going to be happening.

2425
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Comedy Central is getting an app on Xbox One.

2426
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Crunchyroll is coming to Xbox One in several territories.

2427
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:55,000
FX Now is that like an FX thing? That'd be pretty cool.

2428
02:42:55,000 --> 02:43:04,000
MTV, K-Drama, Max Dome, MLG, Movieplex, iHeartRadio, HBO Go, which is pretty big.

2429
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
GoPro.

2430
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:12,000
I know Twitter is one of them.

2431
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:18,000
You'd think that they would have had it by now but Twitter is coming to Xbox One as well.

2432
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Tune in.

2433
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Sci-fi Now.

2434
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Sky Online.

2435
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Sky News.

2436
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Yeah.

2437
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:28,000
FX Now should be live TV or on-demand TV for the FX network, right?

2438
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Like what Archer is on and what not?

2439
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:36,000
I'm thinking that would be pretty cool because I do need to catch up on some Archer so that would be nice.

2440
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:39,000
The only show I actually know that's on that network.

2441
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:42,000
So yeah, lots of apps coming later this year.

2442
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:49,000
And if you haven't been heard yet, the apps that did require the paywall, I believe that paywall is now gone.

2443
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:52,000
So they are available now if you have Xbox Live Silver.

2444
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:56,000
So you can watch Netflix without having to pay an extra fee.

2445
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Alright.

2446
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:05,000
And last but not least tonight I have a story about a particular franchise of interest to many of you and that is the Metal Gear franchise.

2447
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Note that I'm not talking about Metal Gear Solid.

2448
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:11,000
I'm talking old school Metal Gear.

2449
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
Now this is pretty cool.

2450
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Shane may have joked earlier in the show that Konami is going to formally announce that they're killing off Silent Hill at E3.

2451
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:30,000
But in real news, Konami actually gave the blessing to a team called the Outer Heaven team to do a full remake of Metal Gear.

2452
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:35,000
The 1987 action adventure stealth game Metal Gear for release on Steam.

2453
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:40,000
And they're saying it's going to be a full remake of the original game, new script, new models, the works.

2454
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:46,000
The theme compositions will be revamped with orchestral arrangements and the Metal Gear Solid 2 style electronic beats.

2455
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
This is from developer Ian Ratcliff.

2456
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:52,000
This is really cool that Konami has kind of given this the blessing.

2457
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,000
They do say it's going to be based off the MSX version of Metal Gear.

2458
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
So for those of you guys...

2459
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,000
You mean the good ones?

2460
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Yeah, the good one basically.

2461
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Well the NES one, you know what, I still have a lot of respect for it because that's what we kind of grew up on.

2462
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,000
So anyway.

2463
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:10,000
More information to come soon.

2464
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:17,000
They are still looking for volunteers, including a cutscene animator, a cutscene artist in the style of Yoji Shinkawa or Ashley Wood.

2465
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Storyboard artist, sound effect artist, composer, and voice over talent.

2466
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:25,000
So maybe I should audition to be the new voice of Snake. What do you guys think?

2467
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:29,000
How well can you do MMMM Metal Gear?

2468
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
MMMM Metal Gear!

2469
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Was that good?

2470
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Wow.

2471
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
I don't know why I expected anything different from him.

2472
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Nailed it.

2473
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Nailed it.

2474
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
I'll send him my tape right away.

2475
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Alright, there it is.

2476
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
So good luck to those guys. Love it.

2477
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Alright, that is going to do it for the news tonight.

2478
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
But now it's your turn.

2479
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:56,000
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.

2480
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2481
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:01,000
If you'd like to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight.

2482
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Maybe your own E3, what you're looking forward to in the future.

2483
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Or whatever.

2484
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Whatever it is.

2485
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype.

2486
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2487
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:13,000
All one word.

2488
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, Rob Roberts is fabulous Snake.

2489
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:22,000
I feel like there should be sparkles that come out when that's said.

2490
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Alright, oh we do have some calls coming in.

2491
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Oh no, the truck have started to move.

2492
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Oh no, the truck have started to move.

2493
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Oh no.

2494
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Oh no, the truck have started to move!

2495
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Gasp!

2496
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Gasp!

2497
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Let's get to the phones and take some calls.

2498
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2499
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Hey guys, it's Nemesis 47. How y'all doing today?

2500
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Nemesis 47. I haven't heard you in a while. How you doing?

2501
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:48,000
I've been good. I've been good.

2502
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:51,000
I've just been busy just moving out and stuff like that.

2503
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:56,000
I've also been working on my new job too over at the local King Soopers and stuff.

2504
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:59,000
I'm pretty sure that moving is punishment for shoplifting in some countries.

2505
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:02,000
So I'm sorry to hear that. It's never a fun process.

2506
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Well that's okay. I just moved with a buddy of mine, so yeah.

2507
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:10,000
That'll be fun. Well what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2508
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Nothing much. I just want to get my two cents about everything that's going on with E3 this week.

2509
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:24,000
I'm actually gonna... I am hoping they also announce a new Hitman game.

2510
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Ah, a new Hitman game, possibly.

2511
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Because from what I've seen, some months ago that a picture that...

2512
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:37,000
They're actually in the process of filming the new Hitman movie.

2513
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:42,000
So a Hitman game is probably a shoo-in or something for E3.

2514
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:49,000
And I also heard a rumor that tomorrow the new WW2K15 game is gonna be revealed.

2515
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Does EA have the license to that? Because that would make sense.

2516
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
No, 2K15 if you take two.

2517
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Oh, 2K15. Sorry about that.

2518
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:03,000
WW2K15. Yeah, that's from the people who make 2K sports and all that.

2519
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Well, yeah. It's coming out for sure.

2520
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Shows you how well I watch the sports titles. Sorry about that.

2521
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
But you're looking forward to it, huh?

2522
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Oh yeah. The one thing I'm hoping is that it's actually more fresh and more...

2523
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:23,000
I'm hoping it's a little bit more fresher than having the previous game where they pretty much borrowed everything

2524
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:27,000
that they did for THQ and everything.

2525
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:33,000
I see. I was gonna ask you what would hopefully be on your wish list of how would it be different this year.

2526
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Because, you know, a lot of these games get slammed for being roster updates and so forth, so...

2527
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Well, obviously they are gonna have roster updates.

2528
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:45,000
What I'm hearing is there's rumors going on that Goldberg and Sting is gonna be in the game.

2529
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:52,000
And the things I'm hoping is I'm hoping they actually make the weapon animations more realistic.

2530
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Like, instead of the chairs I'm actually disappearing or having three or four hits and they pretty much break

2531
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:04,000
or have very unrealistic tables. Like, they actually slide all over the goddamn place.

2532
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
All over the damn place.

2533
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:11,000
And I'm hoping they pretty much update the weapon systems and everything like that.

2534
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Just pretty much make a better wrestling game experience and all that is all.

2535
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com talking about the new Hitman game saying

2536
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:26,000
the new Hitman game is supposed to be more sandbox-y and fix the problems from the previous one.

2537
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:30,000
I thought the last one was pretty sandbox-y from the looks of it.

2538
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:38,000
I actually like the new Hitman game. I was actually fambling when I first played the game

2539
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:42,000
and also I heard the old voice of 47 because originally they were gonna go with a different voice

2540
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:47,000
but they decided to bring back the old 47 voice so I was happy with that.

2541
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
And I actually love the game.

2542
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Yeah, even I watched it. It's not usually my type of thing but I watched a friend play it and it looked pretty cool.

2543
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:55,000
So I was like, oh wow.

2544
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:56,000
It is. It is.

2545
02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:00,000
It was all next gen at that time, although now we're in a whole other generation.

2546
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:03,000
So it would look amazing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I'm sure.

2547
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Oh yeah, and let's see, what else was I gonna say?

2548
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Oh, did you guys see the new Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD remix trailer?

2549
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:18,000
I did, if for nothing else than the last 20 seconds of basically nothing but subtitles saying

2550
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Kingdom Hearts 3, don't forget.

2551
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Like literally, what was it, three frames or something.

2552
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Like three still pictures that rotate super fast. You can't see it at all.

2553
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Just talk about a tease.

2554
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:35,000
All I did was pretty much pause during the scenes.

2555
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:43,000
They're pretty much scenes from Kingdom Hearts Triple D, the 3DS.

2556
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:50,000
But we'll probably see more about Kingdom Hearts 3 and everything, so yeah.

2557
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:55,000
I definitely think it's still a little early.

2558
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:58,000
I don't think the game is gonna be playable on the show floor or anything like that.

2559
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
I really don't think it's that far along.

2560
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:06,000
But I would love to see a better trailer, like a new little tease would be great.

2561
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
That and 15, but I don't know.

2562
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Square has come out and said don't expect to see either one at E3, so we'll see.

2563
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:14,000
I'm gonna probably say Tokyo Game Show more than likely.

2564
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Yeah, that's a very good thought, is that these could be things that are being saved for Tokyo Game Show.

2565
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Because they kinda did say, without saying, they're holding onto it for another expo.

2566
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Tokyo Game Show would be the highly likely candidate for that.

2567
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:33,000
And lastly, there's another big convention that's gonna happen this weekend, besides E3 obviously.

2568
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:34,000
What's that?

2569
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Denver Comic Con.

2570
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Ah.

2571
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:41,000
Over here in Denver. It's the fifth largest convention in the United States.

2572
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Which I have tickets for, which I am officially missing because it's next weekend.

2573
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
I was gonna say, that's in your backyard and you're gonna have to visit.

2574
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:51,000
You're going now, man! I want to meet ya!

2575
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:57,000
I bought tickets in March or something like that earlier this year before E3.

2576
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Before the E3 plan at work had even really come up.

2577
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I hate to say it, but for me, E3 is trumping Denver Comic Con in a heartbeat.

2578
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Yeah, yeah, it's understandable. E3 is frickin' amazing.

2579
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:18,000
I mean, how? I mean, for me, if I was invited to go between DCC and E3, I'd go with E3 too.

2580
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Because, come on. That's a big show.

2581
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Yeah, you're gonna have a lot of fun at Denver Comic Con, though. I mean, come on.

2582
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Oh, totally, man. Totally. We have, like, Peter Davison. We have Sylvester McCoy, the pimp and the seventh doctor.

2583
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Oh, you mean David Tennant's father-in-law.

2584
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Yes, yes.

2585
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
And the guy with pigeon shit all over him.

2586
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Sorry, I love both of them, but I love making the parallels.

2587
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Originally, Karen Gellan Amy Pond was gonna be at the con this year, but she had to back out because of a movie commitment and stuff.

2588
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:55,000
So, she's, they didn't mention, sorry about that, I tend to stutter a lot, guys.

2589
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:56,000
That's okay.

2590
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:00,000
They did mention that she might be coming next year, though.

2591
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Oh, that'd be cool. She owes you guys a make-up. And then that way, Jason can be there.

2592
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Unless he goes to E3 next year, which, you know, we'll see.

2593
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:13,000
All right. Well, Nemesis, I enjoyed the call, enjoyed your predictions. Thanks so much for giving us a call, and have a lot of fun at the Denver Comic-Con.

2594
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:16,000
And since we can't be there, say hey to everybody for us.

2595
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Okay. Okay, guys. I'm happy I'm at E3 this week, all right?

2596
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:22,000
We will do. See you on E3.vognetwork.com.

2597
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:23,000
All right, man. Big peace.

2598
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Later.

2599
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:30,000
All right. I like hearing from callers who don't always hear from a lot, but I like the regulars, too, don't get me wrong.

2600
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:36,000
But it's always nice to hear from a not-so-familiar tone, just to know that, oh, I'm still listening.

2601
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:40,000
I've had my tickets on the table right in my front door.

2602
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,000
You didn't try to give them to somebody?

2603
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Right inside of my front door. I, you know, I was thinking about that towards the end. I really should have.

2604
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Yeah.

2605
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:52,000
But I was looking at them before this trip started, because I've been out here. I've been away from home for pretty much the entire month of May.

2606
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:57,000
I was just looking at it, and I was like, damn, I could do it if I didn't have to drive all weekend and then some.

2607
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:01,000
All right. Well, I don't even have to give out the number again, because it's lighting up. Let's go to the phones.

2608
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2609
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:06,000
It's your local residential cosplay whore, Rama.

2610
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Rama, it just wouldn't be a show without you. What's on your mind, buddy?

2611
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:10,000
Sailor Moon.

2612
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
Oh, besides that.

2613
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:16,000
So did you find me the little thing that I asked if you could find for me?

2614
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:19,000
I could not find any in the dealer's room.

2615
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Ahhhh. No, Sanketsu.

2616
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Hey, don't upset her during OLR. What's up, buddy? What's on your mind?

2617
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:30,000
I can't help it if I fail the side mission. What am I supposed to do?

2618
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Make one. Out of life fibers.

2619
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Do over.

2620
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:36,000
And then he can talk to me. When I'm bored at work.

2621
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

2622
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:45,000
Not too much. I kind of missed half the show because we were planning stuff out for our podcast this week and some other stuff.

2623
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Well, how dare you?

2624
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:48,000
What?

2625
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
How dare you? How very dare you? I'm just-

2626
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:55,000
I'm sorry. People call me. I gotta take calls. Evidently, I'm an important person.

2627
02:54:55,000 --> 02:55:02,000
I was just gonna say I kind of felt sorry. I said this earlier in the show. I felt sorry for some of the VoG- I think I might have said this on Bobby's show.

2628
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:08,000
I feel sorry for some of the VoG programming on tomorrow and Tuesday because gaming really is gonna dominate the conversation.

2629
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:11,000
And I know Voice Geeks Network is really about all things geek.

2630
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:19,000
But I was like, well, Rama might get out of it because he's a live show so he can kind of adjust to whatever's going on with E3 and all that.

2631
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:26,000
That and I have a game filter set up for the chat so it's all anime all day every day so we're good.

2632
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
There you go.

2633
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Few things. Went to Anime Nexus this past week. It was pretty fun. I met up with Critical Myth so there is a picture of us crossing paths.

2634
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Oh, that's amazing.

2635
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Let's see. I did not make it over to the gaming room because it's over in another hotel and it was too hot to walk across to the other side of the location.

2636
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:56,000
But I did hear there was some pretty good gaming over there so we'll definitely uncover that.

2637
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:59,000
But here's something that was some interesting things though.

2638
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Most popular cosplay there was from the game Danganronpa which is becoming the game which is actually putting life into the Vita because as we all know the Vita doesn't sell.

2639
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:21,000
No, sadly. I'm curious to see what Sony kind of does with that if they do anything with that at E3. We'll find out in 24 hours.

2640
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Hopefully. And evidently it seems in my areas ever since the Luigi death stairs came about it's been kind of hard to find a Wii U.

2641
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Really? You know I think I was seeing some sales numbers today and it does look like Wii U outsold Xbox One for the past week.

2642
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:48,000
But I mean again it still didn't outsell PlayStation 4 so it's not where it needs to be.

2643
02:56:49,000 --> 02:57:00,000
I don't expect that to happen but you know I just find all that pretty interesting and pretty cool because now I'm like you know I may just have to get myself a Wii U just for that.

2644
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:07,000
And what's interesting is that as I'm running around as Dr. Luigi people are asking me for my death stair which was pretty cool.

2645
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:21,000
I was gonna say you know now I don't want to sound like that guy Rama but you do cosplay as a black man as Luigi so you know people are wondering where's my angry black man Luigi?

2646
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
You went there.

2647
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:28,000
I live there. I bought a house there. Rama?

2648
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
That's because I gave him permission so it's okay.

2649
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,000
That's right.

2650
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
And before I get out of here.

2651
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Wait wait you didn't answer my question. It was a serious question. What am I gonna get my angry Luigi? Are you gonna do an angry Luigi cosplay at some point or no?

2652
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:51,000
It'll happen when I end up doing the mushroom doctor which is Luigi cross tenth doctor. I've been asked to do that too.

2653
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:52,000
That'll be fun.

2654
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Green pinstripes?

2655
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Maybe. The suspenders are sitting on my floor.

2656
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
I remember that dapper hat you had.

2657
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Alright you said one more thing.

2658
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:17,000
I was taking pictures and I came across Death Stair Luigi and I'm posting the picture in the chat room and it's also on my Facebook page. Facebook.com slash I M D G Ron M S. You'll find it there.

2659
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:28,000
And it's interesting that Luigi is giving my friend the death stair and the best part is that's my friend Mario. So as you can see Luigi is giving the death stair to Mario.

2660
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:38,000
I have a really bad feeling that this angry Luigi meme is gonna get played out at cons real fast. You know I take back my question. You probably shouldn't do angry Luigi.

2661
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:51,000
I know but the best part is it was a Waluigi and Wario with go karts running around playing riding dirty all over the convention area throwing stuff at each other. People ate it up.

2662
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Alright that's fun though. Looks like you guys had fun there at the con.

2663
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:02,000
Alright well Rama best of luck with your show on Tuesday. I'm sorry I won't be here to hear it but that's what podcasts are for.

2664
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:05,000
Alright take care buddy. We'll see you soon.

2665
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,000
You too. Take care bro.

2666
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Alright bye.

2667
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Alright.

2668
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:15,000
Squeeze in one more call if anybody wants to get in. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2669
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:22,000
I did see just a couple tweets come in here so I want to get to those. I read one of them earlier in the show but I saw a couple stories.

2670
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:27,000
I'll also go ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories he wants to squeeze in here.

2671
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Yeah there's some funny stuff. Notch has released a game called Cliff Horse. It's a game about riding horses on cliffs.

2672
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:41,000
It's kind of like playing Skyrim because the horses just kind of defy gravity and they ride on a cliff.

2673
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:49,000
For anybody that doesn't get it from the outside if you know the meme and seen the image. Physics? I'm a horse bitch.

2674
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Just a couple tweets that were sent to us here. There was a correction to last week's show from Pika Uno.

2675
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:05,000
I don't even remember why Downton Abbey came up on last week's show but it did and we said that it was on the BBC and Pika Uno corrected.

2676
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:06,000
PBS you said.

2677
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
It is on, well in overseas.

2678
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
BBC. It was on, was it television 4?

2679
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:11,000
It's on ITV.

2680
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:12,000
ITV that was it.

2681
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:20,000
Pika Uno issuing the correction there which I did retweet and say well sorry but we're kind of busy on Sunday nights when it usually airs.

2682
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Except for the fact that it airs Sunday morning.

2683
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:28,000
Yeah I don't know when it airs over there.

2684
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:33,000
But it has my spirit grandmother.

2685
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:34,000
Maggie Smith.

2686
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:35,000
Heck yeah.

2687
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
It airs on PBS Sunday nights.

2688
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:38,000
Yes.

2689
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Sassy.

2690
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Satcho and Hunter Matt tweeting us the story about Xbox One controllers are now supported on PC.

2691
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:50,000
You must have missed that part of the show Satcho and Hunter Matt but yes you can now use those on PC.

2692
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,000
And Act Deft sending us to an infamous meme.

2693
03:00:53,000 --> 03:01:01,000
Speaking of leaks and announcements before E3 here's a preview of Valve's surprise conference and its characters singing on stage in Tomodachi Life.

2694
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
One can only dream.

2695
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Any other last minute stories Loki?

2696
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:09,000
The rumor is that the Nintendo digital event is going to be 30 minutes long.

2697
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
That's it?

2698
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:12,000
Wow.

2699
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
It's Nintendo isn't that all they need?

2700
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:18,000
It's according to I guess the timetable that they have on Niko Video or whatever.

2701
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:23,000
It says 1 to about 130 is the...

2702
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
That could be a placeholder we don't really know.

2703
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
That seems short but then again I mean...

2704
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:30,000
And it says Smash Brothers Invitational 8 to 1030.

2705
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:38,000
So I guess last year was pretty short too but they could also pull a stupid like...

2706
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:42,000
Hey! Yeah here's our digital thing.

2707
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
But we're gonna have 3 more during the week!

2708
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Well they could. They could.

2709
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
But 30 minutes doesn't seem like enough.

2710
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,000
Remember they had 3 last year?

2711
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:51,000
That's right they did.

2712
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:56,000
If they only have one in 30 minutes long that's not a good sign.

2713
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:57,000
I think it's a little early though.

2714
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:00,000
I mean this isn't an official source.

2715
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:04,000
It's probably a placeholder on somebody's schedule just because they had to put something.

2716
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
And that is for Tuesday?

2717
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
Yeah.

2718
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:11,000
8 o'clock in the evening for the Invitational.

2719
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:12,000
Wow.

2720
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Well it's Japan time.

2721
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:15,000
Alright.

2722
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
I cannot do the type of translation right now.

2723
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
Maybe it's Japanese specific stuff.

2724
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
It's only like 30 minutes.

2725
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:22,000
Maybe.

2726
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Alright I don't know.

2727
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:24,000
It's a shot. It's a shot.

2728
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Alright that's it.

2729
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
We're gonna close up the Skype line because ain't nobody else calling in.

2730
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
So we are gonna wrap up because you know what?

2731
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:30,000
I got an early day tomorrow.

2732
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
And it's gonna be a big day for a lot of you guys.

2733
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:33,000
You and me both!

2734
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Road trip buddies!

2735
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:35,000
Yay!

2736
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
We also have this cool game I just saw here.

2737
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:38,000
What's that?

2738
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
It's called Rollers of the Realm.

2739
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
It's a pinball RPG.

2740
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:43,000
Ooh fun!

2741
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:44,000
Yeah.

2742
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:45,000
I've gotta check that out.

2743
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Is that on Steam?

2744
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:47,000
PS4, Vita, and PC.

2745
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:48,000
Oh get out.

2746
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:49,000
That sounds awesome.

2747
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:50,000
This winter.

2748
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:51,000
Nice.

2749
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:52,000
It sounds like...

2750
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:53,000
What was that game?

2751
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Kind of like a pinball quest type game.

2752
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:56,000
Yeah.

2753
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:57,000
Alright.

2754
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:58,000
That is it.

2755
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:59,000
We are on our way out of here.

2756
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
We're gonna close up shop.

2757
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Have a great night everybody.

2758
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
Let's thank you for your support first off.

2759
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:09,000
Thank you very much for downloading our show and checking us out.

2760
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:12,000
And supporting us every week as you always do.

2761
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:13,000
555 episodes long.

2762
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
That's 5s across the board.

2763
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:20,000
We'll be back to do it again next week with episode number 556 after E3.

2764
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:24,000
It's gonna be very interesting to see how we all react to the news.

2765
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:28,000
And I want to know how you guys react to all the news going into E3.

2766
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:29,000
But have a great show.

2767
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
Those of you guys that are actually gonna be there in person,

2768
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
I hope to see you around the show floor.

2769
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
Those of you guys that are playing the home game and watching at home,

2770
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
please participate with the site.

2771
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
We're there to help you out.

2772
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:42,000
So let's get the answers to your questions as best we can.

2773
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2774
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:45,000
Jason, I want to thank you as always for being here.

2775
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Of course.

2776
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:47,000
Hope you had fun tonight.

2777
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:48,000
Do you have a final thought for us?

2778
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
I don't want to wake up tomorrow,

2779
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:55,000
but I must because the week starts in pretty much about five hours.

2780
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:59,000
You can sleep through like Stockton and Bakersfield,

2781
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
the really unremarkable places.

2782
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:02,000
While I'm driving, that sounds scary.

2783
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:03,000
No, no, no, no.

2784
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Take the 99.

2785
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:05,000
Sleep through Fresno.

2786
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
Stop at the Bravo Cheese Farm.

2787
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:08,000
Well, we don't really want to stop.

2788
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
Yeah, tell that to the lactose intolerant one.

2789
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:11,000
No, no, no, no, no.

2790
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:14,000
You can find good low lactosey cheeses.

2791
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
Stopping is probably more for the way back.

2792
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:20,000
No, you have to stop by the Bravo Cheese Farm and bring me sage cheese.

2793
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:23,000
You know they're building a Bravo farm on five as well.

2794
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:24,000
No way.

2795
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
In Kettleman City or whatever that is.

2796
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
You know that's still not going to make me take the five and smell the cow shit.

2797
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:29,000
All right.

2798
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:33,000
Dar Sockers, since you have the mic, your final thought tonight?

2799
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
I really didn't mean to take from Jason's time.

2800
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:39,000
Just Bravo Cheese Farm.

2801
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:43,000
Everyone look for the deer kitten commercial for Friskies on YouTube.

2802
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:44,000
All right.

2803
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,000
It's the cutest thing.

2804
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:52,000
My final thought is OMG, busy week ahead, but I can't wait to do some networking and introduce more people to VOG.

2805
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2806
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Speaking of kittens, my son hung up.

2807
03:04:56,000 --> 03:05:01,000
He had a cat calendar because he was really excited about having a calendar and he had a cat calendar.

2808
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:02,000
Then he didn't give a shit about the calendar.

2809
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
He wanted the cat pictures all over his room.

2810
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
So now his room is covered in cat pictures.

2811
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,000
He's ready for the internet.

2812
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
Your son's room is a meme.

2813
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:15,000
And also, I would like to say that I finally finished my fucking calling script and I think it's all done.

2814
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:18,000
And I had it working and I finished converting all the objects over.

2815
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
So now I can start other things again.

2816
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:21,000
Hooray.

2817
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:22,000
Back to the game.

2818
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,000
Back to the game.

2819
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:24,000
All right, guys.

2820
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
We're out of here because you know what?

2821
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:27,000
I got to go pack.

2822
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:28,000
See you next week.

2823
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:32,000
