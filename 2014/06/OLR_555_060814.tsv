14000	20000	The next year of gaming and electronic entertainment is about to be revealed as we are less than 24 hours from the keynotes by all our favorite gaming companies.
20000	23000	All about impending AAA titles, new accessories, and future Steam sale fodder.
23000	27000	All this, listless, and more coming up on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	42000	It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with our 555th episode.
42000	45000	That's right, episode 555.
45000	51000	For this June the 8th of 2014 on the eve of Video Game Christmas, as a lot of people refer to it.
51000	55000	That's right, the Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 kicks off.
55000	61000	Technically the expo starts Tuesday, but all the conferences and some of the early meetings are starting tomorrow.
61000	66000	Microsoft kicking things off at 9am, but we're kicking off E3 in our own way tonight.
66000	69000	My name is Rob Robertson, joining me in the studio as always.
69000	72000	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
72000	73000	Hi.
73000	74000	How are you Jamie Summers?
74000	75000	I'm okay.
75000	76000	Yeah?
76000	77000	Yeah.
77000	79000	What's new with you? Anything new and exciting in the world of Jamie?
79000	84000	She's been working a lot at the, I always want to say Lolcat, but it's LoCat.
84000	87000	I'll tell you why I didn't go with Lolcat.
87000	88000	Okay.
88000	91000	Because Lolcat already exists in Homestuck, it's the land of little cups and tea.
91000	94000	I work at the land, hey.
94000	99000	Jason in a mic or we can't hear it.
99000	104000	Yeah, the Homestucks get it anyways, so that's why I went with LoCat, the land of cubes and tech.
104000	110000	That works, that works. It's a good way to kind of, you know, have the anonymity so people don't necessarily know your employer and all that good stuff.
110000	117000	Except that now I know more people, more and more people that work there, and apparently people I work with know friends of mine.
117000	121000	Like one of my co-workers games with Becky's husband.
121000	122000	That's random.
122000	127000	And another of my co-workers who I play D&D with knows Travis.
127000	134000	Yeah, I was going to say I have co-workers that know people that I used to do Rocky Horror with back at the Birdcage, so that's always something.
134000	136000	He knows Travis from a cast before the one that you were in.
136000	138000	Oh, that's old school.
138000	139000	Isn't that right?
139000	140000	Yeah, that's old school.
140000	141000	Wasn't that like the one right before Understandation?
141000	144000	It was, yep. Absent Friends, 95 or so in Sacramento.
144000	151000	So yeah. And I was just like going, the moment he mentions names, because he mentioned names of people I don't know all the time, he's like, I know him.
151000	154000	You do? Yeah?
154000	160000	So lots and lots of networking, IRL, and of course at the E3 Expo this week, lots of networking there.
160000	167000	We are going to miss you, Dark Soccer. I understand that, you know, work takes precedence because you did just start that job not that long ago, so you can't exactly take a week off.
167000	169000	But you'll be missed.
169000	171000	Well, you know, I'm actually kind of glad I'm not going.
171000	173000	Yeah, why's that? Just?
173000	181000	Just because with as busy as I've been and a little tired and on edge, it means I don't have to be around massive groups of people and double my medication.
181000	189000	Yeah, I actually can understand that because I was talking about this at the end of Bobby's show, but I've been just really exhausted too, and I know some people see E3 as a vacation.
189000	195000	Don't get me wrong, I'm very fortunate to go, I'm very happy to go, I realize I'm lucky a lot of people would give a lot to be able to go to the show.
195000	209000	But it's just one of those things where I'm like, it's not just like, teehee, fun, cosplay, play games, all that, it's some serious, like, you know, you gotta run from place to place, you do these meetings, you have all these kind of serious things going on.
209000	215000	It is work. It's fun work. I know, I managed to cute my way into tons of the press kits we weren't supposed to have the few years I did.
215000	217000	Yeah, you were so good at that.
217000	227000	And then hanging out with my buddy Krista, who worked for LucasArts at the time, and going into the Q&As with her, because she was like, oh, she's with me. Bye, bye.
227000	239000	That's the shit, that's how I got to play Popula Cross at first. And they were like, you know what the hell this game is? I was like, yeah, and thanks to Loki here, I now have the game and have to play through it.
239000	241000	There you go.
241000	251000	But I don't know, as long as one of us, or a few of us are going, I don't feel bad about not going. Honestly, it's a little too much for me.
251000	254000	That's a good way to look at it. Are you gonna try and play the at-home game?
254000	256000	No, I'm actually not.
256000	261000	You're just gonna kinda come absorb everything next week at the show, or bits and pieces here and there?
261000	267000	I may watch a thing here and there, but my plan for the week is work.
267000	274000	I have a hard time believing if they pop out a new Mass Effect trailer, you won't be doing 90 miles an hour on the way home to go watch it.
274000	286000	At that point I say, bitch, please. This is me we're talking about. I mean, of course I'm gonna see stuff I'm gonna get excited about, but honestly, I've decided that the week is actually gonna be spent on myself.
286000	297000	Because with my new schedule, I'm working in closing shift, so I work 1130 to 830 now, that means I can actually get up in the morning and go back to the gym instead of doing it after work when I'm dead tired.
297000	309000	You know, that's what I did last year. I did kinda the home game, and I'm using my quote-y fingers, covered E3 from home, but that just basically means I supported Bobby and all that with what he was doing.
309000	318000	I did end up driving down there later in the week, and we did the Disney 3 thing, but earlier in the week, you know, I just kinda hung out and it was a great kinda charge the batteries, so I think you'll have a good week.
318000	319000	Yeah, bye.
319000	321000	You get all the good stuff on next week's show.
321000	323000	But hey, you got to play an Ouya.
323000	328000	Alright, Techmaster Loki always has something to say. I did get to play Ouya last year when I-
328000	330000	Yes, because it is disappointing as owning an Ouya.
331000	342000	I didn't walk away from the Ouya experience last year with the heap amount of negativity that you have for it now. Granted, it wasn't out yet. I was seeing demos of some games that were probably the better games that were on the system.
342000	348000	Well, and also to be fair, there are a lot of games now I think are more polished than they were when I had it, but no.
348000	359000	Yeah, and there's still stuff that they're cranking out as well, so you know, they're still trucking along, doing their thing, and it's still a very low-cost alternative to get some of this other stuff, so it'll be interesting.
359000	371000	But yeah, the experience last year was kinda funny in that regard that I actually picked Bobby up at the Expo, because you can- I don't know if they like people knowing this, but you can go in the- like, the LA Convention Center is practically a public place.
371000	383000	You can walk in, it's very easy, you just can't get past the line to go to the hall. You can't actually get in the hall, but you can look through the window and see everything that's going on, do all that, and there's some stuff that's on the outside, like the Ouya was in the parking lot last year.
383000	394000	Not that I'm saying you should all go down to the Convention Center and make it more crowded than it already is, but the fact of the matter is, it is in the heart of downtown LA. It's next door to the Staples Center. There's a lot of activity down there.
395000	406000	I'm gonna finish all these puzzles this week, and that's one of the most exciting things about E3, honestly, is finishing these fucking puzzles on my DS, because a new one pops up every other day, it feels like. So, I'm excited.
406000	409000	I'm gonna be totally watching everything. I've been watching everything.
410000	424000	All right, I'm going to our chat room before I introduce our fourth in-studio co-host tonight. I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because of course we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.
424000	434000	Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern is the time to be here. And, let's see, I'm looking at Brad from Pod Culture, starting us off, saying, Ouya isn't that bad, they just had bad timing.
434000	444000	It is actually a neat little bit of kit. And then, let's see, Dungeon Buster says, All the Mass Effects in our chat room. I'm sure there's a lot of people hyped for that.
444000	456000	If there is a new Mass Effect trailer, Dark Soccer, it's gonna hit tomorrow. You could possibly be 24 hours less than away from Garrus on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, possibly.
456000	459000	If they hear it while I'm at work, I'm just gonna have to watch it during my break.
459000	464000	You're gonna have to take a personal, like, I have severe diarrhea, I need to go to the restroom right now.
464000	472000	Why are you going to the bathroom with your headphones? Because I'm going to be shitting loudly. I don't want to hear it.
472000	475000	Sorry, I was-
475000	477000	I'm gonna bring a change of underwear with me to work.
477000	483000	I was watching an episode of Orange is the New Black last night, maybe- alright, anyway, I'm just- anyway, I'm not gonna go there.
483000	489000	Alright, say hello. He was watching this with me last night. Say hello to VX JasonXV.
489000	493000	I'm melting! I'm melting! God, it's fucking hot up here.
493000	496000	It is hot. Welcome to Satan's Butthole, California.
497000	504000	And it's funny, because it wasn't terribly different, you know, I was here just a week ago, and things haven't changed that dramatically.
504000	510000	And I grew up in the desert, and God, the Bay Area has spoiled me. And I don't even live there. What the hell is this?
510000	513000	Well, here's the good news. I checked the weather for LA next week. 70s and 80s.
513000	516000	Nice. I'm very happy to hear that.
516000	521000	Especially if we're doing the Disney thing later in the week and being outdoors all day, it's very nice news to hear.
521000	525000	Because Disney in 100 degrees, not as fun. So, very good to hear it.
525000	531000	In fact, I believe if I caught this correctly, this is not your first E3.
531000	535000	It is not my first E3. This is my second in a decade exactly.
535000	539000	Your last one, we were at together for DDR Freak.
539000	540000	2004, absolutely.
540000	546000	That was also my first E3, and I remember we went to the Dear Friends concert together. That was one of the first times you and I ever hung out.
546000	549000	That was the year of the thumping floor.
549000	551000	That was the year of the thumping floor.
551000	552000	Thumping floor.
552000	559000	We went to some presentation, and it was on this big diagonal, and people were sitting on the floor, and they put subwoofers on the floor.
559000	564000	I'm sure that made for the interesting experience for the attendees.
564000	569000	So, a decade later, I'm going to tell you, the show's changed a lot. An awful lot.
569000	572000	No more Kensha Hall, rest in peace. Which is really sad.
572000	576000	You'll be able to see down there, and it's a bunch of parked cars. You're like, what the hell?
577000	583000	Of course, I don't know if the layout of the convention center's changed at all because of the construction for the farmer's field football.
583000	593000	It doesn't seem like it based on the booth maps and things I'm seeing Bobby's posted on VOG Network under our interactive coverage, E3.vognetwork.com, which I'll come back to later.
593000	599000	But you can actually see the booth maps, and it doesn't look like it's changed, so I guess they didn't really start that construction yet.
599000	612000	I remember watching E3 coverage, people that were livecasting throughout the whole week, and when I was there in 2004, everything was very open, like booths.
612000	618000	There wasn't really these dividing lines. There were decorated walls and everything that was being showed off.
618000	629000	The biggest walls that I can think of are either supporting beams or squares ramp up to their back wall in their inner enclave showing off Final Fantasy XI.
629000	631000	Ah yes, the theater.
631000	646000	Yeah, that's exactly what it was. But then when I watched it a year or two ago, everybody had these big enclosing, draping curtains everywhere, which seems to be really terrible to accommodate that many masses of people.
646000	647000	But we'll see.
647000	654000	We'll see. We'll see. Also, very important question that's going to be burning on everybody's mind. It's your first trip to Disneyland, if I'm not mistaken, right?
654000	655000	It is not.
655000	656000	Oh, I thought it was.
656000	658000	It is my first as an adult or anything close to it.
658000	659000	Okay.
659000	662000	I haven't been to Disneyland since I was seven or something.
662000	670000	Okay, your first time truly at Disneyland as an adult, so what are you looking for? I know you're not a coaster guy, but what are you truly looking forward to most at Disneyland?
670000	675000	I actually am looking forward to going back on Star Wars The Experience.
675000	676000	There you go.
676000	685000	Because that was a... I've never been a rollercoaster guy. I cried the first time I went on it because the motion and the experience just overwhelmed me.
685000	686000	It's very different.
686000	688000	Yeah, they redid it two years ago.
688000	689000	It's completely different.
689000	691000	Is it still shuttles and mass rows sitting?
691000	692000	Yes, but it's still...
692000	693000	High definition, 3D.
693000	701000	Sure, sure. And I'm looking forward to that, but it'll just be funny to be in that line, look and see those little triggers that I'll be able to remember.
701000	704000	Sing Star Trek while you're in line for me.
705000	707000	Are you going to cry again? Do I have to hold your hand or something?
707000	711000	Maybe in happiness and not in sensory overwhelming fear.
711000	712000	Alright, sounds good.
712000	718000	I'm sure... I haven't thought about Disneyland for a long time because I've never made plans to go there.
718000	725000	I don't know if Zen still listens to the show, but Zen is a buddy of ours that is sometimes at the Star Wars gift shop at Disneyland.
725000	731000	So Zen, if you happen to be working Friday, have some tissues ready for me, please. As a personal favor, I would really appreciate that.
731000	736000	It'll be really interesting. I've been on a whole recollection kick for the last year or two.
736000	742000	And it'll be fun to just kind of be around and see what I personally specifically remember from being there before.
742000	750000	But it'll be fun. I'll be around great people. I assume a lot of other E3 attendees will be there as well, so fun networking potentials to be made there.
750000	758000	And yeah, this is going to be an insane week for many, many reasons, but I am completely looking forward to it.
758000	762000	Alright, sounds good. Alright, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.
762000	767000	Actually, I do have a few things I want to mention from the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
767000	770000	Vidpower talking about the Movie Theater Sony Conference experience.
770000	774000	Vidpower says they sold out of tickets here eight hours after the announcement.
774000	776000	I don't think any of us are doing that.
776000	785000	No, they sold out of everywhere, but I think a lot of people started buying... or not buying, ordering tickets to get a certain beta code.
785000	790000	Oh, I think that's what's going to be giving away there? The PlayStation Now or whatever?
790000	792000	It's for Battlefield Hardline.
792000	793000	Oh, okay.
793000	796000	Apparently. The rumor is for PlayStation 4, the beta for that.
796000	802000	Interesting, interesting. So, well, Jason and I are fortunate enough, we're going to the Sony Conference, the real deal in LA.
802000	809000	But yeah, I'm curious. Those of you guys that go to the movie theaters, I really want to hear kind of what that is, because that's a really new thing.
809000	817000	And to get all these common Sony fans in one place to watch it is a really fascinating idea, so I'm really curious to hear how that goes.
817000	824000	I want some Vidpower, I don't know if you're going, but anybody who is going, I definitely want to hear your thoughts on that for next week's show.
824000	834000	Let's see. I read this name as Village Idiot is Matt, and I was like, oh, that's kind of a rude thing to say to Loki, but it's actually Village Idiot's Matt.
835000	842000	Which I'm guessing is another Matt. It says, is it true that the Ouya controller sucks? One of the only things keeping me from trying it out.
842000	844000	Yes, it's not good.
844000	846000	Is it better now, though, than when you had it?
846000	853000	No, because they did have another controller that was a redesign, and I ended up getting a replacement because mine was broken.
853000	858000	It had a really terrible dead zone in it. The new one worked, it wasn't that great, though.
859000	868000	I think they have yet another one, but the thing is, you don't give a shit because you can sync your DualShock 3s to them, and most games support them.
868000	877000	In fact, I think most games support them because the original controllers suck, and you can even use an Xbox 360 controller hooked up via USB and stuff.
877000	880000	There was a lot of options, but I only played with the DualShock.
880000	887000	I didn't think the Ouya controller was that terrible, but it is certainly no DualShock, I'll say that for sure.
887000	890000	Alright, let's get into kickoff topics. We've got a couple things tonight.
890000	893000	I want to talk E3, but I want to talk about one of the big, big stories that's going around right now.
893000	899000	I'm sure a lot of you guys have caught wind of the rumor, rumor has it, that's been going around.
899000	903000	IGN ran a report last night that says, The Last Guardian has been cancelled.
903000	911000	That they had, on good authority, I think their Russian side or whatever, had something that said that The Last Guardian was cancelled.
911000	916000	Well, one of the producers over at Sony said, we had a good laugh about that story this morning.
916000	922000	So, then they had to go back and modify the headline to say, The Last Guardian may be cancelled.
922000	926000	And now it's coming out like, conflicting reports that The Last Guardian is cancelled.
926000	934000	And this caused one of my good friends, Captain Spike from Game Buoy, to say on my Facebook, the old classic line,
934000	940000	you can't spell ignorant without IGN. Which, you know, not to dog pile on IGN, but it's always fun to kind of poke fun.
940000	947000	Obviously, they ran on some information they thought was legit and Sony's coming out and flat out denying it.
947000	950000	What do you guys think is going on? What do you guys think is the status of The Last Guardian?
950000	957000	Which, may I remind you, was first talked about in 2007. It's the new Duke Nukem Forever.
957000	960000	Hopefully, it'll end up a better game if it's not cancelled.
960000	962000	I think it's IGN being full of shit.
962000	963000	Yeah.
963000	968000	I really, honestly, whenever I see anything like that, I wait until I get an official word.
969000	976000	If I remember correctly, it was, I think, because I didn't even read the article, I think I glanced at something on NeoGaf or something,
976000	987000	but I thought it was due to a mistranslation or something, or they took something one way and then took it another way.
987000	991000	Honestly, here's what it comes down to.
992000	995000	They ran it because of page hits.
995000	1002000	So, now they had a good chance, and it seemed like it's something that makes sense to run that,
1002000	1010000	and if they could be first with the story, then they get lots of page hits, and it just happened that it ended up not being true.
1010000	1018000	Nonetheless, they still got tons of page hits. People were talking about it, and most people forget about this mistake in a few weeks.
1018000	1021000	So, it's just page hits.
1023000	1031000	Alright. Anyway, just a note, we're still recording right now for the podcast, but wouldn't you know it, our live feed just went down,
1031000	1033000	so right now our live listeners can't hear us.
1033000	1035000	E3 has taken another service down.
1035000	1036000	Oh my gosh.
1036000	1037000	The rush is too much.
1037000	1040000	It's very frustrating, very frustrating, especially on a big show such as tonight,
1040000	1045000	which is, you know, the weird thing about an E3 prediction show for a show like us who tapes on Sunday night,
1045000	1048000	literally we're going to have like three quarters of the answers tomorrow.
1048000	1053000	I mean, and Tuesday is when the rest of it with Nintendo and, you know, the show floor opening up.
1053000	1057000	So, to do the predictions now is like really for the live audience.
1057000	1060000	I realize there's two distinct groups that listen to our show, right?
1060000	1065000	There's the live folks, and then there's the folks that listen to the podcast, most of them Monday morning.
1065000	1071000	So, you know, hi to you guys that listen on the podcast feed, but I bet some of this is going to be hilarious to listen to in retrospect,
1071000	1076000	because for all we know, Sony rolls out that last Guardian Trail tomorrow, and, you know, all of this is for naught.
1076000	1079000	Hey, we weren't the ones that said it was canceled.
1079000	1082000	That's true. We were not the ones that said it was canceled, so.
1083000	1086000	And this is when I sit back in judgment.
1087000	1094000	If this show comes last after the day's coverage, then answers, answers, answers, answers, answers, predictions.
1094000	1096000	Well, at least we can gauge ourselves.
1096000	1100000	I think it does put Sony in an interesting pickle where they kind of need to say something on it.
1100000	1102000	They need to give an update on the game.
1102000	1105000	I don't think that'll necessarily happen at the press conference.
1105000	1108000	I mean, well, maybe it was always planned. We don't know.
1108000	1113000	You can bet that the script for tomorrow's press conference is iron tight.
1113000	1120000	They are not going to change it, with the exception of if they may have some counter moves planned for Microsoft.
1120000	1123000	Like there could be like a script A, script B, script C kind of thing.
1123000	1125000	We have cracked down three.
1125000	1128000	Well, who knows? Anything is possible depending on what Microsoft does.
1128000	1133000	They throw the first pitch, so, you know, Sony gets to respond to that in the position they're in.
1133000	1134000	But you can bet that thing is scripted.
1134000	1139000	They're not going to just suddenly say, oh, now we have to talk about The Last Guardian because IGN's got a big mouth.
1139000	1143000	But I do kind of think it puts them in a position where they're going to have to say something.
1143000	1154000	If it's not part of their planned press conference, then they're going to have to put out a press release or something that says the status or drop a quote to GameSpot, the biggest competitor for IGN or something.
1154000	1158000	Pull a Nintendo, show the logo on the screen, say, coming 2015.
1158000	1164000	Well, Sony's also in a unique position where they have that app, too, that they're doing on the PlayStation 4.
1164000	1168000	So they could always drop something into that, too, if they wanted to. I don't know.
1168000	1175000	You know, again, there's a lot of questions about this game, so I think many of us would like an update. So, we'll see.
1175000	1180000	Anyhow, speaking of wanting an update, let's talk about the other half of the kickoff topic I wanted to do tonight.
1180000	1189000	And that is your own personal thing you want to get out of this year's E3. Like, what's the one thing you're, like, really curious?
1189000	1193000	I'm not talking prediction because that'll be later, but I'm talking, like, what are you genuinely curious about?
1193000	1197000	What is the thing you want to see more information about at the show?
1197000	1201000	I'll start with Jamie because I have a pretty good guess what she might say, but sometimes she surprises me.
1201000	1202000	Well, apart from Mass Effect stuff.
1202000	1203000	Okay, that was my guess.
1203000	1213000	I actually want to know if any of the previous characters played in Dragon Age or Dragon Age 2 will have any real bearing or appearance in Dragon Age Inquisition.
1213000	1223000	Gotcha. So, Dragon Age Inquisition isn't that far out from release, so you want, like, those final details. Like, who am I going to be able to play? Who am I not? What's going on?
1223000	1227000	Also, I'm super happy about it, though.
1227000	1228000	What?
1229000	1238000	Like, Vivienne looks amazing. Some of the characters just look really nice. I'm trying to be hopeful about it and hope that they don't pull, you know, what they did with Mass Effect 3.
1238000	1242000	Different script writers! It's done! It's over! No.
1242000	1249000	Let's see. Going to our chat room because the live listeners did come back, thank heavens, over at live.vognetwork.com.
1249000	1253000	WhatupG says, Kevin Butler comes on stage. Last Guardian this.
1253000	1257000	I don't know if Kevin, I think the Kevin Butler thing's kind of dead. I don't know. I don't know.
1257000	1262000	Loki, what about the thing you most personally want to see at E3 this year?
1262000	1271000	I just want to see a reason to buy any of these new systems, to be honest. I mean, because, I don't know. I just, I want to see new stuff. I want to see, like, the stuff that hasn't been announced yet.
1271000	1278000	I don't give a shit about fucking Fable Anniversary or Halo Anniversary. I want to see some new shit. That's what I want to see.
1278000	1282000	So it's games specifically, not peripherals. It's like, where are the freaking games?
1282000	1293000	I don't even know if there would be anything peripheral-wise that I'd be even interested in. I mean, I don't know. I guess Project Morpheus might be neat to see if they had any information like when that's actually coming out or something.
1293000	1311000	But I don't think that they're going to have any of that so early. Honestly, I'd be interested to see a little bit more on Sunset Overdrive. Anything from Sony because I don't even know what the hell they have coming out for the rest of the year. Nothing new, at least.
1312000	1322000	And then Nintendo. Shit, give me a fucking reason to buy the Wii U. I mean, because Mario Kart's cool, but I need something. I'm not going to invest $300 to play one game.
1322000	1328000	Or, I guess, two because you get a free game. But I'm not going to invest $300 to buy a handful of games.
1328000	1330000	Funny enough, though, a lot of people did.
1331000	1348000	That's cool, but see, I did that with the Wii, and the Wii has collected dust for several years now, so I'm just not going to do that. I need a reason. Because eventually, Mario Kart will get burnt out, and then it's going to be like, okay, what now?
1348000	1359000	So, I just need to see why I need one of these consoles. I mean, I want a new console. It'd be kind of cool to have one, but I need a game that I'm really excited about.
1359000	1374000	Like, it would be totally awesome to see a new Saints Row game. I would be down with that. As long as they just don't go fucking crazy. I would just reboot the shit. I mean, seriously, it's beyond ridiculous right now.
1374000	1380000	I hope they go back, they tone it down a bit. It'd be nice.
1380000	1387000	Now, some of you guys out there might be kind of a little surprised that Loki doesn't own a new console, but there's plenty of people that haven't made that plunge yet. Plenty of plenty of people.
1387000	1393000	In fact, I'm looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, and SHA100Matt says,
1393000	1402000	Actually, this E3, more than last year's, will weigh a lot more in my decision making in buying a console. And Dungeon Buster says, I'm still not buying a system yet either.
1403000	1406000	Three of the four of us in this room right now have not taken the plunge yet.
1406000	1410000	Oh, I thought Dark Soccer, you guys had a PS4 at home. I guess I'm home.
1410000	1411000	No.
1411000	1412000	Oh, why did I think that?
1412000	1415000	Dan just spent $500 on a new driving rig.
1415000	1417000	No, then I'm the big consumer whore in the room.
1417000	1418000	And how?
1418000	1419000	But I don't have a one.
1419000	1420000	Shocking.
1420000	1425000	And to address Bobby, Saints Row 4 is so successful they need to go back and boot it when it wasn't selling that well.
1425000	1434000	Do remember that there is quite a bit of difference in time from the game that came out last year versus the original game that came out in 2006.
1434000	1438000	Quite a few more people have bought the consoles since then.
1438000	1443000	I think they could also do it. The very first game that came out was a little more serious. I was trying to be a competitor.
1443000	1449000	Saints Row 2. Saints Row 2 had a perfect balance between crazy and kind of toned down, and the story was fantastic.
1449000	1455000	And you know what? Just building off of that and just going a little bit crazy like they did with Saints Row 3, I think that was fine.
1455000	1461000	It's just when you get to, like, they're fucking in space in, like, you know, the Matrix and shit.
1461000	1466000	It's not even fucking original. It's so ripped off of everything, and it doesn't make any sense anymore.
1466000	1472000	That's the thing. It's cool that they have a superhero game now, but it doesn't make any fucking sense.
1472000	1479000	And yeah, okay, that might be the point, but it's just, it's not Saints Row anymore. It's another fucking game that they have the Saints Row title on.
1479000	1482000	It's fucking Lords of Shadows, okay? That's what it is.
1482000	1486000	S2100mattinchat says, Loki has a new console. It's called a baby.
1486000	1488000	I already had a baby.
1488000	1491000	Does it have a power switch? Alright. I'll talk about mine.
1491000	1498000	The thing I am most curious about at this year's E3, I want to see if Nintendo makes a Hail Mary play.
1498000	1507000	That is, you know, and I realize they may not. I realize we may know most everything that's happening with Nintendo between Smash Brothers and Bayonetta.
1507000	1510000	Like, we have a pretty good idea what their holiday lineup looks like.
1510000	1514000	But, you know, out there in the media, the Wii U has been getting dogpiled a little bit.
1514000	1519000	Yes, there is a little sparkle, a little glimmer of hope with what's going on with Mario Kart 8.
1519000	1527000	But whatever Nintendo's plan is for this E3 was thought up long before the sales figures for games that came out just last week came in.
1527000	1533000	So, I'm very curious to see what Nintendo's Hail Mary plan will be, if there is one.
1533000	1538000	I mean, I fully realize it may be par for the course, but there's that part of me that goes,
1538000	1546000	okay, for all the crap we've given Nintendo over the years about they don't get online, they don't get online, Mario Kart 8, it didn't go down.
1546000	1550000	The YouTube thing actually works out pretty well. It's become a meme.
1550000	1554000	It's so, the level of detail in the game is so well done, it's down to that level.
1554000	1560000	You kind of go, could there be more of this coming from Nintendo that we just don't know about yet?
1560000	1567000	And could it really make us go, wow, like, I never thought Nintendo was going to do that and they finally freaking did it.
1567000	1573000	Like, I'm talking like, if they came out and said Pokemon MMO and just put it all out on the table.
1573000	1579000	You know, that's the type of like Hail Mary thing I'm talking about, where it's like they finally do something we never thought they would do.
1579000	1584000	And it's in a fit of desperation, in a sense, to win back the public.
1584000	1592000	Because Nintendo, I mean, I have a lot of friends, especially, that will loyally support Nintendo through a lot and will defend Nintendo through a lot.
1592000	1597000	You know, Nintendo is a very big brand that a lot of people really kind of, you know, tie to and connect with.
1597000	1604000	And I think they're always going to have that little group, but I'm really curious, what are they going to do to really push the envelope and open it up to everybody?
1604000	1609000	Will they finally make the Pokemon console game that they've always refused to make?
1609000	1614000	I'm not talking stadium, I'm not talking, I'm talking like the RPG adventure or the MMO.
1614000	1620000	I'm talking, are they going to do, are they going to do a Metroid that looks like a freaking Halo game?
1620000	1625000	That's online and, you know, shoot them up, player thing, because, I don't know, they think that's what people want.
1625000	1631000	I really want to see, like, what is that thing where Nintendo really breaks the mold we've all come to expect from them.
1632000	1635000	So, we'll see. That's what I'm looking forward to see, but we'll see.
1635000	1643000	And vidpower in our chatroom kind of backs that up. Good guy Nintendo, free servers, didn't go down when Mario Kart 8 came out.
1643000	1650000	So, but, to be fair, it's one game. It's one game. Alright, you cracked the seal.
1650000	1655000	Now let's, you know, let's see the waterfall of games that you're going to have next.
1655000	1661000	Alright, Jason, how about you? Lastly, you. What is the thing you personally want to see more of at E3?
1661000	1667000	E3 is at a really, really strange time in, like, the course of video game development right now.
1667000	1675000	And I say that because Nintendo has been around since, the Wii U has been around since 2012 and everything else since the end of 2013.
1675000	1684000	The point I was going to make was that I'm looking forward to seeing games that are going to have that not release window polish on them.
1684000	1692000	And I think that's still going to hold true, but I think that they're not nearly developed far enough yet that it will be as meaningful as I want it to be.
1692000	1700000	But that's really what I'm looking forward to this year is just that, like, this year to me is going to be future outlook.
1700000	1707000	Like, maybe holiday season, but probably getting us to next E3 when everything new is actually going to be on the show floor.
1707000	1711000	You know, there's a lot of talk about all these games that are being delayed to 2015.
1711000	1717000	There's so many of them, we don't even have them all in our show world tonight. In fact, one I know that's not on the show world, it was big news.
1717000	1721000	The next Batman game pushed to 2015, which is huge news, right?
1721000	1724000	Yeah, I kind of knew about that a few weeks ago.
1724000	1725000	Why didn't you say something?
1725000	1729000	Well, because it's financial year 2015, and I thought that was sometime in October.
1729000	1730000	Oh, okay, gotcha.
1730000	1740000	I didn't realize it was actually next year. If I had known when their fiscal started, I would have been able to drop that bombshell a few weeks ago.
1740000	1747000	Yeah, it's just... I don't know. I'm not surprised, because that's a pretty ambitious game. Sorry.
1747000	1748000	Go ahead.
1748000	1755000	I was just going to say, so Jason, what I think I'm hearing from you is that you want to see even beyond all these games getting pushed back to 2015.
1755000	1760000	You're like, what is the life vision for these consoles? What does the life expect to see? Is that kind of what I'm hearing?
1760000	1761000	To an extent.
1761000	1763000	Like, you want to see the five year plan.
1763000	1768000	It's more than just consoles, too, because it's also things like the new Unreal Engine that just came out a couple of months ago.
1768000	1773000	There are an Oculus continuing its theme, Project Morpheus, coming up and actually doing something.
1773000	1780000	Like, right now, all of these technologies that have hit in the last six months or so, they are a thing now.
1780000	1785000	So we're going to get a tiny, tiny little glimpse about what that's going to mean for gaming.
1785000	1793000	Probably not in the next year, because this shit takes forever to develop, but it's going to be the seeds, the inklings for the next one or two years.
1793000	1797000	You should go to the Game Developers Conference next year. I think you might get more there, but...
1797000	1801000	Don't need to spend more time in the Bay Area, but I probably will.
1801000	1802000	I understand.
1802000	1812000	Yeah, there are coworkers. Me and a couple of coworkers are trying to drum up support and we're trying to make a bigger deal about gaming within our company and going to these kinds of events.
1812000	1817000	Co-workers of mine have been at GDC, and if timing works out, I would absolutely love to do that.
1817000	1832000	Yeah, as I've said on the show, I'm not exactly a full-time gamer, I'm also not a developer, but I'm kind of gravitating towards engine production development and interest in that thing on a technical level.
1832000	1836000	And so, my answer falls right in line with that.
1837000	1846000	Now, next week's kickoff topic, I'm going to actually give you seven days notice on the kickoff topic. Next week's kickoff topic will be, were you satisfied with what you saw?
1846000	1852000	So I'm going to follow up and see if Dark Soccer got the Dragon Age and Mass Effect info she wanted. I'm going to see if Loki found a reason to buy a console.
1852000	1853000	No, my answer is no.
1853000	1855000	You don't know yet. Sit down.
1855000	1865000	I do know, because here is the fucking Nintendo E3, whatever you want, live from the treehouse, because it's like a fucking kid's meal at Burger King or something.
1865000	1871000	It's going to be too much fucking 3DS, not enough Wii U, and it's just going to be yay. That's about it.
1871000	1874000	If it's a treehouse, does that mean there's going to be a new Donkey Kong Country?
1874000	1881000	No, I don't know what the fuck the treehouse is supposed to be, but that's what they call their fucking event.
1881000	1886000	But that's what it's going to be. It's mostly 3DS, because that's where the money is right now.
1886000	1890000	I hope Iwata didn't go to E3, because he's coming over to kick your ass.
1891000	1895000	Bring it on. That guy can't be that tall. I'm sure I can take him.
1895000	1906000	Oh, anyways, last bit. You know what I'd love to see? I know this is such a long shot. I think Half-Life 3 being revealed would be more likely.
1906000	1908000	I'd love to see a new console DDR.
1908000	1910000	Yeah, that'd be nice.
1910000	1911000	That's just never going to happen.
1911000	1912000	That'd be nice.
1912000	1917000	Alright, Jason, I know you're not going to be, or will you be here for the next show? Are you back to Colorado?
1917000	1926000	I haven't decided. I think, you know, we're driving back on Saturday. I think I should get home, which means driving all day Sunday and most of Monday.
1926000	1927000	Gotcha.
1927000	1930000	But I haven't actually decided yet, so perhaps see you folks next week.
1930000	1937000	Perhaps. We'll Skype you if nothing else, just to figure out if you got to see your long-term vision or whatever, and I'll let you know if Nintendo...
1937000	1942000	I think mine will probably be pretty easy, because I think you're all going to be feeling it if I feel it.
1942000	1952000	So, anyway, I want to do housekeeping first, and then do our gaming week, which I know is a little out of order, but I'm going to use housekeeping, of course, to promote what we're working on at VoG Network.
1952000	1958000	E3.vognetwork.com. It is our live, interactive coverage at the Voice of the Geeks network of the E3 Expo.
1958000	1967000	Myself, Bobby, Jason will be like half us and half his day job, so two and a half times the coverage we had last year when it was just one person.
1967000	1972000	What happens is that we are the second place to go for all the information.
1972000	1986000	Look, we're not delusional. We know y'all go to Twitch or IGN or GameSpot, whatever, one of those sites, to go figure out what's breaking at E3 and see everything for the first time and see all those press releases turned into articles and all that stuff.
1986000	1991000	That's great. Go to those sites. Absorb the information. Get everything you can on the games.
1991000	2001000	But then, when you're kind of sick of reading the same thing over and over and over again, and you've got this burning question that isn't being answered anywhere else, come on over to E3.vognetwork.com and ask it.
2001000	2010000	We are your voice out there on the show floor. We can't guarantee everybody's going to talk. We can't guarantee everybody's going to answer your question. We're not going to get the runaround, but we're going to try.
2010000	2017000	And usually we found, I'm just kind of warning you guys from years past, the bigger the developer, the less willing they are to go off script.
2017000	2025000	So if you want Square Enix to talk about Final Fantasy XV when they flat out said it's not the show this year, you can try, but the answer's probably going to be Fat Chance.
2025000	2042000	However, some of these other developers that are pretty open and want to talk to their people, like I'm sure the folks, if there is a Saints Row 5 or a Saints Row reboot of that type of thing announced, I'm sure they'll be more than happy to talk about those games and answer those types of questions.
2043000	2045000	Still buy it, whatever it is.
2045000	2046000	Of course you will. You know you will.
2046000	2047000	I know.
2047000	2057000	You know, the folks that make The Witcher are pretty good. Those games that aren't necessarily the AAA titles, but are kind of like just below that are usually pretty good about talking up their stuff at E3.
2057000	2067000	So ask away, we'll try, if nothing else. Funny enough, and I just said that, but probably the biggest break we got last year was we got a Disney scoop.
2067000	2076000	Thanks to the interactive coverage, you know, they announced Disney Infinity last year and they talked about all these figurines and somebody went under our site and said, you know, I've seen all this talk about the figurines.
2076000	2078000	Nobody said about how much are they going to cost.
2078000	2084000	So Rob and Bobby, I want you to find, well actually it was just Bobby last year, Bobby find out how much those figurines are.
2084000	2085000	And he did.
2085000	2086000	Wasn't my main question.
2086000	2087000	It might have been, was it your question? I don't know, somebody.
2087000	2089000	No, my answer.
2089000	2094000	No. Bobby got word on the show floor, you confirmed it, basically.
2094000	2096000	I already know how much they are.
2096000	2104000	Anyway, so yeah, that's the kind of good stuff that's going to come out of the coverage. E3.vognetwork.com. Check it out.
2104000	2111000	Alright, and that's all I have for Housekeeping. We will be back here next Sunday. There will be sadly no special shows during the show.
2111000	2116000	What we're going to try to do is use that time to book interviews for future episodes.
2116000	2121000	I may try to record some stuff there to play during future shows, but that's that.
2122000	2126000	We are looking at having a live interview on the show on the 22nd, actually.
2126000	2130000	But I will talk more about that next week because I don't have everything signed and dotted and all that.
2130000	2132000	And I don't want to promote something I don't know for sure.
2132000	2137000	So something, I'll tell you this, it's kind of a neat game that a lot of people are talking about right now.
2137000	2140000	So we'll hopefully have more info for you next week on that.
2140000	2145000	Alright, meantime, let's go into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.
2145000	2147000	We'll go through this pretty quick.
2147000	2148000	Dark Sakura.
2148000	2158000	So far just Animal Crossing, although I did actually manage to get a little bit of time this afternoon to play through some Final Fantasy XIV and just hit the level I've been trying to get.
2158000	2166000	So now I get to do like five quests and then grind for another two levels until I can get the next bit of my story quest.
2166000	2172000	So no one will still do that dungeon with me. The D-whatever, DD.
2172000	2174000	I'm just never on when you are.
2174000	2175000	I never remember the name.
2175000	2176000	Dazmiel, Darkhold, whatever.
2176000	2177000	Yeah, whatever it's called.
2177000	2178000	That's an interesting one.
2178000	2181000	If I wasn't gone all next week, I'd help you.
2181000	2182000	It's okay.
2182000	2183000	You'll get it.
2183000	2186000	Yeah, so I've really had a very minimalist week.
2186000	2187000	Alright.
2187000	2189000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2189000	2193000	I only played Goat Simulator version 1.1.
2193000	2196000	I only played a little bit of it because they have a lot of stuff that they added.
2196000	2198000	They added a whole new section of the maps.
2198000	2206000	If you go into the tunnel now, it'll allow you to travel to some coastal town thing that they made.
2206000	2208000	It's got all sorts of crazy stuff.
2208000	2214000	It has its own theme park and you can stick your tongue to the rollercoaster and do some stuff with there.
2214000	2219000	Plus they have goat parkour in there now and you can ride a skateboard and ride a bike.
2219000	2228000	The only thing I didn't like about it is that the goat, they seem to have increased the speed of the goat really really really fast now for some reason.
2228000	2230000	I'm not sure why that is.
2230000	2235000	So it's kind of hard to control sometimes because it doesn't run like it used to.
2235000	2238000	But it's still silly.
2238000	2240000	It's still a fun game.
2240000	2242000	So definitely check it out.
2242000	2245000	If you bought it earlier, check out the new patch because it was free.
2245000	2248000	Lots of stuff in there.
2248000	2253000	Including Minecraft, which I haven't found yet, but there's a ton of stuff in the game.
2253000	2255000	That's it. That's all I played.
2255000	2256000	Alright.
2257000	2263000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, map.
2263000	2265000	Jason, how about you? How was your gaming week?
2265000	2268000	I did finally get a chance to play Mario Kart.
2268000	2273000	It did come in on Monday and I've played a couple of multiplayer and a couple of solo rounds.
2273000	2278000	I don't think I have anything else particularly interesting to add on top of what you did, but it is a great game.
2278000	2280000	It runs so well.
2280000	2285000	I have clips from my personal favorite races up on YouTube.
2286000	2294000	That replay feature, I completely agree with the point that you made in that these are going to get really old really fast.
2294000	2301000	And by the time that everybody else figures them out and starts posting every single one because they can, we're going to be like, yeah, we saw that.
2301000	2309000	But the actual mechanics for not just 100% defaults of how it makes the replays, but also the little tweaks.
2310000	2318000	If anybody out there listening has Mario Kart 8 and has not hit edit replay highlights or something like that, you can choose the racers to feature.
2318000	2322000	You can bump it up to 60 seconds, 30, 45, or 60.
2322000	2327000	You can also do all, but it's worthless unless you're going to watch it because you can only post up to 60 seconds to YouTube.
2327000	2328000	Right.
2328000	2338000	But you can actually tweak these tiny little things about the race and it makes it a lot better because we're not just seeing one person zoom around racers at opportunistic times and all that kind of stuff.
2338000	2341000	But the replay feature is grand.
2341000	2345000	For as being hands off as it is, they did a wonderful job.
2345000	2351000	I'm enjoying that game thoroughly and unfortunately it's at a place I'm not going to be full time.
2351000	2352000	Anyways, whatever, no big deal.
2354000	2359000	I played that while I was killing time before coming up to Sacramento yesterday, more Titanfall.
2360000	2364000	And I think there was something, but I'm totally 100% drawing a blank.
2364000	2366000	I went to Scandi again and that was fun.
2366000	2371000	I actually got to use the headphone ports for all three, Technica, Popn, and 2DX.
2371000	2380000	And it makes a difference because I have big over the ear headphones and you kill all of the other arcade noise, mostly, and just hear game sounds.
2380000	2383000	And it's very, it makes the experience quite a bit better.
2384000	2386000	Yeah. Oh, oh, that's what I was going to say.
2386000	2389000	Does anybody in this room know what the term yak shaving means?
2391000	2394000	Well, it certainly conjures a particular image to mind.
2394000	2398000	In the quick summary of it is that you need to go check the mail.
2399000	2401000	It's a sub-zero blizzard outside.
2402000	2403000	So you need a coat.
2403000	2404000	You don't have a coat.
2404000	2407000	You need to go shave your yak to get the fur to make a coat.
2408000	2412000	It's a series of steps that you fumble over in order to actually accomplish one thing.
2413000	2414000	That was my week in a nutshell.
2415000	2423000	I bought a recorder for E3 and systematically failed to be able to put micro SD cards that I had and ordered to use.
2424000	2427000	And to top it all off, I was putting them in backwards.
2428000	2429000	I discovered that today.
2432000	2443000	Sony's instructions are terrible because the words tell you when you put a Vita or M2, whatever their brand is, when you put a Vita card in, the contacts face you.
2444000	2449000	When you put a micro SD card in, you put a label towards you.
2450000	2451000	The two of them are opposite.
2452000	2459000	I didn't notice in the diagram that facing you is the back of the recorder.
2460000	2465000	So despite the fact that I could just pop it and put it right in while looking at the face of the unit, no, it's backwards!
2466000	2467000	Fuck you, Sony.
2470000	2471000	Thank you.
2471000	2482000	But it's working, and I have more battery capacity and SD cards than there is time in the week, literally 24 hours times 7 days a week.
2483000	2484000	So I'm ready, I hope.
2485000	2494000	Alright. My gaming week, I also played more Mario Kart, which I talked extensively about last week, so I won't repeat myself, except to say that I finally played some 4-player matches.
2495000	2498000	Still disappointed you can't get one of those people on the gamepad by themselves.
2498000	2503000	I do notice a little bit of a framerate dip in those matches, but it's not the end of the world.
2504000	2508000	I'm getting really nitpicky at that point when I get into that. Still a lot of fun, and that's the most important thing of all.
2509000	2514000	Also on the Wii U, I finally got to play the Wario. It's not WarioWare, it's like Game & Wario, it's just another mini-game collection.
2515000	2519000	Yeah, okay, it's a mini-game collection, party games, you know, I had five people over here last night.
2520000	2523000	It was fun for that, and that's, you know, it was cute.
2523000	2532000	You play this game where you launch people onto platforms, and then like, as you land, you might knock other people off, and the platforms move. It's silly. Silly stuff.
2533000	2538000	I played Rob's NES Remix and NES Remix 2. It reminded me of Dance Master Mode from DDR. I completely forgot that.
2539000	2540000	Super fun.
2541000	2542000	You unlocked Clu Clu Land for me.
2543000	2544000	I unlocked the first stage of Clu Clu Land.
2544000	2545000	Yay!
2546000	2573000	Okay, also, a game I've been spending a little more time with this week, I bought, it came out, and some of you might be surprised to hear I bought this, but I picked up on the 3DS since I had some credit on the Nintendo store from buying all this other stuff, and I had the Nintendo Wii U Deluxe, so I get all that 10% back or whatever, and now that store is across both the Wii U and the 3DS, so I was able to get Tomodachi Life at a discounted price.
2574000	2591000	Now, yes, there was a lot of controversy around this game, which we got into a couple weeks ago on the show, and I said my piece, but I think it's important to realize that Nintendo did apologize for that, and I think the gaming community as a whole, for the most part, accepted Nintendo's second apology. Unfortunately, it took them two times to get it right.
2591000	2611000	But I decided, you know what, I like these type of sim games anyway, I was a fan of Animal Crossing, I'm gonna check the game out. I realize some of my GLBT family does not feel the same way, and there's some people out there that feel very strongly that Nintendo screwed up, and we should not be buying Tomodachi Life.
2611000	2623000	However, if people continue to hold grudges against me for my entire life, for things that I've had to apologize for in the past, and with 555 episodes of this program, I've said some stupid shit I've had to apologize for in the past.
2623000	2631000	If people held grudges against me for the rest of my life, I wouldn't like that very much, and that would be really sad and depressing that there would be literally nothing I could do to make things right.
2631000	2640000	My point is, they apologized, let's move on. That being said, I want to put that whole controversy behind us and kind of evaluate the game as a game.
2640000	2650000	Well, alright, I guess I should get this out there. It's really, really easy to kind of get what I want in that sort of like romance department, so here's what I did.
2650000	2671000	You can't change the gender of a Mii that you import from your own, like Mii Plaza or the Miis that are saved on your system and so forth, but what you can do is you can make a new Mii, and you can make it a male or female, and all the same facial features, beards, lipstick, mole, beauty marks, whatever, are the same same, male or female.
2671000	2679000	You can do whatever you want. You want to make Conchita worst? You can. So what I did is I created Alan in the game as a female, and he knows that I did this.
2679000	2688000	And so, his character and my character, funny enough, are getting into a relationship right now. They're doing that whole courting each other, having long walks on the beach thing. It's really adorable.
2689000	2706000	So it really wasn't that hard to work around. So I say that both as a pro and a con, in that the pro is that if you really want to set up a same-sex relationship, as long as you're willing to overlook a few things such as misgendering, but I just kind of giggle it off.
2706000	2716000	You know, it'll keep referring to Alan as a she, but I just think of it as like an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race. You know, like, how is she, though? How is she a girl?
2716000	2727000	And I just kind of picture it like that in my mind, and it's fine. If you're willing to kind of overlook that little bit of silliness, it works just fine, and it's really easy to set up.
2727000	2738000	But the con that I also say to that is that it was really easy to set up, and I'm buying a little less and less that it would have taken a lot for Nintendo to fix this.
2738000	2746000	I'm not a programmer, so I'm not really going to try to get into it, but I just kind of think if Nintendo had really wanted to do it, they could have.
2746000	2758000	But I do think at the end of the day, they were a bit lazy and probably ignorant, which, you know, okay, they've apologized, you know, I've done some lazy and ignorant things in my life, you know, whatever.
2758000	2766000	We'll move on and see what happens in the future. Anyway, now I'm really done with that topic, but I felt like I had to tell you the whole story on what's going on there.
2766000	2773000	Let's talk about the game itself, and kind of just trying to look at it from that neutral standpoint.
2773000	2781000	The game is really nothing like Animal Crossing, in my opinion. I know we kind of keep comparing it to that, but it really isn't like that at all.
2781000	2792000	It's a little more like a, honestly, it plays like a Facebook game, and I realize that can be seen as like a negative, but that's really what I think it is.
2792000	2800000	You check in on it once in a while and, oh, somebody wants to be fed, or oh, somebody wants new clothes, and oh, they want to feed me, feed me, burp me, burp me.
2800000	2804000	So, it's Nintendmes instead of Nintendogs.
2804000	2812000	Actually, that's not a bad way to look at it. It's almost like Nintendogs with people is almost a better way to look at it than Animal Crossing.
2812000	2820000	Ironically, there was also the Sony game that came out this week that was Nintendogs, but they talked like people, and that was weird.
2820000	2834000	So, anyway, but what are you rewarded with for, you know, feed me, feed me, change my clothes, do whatever, tell me about if this person and I would make a good match or whatever.
2834000	2846000	You get rewarded with story, and it's very much a fishbowl game. You're looking at these little virtual pets, which is why I think maybe Nintendogs is kind of a great comparison, because you're rewarded with the story.
2846000	2860000	And when you have like 30 or something villagers in your little town that are all based off me's that you made, either me's made off celebrities, me's from people you know with these QR codes and so forth, you kind of get these little stories.
2860000	2875000	And so, this causes you to be able to go to other people and to go, Loki, he'll never guess what you did in my town. Oh, my God, you were acting so stupid, and you would not believe that you're in a relationship with Lady Gaga, who I imported a me that looks like Lady Gaga to my town.
2875000	2887000	And it's like those little silly story sharings. It's very quirky. There's a lot of like, you know, let's sing karaoke. You don't actually sing karaoke, but you watch your characters sing pop songs and make these silly music videos.
2887000	2896000	And there's this nightly news element in it where you hear about the crazy antics that your me's are getting into and me's on the street will be interviewed, which are the me's there.
2896000	2908000	So, I mean, that's what it is. Essentially, it's this big, you'll never guess what the people in my sim are doing, which is, again, kind of goes back to The Sims. The Sims, you know, was a big thing like that.
2908000	2919000	He'll never guess what I did in my house. Okay, so I built a pool, and I had everybody go in the pool, and then I got rid of the ladder, and you'll never guess what happened, right? Those are the kinds of stories that we create out of these types of games.
2919000	2928000	And that's what you do get in Tomodachi Life is those stories and that aspect of it, but the game aspect, you guys, is really, really weak.
2928000	2944000	There's no fishing like in Animoid. There's no bug catching. There's really none of that. Sometimes you get into a, pick a card out of my hand and let's see who gets a pair first, or here's a picture zoomed in three times the regular amount.
2944000	2952000	What could it be? There's really crappy throwaway minigames like that that you can play that sometimes they'll want to play, but it's nothing.
2952000	2963000	It would be hilarious if it's just so, like, disturbed. What is it? It's my penis. It's my penis. Whoa, that was unexpected.
2963000	2964000	No, no, nothing like that.
2964000	2966000	Lady Gaga.
2966000	2971000	Sometimes there's, they have a lot of weird items and things in the game, but that's really it.
2971000	2984000	So, here's the thing, the bottom line on this game. I do think it serves a cute purpose, and for people that want a nice little distraction, it's a polished game that allows you to kind of interact with the people.
2984000	2995000	It's like a Facebook game. If you're the type of person that doesn't mind checking in with a Facebook game every, you know, day or so for a good 15 minutes to just kind of check on people and so forth, Tomodachi Life is a very polished version of that game.
2995000	3006000	But if you're looking for a game, you're not going to find it here. And I, for that reason, kind of give it, I'm tepidly positive on this game.
3006000	3015000	I'm not, like, super enthusiastic positive. I kind of think it does what it needs to do. I'm not sure it's worth $35 at the end of the day.
3015000	3022000	I think this is a $20 game, not a $35 game. Or this is a game that Nintendo will give away a year from now to get you to buy something else.
3022000	3029000	I kind of don't think $35 is worth it for this game. And that's what I have to say on Tomodachi Life.
3029000	3039000	If you disagree with me, you can always email us in your thoughts on the game. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send something.
3039000	3047000	I'm looking at her chat to see if anything has come up on that, what I was just talking about. Dark Tetsuya says at Live.vognetwork.com.
3047000	3054000	So it's sort of like a soap opera or not quite that deep? Well, is a soap opera really that deep, Dark Tetsuya?
3054000	3062000	It's a telenovela, let's put it that way. It's a telenovela. It's a little bit like that. So, yeah, there you go.
3062000	3071000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news now that we've all gone with our gaming weeks and talk about what really is going on in the gaming world this week. Loki.
3071000	3087000	Alright, so this kind of leaked out based off of people being at the convention center early and taking some photographs from the inside, kind of looking at booths being constructed and stuff.
3087000	3094000	And one of the things that was spotted at Nintendo's booth was this big old banner for something called Mario Maker.
3094000	3107000	And it kind of shows a picture of the Super Mario Brothers 1 style graphics with someone placing a piranha plant with a stylus.
3107000	3117000	So what is it? You know, is it something for 3DS? Is it something for Wii U? No idea, but it looks like a game that revolves around making your own 2D Mario levels.
3117000	3121000	Is it a game for both, wiggling eyebrows?
3122000	3134000	It could be. I mean, shit, if the Wii U can't handle 2D Mario, which it should be able to since it runs on Virtual Console, and it's also an NES Remix, I think that they could probably handle this.
3134000	3141000	Hey, maybe it's based off of the engine that runs NES Remix since they kind of remix the games there anyways.
3141000	3149000	Maybe you could be absolutely right, actually, on that. Thoughts? You and I were joking before the show. You kind of said this on an earlier show.
3149000	3159000	Yeah, I only said this like, I don't even know how long ago, but yeah, it makes sense. I think it was back when I was saying how Nintendo doesn't really want to put effort into some of these games at the release.
3159000	3166000	Like, for example, Virtual Console and stuff like that. They'll re-release a game and they won't really add that many features into it.
3166000	3174000	Well, just add a game that people like, like Mario Brothers or something. Add a level creator and have a way where you can share levels and stuff like that. There you go.
3174000	3181000	All your community creates the content for you. You have to do no work other than building that editor, which you probably have anyways.
3181000	3188000	Although I don't know if I want to believe the rumor or not. I mean, we're going to find out in two days anyway.
3188000	3203000	You know, I feel like this is a very logical step for Nintendo. It makes a lot of sense. So if it's a made-up thing, it's a really good and convincing made-up thing because this is something where I could see Nintendo going in this direction.
3203000	3211000	It's essentially Little Big Planet starring Mario in a way. And I think that's a really good thing for Nintendo right now.
3211000	3219000	Because if you think about it, they don't really have a lot like it. I mean, back in the day, you could edit Excitebike tracks, but what could you really do with that?
3219000	3227000	Even here in the States, we didn't have the Famicom Disk System, so you couldn't even save what you did. It was like, come over and I'm going to design a track while you do something else and you can play my track.
3228000	3235000	And there's been like little editing in that way. I think maybe some Super Nintendo games had like three slots. You could save things. Like little things like that.
3235000	3245000	But nothing that I can think of that's really incorporated the internet. Like I'm really trying to think on something that kind of does that create and share that really Little Big Planet is based on the Nintendo universe. I'm drawing a blank.
3245000	3253000	Smash Brothers Brawl. Which also had a limit of what, like four or five stages I think. If I remember correctly.
3254000	3266000	Still, I would argue there's a pretty significant difference between something of that caliber and taking a game like a 2D platformer like Mario and opening that up to everybody to kind of do their own thing.
3266000	3271000	Look how many ROM hacks there are for Mario. We're going to have asshole Mario officially.
3272000	3277000	And I think a lot of people have been wondering, why doesn't Nintendo just embrace this? Everybody wants to hack the game.
3277000	3284000	When I talk about Nintendo making a Hail Mary play and doing something that none of us expect, this is kind of in line with that.
3284000	3289000	I have an answer to that question. Swap, note, spot, pass. That's why.
3290000	3301000	So do you think there is a concern that people will make levels that are giant blocks that say fuck, shit, cunt as you run through the level and Nintendo's worried about having to police that?
3301000	3312000	It may be community created, but it's still moderator curated. Like yes, they will have to enforce that kind of thing if it is publicly accessible for everybody. Even if it's not, they probably have to.
3312000	3322000	Like this is the Nintendo Network and Miiverse and all of this stuff where people drive the content. Yes, that's true, but Nintendo has very, very, very, very strict social guidelines.
3322000	3327000	So they can't have everything doing this. They have just enough that they have manpower.
3327000	3331000	I wish they'd do this with the original Mario Kart and make their own track editor would be awesome.
3331000	3340000	Well, you never know. I mean, I just see with Nintendo getting more and more into the online thing, again, this makes, because I could see you could share your levels on Miiverse quite easily.
3340000	3348000	And Nintendo does have that moderator thing in place. So maybe like little big planet, there'll be a way to report offensive levels and they'll be able to look at it.
3348000	3355000	Like there's probably a way they can look at the file on their screen and just see the level all at once and see if anything offensive is in it and take action that way.
3355000	3363000	So I don't know. So maybe Nintendo is going to start to embrace this and logically it makes a lot of sense. I hope it's true.
3363000	3369000	It seems like it also seems like a stupidly easy thing for Nintendo to make. Doesn't it?
3369000	3375000	And also like something that they could do for one, two, three world. I mean.
3375000	3386000	Yeah. Like one of the best parts of NES Remix 2 was that whole, I'm playing as the princess in Super Mario 3. That's so trippy, but awesome.
3386000	3396000	Like that was, that was like one of the highlights for me. So yeah, you're right. If they could kind of fuse all that together, if Mario Maker is not just Mario one, or maybe it's Mario one to start.
3396000	3403000	But if you want the DLC for Mario two and three, you got to buy the virtual console game and now it'll come with it.
3403000	3410000	Who knows? Who knows? It'll be interesting to see what Nintendo gets into with that.
3410000	3420000	If Mario Maker comes out, let's hypothesize you owned a Wii U. Let's say Mario Maker comes out. It's a $30 game. Would you buy it?
3420000	3422000	For 30 bucks? No.
3422000	3424000	30 bucks? Still too much, huh?
3425000	3433000	There'd have to be some significant stuff in there. And I just, honestly, if I want to play ROM hacked Mario games, there's plenty of them out there.
3433000	3444000	There's plenty of them out there that do even like trippier stuff than just rearranging the levels. You know it'd be, well, Metroid would be cool too, because I've seen a lot of ROM hacked Metroid stuff.
3444000	3452000	But anything ROM hacked sometimes is pretty, you know, interesting, especially when you're, you know, redesigning levels and there's some pretty cool levels out there.
3452000	3456000	There's even custom storylines for Earthbound Mother 2 and Mother 3.
3456000	3466000	I'm curious for Jamie and Jason's thoughts on this real quick, but going to the chatroom at live.voggetnetwork.com, Blender says LittleBigPlanet has a strict policy and will remove levels.
3466000	3474000	So, you know, it's not like this format of having levels and moderating them and so forth doesn't already exist somewhere else.
3474000	3483000	And if I remember correctly, they even outright, well, no, I've played custom levels that have eye taken, camera taken photos. Never mind.
3483000	3488000	But they probably moderate those much more strictly because the real world and a camera and part of your level.
3488000	3494000	Yep. Time to penis. Although I did play a level once that was all pictures of Parker Posey, it was great. That was my favorite.
3494000	3500000	Because then you could take the stickers and put them in your own levels. It was this really creepy, like, Parker Posey stalking thing. It was hilarious.
3501000	3506000	But while you have the mic, your personal thoughts on Mario Maker and if it's something that would interest you.
3506000	3508000	Ask me on Tuesday.
3508000	3510000	Cop out.
3510000	3513000	I'm going to see it on Tuesday.
3513000	3520000	I just want, ideally, I just want, and this is probably selling me a Wii U, I just want Excite Truck Maker.
3520000	3526000	That's what I want. I just want Excite Truck Maker because the game was perfect. You just need more levels. That's all you needed was more levels.
3526000	3528000	Jamie, quickly, your thoughts?
3528000	3530000	I don't think it's enough to make me want a Wii U.
3530000	3536000	Not enough to make you want a Wii U, but let's, let's hypothesize you already had a Wii U. Would the game itself be something of interest to you?
3536000	3537000	Maybe.
3537000	3538000	Maybe.
3538000	3544000	I mean, I spend most of my time in the Sims building houses, so I'd be, probably just do nothing but build shit all day.
3544000	3546000	To never be used.
3546000	3549000	The design side of you, I think, would twitch a little bit, like, getting to do this.
3549000	3555000	Here's another interesting thing. What if it was not just making Mario levels? What if it was like Mario Paint?
3555000	3557000	Hmm.
3557000	3559000	I pay enough for Photoshop.
3559000	3562000	That was actually the initial reaction I had when I first heard about this news.
3562000	3569000	You know, there has been a lot of clamoring for a return of Mario Paint. You know, we haven't seen that in a very long time, and the Wii U seems like an obvious play.
3569000	3576000	I mean, we have games that are very similar, like Art Academy on the 3DS and so forth, like, it's not out of the question that we would get some type of return of Mario Paint.
3576000	3578000	As long as it has the Flyswatter game, that's all I want.
3578000	3580000	Alright.
3580000	3584000	ActDeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Mario Paint. I would like that.
3585000	3591000	Alright. Let us go to our next story, which has to do with Xbox.
3591000	3600000	The Xbox One controller. I remember this. Jason, you brought an Xbox One controller and a PlayStation 4 controller to the studio once, and I was like, why did you buy these controllers?
3600000	3603000	You were like, yeah, I wanted them, and someday I'll be able to use them on the PC.
3603000	3604000	Yep.
3604000	3606000	Well, guess what? That day has come, Jason.
3606000	3608000	It's actually sitting eight feet away from you right now.
3608000	3609000	Is it really?
3609000	3610000	Yeah.
3610000	3611000	They're in my little black bag over there.
3611000	3620000	Microsoft has released the official drivers for Xbox One for the PC, so it will support 32-bit and 64-bit Windows PCs.
3620000	3631000	Any game that currently supports the Xbox 360 controller will support the One controller, and as soon as you install the drivers, you can start using that controller and connect it via a micro USB cable.
3631000	3640000	Native controller support will come in a Windows update that is to come in the future, but they wanted to get the drivers out there ASAP so that people can use it on the PC.
3640000	3647000	And I'm going to be honest, the Xbox 360 controller makes a great PC controller. I use it all the time.
3647000	3657000	So I kind of want an Xbox One controller just to – because, you know, again, the D-pad on the 360 drives me nuts, so I imagine it's a lot better on the One.
3657000	3665000	I'd also like to see some of those PC games support those rumble triggers. I'd be interested to see how that is like.
3665000	3666000	Yeah. It would be cool.
3666000	3672000	Well, one game that you could use that controller on as well when it comes out is Dead Rising 3.
3672000	3680000	Of course, Dead Rising is already out on the Xbox One, but if you don't own a One but somehow have a controller like Jason, the game is coming to Steam.
3680000	3687000	Capcom announced earlier this week that it will be on PC, and it's part of their E3 2014 lineup.
3687000	3699000	We don't know when, but it seems like it wouldn't take too long to put together, so I would think this holiday season, if not maybe something more like August, just in time for all these new drivers.
3699000	3701000	You could play Dead Rising 3.
3701000	3703000	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
3703000	3706000	I have some stuff, but it's not happy stuff.
3706000	3707000	Aww.
3707000	3709000	But we knew this was coming one day.
3709000	3710000	The PSP?
3710000	3711000	Mm-hmm.
3711000	3713000	Womp womp.
3713000	3715000	Oh, do I have to get the sound effect board again?
3715000	3717000	No. I did all the sound effects we need.
3717000	3718000	Okay, fine.
3718000	3725000	It is going to be ending later this month. Bye-bye. At least in Japan.
3725000	3732000	It also is discontinuing it in North America. Of course, the shipment's already discontinued up here.
3732000	3742000	It's going to continue on in Europe for a little while, and it's going to be continuing in Latin America, some of the other Asian countries, but it's officially...
3743000	3749000	But I bet Fry's will still sell the UMD's movies, trying to get rid of that last stock that they have.
3749000	3753000	They'll eke any penny they can out of that, and then maybe I'll buy some.
3754000	3755000	There you go.
3755000	3759000	But I mean, it's almost ten years old. I guess that's...
3759000	3764000	It seemed like the PSP was still kicking in Japan, though, so it was kind of a surprise to hear this.
3764000	3766000	Buy the Vita! We'll force you to buy the Vita.
3766000	3768000	Maybe that's part of what it is.
3768000	3769000	That's kind of what I think it is.
3769000	3782000	Yeah. But the only bummer about the PSP is that anytime I think of the PSP, I'm going to inevitably think of the PSP Go, which in retrospect was probably just a little bit ahead of its time.
3782000	3790000	I mean, a digital-only platform. It's really funny. The PSP Go, in a way, was doing some of the things the Xbox One wanted to do with the digital-only.
3790000	3794000	And it didn't work out so well.
3794000	3795000	People bought them, though. I mean, some people did.
3795000	3801000	I kind of think if the PSP Go were to come out today, it might actually have done a little better.
3801000	3804000	PSP Go or PSP No?
3804000	3805000	No.
3805000	3814000	Yeah, there is a much better network that could have actually supplanted it with games and with a lot more games nowadays, especially with the addition of PlayStation Plus.
3814000	3817000	I was going to say, PlayStation Plus alone would give that thing a lot of value.
3817000	3821000	God knows I have, like, six purchases for a system that I don't own.
3821000	3823000	Yeah, right? So...
3824000	3828000	And also, they added, was it the Xbox Live Gold stuff already?
3828000	3829000	Mm-hmm.
3829000	3838000	So, since now, fucking Sony won't let me register those PlayStation 4 games anymore since I don't own a PlayStation 4.
3838000	3845000	But on Microsoft now, you can do the Xbox One games, and I can do it even though I don't have an Xbox One, so...
3846000	3847000	All right.
3847000	3849000	Get in on that shit.
3849000	3851000	All right, Loki, why don't you continue on?
3851000	3855000	All right. So, moving on here, let's see.
3855000	3857000	This is kind of neat.
3857000	3867000	You know, good old games, they've kind of had a pretty decent service going along with all their older games that are DRM-free.
3867000	3877000	Now, if you want a kind of similar integration with stuff, as Steam does, they have their own client that they announced called Galaxy.
3877000	3888000	And now, Galaxy is going to have cross-platform support, as well as for those playing online, and it's also totally optional.
3888000	3897000	So, if you want to have that in there, you'll be able to earn achievements, access your library, also the multiplayer stuff.
3899000	3904000	And it's kind of a neat little front-end for all these games you may have through GOG.com.
3905000	3910000	But, you know, if you don't want that and you want things the way they are now, you don't need it.
3910000	3912000	So, that's kind of cool.
3912000	3921000	I didn't actually watch the livestream, but I guess that was part of their Witcher announcement, I think, as well, when they were talking about that stuff.
3921000	3925000	I'm curious to check this out, because I have a very small library on good old games.
3925000	3927000	Yeah, all the free stuff that they've given out.
3927000	3929000	I actually have bought things on good old games.
3929000	3931000	I bought when they released Sid Meier's Covert Action.
3931000	3938000	Those of you that have listened to the show for a long time know I have this really awkward boner for Covert Action.
3938000	3943000	Which, you know, was a game from my childhood I just loved, even though the critics weren't really into it.
3943000	3947000	Even kind of looking back in retrospect, I'm like, this game was kind of stupid.
3947000	3952000	But it was Carmen Sandiego, but with guns and killing people. It was awesome.
3952000	3955000	So, I will always have a soft spot for Covert Action.
3955000	3963000	Battle chest, Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Space Quest, Descent...
3963000	3970000	I think those are the things that I actively bought from there, because they make cross-platform DOSBox emulation for all those old games.
3970000	3973000	You got a little library growing there.
3973000	3975000	I'm downloading Galaxy right now.
3975000	3977000	I think it is a good service overall.
3978000	3983000	I think some of the games are sometimes a little pricey, but usually it's for a reason.
3983000	3985000	They're the games we really, really, really enjoy.
3985000	3989000	But, you know, it's just hard.
3989000	3991000	I mean, what is the value of a game like that?
3991000	3995000	But then again, I also pay five bucks for things on Virtual Console that some would say,
3995000	3997000	What the hell are you spending that money on?
3997000	3999000	I'm a liar. I'm not downloading it right now.
3999000	4002000	It's not out just yet. I will download it when it's actually out.
4002000	4005000	We're not downloading it on this bandwidth. We're having a hard time keeping the show up tonight.
4005000	4009000	Hey, hey, that outage wasn't our fault. Nobody knows what I'm talking about right now.
4009000	4011000	Well, the live listeners sure do.
4011000	4016000	All right. Let's move on to you, Jason.
4016000	4017000	Continue the conversation.
4017000	4024000	So, Valve has officially embraced the fickle nature of game and game development by updating their early access fact,
4024000	4032000	warning that users may be playing games that will never actually be released, or worse, could be scrapped outright.
4033000	4036000	The statement updated to read,
4036000	4040000	It's up to the developer to determine when they are ready to release,
4040000	4043000	and some developers have a concrete deadline in mind,
4043000	4047000	while others get a better sense as the development of the game progresses.
4047000	4052000	Doug Lombardi, who's the director of marketing at Valve, said along with this,
4052000	4056000	that the changes to the fact are intended to help set customer expectations
4056000	4060000	of what may or may not happen over the course of development of an early access game.
4060000	4064000	We frequently iterate on Steam features as we gather feedback and find areas for improvement.
4064000	4068000	In this case, it became apparent that further clarifications would help customers
4068000	4072000	evaluate their potential purchase of early access titles.
4072000	4077000	We think of Steam, early access, and game development as services that grow and evolve best
4077000	4079000	with the involvement of customers and community.
4079000	4085000	And this is really super surprising to me because don't some early access games
4085000	4088000	cost like full price for what you would buy for a new game?
4088000	4089000	Yes, they do.
4089000	4094000	I've seen a good number of like $10 or $15, but I have definitely also seen like $50 early access games.
4094000	4098000	Like Arma 3, Arma 3 was early access and I think it was like $40.
4098000	4101000	I bought AudioSurf on early access, I think there was another one I bought too,
4101000	4104000	but I mean those were more indie titles, they were like $10, $15.
4104000	4106000	Yeah, and they were also early, like,
4106000	4110000	Wasn't that actually even before early access was officially a thing?
4110000	4113000	I think AudioSurf in particular is one of the early,
4113000	4118000	I mean it was released as an early, early game and it's still really being developed, so.
4118000	4121000	It's a very interesting feature, don't get me wrong,
4121000	4126000	and we have a lot of the same arguments that we do with Kickstarter that these things may not pan out.
4126000	4130000	The difference is that because it's an early access game, you are playing something,
4130000	4132000	so you get something out of it.
4132000	4137000	But, like any game, if it requires server components especially,
4137000	4143000	if the source disappears, then well, your game may eventually disappear as well.
4144000	4149000	Steam had to do legal cover your ass, so, you know, that went into the fact.
4152000	4159000	Well, we'll see how people keep to early access in light of this news.
4159000	4164000	And this is actually new to me, I haven't followed a lot of early access stuff,
4164000	4169000	I've heard, I saw Arma when it came out most recently, DayZ was a big thing,
4169000	4173000	I've seen a couple of others, but I've never bought them, I've never jumped into it first hand.
4173000	4180000	But apparently, a game has already been halted and not cancelled,
4180000	4185000	but Towns was halted and it's going in via Steam Greenlight,
4185000	4191000	and then Earth Year 2066 was outright removed last month,
4191000	4195000	apparently due to dishonest marketing, which I didn't hear anything about.
4195000	4198000	That's very interesting, but apparently these are,
4198000	4202000	I don't want to say reactive changes, but they're certainly happening after the fact,
4202000	4204000	there's already precedent for this kind of a problem,
4204000	4207000	and now it's in Steam's official information, so take that as you will.
4207000	4210000	Hi, GameGuru in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
4210000	4216000	paying for a broken game, sigh, but if that's what people want, dot dot dot.
4216000	4218000	It's your money spending on what you want, right?
4218000	4219000	Yep.
4219000	4223000	Alright, so hopefully you're getting an accurate portrayal of what your money is going to buy,
4223000	4225000	I think that's a very important thing to know.
4225000	4226000	Anyhow, DarkSakura.
4226000	4232000	One other point about what money controls is money controls things like layoffs,
4232000	4237000	which Nintendo has decided to consolidate their European operations,
4237000	4240000	and they're laying off 130 employees.
4240000	4243000	Now, keep in mind, for some people, that's a small town,
4243000	4251000	so they said that they're closing the headquarters in Gossa's time,
4251000	4253000	I guess I pronounced that right, because I know what the little B sign is,
4253000	4256000	it's a sss, it's an extra sss.
4256000	4261000	Anyway, that's in Germany, and is moving their operations to Frankfurt,
4261000	4264000	so they're losing 130 employees.
4264000	4266000	Not so permanent.
4266000	4270000	Huh, Nintendo has more offices in Europe than just Germany, though, right?
4270000	4275000	Yeah, this is just one office, but I mean, it almost seems to me like it's the start of something else, so.
4275000	4277000	Take it as you will.
4277000	4280000	It's unfortunate, but with some of these sales we're seeing and so forth,
4280000	4283000	it's not surprising that something's happening somewhere,
4283000	4288000	but yeah, I mean, again, this is a very important year for Nintendo,
4288000	4291000	they've got to really start making some of that money back on Wii U,
4291000	4296000	so it really should have been last year, but you know, Nintendo has tons of cash on hand,
4296000	4299000	let's not forget that, they've got tons and tons of cash on hand, so.
4299000	4302000	What happened to It Prints Money?
4302000	4303000	That's why they have cash in hand.
4303000	4305000	That's why they have cash on hand.
4305000	4308000	But the 3DS, you know, it's probably not doing,
4308000	4311000	I think the reason why some people think the 3DS is disappointing
4311000	4316000	is because A, you know, you have the ever-growing mobile market and so forth,
4316000	4319000	but B, it's not meeting expectations,
4319000	4323000	but I think the expectations were set really, really high to try to offset what's going on with the Wii U,
4323000	4327000	but for all practical purposes, it seems like the 3DS is still doing very well,
4327000	4331000	a lot of people own them, and the game is still making a lot of games for them.
4331000	4333000	Seems to be in a better spot right now than the Vita,
4333000	4337000	and I'm not really dogging on the Vita, I realize there's a lot of great games out on the Vita and so forth,
4337000	4341000	but it's not exactly nearly as rampant as the 3DS adoption is, so.
4341000	4343000	Anyhow.
4343000	4346000	All right, let's travel around the world and check out release dates.
4346000	4350000	Let's see what is coming out soon from a company you love,
4350000	4355000	although with the three-week, probably most of it isn't really announced,
4355000	4357000	but we'll see what is on deck anyway. Loki.
4357000	4359000	Not a whole ton of stuff coming out this week.
4359000	4363000	I've got Enemy Front on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,
4363000	4371000	and How to Train Your Dragon 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and 3DS.
4371000	4373000	That is it.
4373000	4378000	All right, let's go to Japan and check out what is coming out there in the Japanese release dates.
4378000	4385000	On June 12th on the PlayStation 4, Thief gets its Japanese release from Square Enix on June 12th.
4385000	4389000	Fighting Commander 4 also coming out on the PlayStation 4 on June 12th.
4389000	4393000	Nothing for Xbox One, because remember, that isn't out in Japan yet.
4393000	4397000	Very interesting to see. I'm very curious. That was almost like a runner-up for me.
4397000	4404000	How is Microsoft going to get into the Japanese market there at E3?
4404000	4408000	All right, Shane walked into the studio and is dying to say something here. What?
4408000	4410000	I have breaking news.
4410000	4412000	Okay, what?
4412000	4415000	Can I borrow your phone charger?
4415000	4418000	Couldn't you, like, text me that or something?
4419000	4426000	Yes, she can borrow my phone charger. Oh my god, was that really worth interrupting the show for?
4426000	4430000	You jerk. Get out of here. All right.
4430000	4434000	It's in my room. You want to brave that?
4434000	4436000	Or give me a minute and I'll come get it.
4436000	4446000	All right, on the PlayStation 3, it's probably over by where Alan's underwear is, but I'll let him figure that out on his own.
4446000	4458000	All right, on the PlayStation 3, Fighting Commander 4 on June 12th, One Piece Unlimited World R, as well as Ratchet & Clank Giga Saikyo TriStar Pack.
4458000	4461000	It looks like a compilation there on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4461000	4467000	And Thief, also making its way to the PlayStation 3 all this week on the 12th.
4467000	4472000	On the Xbox 360, Thief gets its release there in Japan.
4472000	4484000	And on the PlayStation Vita, One Piece Unlimited World R from Bandai Namco, as well as Iyu Densetsu Anno Kisuke Evolution from Falcom comes out as well.
4484000	4490000	And last but not least, I'm going to check the Wii U to see if anything is out this week on the Wii U.
4490000	4494000	One Piece Unlimited World R is there as well.
4494000	4499000	And I can't forget the Nintendo 3DS, except they are not actually having any releases this week.
4499000	4502000	But Pack World is slated for June 19th, so there's that.
4502000	4506000	And Pokemon Art Academy, speaking of those Art Academy games, that's all on the 19th.
4506000	4510000	All right, moving on. To Europe, DarkSakura.
4510000	4516000	There's some stuff coming out in Europe, and for a moment my system has been slow, so you ready?
4516000	4520000	On the 13th of June we have Inazuma 11 GO Shadow & Light.
4520000	4524000	Spread tires, I guess, on PC.
4524000	4529000	Enemy friends on Xbox 360, PS3, and on PC.
4529000	4532000	That looks to be about it.
4532000	4535000	A general lack of stuff.
4535000	4546000	And since Rob and Shane are now braving the depths of the scary, scary bedroom, I will just go ahead and say that Loki has the new story.
4546000	4547000	Yeah, of course.
4547000	4552000	So this is kind of disappointing, especially when it turns into lawsuits.
4552000	4560000	But apparently the composer for the Halo series and now the upcoming Destiny game, Martin O'Donnell, is suing Bungie.
4560000	4565000	Because apparently he was fired without cause, according to his claim.
4565000	4572000	And due to that, he was not paid his, I guess, accrued time off.
4572000	4577000	The unused vacation, paid time off, sabbatical time, and other benefits that they had promised to pay him.
4577000	4585000	And now, because of this, I guess he is seeking twice the amount of withheld wages along with compensation to cover legal fees.
4585000	4595000	And I guess also filing another grievance against both the CEO Harold Ryan and Bungie.
4596000	4599000	But I guess they haven't really said what that is over.
4599000	4602000	And I don't know, it doesn't really say.
4602000	4605000	So he has another grievance, but it doesn't really say what it's for.
4605000	4609000	I guess separate from the whole paid time off thing.
4612000	4616000	Well, when you leave a company, you are supposed to get all that time off.
4617000	4626000	And apparently he says, like most companies, they have a policy based on that they are supposed to be paying that stuff out.
4629000	4631000	Well, we'll see what develops in court.
4631000	4634000	But like most things, it will probably be settled out of court with a gag order.
4634000	4636000	So we'll never hear about it again.
4636000	4644000	Alright, one thing you're still going to hear about, and you're going to hear plenty about it next week, I'm sure, is Mortal Kombat X was officially announced.
4644000	4654000	Now I want to point out, unlike when we had Final Fantasy X-2, which a lot of people mistakenly called Final Fantasy X-2, this is Mortal Kombat X, not X.
4654000	4658000	And that's per the Twitter of, I believe it was Ed Boon that came out and actually said that.
4658000	4659000	But isn't it the tenth game still?
4659000	4660000	It is.
4660000	4666000	So calling it Mortal Kombat X is not necessarily wrong, but they are going to be marketing the game as Mortal Kombat X.
4667000	4674000	But you see, with a game like Mortal Kombat, you think extreme or extreme violence or whatever, so it makes sense.
4674000	4687000	But anyway, Mortal Kombat X was officially announced this week to no one's surprise, because you remember on last week's show we were talking about that the posters were spotted and we knew this was coming, there was a countdown to a countdown.
4687000	4694000	Well, the official trailer hit, and it was Sub-Zero and Scorpion fighting with some little rap music.
4694000	4695000	What, they're going to be in the game?
4695000	4696000	Yeah, I know, right?
4696000	4697000	That's so shocking.
4697000	4698000	That was playing in the background.
4698000	4705000	And while I'm watching this trailer, all I can hear is my mom in the back of my head, that is so, Rob, that is gross.
4705000	4707000	That is a gross game.
4707000	4710000	Because, like, you know, it's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4710000	4714000	So we're watching, and it looks like the x-ray attacks are back, but it doesn't, like, fade to black now.
4714000	4716000	You kind of see that in real time.
4716000	4723000	And that whole little thing where, like, he frickin' decapitated Sub-Zero at the end or something and put the spear through his head, like, it was very, very explicit.
4723000	4729000	And I was like, even I was like, that is, that is gross, Ed, Ed Boon, that is gross.
4729000	4736000	Well, the whole thing was like CG, but I did, if it's assuming, I'm assuming that it's going to be based off of what the actual gameplay is like.
4736000	4742000	So, if that's the case, it looks like they have the environment attacks that they had in Injustice, which is kind of cool.
4743000	4753000	And then, what was I going to say, I don't know, I don't like the whole CG trailer thing, and I really didn't like the music choice for that trailer.
4753000	4755000	It was just very off-putting.
4755000	4758000	What did you want, techno? You want the old mortal combat?
4758000	4761000	Yes! Yes, that's exactly what I wanted.
4761000	4767000	Come on, I mean, dude, you had a perfectly good theme song, you don't need to change it up.
4767000	4776000	Just, I mean, if you want to go cliche with it, you can have a little bit of, you know, a little bit of bass, you know, have a drop in there or something like that.
4776000	4783000	But have it be the fucking original, well, the original movie theme. Was it the movie or the game theme? It wasn't the game theme.
4783000	4785000	No, it was like made for the movie.
4785000	4792000	Anyhow, yeah, and Act F says, I don't think the trailer music should be any indication of the music in the game. I agree with that, it never is.
4792000	4801000	But no, no, it is, because it says, you know, that's the artist, and it was a special song by that artist in the game. So that song is in the game.
4801000	4810000	Wow, really? Interesting. I wonder if they're going like EA soundtrack style with it or something. Warner Brothers does have a record label.
4810000	4812000	I suppose.
4812000	4813000	Be interesting.
4813000	4818000	But they really need the original one. Or just mix it up, you know?
4819000	4825000	Tigerclaw agrees with you in our chatroom, saying they could have done something like a dubstep of the original MK Techno song.
4825000	4827000	Mortal Kombat!
4830000	4834000	Yeah, I would like that. I would admire that.
4834000	4841000	WhatupG says that Ed Boon says, waiting to see Scorpion's second fatality. Oh god, I can only imagine.
4841000	4849000	Alan Alchemy in our chatroom says, I wouldn't mind a proper sequel to the reboot from two years ago. It was really good in the story narrative from there.
4849000	4858000	The story only covered Mortal Kombat 3 and a little bit of 4. I'm not sure, but Mortal Kombat 4 is kind of where I think a lot of people felt the series started to kind of decline a little bit.
4858000	4866000	So I'm kind of curious as to how they'd want to retell some of that. Although, I would like Tanya to come back. I like playing as her in Mortal Kombat 4.
4866000	4876000	Rumor that's brewing right now is that you're going to have variations of the same character. So you'll have three Scorpions.
4876000	4883000	And it's not talking like Cyber Skorpion and Scorpion. It's just like you'll have these distinctive little changes within the characters.
4883000	4886000	They just have to rip off Mario Kart, don't they?
4886000	4891000	Custom Karts that your Mortal Kombat characters ride in.
4892000	4898000	Village Idiot's Matt in our chat says, are we really going to panic about the music? The video is fucking sweet.
4898000	4905000	I like music in a video game, don't get me wrong, but I don't think that's the only song that's going to be in the game.
4905000	4911000	And even if I maybe didn't like it personally, at the end of the day, I could always mute it and play my own thing.
4911000	4917000	Do the consoles let you do custom soundtracks anymore? Actually, come to think of it, I don't remember if the new ones let you do that.
4918000	4923000	They're just like, hey, hey you guys, I know you like the on off switch, we just added that in.
4923000	4927000	Well I guess it shows you how often I actually use that feature, so maybe I shouldn't be complaining about it.
4927000	4933000	Alright, anyhow, let us take a trip back. We're going to go back in time a little bit.
4933000	4940000	We're going to go back in time to when you couldn't have a full CD soundtrack in your video games, you couldn't do that.
4940000	4941000	Yes you could.
4941000	4944000	You had bleeps and bloops and you liked it.
4945000	4947000	Oh, is this game a little newer where you could have a CD?
4947000	4953000	No it's not, but back in the day, even, you know, 20 years ago we had CDs.
4953000	4958000	I suppose with your 10 year rule we did have the whole Symphony of the Nights over 10 years old, right?
4958000	4963000	Well, even 20 years ago we still had CD music.
4963000	4968000	Fair enough, but I know, see I get prepped on what game you've picked and I know this is a bleep bloop game.
4968000	4971000	I was six years old, Rob. Six.
4971000	4973000	Six years old, alright.
4973000	4975000	You probably couldn't see over the edge of the cabinet.
4975000	4979000	Which sadly means most of our listeners probably weren't born.
4979000	4981000	Well, dammit, they need to play it.
4981000	4982000	Alright.
4982000	4984000	Because, fuck your age limitations.
4984000	4986000	What is the game of the week already, DarkSakura?
4986000	4988000	Pango!
4988000	4990000	I did this one just for you, Rob.
4990000	4991000	I love Pango, it's one of my favorites.
4991000	4992000	Dan suggested it too.
4992000	4993000	Oh yeah?
4993000	4994000	Yeah.
4994000	4996000	Pango is a red penguin.
4996000	5001000	Why he's a fucking red penguin in the Arctic, I have no idea. Antarctic, I mean.
5001000	5005000	So anyway, you play on an overhead maze and you have ice blocks.
5005000	5008000	And Pango has to fight the snow bees.
5008000	5010000	These green blobby things.
5010000	5012000	Not the bees, not the bees!
5012000	5014000	Snow bees, Rob, snow bees.
5014000	5017000	And you have to basically eliminate all the snow bees.
5017000	5023000	And steal bonuses and three different diamonds that are dispersed throughout the maze.
5023000	5026000	So it's a joystick button game, you know.
5026000	5034000	You can actually shake the walls to paralyze snow bees and then run over them and get points.
5034000	5040000	You have 16 levels and they repeat once you reach the 17th.
5040000	5050000	Basically, when you kill different snow bees on the way, new ones will hatch from eggs that are within some of the ice blocks.
5050000	5058000	Some of the blocks that have the eggs will flash at the start of the level, but you have to have really good memory to remember that.
5058000	5063000	You can get rid of the eggs by crushing the blocks that they're in.
5063000	5075000	And then like I said, Pango can push a side wall that can vibrate and stun a snow bee and then they get 100 points for walking over them.
5075000	5078000	When all the snow bees are gone, you go on to the next level.
5078000	5081000	You have diamond blocks that are unbreakable.
5081000	5090000	And if they are collected in a horizontal or vertical line, then you get an extra 10,000 points if they are aligned without being next to a wall.
5090000	5093000	And 5,000 if they are against a wall.
5093000	5097000	They also, by aligning them, will temporarily stun all snow bees.
5097000	5100000	After 60 seconds, go by without any deaths.
5100000	5111000	The game goes into sudden death, where the music tempo and the snow bees get faster and basically the snow bee gets to live and you have to start over.
5111000	5113000	Lather, rinse, repeat.
5113000	5114000	Yeah.
5114000	5126000	There is an easter egg that in the attract mode, if you push two joysticks up and press two action buttons and one button of start game, it will show the credits for the game.
5126000	5129000	And then the game will reset.
5129000	5133000	You can actually stop the waiting by pressing the start one button.
5133000	5135000	So yeah, you get different points for killing different things.
5135000	5136000	And it has intermissions.
5136000	5141000	It has six intermissions every even numbered round.
5141000	5150000	They have six penguins that are doing dancing or marching around or shaking their booty in one of them.
5150000	5152000	The third one, the penguins stop and salute.
5152000	5158000	The fourth one, the penguins face the player and then exit the screen in a line, kind of like the aliens in Space Invaders.
5158000	5163000	The fifth one, Pango is revealed to be playing a cocktail table by himself.
5163000	5168000	And in the sixth version, Pango appears from behind the cocktail table playing peekaboo.
5168000	5170000	And then it repeats.
5170000	5178000	So, there were different versions of Pango and some of them had different music.
5179000	5184000	Now, this very first one here used popcorn as the theme music.
5184000	5188000	And it took a little while to draw the maze at the start of the game.
5188000	5191000	The second one had original music and faster maze drawing.
5191000	5194000	So, of course, the second version was also harder.
5194000	5199000	So you had Pango, which is Pango's set one revision seed that played popcorn.
5199000	5204000	And then Pango 2, Pango 2U, Pango 3U, and Pango 4.
5205000	5208000	Pango 4 being the fastest and hardest.
5208000	5210000	It was fast and hard.
5210000	5213000	So there's been many, many versions.
5213000	5218000	We've had versions on the Atari 2600, 5200, which I have a 5200 version,
5218000	5222000	Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, and the Game Gear.
5222000	5227000	Then Bondi Electronics did two Sega license handhelds of Pango.
5227000	5232000	One was an LCD pocket game, the other one was a tabletop version.
5232000	5237000	There was Peppenga Pango that came out on the Sega Master Drive in Japan,
5237000	5240000	which I need to have this now.
5240000	5243000	And then there were some clones.
5243000	5246000	There was Penge for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.
5246000	5250000	And Capcom did one called Don't Pool, which was part of Three Wonders,
5250000	5254000	which I think I've reviewed Three Wonders before, that was a Pango clone.
5254000	5257000	Hijimaru is really similar to this, too.
5257000	5258000	Hijimaru.
5258000	5260000	Sorry, Hijimaru is really similar to this.
5260000	5261000	Yeah.
5261000	5264000	There were other remakes that came out.
5264000	5267000	There was an 8-player version, too, in 2010.
5267000	5275000	It was on location test at a Sega Shinjuku Nishiguchi that was there in 2012.
5275000	5277000	May 2012.
5277000	5281000	Then Club Sega Akihabara Shinkan did another one in July
5281000	5286000	that was a four-game compilation that was called Gensin Love Plus Pango.
5286000	5290000	And so then there were just all kinds of different other versions.
5290000	5297000	And then that compilation one came out on the Xbox 360 as Gensin Love Plus Pango.
5297000	5305000	As far as the highest Pango score, according to Twin Galaxies, which whoop-de-shit,
5305000	5310000	Rodney Day of Canberra, Australia, has the world record of Pango
5310000	5318000	with 1,110,370 points since August 13, 1983, and no one has broken it since.
5318000	5321000	Also, Pango makes a cameo appearance in Up and Down.
5321000	5325000	If a player manages to pass the first four rounds in less than a minute each,
5325000	5333000	he will appear in the water of round five riding a surfboard that Pango will.
5333000	5337000	You know, I played a game back when I was super young
5337000	5342000	that was an awful lot like this but had slightly different mechanics.
5342000	5345000	It was an old, old, old DOS game, predominantly black and white.
5345000	5349000	It was called Pango, P-A-N-G-O.
5349000	5351000	Its theme was also popcorn.
5351000	5356000	You had a shooting mechanic and it also had a gravity mechanic,
5356000	5360000	so if you built up to a boulder it would come down and squash the enemy,
5360000	5363000	which, hell, if I can even remember what the enemies were.
5363000	5367000	But this is striking a lot of familiar feelings for a game
5367000	5369000	that I haven't played in literally two decades.
5369000	5373000	Oh, my God, Rob, if you still have it, you totally need to play the raver's choice.
5374000	5376000	Volume four from DDR.
5376000	5380000	That's actually one of the many reasons why we all learn about popcorn in our youth
5380000	5383000	because it was just everywhere.
5383000	5385000	It was, you know, the traditional...
5385000	5387000	Which I believe was my first eight.
5389000	5392000	I don't even remember how hard that game was.
5392000	5397000	You heard Dark Sakura talking there about how many freaking clones and stuff there were,
5397000	5400000	so it doesn't surprise me at all that whatever computer you were playing on
5400000	5402000	probably had this, you know?
5402000	5404000	It was an old-school straight-up PC.
5404000	5408000	I'll call it a bootleg because it wasn't a direct copy.
5408000	5411000	Like I said, the character was a car, not a penguin.
5411000	5414000	I don't remember what the enemies were, but I'm pretty sure they weren't living things,
5414000	5415000	traditionally living things.
5415000	5417000	But, yeah, it was a great game.
5417000	5420000	I'm not entirely sure how I missed Pingo.
5421000	5423000	All right. Is that it then?
5423000	5427000	Your classic game of the week, courtesy of Sega.
5427000	5429000	Pingo pen.
5429000	5433000	Although I think that the name Pupunga Pen is actually pretty funny.
5433000	5436000	Watching the guy play that game kind of hurt me a little bit
5436000	5439000	because he wasn't crushing the ice blocks that had the eggs in them.
5439000	5442000	No, I had one that was better than this guy.
5442000	5443000	It was really good.
5443000	5447000	But at the second round, the music was replaced with a remake,
5447000	5449000	with like an OC remix and then another one.
5449000	5451000	I was like, nah, I want the music.
5451000	5454000	We need authenticity here.
5454000	5460000	If you look up Pango playthrough or something, you'll find the really good one first.
5460000	5464000	Surprising that with all the Sega circle jerk we see,
5464000	5467000	we don't usually see this game show up with all their remakes.
5467000	5470000	Although I want to say it did show up in that Sonic collection.
5470000	5475000	Did it show you the version that the one they had at Pasquale's finally died?
5475000	5478000	I think we beat it into submission.
5478000	5481000	That was the only place that I knew of in town that still had a working Pango.
5481000	5482000	Rest in peace.
5482000	5483000	All right, we're going to take a break, guys.
5483000	5488000	When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come on this, the eve of E3 2014,
5488000	5491000	including in our next segment, List List.
5491000	5493000	We haven't done a List List since last year.
5493000	5496000	We did one at the end of the year for our 2014 predictions.
5496000	5497000	It's about time.
5497000	5500000	So yeah, it's high time we bring some OLR games back.
5500000	5502000	The prequel show is perfect for that.
5502000	5507000	If you have started listening to OLR this year, you've never heard an OLR game.
5507000	5508000	I'm sorry.
5508000	5509000	I know, I'm sorry.
5509000	5511000	I'm very sorry if you just started listening to this game.
5511000	5512000	You got 500 episodes to catch up on.
5512000	5513000	Get to it.
5513000	5514000	All right, we're going to take a break.
5514000	5516000	When we come back, plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5516000	5517000	Don't go anywhere.
5517000	5518000	We will be right back.
5523000	5530000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, June the 8th on the eve of E3.
5530000	5533000	Now, I imagine there's got to be some of you guys that are going to be listening to this at work,
5533000	5535000	you know, later in the week or whatever.
5535000	5537000	I don't know if our Monday crowd will still be listening because, you know,
5537000	5540000	the press conference is going on, but it'll be really funny that there'll be all this news out there
5540000	5542000	and you'll get to see what was right and what was wrong.
5542000	5544000	It's always funny to kind of take a look back.
5544000	5549000	One of those being wrong, of course, that, you know, The Last Guardian's not canceled.
5549000	5552000	Well, actually, it just came in.
5552000	5553000	Somebody had sent me this.
5553000	5554000	I'm sorry.
5554000	5556000	I forgot who sent me this tweet about this.
5556000	5558000	Oh, actually, I think this went to the Twitter.
5558000	5560000	Oh, for OLR, Redertainment just sent this.
5560000	5566000	IGN actually issued an official apology for that article in the first place.
5567000	5573000	Steve Butts, who is, I guess, that's his name, who I guess is the editor-in-chief over at IGN,
5573000	5575000	basically said, I made the call to post this.
5575000	5577000	I had credible information.
5577000	5579000	Obviously, the Twitter post makes that.
5579000	5580000	It was an error.
5580000	5586000	And basically, we retract the story and kind of went into this whole no one care about how it happened.
5586000	5587000	So there it is.
5587000	5589000	So IGN did officially apologize for that.
5589000	5591000	So we'll see.
5591000	5593000	I guess if it was Polygon making that mistake,
5593000	5596000	they would be filming a documentary about how they made that mistake.
5596000	5600000	And then they would be engaging in Twitter spats with people about how they're right.
5600000	5602000	We'll talk about a little bit of that later.
5602000	5606000	All right, let's get into some rapid fire news
5606000	5610000	and quickly talk about a few other things going on in the game industry before E3.
5610000	5614000	Although I have to ask, Dark Sakura, before the show tonight,
5614000	5617000	you brought me like a big bag of, it was British candy, right?
5617000	5619000	From our friend Robert in England.
5619000	5620000	All right.
5620000	5621000	Well, thanks, Robert, for the candy.
5621000	5623000	You're getting me on a sugar high here before our list list.
5623000	5624000	He's done a bunch of stuff.
5624000	5626000	A lot of it I've been trying to share the wealth,
5626000	5629000	and I had it ready to bring the week we didn't do a show.
5629000	5630000	And then I forgot it last week.
5630000	5635000	You know what I'm hooked on that I need to get me some of is HP sauce.
5635000	5636000	You can get it easily.
5636000	5637000	They sell it at Safeway.
5637000	5638000	I know.
5638000	5639000	But I need to get me some of that.
5639000	5641000	You know what's better than HP sauce?
5641000	5642000	How's the Safeway today?
5642000	5643000	Daddy's sauce.
5643000	5646000	It actually is the brand is Daddy's, not Daddy's sauce.
5646000	5648000	I'll get both.
5648000	5649000	All right.
5649000	5650000	There it is.
5650000	5653000	Go get it at Touch of Britain in North Highlands.
5653000	5654000	Trust me.
5654000	5655000	And then have food there.
5655000	5658000	Look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
5658000	5659000	SSG100Matt says,
5659000	5663000	Hoard House always gets me into trouble whenever I listen via podcast.
5663000	5664000	You're welcome.
5664000	5666000	SSG100Matt also says they're apologizing, IGN,
5666000	5670000	because they don't want to get kicked out of Nintendo's after party at E3.
5670000	5672000	Wouldn't that be Sony's, though?
5672000	5674000	Alan Alchemy in chat says,
5674000	5676000	God, you're so mature.
5676000	5677000	Alan Alchemy says,
5677000	5680000	Steve Butts of IGN went on record as saying,
5685000	5686000	Grow up.
5686000	5688000	I read that differently, Rob.
5688000	5689000	Or that is,
5694000	5696000	Grow the F up.
5696000	5697000	Oh, my God.
5697000	5700000	I was just trying to stick with the syllables you put in there.
5700000	5702000	Let's move on with some rapid fire news.
5702000	5704000	Now what we need now is some sort of, you know,
5704000	5708000	mashed up song with a girl's butts about their whole mistake.
5708000	5710000	You know, called Steve Butts.
5713000	5717000	Witcher 3, the Wild Hunt, finally got its reveal this week.
5717000	5721000	Or at least an extended reveal, which they announced the release date.
5721000	5723000	February 24, 2015.
5723000	5727000	It'll be coming out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.
5727000	5729000	In both retail and digital formats.
5729000	5731000	Of course, on GOG Games.
5731000	5733000	Or GOG.com, obviously.
5733000	5734000	I'll be there.
5734000	5736000	And then, this is kind of exciting.
5736000	5740000	Crytek announced, or I should say Deep Silver announced,
5740000	5743000	that Crytek's going to be doing the sequel to Homefront.
5743000	5747000	So, Homefront The Revolution, that's going to be coming out sometime in 2015.
5747000	5750000	Also on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
5750000	5753000	And I'm pretty excited about that.
5753000	5755000	Because the original game looked pretty cool.
5755000	5760000	And be curious to check out the new one when it comes out, eventually.
5761000	5764000	So I'm sure that's going to be something we'll see at probably E3.
5764000	5766000	Probably. Probably.
5766000	5767000	Jason?
5767000	5768000	Alright.
5768000	5771000	The news we have all been waiting for.
5771000	5775000	Harmonix has finally given a release date to...
5775000	5777000	Disney Fantasia Music Evolved.
5777000	5779000	Some people are looking forward to it.
5779000	5781000	It looks like it...
5781000	5785000	Harmonix's touch on things is very much in line with mine.
5785000	5790000	They have officially dated Disney Fantasia Music Evolved for October 21st
5790000	5794000	to be released on the Xbox One and Xbox 360.
5794000	5798000	Disney Fantasia explores the vivid imagery and music of Disney's symphonic film,
5798000	5803000	but with a modern spin and a conductor-like wave of the arm in front of Kinect.
5803000	5805000	So the much...
5805000	5806000	And they've actually...
5806000	5807000	I remember...
5807000	5809000	I don't know if we've reported on it every time,
5809000	5811000	but I think it's been a long time.
5811000	5812000	And they've actually...
5812000	5813000	I remember...
5813000	5815000	I don't know if we've reported on it every single time,
5815000	5819000	but every single time that Harmonix has a reveal for this game,
5819000	5823000	more and more of the soundtrack is revealed.
5823000	5826000	And it's always seemed a little weird to me because they're always very modern,
5826000	5830000	and I wouldn't even call them poppy songs in most cases,
5830000	5832000	but at any rate, they have good songs going into it.
5832000	5838000	And the reveal that accompanied this announcement on this turn was a new level,
5838000	5841000	the neighborhood, a new world, rather, the neighborhood,
5841000	5844000	a surreal glimpse of 1980s New York,
5844000	5847000	with a pastel sky bursting behind skyscrapers.
5847000	5854000	And the songs announced are M.I.A.'s Galang and the Who's the Real Me.
5854000	5858000	For all of you importing fans out there, Retro Game Challenge 2,
5858000	5863000	the fan translation of Game Center CX2, has arrived.
5863000	5867000	Done by Aaron in Japan, as everybody knows him as.
5867000	5871000	Well, not everybody, but people who maybe started with Bomani and stuff
5871000	5873000	probably remember that name, yeah.
5873000	5877000	The DDR crew, as it were, knows Aaron,
5877000	5880000	the last name that I have never been able to pronounce successfully,
5880000	5882000	as Aaron in Japan.
5882000	5885000	And not just text, but graphics as well,
5885000	5890000	so that any Japanese symbols, symbology that isn't just straight-up words
5890000	5892000	have been translated into English.
5892000	5895000	Go forth and enjoy it, because these games are quite fun.
5895000	5898000	This is great that the community went to get this game translated,
5898000	5902000	a real missed opportunity to not put this game out.
5902000	5904000	I mean, I understand maybe the first one didn't do so hot,
5904000	5906000	but it was such a cute little game,
5906000	5909000	and people, I think, really missed out by not checking it out,
5909000	5911000	so I'm glad people get to...
5911000	5914000	I wish people could have got to do this the legal way,
5914000	5916000	but desperate times.
5916000	5919000	Like everything else, well, they brought it, they did bring it here,
5919000	5923000	so I'm pretty sure that licensing has a huge amount to do with this,
5923000	5927000	because I would imagine that the TV station that airs Game Center CX
5927000	5931000	has large claims to it, and probably has high licensing, likeness,
5931000	5933000	something-something rights to it.
5933000	5934000	Yeah, but...
5934000	5936000	The legalities, whatever.
5936000	5942000	But it's here, and everybody can import and hack their legitimate copy
5942000	5944000	to play it in English.
5944000	5946000	Sure.
5946000	5948000	All right, lastly, Dark Soccer for Rapid Fire News.
5948000	5954000	Well, there is some news about an actual TV series, kind of TV series,
5954000	5958000	more like a short interactive TV show that's going to be on Xbox One,
5958000	5960000	Xbox 360, and PS4 in November.
5960000	5963000	It's called Rabbids Invasion, the interactive TV show,
5963000	5967000	so it's a CG animated show that's based off of the Rabbids,
5967000	5971000	and it will require a Kinect or PlayStation camera,
5971000	5976000	and lets you do little mini-games like matching poses or egg fights
5976000	5979000	or stuff like that, and it's up to four players at a time,
5979000	5981000	so that's kind of neat.
5981000	5986000	And there is something I'm kind of excited about.
5986000	5988000	It's Marathon Gamers, if anyone hasn't heard of them.
5988000	5992000	It's a group of friends who have a small charity organization
5992000	5995000	who will be doing the summer marathon of friendship to raise money
5995000	5998000	for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.
5998000	6001000	The group actually is from Huntsville, Alabama,
6001000	6004000	so that's why I kind of have a big interest in them.
6004000	6010000	It's a 48-hour marathon gaming session on June 20th on Stitch.
6010000	6013000	So they're going to be playing Left 4 Dead, Mario Party,
6013000	6017000	all kinds of games, and you can contribute.
6017000	6021000	It will start June 20th at 2 p.m. Central Time,
6021000	6029000	and you can join it on twitch.tv forward slash marathon underscore gamers,
6029000	6033000	or you can go to marathongamers.org and check them out.
6033000	6035000	Please, please, please, please, please help them out
6035000	6038000	because they're doing a great thing.
6038000	6040000	All right, excellent.
6040000	6042000	I like giving shout-outs to the charity streams,
6042000	6044000	lots of good stuff out there.
6044000	6046000	And they're from my home state.
6046000	6049000	All right, let's get into, we've been hyping this up all night.
6049000	6056000	It is time for us to bring back the segment known as Listless.
6056000	6059000	All right, here is the way that Listless works.
6059000	6061000	It's been a little while since we've played this game,
6061000	6063000	but I'm going to explain the rules one more time here, okay?
6063000	6066000	We are going to put together as a highly scientific method
6066000	6069000	for us to determine the definitive list.
6069000	6072000	Once we have put this together, there is no arguing with it.
6072000	6074000	It's done. It's definitive.
6074000	6076000	We've compiled it. You voted on it. It's done.
6076000	6078000	And yes, you will have a chance to vote on the list
6078000	6080000	and help make this a possibility.
6080000	6083000	Head on over to live.vognetwork.com if you wish to play.
6083000	6085000	Those of you that listen on the podcast feed, I'm sorry.
6085000	6089000	You can't play for now, but we are looking at in the next year
6089000	6093000	expanding this segment so that you can actually vote during the week as well,
6093000	6094000	but that will be later on.
6094000	6098000	So for tonight, just the live chatters getting to participate in Listless,
6098000	6103000	not Piss Piss, Kajuno, List, List, L-I-S-T-L-E-S-S.
6103000	6104000	Okay, here's how it works.
6104000	6107000	Tonight we're going to have five people in studio,
6107000	6110000	and we are all going to compile the first list,
6110000	6112000	and we do that by naming our top three.
6112000	6117000	So we'll have five, and we'll take that down to, or we'll take that up to 15.
6117000	6121000	Then comes round two where we all vote something off the list.
6121000	6125000	Now remember in the upgraded Listless rules that we did last year for 2.0,
6125000	6130000	if a host has two answers removed from the list,
6130000	6132000	the third one gets immunity.
6132000	6135000	That way nobody's list gets completely decimated.
6135000	6137000	So we will each eliminate one answer.
6137000	6139000	And also in case of a tie.
6139000	6141000	It wasn't there in case of a tie.
6141000	6145000	The host's choice that wasn't picked gets the break of time.
6146000	6148000	Oh, you're right. I am breaking the engagement.
6148000	6150000	You're throwing it way back. That's all right.
6150000	6152000	It's been a little while. It's been a little while. All right.
6152000	6158000	So anyway, so with, and they're talking in chat that it sounds like List List,
6158000	6160000	like a like like or something in Zelda.
6160000	6162000	No, that's the joke.
6162000	6164000	That's the joke, you guys. That's the joke.
6164000	6167000	All right. Anyway, Crystal Waters, I love you,
6167000	6169000	but I'm going to take your volume down there in a minute.
6169000	6171000	Let's see. What else do I need to say about this?
6171000	6174000	So we're up to 10, and then you guys over at live.vognetwork.com
6174000	6177000	are going to get to vote for your top two answers.
6177000	6179000	You're just going to click them.
6179000	6181000	It's going to pop up right there on the screen.
6181000	6183000	You click your number one, you click your number two,
6183000	6185000	and then you submit, and there it is.
6185000	6188000	We compile the votes and read the answers here a little later on the show.
6188000	6190000	So let's get to it.
6190000	6194000	All right, Crystal, you can come back now that we're ready to actually start making this list.
6194000	6196000	So let's put it up on the board.
6196000	6202000	The question tonight, what are we most looking forward to at E3 2014?
6202000	6204000	We're going to put that up on the board,
6204000	6208000	and those of you over at live.vognetwork.com will be able to see that pop up on your screen.
6208000	6213000	While we wait for that to pop up, we're going to introduce who's playing along tonight.
6213000	6215000	Of course, Techmaster Loki.
6215000	6218000	And Loki, celebrities on game shows always are promoting something.
6218000	6220000	So what are you promoting tonight?
6220000	6224000	I'm promoting... I don't know.
6224000	6226000	Promoting apathy.
6226000	6229000	All right. Apathy, people of America.
6229000	6231000	Loki's promoting apathy. All right, fair enough.
6231000	6235000	Dark Sakura, of course, is here tonight participating as well.
6235000	6239000	Dark Sakura, what are you promoting tonight?
6239000	6241000	Flatulence.
6241000	6243000	Flatulence.
6243000	6245000	All right, there it is. All right.
6245000	6247000	Dark Sakura's here as well.
6247000	6251000	I am here as well, and in good Rob Roberts fashion, I'm promoting myself.
6251000	6256000	Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E if you wish to follow me on the Twittersies.
6256000	6260000	Also joining us tonight in studio is Jason.
6260000	6265000	I'm promoting the Melancholy Awareness Association of America.
6265000	6267000	Oh, are you a sad panda?
6267000	6269000	For their sake, I am.
6269000	6273000	All right. And last but not least, joining us in studio, speaking of apathy.
6273000	6276000	Oh my God. All right, say hello, everybody, to Shane.
6276000	6277000	Hello.
6277000	6278000	Hi, Shane.
6278000	6279000	Hi.
6279000	6281000	This is why I have you take Jamie's mic. I can actually hear you on that one. How are you?
6281000	6282000	I'm fine.
6282000	6284000	And what will you be promoting tonight?
6285000	6290000	I'm going to promote the charity Pediatric AIDS. We give babies AIDS.
6290000	6293000	What? That's not even funny.
6293000	6294000	I thought it was.
6294000	6295000	No, it's not.
6295000	6297000	Look at these people in here. They're laughing.
6297000	6299000	It's awkward laughter because you're weird.
6299000	6302000	He means AIDS and, you know, assistance.
6302000	6303000	Yeah.
6303000	6304000	Butlers.
6304000	6307000	Duh. We give them puppies and walkers.
6307000	6308000	What were you thinking?
6308000	6310000	A 70s diet drug, clearly.
6310000	6311000	All right.
6311000	6313000	What?
6313000	6319000	Let's get into building the list. We're going to create the definitive list with the top answers.
6319000	6323000	Let's start with Jason. What is your first answer for the board?
6323000	6329000	Of course you had to start with me. I've been wrenching this last five minutes trying to figure out what the hell I'm going to say.
6329000	6332000	Well, I need at least another.
6332000	6336000	Oh, hopefully we steal all five of those. So you have this agony.
6336000	6342000	You all can give your answers along in chat as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
6342000	6347000	If you want to help out the hosts by putting some answers up on the board, live.vognetwork.com.
6347000	6361000	Because we have to pay this one forward, I will go with, despite the fact that they have no official show floor present, Val will bust through the arena, interrupting somebody else's keynote, Kanye style, and Half-Life 3. Go get it.
6367000	6372000	Sorry for the awkward silence. I'm writing it down. Hold on.
6372000	6377000	All right. There it is. So, Val, will Kanye interrupt a keynote with Half-Life 3?
6377000	6382000	So you are basically just totally swiping Bobby's winning answer from last year.
6382000	6383000	Ah, that's not cool, man.
6383000	6384000	Is what you're doing.
6384000	6387000	Yeah, well, like I said, I'm paying it forward. I'm paying it forward, dammit.
6387000	6388000	We're going to start that way.
6388000	6390000	Paying it forward, plagiarizing, saving.
6390000	6391000	Fine.
6391000	6394000	That's what I'm going to say from now on. Oh, I can't plagiarize that. I've been paid forward.
6394000	6400000	We'll put it up on the board and see how that goes. Shane, your number three answer.
6400000	6409000	Okay, so I totally wrote down five things, so I thought it was five for some reason, so I will say my number three is,
6409000	6416000	Microsoft realizes we need a new Alan Wake fix and puts a show in production for their dumb Xbox One TV show initiative.
6416000	6420000	Kind of like Twin Peaks, because that's what that game really is.
6420000	6423000	So an Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One, essentially.
6423000	6429000	All right, let's put that up on the board. That's a nice, non-offensive good answer from you. I like that.
6429000	6432000	All right, Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One.
6432000	6436000	All right, let's go now over to Dark Sakura.
6436000	6440000	Dark Sakura, the lovely Dark Sakura, with her number three answer.
6445000	6448000	I'll get a Mass Effect sticker. I'll bring it back for you.
6451000	6454000	Is your mic off, Dark Sakura? I don't know why.
6454000	6456000	Yeah, Shane turned my mic off. Thank you, Shane.
6456000	6461000	All right, so Dark Sakura's answer was Mass Effect anything.
6461000	6465000	But you know what I would really like? An HD remix of the first three.
6465000	6467000	There's those rumors going on up there.
6467000	6473000	Without having to use mods like I've already done. I pretty much already play Mass Effect HD remix, just saying.
6473000	6477000	Fair enough. All right, Mass Effect anything is up there on the board. There it is.
6478000	6481000	Let's go over to me and my number three answer.
6481000	6486000	My number three answer tonight is the Microsoft Game Shows Return.
6486000	6489000	I'm talking one versus a hundred and that stuff. Come on.
6489000	6493000	And you say mine was a gimme. Come on, Rob.
6493000	6497000	Whatever. This is something you obviously quite want to see. You bring up a lot.
6497000	6503000	I think every list list I talk about how I want to frickin' that thing to happen there.
6503000	6504000	What's that every episode?
6504000	6508000	All right, Microsoft's Game Shows Return. Putting that up on the board.
6508000	6512000	All right, Loki, last but not least with your number three answer tonight.
6512000	6515000	Well, you know, I could say something serious, but what fun would that be?
6515000	6524000	So like I came up with the chatroom earlier, it's going to be Red Dead Redemption Cross Midnight Club.
6524000	6526000	It's drift horses with neons.
6528000	6530000	Hey, I'd play that a couple rounds at least.
6530000	6536000	Red Dead Redemption Cross Midnight Club. So drift racing with horses.
6536000	6538000	Old west drift racing.
6538000	6542000	Sort of like Wendy Okupa and that little carousel cart or whatever that is.
6544000	6551000	Except these horses are going to have thumpin' bass and undercarriage lights and all that fun stuff.
6551000	6555000	All right, fine. There it is. It's up on the board there. Red Dead Redemption Cross.
6555000	6558000	Vin Diesel's going to have a cameo because why not?
6558000	6562000	Why not? Why not? All right, let's go to the number two answers.
6563000	6566000	Jason. Yeah, everybody do it. Where have you been, Shane?
6566000	6569000	I started with all the agonizing. Fair answer.
6569000	6570000	Jason.
6570000	6572000	No, there is actually one legitimate one.
6572000	6573000	All right.
6573000	6575000	At least one. I still have to think of a good number one.
6578000	6582000	Google's acquisition of Twitch confirmed with bonuses.
6582000	6586000	With unforeseen things that were not announced in the deal.
6586000	6591000	The reason why all this is taking place and not just, hey Twitch, move into our data centers.
6591000	6597000	Yes, Google, the acquisition as was rumored, what, two weeks ago and then just disappeared.
6597000	6601000	Finalizes with new features to come as a part of it.
6601000	6606000	All right, so I'm going to throw that up on the board as Google Twitch acquisition confirmed with perks.
6606000	6607000	Exactly correct.
6607000	6610000	All right, there it is. You talk about safe answers. All right.
6610000	6614000	I actually don't think, in reality, I actually don't think that's a very safe answer.
6614000	6616000	All right, well, we'll see. All right.
6616000	6620000	Going to Shane's number two answer. Shane, what is your number two answer?
6620000	6626000	My number two answer is giving the fans what they want. Konami announces they're done ruining Silent Hill.
6631000	6636000	And that's it. That's it. There's no new game. There's no actual game. It's just an apology.
6636000	6638000	You know what? We're done.
6638000	6639000	Yeah, they're not going to make any more.
6639000	6641000	All right, they're going to take it out back and shoot it.
6641000	6642000	Yes.
6642000	6646000	All right, sounds good. They're just going to let Pyramid Head cut it up. Here it is.
6647000	6652000	But we are proud to announce Silent Hill Lords of Sirens, the spinoff game.
6654000	6655000	Straight up action.
6655000	6659000	Konami announces they are done ruining Silent Hill. There it is, Shane's number two answer.
6659000	6661000	Dark Sakura, your number two answer, please.
6661000	6663000	X Tango returns.
6664000	6666000	Oh, I was in one of the Tango halls.
6666000	6672000	Ah, that's amazing. X Tango, one of the games we saw many years ago that never happened. Nothing ever happened with it.
6672000	6674000	It was fun.
6674000	6677000	It was a music game where you would put in commands in the characters of Tango.
6677000	6678000	It was great.
6678000	6685000	It was great, yeah. Whatever happened to it? The internet. You know what? If that game was around today, it would have had a Kickstarter.
6686000	6688000	Let's kickstart X Tango.
6689000	6690000	All right.
6690000	6692000	I will do this shit. You watch.
6692000	6694000	And then it will sell a million copies.
6694000	6700000	Time for my number two answer. My number two answer. Okay, I'm going to go like really crazy talk with this.
6700000	6704000	This is fanboy wank. Everybody get your splash zone.
6704000	6706000	F zero and just finish it raw.
6706000	6708000	Nope, nope, nope, nope. Worse.
6708000	6713000	Get your plastic tarp over your head for the splash zone wank that's about to happen. You ready?
6713000	6715000	All right, so here's the thing.
6715000	6719000	The Wii U is going to go online in a big way.
6719000	6723000	And I'm not just talking about like the Dragon Quest X game we've been waiting for.
6723000	6729000	The reason why Phantasy Star Online 2 has been delayed? Wii U exclusive.
6729000	6733000	Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive.
6733000	6737000	Oh, the people in the room seem receptive to that. I thought you'd all boomy for that answer.
6737000	6739000	Boo.
6739000	6741000	I mean, why are you boomy?
6741000	6743000	It's wank, but let's not say that's a bad idea.
6743000	6748000	That'll never happen. Although, I mean, I guess if they have any chance of an MMO coming to them, you know, coming from Sega.
6748000	6752000	Because for some reason Sega loves Nintendo, ironically.
6752000	6756000	Why not? Sega and Nintendo are kind of in bed together. It would make a lot of sense.
6756000	6761000	If Nintendo really wants to come all out there and be like, bam, we're online, that would do it.
6761000	6769000	And then Microsoft would be like, bam, we're online with motherfucking Destiny, which is way better than that fucking game.
6769000	6774000	Not for everybody, though. Is Anna Banana-Chan in Destiny? I don't think so.
6774000	6776000	Nobody's going to understand that joke.
6776000	6778000	It could be, if you name your character.
6778000	6783000	Shane understood it. Alright. Loki, last but not least, your number two answer.
6783000	6788000	Okay. Sticking with my completely serious answers here.
6788000	6798000	I would love to see just an unusual announcement, coming from any of the big three, I guess, of President Cat 2, Prepare for Kittenfall.
6798000	6809000	Oh, that's good. President Cat 2, Prepare for Kittenfall.
6809000	6814000	What's the general synopsis of President Cat 2?
6814000	6821000	It's just, you know, mech suits and kittens and everything that the internet loves.
6821000	6827000	All wrapped in the one nice package. It's got the casual angle, it's got the hardcore angle.
6827000	6828000	It's got cats.
6828000	6831000	Alright. Here is the board so far.
6831000	6834000	Valve, will Kanye interrupt a keynote with Half-Life 3?
6834000	6841000	Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One, Mass Effect anything, Microsoft's game shows return, Red Dead Redemption cross Midnight Club,
6841000	6847000	Google's Twitch acquisition confirmed with perks, Konami announces they are done ruining Silent Hill,
6847000	6853000	X-Tango returns, Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive, and President Cat 2, Prepare for Kittenfall.
6853000	6856000	Man, the elimination round tonight is going to suck.
6856000	6861000	These are all really good answers, but we still have one more set of answers to put up on the board.
6861000	6863000	Jason, what is your number one answer?
6863000	6870000	So far as I know, I don't recall if this developer has a booth and I don't know that I've heard any specific news about it.
6870000	6877000	Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 on the show floor.
6877000	6882000	Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 in a tiny tent.
6882000	6885000	Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 in a tiny tent next to the Capcom booth.
6885000	6890000	Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.
6890000	6892000	And that's Jason's list.
6892000	6895000	Shane, what is your number one answer?
6895000	6899000	It's a little long. You can condense it easily though, I'm sure.
6899000	6909000	Sony and Take-Two announce a partnership to bring the PS4 version of BioShock Infinite to Project Morpheus for amazingly fun virtual rail swinging.
6909000	6914000	Sony plus Take-Two, 3D BioShock Infinite.
6914000	6916000	BioShockulous.
6916000	6918000	BioShockulous.
6918000	6920000	But it's not Oculus.
6920000	6921000	BioMorphius.
6921000	6926000	Alright, Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite. That's probably the best way I can condense that.
6926000	6929000	Any particular reason you went that route, Shane?
6929000	6935000	I really liked that game and I didn't want to be too predictable tonight.
6935000	6940000	So I did not talk about Elite Beat Agents, Pokemon, Mass Effect. I did talk about Silent Hill, but I killed it.
6940000	6947000	Alright, Dark Sakura. That is Shane's list. There it is. Dark Sakura, what is your number one answer?
6947000	6952000	A game that features an all-female cast not written with any misogynistic tendencies in mind.
6952000	6956000	As in, no hyper-sexualization, they're written intelligently, and don't need no man.
6956000	6959000	How the fuck am I supposed to condense that?
6960000	6965000	Let's see, I'm going to put all female cast and credit developed video games.
6965000	6970000	No, because I have seen men that write women well. Brian Michael Bendis writes a very good woman, for example.
6970000	6971000	Murphy Brown the video game.
6971000	6973000	No. That's bullshit.
6976000	6979000	Non-sexist all-woman game. There we go.
6979000	6984000	What was that Fox sitcom back in the late 90s?
6985000	6989000	I don't know. I don't watch that damn show.
6989000	6992000	That's... I would not call that non-misogyny.
6992000	6996000	Alright, all-female game with zero misogyny. That was the best way I could condense that there.
6996000	6997000	Yes.
6997000	6999000	So I'm going to put that up on Dark Sakura's board.
6999000	7002000	And if anyone wants a good example, look at Claymore.
7002000	7003000	Alright.
7003000	7007000	All women, no romantic subplot. None of that shit.
7007000	7008000	Alright.
7008000	7011000	It's not a chick flick show.
7012000	7014000	There it is, that's Dark Sakura's list.
7014000	7024000	My number one answer is that... what will happen is that finally, after all these years, it will be a Half-Life 3 teaser shown at E3.
7024000	7028000	But then halfway through the teaser, GLaDOS interrupts it and says,
7028000	7034000	Oh, were you getting your hopes up? And the 3 shifts into a Portal 3 logo.
7034000	7035000	So GLaDOS...
7035000	7037000	Oh, that would piss everybody off.
7037000	7044000	GLaDOS, Valve trolls Valve is my answer, basically. Valve trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer.
7044000	7046000	How in the hell are you going to summarize that?
7046000	7049000	GLaDOS turns Half-Life 3 into Portal 3, I guess.
7049000	7050000	That would be fantastic.
7050000	7056000	I just put Valve trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer, and you guys already heard the rest of the answer there.
7056000	7063000	Alright, let's go to Loki, and dare I ask it, the last one on the list, your number one answer.
7063000	7072000	My number one answer, I mean, I don't know, I can't think of anything really great and just cheesy, so I guess I will be somewhat serious.
7072000	7082000	Even though they haven't made the movies in a long-ass time, and the games weren't that great, I would love to see Rockstar do a new Matrix game.
7082000	7092000	Because the version of, was it, their game, The Warriors, was one of the best movie adaptation games I've ever seen.
7092000	7102000	And The Warriors, I mean, that game came out way after the movie, obviously, so I would love to see him go back and take over that franchise.
7102000	7107000	So turn a mediocre franchise into a really good one through a video game?
7107000	7108000	Yeah.
7108000	7109000	Alright, awesome.
7109000	7110000	I got it.
7110000	7111000	What?
7111000	7112000	Goonies.
7112000	7113000	Oh, wait.
7113000	7114000	Too late, too late.
7114000	7121000	Alright, there we go, Rockstar does a new Matrix game, so there it is, here are the 15 answers up on the board.
7122000	7124000	Valve, will Kanye interrupt a keynote with Half-Life 3?
7124000	7126000	Google Twitch acquisition confirmed with perks.
7126000	7128000	Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.
7128000	7130000	Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One.
7130000	7132000	Konami announces they are done ruining Silent Hill.
7132000	7134000	Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite.
7134000	7135000	Mass Effect anything.
7135000	7136000	Extango returns.
7136000	7138000	All female game with zero misogyny.
7138000	7140000	Microsoft's game shows returns.
7140000	7142000	Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive.
7142000	7144000	Valve trolls Valve with Portal 3 trailer.
7144000	7146000	Red Dead Redemption cross Midnight Club.
7146000	7150000	President Cat 2 prepare for Kittenfall and Rockstar does a new Matrix game.
7150000	7152000	This is an awfully big list.
7152000	7154000	It's time to trim it up a little bit.
7154000	7158000	This is going to be a very tough round tonight, but it is all part of the process, folks.
7158000	7165000	And if you want to egg on the host, you should be shouting in chat right now which of these is not worthy of the list.
7165000	7170000	Jason, you get the lovely distinction of going first, but that means you can take any one of these out that you want.
7170000	7172000	Jason, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7172000	7174000	Oh, man.
7174000	7181000	You know, the jokes don't quite reach that bar as obvious dumb to get rid of.
7181000	7183000	And all the serious ones are really, really good.
7183000	7185000	This is a really hard decision.
7185000	7192000	But I'm going to say just for plausibility and obvious and gimme, Mass Effect anything.
7192000	7194000	Oh, alright.
7194000	7197000	Only because it's not a stretch. It's the only reason.
7197000	7201000	Alright. You want to keep us living in Wackyville.
7201000	7203000	Alright, fair enough.
7203000	7209000	So in Jason's quest to keep us living in Wackyville, sorry DarkSakura, but you know you're going to get Mass Effect anything anyway.
7209000	7212000	Alright, it is stricken from the list.
7212000	7215000	Shane, which of these answers is not worthy of the list?
7215000	7220000	I'm sorry, Jason, but it's just past its reference time.
7220000	7222000	The Kanye one with the valve thing.
7222000	7224000	That's years old.
7224000	7226000	Are you only distributed because of the Kanye reference?
7226000	7227000	Yes.
7227000	7229000	No, it wasn't his edition.
7229000	7230000	Never mind. Okay.
7230000	7233000	Well, plus we're not going to repeat last year, Jason.
7233000	7235000	It's time for a new year, so I understand.
7235000	7236000	If he didn't eliminate that one-
7236000	7238000	It's not over until it happens.
7238000	7241000	Alright, so there it is. It's not worthy of the list.
7241000	7243000	It has been stricken from the list.
7243000	7247000	So DarkSakura has the distinction of going next.
7247000	7249000	DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7249000	7251000	I'm actually going to take off the Alan Wake TV show.
7251000	7254000	Oh, an Alan Wake TV show. Why that?
7254000	7256000	Because I don't really like Alan Wake.
7257000	7259000	Alright, it is stricken from the list.
7259000	7261000	Sorry, Shane, but it wasn't going to happen anyway.
7261000	7264000	Alright, it is stricken from the list.
7264000	7265000	I like how these have been all tier three.
7265000	7266000	Yeah, it's been all tier-
7266000	7269000	Well, let's see what happens because I'm going next.
7269000	7272000	It's my turn to eliminate an answer.
7272000	7274000	Oh, God, this is hard.
7282000	7284000	I'm going to break the trend here and I'm going to make-
7284000	7287000	I'm unfortunately going to take a second answer off of somebody's list.
7287000	7290000	And Jason, it's going to be you.
7290000	7293000	I'm going to take Google's Twitch acquisition off the list.
7293000	7295000	How? I'm offended.
7295000	7296000	I just-
7296000	7297000	It's not really game news.
7297000	7298000	You're completely safe.
7298000	7300000	It's a little safe.
7300000	7302000	It's kind of the same reason you took the Mass Effect thing off.
7302000	7304000	It's a little safe and I just-
7304000	7306000	I don't know, it's a little bit like-
7306000	7308000	With bonuses.
7308000	7311000	They're going to say something that's just really fantastic.
7311000	7312000	I know, I know.
7312000	7313000	Oh, they're not an independent company.
7313000	7316000	But we're all running off the assumption it's already happening.
7316000	7318000	That's my problem with it.
7318000	7319000	So I'm sorry, Jason.
7319000	7321000	I'm not supposed to have predicted that it won't come to pass.
7321000	7322000	All right.
7322000	7328000	But the good news, Jason, this means Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 has immunity.
7328000	7329000	So there it is.
7329000	7334000	So Loki, that out of the picture, which of the rest of these is not worthy?
7334000	7336000	Loki's whole list is going to survive.
7336000	7337000	I can't believe this.
7337000	7339000	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7339000	7345000	Well, just because I don't know what else they possibly could show at E3 because they only have what-
7345000	7351000	I mean, granted, it is a pretty decent game, Metal Gear Solid 5 and Pro Evo, I guess, 2015.
7351000	7355000	But I don't think that Konami is done ruining Silent Hill.
7355000	7362000	Considering that there's all these popular horror games coming out, especially in the indie scene,
7362000	7366000	they're going to ruin that game until it stops making them any money.
7366000	7367000	Hasn't they already done that?
7367000	7370000	Oh, I think that there's going to be a next-gen Silent Hill game.
7370000	7372000	I bet there will be.
7372000	7373000	So there will be.
7373000	7374000	Look at how-
7374000	7375000	I feel like there'll be a third movie.
7375000	7377000	I want to point out, look at how we treat our guests on this show.
7377000	7384000	Look at Shane's list, also down to one answer with Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite.
7384000	7388000	Dark Soccer gets through with PAR with only one of our answers getting eliminated.
7388000	7389000	Myself and Loki unscathed.
7389000	7390000	Imagine that.
7390000	7391000	How the hell did that happen?
7391000	7393000	Well, it's like they said, orange is the new black.
7393000	7394000	You guys take care of yourselves.
7394000	7396000	Of your own.
7396000	7397000	I will say this.
7397000	7401000	I was very tempted to go with the Red Dead Redemption cross midnight club,
7401000	7403000	but it seemed like too many chatters were really excited about that answer,
7403000	7405000	so I didn't eliminate that.
7405000	7406000	Pure pressure.
7406000	7407000	All right, fine.
7407000	7408000	All right, pure pressure.
7408000	7409000	All right, so here it is.
7409000	7412000	With those five eliminated from the list, we are left with the following.
7412000	7414000	X-Tango returns.
7414000	7416000	Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.
7416000	7418000	Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite.
7418000	7421000	All-female game with zero misogyny.
7421000	7423000	I almost took that off the list too,
7423000	7426000	only because I'm sorry, Dark Soccer.
7426000	7428000	It's not going to happen this year.
7428000	7432000	It's sad, but it's one of those things that's like it's a sad state of affairs,
7432000	7435000	but let me put it this way.
7435000	7436000	I'm looking on Twitter.
7436000	7439000	Some people are at E3 and hanging out and all this stuff, and it's going on,
7439000	7444000	and somebody has already overheard the phrase fucking F-A-G-G-O-T
7444000	7447000	already out on the show floor walking around there,
7447000	7450000	and I'm kind of like and these are the same people
7450000	7452000	that then go post on the comment section of the websites.
7452000	7456000	Why do we need a gamer X, or why do we need a safe space,
7456000	7459000	or why do we need this social movement, or what?
7459000	7463000	But it's not that I disagree with that answer.
7463000	7465000	It's that sadly, I just don't think it's going to happen.
7465000	7468000	Or as I like to say, not all men, but too damn many.
7468000	7471000	All right, but it is still on the list, so we'll see.
7471000	7474000	Also, Microsoft's game shows return.
7474000	7477000	Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive.
7477000	7480000	Valve Trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer.
7480000	7482000	Red Dead Redemption cross Midnight Club.
7482000	7485000	President Cat 2 prepare for Kittenfall.
7485000	7487000	And Rockstar does a new Matrix game.
7487000	7492000	So this is now in your hands, folks that are participating
7492000	7495000	over at the Voice Geeks Network, live.vaganetwork.com.
7495000	7499000	I'm updating the list right now, and in just a couple seconds here,
7499000	7501000	you will be able to answer.
7501000	7505000	So you're going to click on your number one and your number two choices there
7505000	7509000	as soon as the message pops up at the bottom of the screen, and there it is.
7509000	7512000	You can click your number one and your number two and click the answer button.
7512000	7516000	We will compile the list and read the answers a little later on in the show.
7516000	7520000	Looking at our chat room over at live.vaganetwork.com.
7520000	7522000	Some other answers that didn't make it.
7522000	7525000	VidPower says, funny slash serious answer.
7525000	7528000	Rare working on some non-banjo-kazooie 3 game.
7528000	7530000	Let's see.
7530000	7535000	Kaijudo, though it does say Grand Theft Auto 6 with a female lead.
7535000	7537000	Could be interesting.
7537000	7539000	So there you go.
7539000	7542000	Your turn to vote over at live.vaganetwork.com.
7542000	7544000	We will see what the definitive list ends up being tonight.
7544000	7548000	You know, to be fair, Kaijudo, they actually did have, it wasn't a lead,
7548000	7553000	but they had a pretty decent secondary character in Grand Theft Auto 4
7553000	7555000	that was a female.
7555000	7558000	She was kind of like a drug boss, so that was kind of cool.
7558000	7560000	All right, and Kaijudo in chat also says,
7560000	7563000	can I take them all off the list and start a new one?
7563000	7567000	Sure, all you have to do is create your own blog.
7567000	7569000	There you go.
7569000	7572000	But as far as OLR list goes, nope, you're stuck with that.
7572000	7573000	That's part of the scientific process.
7573000	7576000	We don't always agree with science, Kaijudo, but we're stuck with it.
7576000	7578000	So there you go.
7578000	7582000	Let's now take this opportunity to go over to the FUGL question of the week.
7582000	7585000	You take Facebook, you take Google, you slam it together, you get FUGL.
7585000	7595000	We're going to ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities,
7595000	7598000	and we're going to read some of our favorite answers right now on the show.
7598000	7602000	And tonight's FUGL question of the week is, of course, about E3
7602000	7604000	and in line with what we just did.
7604000	7608000	Give us one prediction for one of the big press conferences,
7608000	7610000	Microsoft EA, Ubi, Sony, or Nintendo.
7610000	7612000	Try to be a little risky in your prediction,
7612000	7618000	saying, I think Microsoft will talk about Halo isn't exactly going to impress everyone with your predicting ability.
7618000	7620000	This is your last chance to make your big prediction,
7620000	7622000	so you can be the guy or gal, of course, who says,
7622000	7627000	I called it, as people love to do on the internet later this week.
7627000	7629000	Because, you know, they're going to talk about Halo 5,
7629000	7631000	and somebody's going to be like, totally called that.
7631000	7635000	Totally called Halo 5, because there's always that guy that's like, no shit.
7635000	7636000	All right.
7636000	7638000	Guys, guys, guys.
7638000	7640000	It's going to be a new call of duty.
7640000	7641000	Totally called it.
7641000	7642000	All right.
7642000	7646000	Going to some of the answers over there on Facebook and Google,
7646000	7647000	starting with Facebook.
7647000	7649000	Tiger Claw says, my prediction for Nintendo is going to be,
7649000	7652000	they reveal a brand new Star Fox for the Wii U,
7652000	7657000	fully utilizing the gamepad touch screen, reminiscent of Star Fox Command on the DS.
7657000	7662000	So either that or a new Metroid game on Wii U that's a 2D side scroller.
7662000	7663000	So there you go.
7663000	7668000	And then likes to insert that same answer about Gabe Newell and Half Life 3
7668000	7671000	that already got eliminated from the list earlier.
7671000	7672000	All right.
7672000	7676000	Let's go to the next answer, which is from Rob H., who says,
7676000	7680000	fingers crossed Rare comes back with a good perfect dark
7680000	7685000	and an HD remake of Blastcore, free with Blastcore 2 on both 360 and Xbox One.
7685000	7686000	Oh, God.
7686000	7687000	He is my new best friend.
7687000	7689000	Oh, if there was a new Blastcore,
7689000	7691000	I would buy whatever system it's on in a heartbeat,
7691000	7693000	which I guess would be the one in this case.
7693000	7696000	Renee, our friend from Killer Queens from Outer Space,
7696000	7698000	was on episode 13 of that show, so check it out.
7698000	7701000	Renee says Square Enix announces more updates on Kingdom Hearts 3,
7701000	7704000	revealing new worlds from forgotten animated features,
7704000	7707000	such as the Black Cauldron, Song of the South,
7707000	7709000	you're right, Song of the South,
7709000	7713000	and the unforgettable Donald Duck's World War II propaganda cartoon.
7713000	7714000	Wow.
7714000	7715000	That's a pretty bold answer.
7715000	7719000	Well, the Black Cauldron is, they at least have Disney pins for that.
7719000	7721000	Fabrice A. replies on Facebook.
7721000	7722000	No, wait, wait, wait.
7722000	7723000	It's not something we're saying.
7723000	7724000	You know what would be hilarious?
7724000	7728000	Is if they had, oh, God, what the hell was that movie?
7728000	7730000	Of course, now that I think it,
7730000	7731000	I can't remember the name of the franchise,
7731000	7733000	but the Nicolas Cage movie,
7733000	7736000	where he's going and searching for the artifacts and stuff like that.
7736000	7737000	National Treasure.
7737000	7738000	National Treasure.
7738000	7739000	Wasn't that a Disney movie?
7739000	7742000	Wouldn't that be hilarious to have that as like a world that they go to?
7742000	7743000	A world of Nicolas Cage, absolutely.
7743000	7744000	Exactly.
7744000	7746000	All right, Fabrice A. replies and says,
7746000	7749000	Microsoft announces another price drop for Xbox One and Xbox 360.
7749000	7751000	Sony announces Shenmue 3.
7751000	7753000	Wait a minute, that's quite flipping the script.
7753000	7755000	I always thought it was supposed to be Microsoft that was supposed to have that.
7755000	7757000	Burr replies and says,
7757000	7761000	Sony announces Home 2.0 for PlayStation 4.
7761000	7764000	I'd be curious to see if they would continue Home.
7764000	7767000	You know, it certainly has its fans over on PlayStation 3.
7767000	7770000	There's quite a vocal community over there.
7770000	7773000	I'm kind of surprised they haven't done something on PlayStation 4 yet.
7773000	7776000	So, curious to see what happens with that.
7776000	7778000	Fifth Dream replies and says,
7778000	7782000	My predictions are Nintendo announces the long-awaited Pokemon MMO.
7782000	7786000	Sony gives a release date for Project Morpheus, which arrives with the new VR Home.
7786000	7790000	Microsoft announces Kinect 3.0, which looks suspiciously like a Power Glove.
7790000	7794000	And Final Fantasy XV gets a surprise release at the end of the week.
7794000	7797000	Well, that's a little bit of a stretch, but wouldn't it be fun?
7797000	7799000	Andy R. replies and says,
7799000	7804000	Sega breaks back into the console biz with a new system available next Tuesday.
7804000	7806000	Would be a very Sega thing to do.
7806000	7808000	Dark Charger replies,
7808000	7811000	Nintendo will finally adopt a subscription model for their classic games.
7811000	7813000	Thank you, I like that answer.
7813000	7814000	Rageinator says,
7814000	7817000	Gabe Newell will walk on stage with a one last thing line,
7817000	7820000	rips open a jacket to reveal a t-shirt with a 3 on it,
7820000	7824000	then spikes the microphone, not simply drops it.
7824000	7825000	Awesome Unicorn says,
7825000	7829000	I really don't care what the announcement is, but I just want someone to pull a Beyonce,
7829000	7832000	and Nintendo has shown a willingness to do that with their lesser titles,
7832000	7835000	such as the surprise Inazuma 11 release.
7835000	7838000	Can you imagine the insanity and sheer excitement of an announcement
7838000	7841000	that Super Smash Bros. for the 3DS will be available on the eShop,
7841000	7843000	following their digital event?
7843000	7845000	Again, that's really wishful thinking,
7845000	7849000	but I think you hit the nail on the head with the whole surprise,
7849000	7852000	under the radar title, anything's possible.
7852000	7855000	Something like Mario Maker is a prime candidate.
7855000	7858000	It's not going to be on the eShop during the event.
7858000	7862000	If anything, I'm guessing at this point since we got a July announcement already
7862000	7867000	of the Wii Sports Club thing, it's going to be August.
7868000	7870000	And Hitstun lastly on Facebook says,
7870000	7876000	Nintendo responds to fan feedback by bringing back Mario Kart 64's Block Fort
7876000	7879000	in Smash Bros. Trolls.
7879000	7880000	I like that answer.
7880000	7885000	And going over to Google Plus and reading some of the answers over there.
7885000	7887000	Why don't I see the answers over here?
7887000	7890000	Hello, Google. Come in, Google.
7890000	7892000	Where are my answers?
7892000	7895000	Oh, there they are. Way down there. Hi.
7895000	7897000	Let's get to the comments on this one.
7897000	7899000	Colin M. replies and says,
7899000	7902000	Nintendo announces a new minigame collection for the Wii U.
7902000	7904000	Possible Mario Party U.
7904000	7908000	Well, Colin, with all due respect, that's a safe answer.
7908000	7911000	A minigame collection on the Wii U? You don't say.
7911000	7913000	All right, at least he throws a possible title out there.
7913000	7915000	We'll see. More Mario possibly.
7915000	7917000	ActDeft replies and says,
7917000	7920000	Nintendo adds streaming to the Wii U.
7920000	7922000	Probably not happening, but wouldn't it be awesome?
7922000	7924000	And when Nintendo's new revenue sharing thing for YouTube,
7924000	7926000	it just might happen.
7926000	7928000	I don't think that box is powerful enough,
7928000	7930000	but you never know. You never know.
7930000	7934000	It may not do HD, but maybe a virtual console,
7934000	7937000	like a lounge where you can watch other people play virtual console games.
7937000	7939000	They could do their own thing with it.
7939000	7941000	They wouldn't necessarily have to adopt Twitch. Why not?
7941000	7945000	They could backport replays, highlights into every other game.
7945000	7949000	If Xbox 360's Game Room technology allowed for the recording
7949000	7951000	of playthroughs of classic video games,
7951000	7953000	they could do it with Nintendo.
7953000	7958000	It would take a clever work around for the lower technology.
7958000	7960000	Even the 360 was more powerful than the Wii U.
7960000	7964000	It would take the bad letter E for Nintendo.
7964000	7967000	That E word being effort, and they don't do it.
7967000	7970000	All right, sorry, redertainment last but not least,
7970000	7971000	with The Question Knight saying,
7971000	7975000	With the recent moves by Microsoft to make a previously premium app available to all
7975000	7977000	without needing a gold subscription,
7977000	7981000	Microsoft will need to announce something to make being a paid subscriber to Xbox Live worthwhile.
7981000	7983000	That something is what I think Microsoft will announce.
7983000	7985000	I don't quite know what that will be,
7985000	7989000	but my gut is telling me something involving Comcast, Time Warner, and or DirecTV.
7989000	7992000	Could you possibly be meaning their own channel?
7992000	7995000	Because it seems to be the direction we're heading in right now, but we'll see.
7995000	7998000	All right, that does it for the Google Question of the Week.
7998000	8000000	Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio,
8000000	8004000	or on Google Plus, google.com slash plus, orange launch radio, all one word.
8004000	8008000	We still have some more gaming news for you all, so let's get to it. Loki.
8008000	8013000	All right, so let's see, Mario Kart did pretty well.
8013000	8019000	At launch, it sold over 1 million units, 1.2 million during its debut week,
8019000	8024000	and making that the fastest selling Wii U game to date.
8024000	8028000	So, of course, you know, Reggie's pretty excited about that.
8028000	8033000	They said, you know, the early response of Mario Kart 8 demonstrates that the best days for Wii U are still ahead.
8033000	8038000	This year's E3 is just days away, and it will be all about future games for Nintendo platforms.
8038000	8042000	No shit! It's going to be about future games for Nintendo platforms?
8042000	8045000	I thought they were going to be talking about the Xbox!
8045000	8049000	That's the dumbest fucking statement he could make, but whatever.
8049000	8052000	Hooray for Mario Kart 8.
8052000	8059000	By the way, this was the article that may have gotten me into a little bit of trouble on Twitter this week.
8059000	8067000	I might have had a big ass sassy mouth, and I might have written a tweet that my buddy Godfrey over at Gamertag Radio retweeted,
8067000	8073000	and somebody over at Polygon might have seen it and had an issue with something my sassy ass mouth had to say.
8073000	8081000	And I basically said something to the effect of, you know, well, Mario Kart 8 sells 1.2 million in its first weekend,
8081000	8084000	which is what Polygon predicted it would sell in its entire lifespan.
8084000	8087000	Way to go, games analyst! Thumbs up emoji.
8087000	8092000	And I got a little reply from a guy that works at Polygon.
8092000	8096000	In fact, I think he's kind of a high-up mucky-mup over there, Ben Kucera.
8096000	8100000	And he basically replied saying, should I bring up the conversation here?
8100000	8107000	Well, like I say, my policy on analysts and why I don't really like to talk about analysts on the show,
8107000	8109000	you can't spell analysts without anal.
8110000	8115000	I just, I'm the, if I'm going to be analyzing stuff, I'm going to do it my own way.
8115000	8119000	I'm not going to, you know, quote some dude that's got, you know, well, see,
8119000	8122000	at least this guy has a little bit of experience in the industry,
8122000	8125000	not necessarily someone that just crunches numbers all day long.
8127000	8129000	So, all right, I'm trying to bring up the conversation I had.
8129000	8131000	So here's the tweet that started off.
8131000	8137000	I put, so, Mario Kart 8 sold in a weekend what Polygon predicted it would sell in a lifetime, right?
8137000	8139000	Got to love games analyst, thumbs up.
8139000	8142000	And that got, by the way, seven retweets and ten favorites.
8142000	8147000	So Ben Kucera replies and says, it still needs to sell over four million more units
8147000	8152000	or nearly a one-to-one ratio with a tiny Wii U install base to prove the point.
8152000	8154000	Everyone is happy the game is a hit,
8154000	8158000	but it's a long ways from beating the second worst selling title in the series.
8158000	8165000	At least try to understand what you're criticizing before you start the smack talk colon P.
8165000	8169000	And I'm like, oh, it's going to be like, oh, you're going to come at me like that?
8169000	8171000	Back rolls? Okay.
8171000	8174000	I'm going to start calling you crazy eyes, I hope you know.
8174000	8178000	My sassy mouth might have replied,
8178000	8180000	because I was like, well, he was kind enough to let me know his thoughts,
8180000	8182000	so maybe I should reply in kind.
8182000	8188000	So I wrote back and I said, assuming Wii U install base doesn't grow significantly this holiday.
8188000	8190000	Admittedly, it's an uphill climb,
8190000	8195000	but I think what was overlooked in the original analysis was Wii U adopter makeup.
8195000	8198000	It's small, yes, but fiercely Nintendo loyal.
8198000	8202000	To say 20% here means 20% here didn't turn out to be accurate,
8202000	8205000	but we will see when and if the install base grows.
8205000	8209000	And that's when he wrote that tweet that said at least know what you're criticizing.
8209000	8212000	And I wrote back and I said, here is what I'm criticizing.
8212000	8214000	I realized the article's main point was lowest selling,
8214000	8217000	but, and I put a little screen cap there of where they showed,
8217000	8221000	Mario Kart 8 Wii was going to sell 1.2 million units overall.
8221000	8227000	And I said, in this internet ADD reading age, these pictures can truly wield many words.
8227000	8231000	And then I said, for what it's worth, I think your site overall is typically better balanced.
8231000	8233000	There's other sites that sensationalize way worse.
8233000	8237000	I'd never give them attention by calling them out on Twitter, which is true.
8237000	8240000	But, okay, Shane's desperate to say something on this.
8240000	8242000	What'd you want to say on this, Shane?
8242000	8245000	All right. Yes, Shane, what?
8245000	8249000	I wanted to say first, I think Polygon has always been bad ever since they launched
8249000	8255000	and gave themselves all that media hype about, look at the behind the scenes crap that we're doing.
8255000	8259000	Yeah, it was a little silly, but it was years ago, to be fair.
8259000	8261000	And Bobby can't ban me from talking right now,
8261000	8265000	so I would say Polygon is more sensationalist than Kotaku lately.
8265000	8270000	And Kotaku's a lot more readable than Polygon has been in a while.
8270000	8272000	Interesting. All right.
8272000	8275000	I don't know. I don't visit that website.
8275000	8280000	And I don't know how much longer I'll visit the other if that continues to be the trend.
8280000	8284000	I did not get a reply to my little retort, just saying.
8284000	8285000	Little thing there.
8285000	8289000	All right. Anyway, did you get all of your stories out, Loki?
8289000	8293000	No. I was also going to mention that Watchdog sold 4 million copies.
8293000	8300000	So that did pretty well, considering that it was slightly delayed from when they originally thought it would be out.
8300000	8305000	It's interesting, because going back to the conversation we were having about exactly those same two games last weekend,
8305000	8311000	you made the point that you see a lot more Mario Kart media than you've been seeing Watchdog's media.
8311000	8315000	Call it selective bias, and that may be the case, but like...
8315000	8316000	Yeah, I think that's the case.
8316000	8321000	In the week and a half that we are now in for both of those games' release,
8321000	8325000	I've seen a fair amount of trailers, a lot of online coordination,
8325000	8330000	a lot of Twitter and other coordination to play games online, and a lot of stuff for Mario Kart.
8330000	8338000	I have seen three Watchdog spoofs, one by Mega64, another...
8341000	8346000	No, I've seen one. I'm actually... I think I'm confusing it for like a picture.
8346000	8355000	Oh no, there was somebody that I follow that has a game deconstruction talking channel on Blip.
8355000	8357000	He might still be on YouTube.
8357000	8364000	He was deconstructing that apparently one of the Watchdog missions is you have to kill someone in prison that knows who you are by avoiding the guards.
8364000	8369000	Except for the fact that the prisoner was scheduled to be executed anyways. Why not just let things run its course?
8369000	8374000	So I was seeing a lot of deconstructions and spoofs about the content of Watchdogs,
8374000	8379000	and there may be a third example in there, I don't remember what it is, but those two chiefly I can remember right now,
8379000	8385000	and I see a lot of fun, hey this game is fun, let's fucking play it, coming out of Mario Kart.
8385000	8394000	Yeah, it's gaining a lot of steam, and look, I totally get the idea that the game,
8394000	8398000	if the Wii U doesn't get a bigger install base, then that game isn't going to sell more copies.
8398000	8401000	I totally get that, because there isn't much of an install base for the Wii U,
8401000	8405000	but I don't think it was fair to say because it sold 20% here, it's going to sell 20% here,
8405000	8411000	because that's assuming that those people that bought the system are exact same proportional make-up of the people that bought the system over here.
8411000	8414000	So that was my issue with that whole thing. Anyway.
8414000	8420000	Moving on, let's talk about, speaking of Nintendo, I kind of referenced this briefly earlier in the show,
8420000	8426000	but I'm sure a lot of you guys heard that Satoru Iwata is actually not going to be at E3 this next week.
8426000	8431000	He will not be making the show, which, you know, usually he'd be in behind closed doors meetings anyway, doing interviews.
8431000	8435000	It would be very hard to catch him out on the show floor, very rare.
8435000	8439000	But his physician has actually advised him to not travel overseas.
8439000	8445000	Now, this won't really have a big impact anyway, because again, he was really only there for meetings and interviews anyway,
8445000	8453000	and he can tape appearances in Japan for this Nintendo Direct thing that they're doing anyway, so it just kind of works out.
8453000	8460000	But regardless, there's certainly that area of mystique of, oh, he's sick enough to not be traveling overseas.
8460000	8464000	Hopefully this is just one of those abundance of caution sort of things, and there isn't something really wrong,
8464000	8468000	because that would be a real bummer to hear that Iwata's sick or something.
8468000	8473000	Sick enough to not be a sardine for 14 hours is not necessarily very sick.
8473000	8477000	You could have an ear infection, the flight would be fucking miserable, and you would skip it.
8477000	8480000	Yeah. So, you know, again, hopefully this is just a move out of an abundance of caution.
8480000	8485000	E3 can be really, I mean, it can really wear down your immune system and stuff, too.
8485000	8488000	Just, you know, the constant on-the-go stuff, so, you know.
8488000	8489000	Con plague.
8489000	8495000	Yeah, exactly. So, I can see why he'd want to stay home if the doctor, you know, tells him to.
8495000	8501000	I'll probably get sick from the damn thing, I always do, but I'll take my vitamin C supplements just in case.
8501000	8503000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
8503000	8509000	I have some stuff. Actually, what I have is a system that doesn't want to help me today.
8509000	8513000	But this is something really good, and this is something that affects us.
8513000	8515000	Because we're going to be there, Rob.
8515000	8516000	We are.
8516000	8517000	We're going to GamerX.
8517000	8518000	Woohoo!
8518000	8522000	And it looks like that there will be major game publishers who are showing some support.
8522000	8528000	Well, Major is kind of like, oh yeah, okay, I guess you're kind of major.
8528000	8534000	But they are giving support to the convention, so is Ubisoft and NIS America.
8534000	8539000	So they will be there for the second and last GamerX.
8539000	8547000	So I think that that's going to be good that we're seeing, you know, I wish that we would have enough more support.
8547000	8552000	I mean, because we have BioWare there, IndieCade, Cards Against Humanity, a bunch of others.
8552000	8556000	I wish that we had enough to see enough support to go for another con.
8556000	8559000	Yeah, I hope they'll be convinced to do a third year.
8559000	8563000	But, you know, we're going to go, we're going to have fun, and we'll party like it is the last one.
8563000	8565000	I had a great time last year, we're going to have a good time this year.
8565000	8566000	There's going to be a panel.
8566000	8569000	The panel's going to be happening Saturday at 2 o'clock.
8569000	8571000	Podcast Cross Zone Returns for its second panel.
8571000	8574000	We're going to do it a little differently this time.
8574000	8578000	And DarkSakura, you are offered a spot up on the panel if you'd like to speak on it.
8578000	8579000	I said yes.
8579000	8581000	Okay, I couldn't remember if you said yes or not, so I didn't want to push you.
8581000	8586000	No, I'm just totally not going to go, and I'm just going to sit in the back and heckle and throw shit.
8586000	8589000	Well good, the good news is we made room for you on the panel, so you're going to be up there.
8589000	8590000	I'll be there.
8590000	8593000	I'll be good, and we're going to have a lot of other guest speakers up there too, so this will be fun.
8593000	8595000	And then folks in the audience as well.
8595000	8597000	We need to discuss cosplay, Rob.
8597000	8600000	Oh boy, I need to discuss losing 25 pounds, but yes.
8600000	8601000	No, no, no, no, no.
8601000	8610000	Oh come on, Rob, if a guy who is a foot shorter than you and probably three times your weight can cosplay Sailor Moon, you can cosplay anything.
8610000	8611000	That's right.
8611000	8614000	If we can have Manfay, you can cosplay anything.
8614000	8616000	Well that makes me feel better.
8616000	8618000	Alright, let's go over to Loki.
8619000	8632000	Alright, so this is kind of goofy, but Devolver Digital is on, let's see, they're actually planning on localizing Pigeon Dating Sim.
8632000	8633000	Hataful Boyfriend?
8633000	8634000	Yes they are.
8634000	8636000	Oh my god, that game is the best.
8636000	8639000	They are localizing Hataful Boyfriend.
8639000	8641000	Even though it's already been done.
8641000	8651000	They have a fantastic press release to go along with that, you know, talking about, you know, Love is for the Birds, you know, the NEST hardcore pigeon dating sim for fans everywhere.
8651000	8670000	Basically, you know, they were talking about how there's, what was it, a lot of games based on first person shooters and stuff and they thought that the demographic of semi-realistic pigeon dating simulations are the next great frontier in video games.
8670000	8671000	I love their humor.
8671000	8673000	But yeah, they're going to be working on that.
8673000	8676000	So it's going to be available, playable at E3 by appointment only.
8676000	8683000	And it's going to launch during the summer on PC, Mac, via Steam, Good Old Games, Humble and other digital storefronts.
8683000	8686000	Shit, we need to hit Devolver Digital as soon as we get into the LACC.
8688000	8696000	Continuing on, games that will appear in America, will appear in general, despite the fact that the dating sim had been done previously but is getting localized.
8697000	8703000	Shovel Knight was kickstarted last year, a couple months, a few more months than just last year.
8703000	8713000	It was originally slated for just a $75,000, it originally wanted $75,000, it wound up with $300,000.
8714000	8727000	The Yacht Club Games has confirmed by Backer News Release, which is public so everybody sees it anyways, that the 8-bit inspired adventure game Shovel Knight will be here on June 26th.
8727000	8734000	Get ready for the greatest 8-bit inspired adventure game to sweep you off your feet and deliver pure fun directly to your soul with shovels.
8736000	8738000	I'm looking forward to checking it out, it looks so cute.
8738000	8740000	Did you back it? I backed it.
8740000	8741000	I did not back it.
8742000	8744000	I actually still have yet to back a kickstarter.
8744000	8749000	You know what, I actually have another kickstarter game I just got and I haven't played it yet, that Mung to Sleep.
8749000	8754000	That's that one that's the horror game that's done from the perspective of a two year old.
8757000	8765000	Alright, well, let's take this opportunity to get some listener feedback in a segment we do every week here where you guys can participate with the show by emailing us to our mailbag.
8765000	8769000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is our email bag.
8769000	8770000	Yeah, do it.
8770000	8775000	And Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag head first and find an email or four or five.
8775000	8776000	I dipped a toe in.
8776000	8777000	You dipped a toe in?
8777000	8778000	There were only two so I dipped a toe in.
8778000	8779000	Just two? Alright.
8779000	8781000	And my toe has been freshly washed today.
8781000	8783000	Then two emails to read tonight on the show.
8783000	8786000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us your e3 thoughts.
8786000	8787000	My toe smell of lemongrass.
8788000	8791000	Hello again, OLR gang.
8791000	8796000	I very much agree that Mario Kart 8 could be a tipping point for gamers to jump in on the Wii U.
8796000	8805000	I have not purchased any of the next gen consoles, mainly because of the we'll fuck you over less than the other guy mentality that Sony and Microsoft assumed initially.
8805000	8811000	However, Nintendo is starting to build game steam with their newer releases and they may be the winner of my next paycheck.
8811000	8813000	That's funny.
8814000	8816000	The specifics about the pod mentioned last week.
8816000	8818000	Our show is called The Village Idiots.
8818000	8821000	It can be found on iTunes, Stitcher or at villagepodcast.bestpro.com.
8821000	8823000	Well, hello Village Idiot Matt.
8823000	8825000	Nice to make the connection.
8825000	8826000	There's the connection.
8826000	8831000	That's the guy I felt bad last week because I'm all like, you could have given yourself a promotion.
8831000	8833000	So he did email it back and give a promotion.
8833000	8834000	That's great.
8834000	8839000	We also host a show on the same RSS feed called Popcorn and Profanity, which is a film pod.
8839000	8847000	All updates on our show can be found on our homepage villageidiotspodcast.blogspot.com or twitter at villagepodcast.
8847000	8851000	We should be getting more content up soon, but I am in the process of beginning a new job.
8851000	8852000	Nursing!
8852000	8853000	Good.
8853000	8855000	So forgive us if it takes a little time.
8855000	8856000	You know what?
8856000	8858000	Nursing is a little bit more important than podcasting.
8858000	8860000	So, um...
8860000	8862000	Slightly. Only a slight bit though.
8862000	8863000	Nurse away.
8863000	8865000	Gamers unite.
8865000	8866000	Thanks again and keep up the good work.
8866000	8868000	Matt, Raging Janitor.
8868000	8873000	I like that name Popcorn and Profanity because that's definitely my living room when watching a movie.
8873000	8878000	And, um, I'm actually going to go ahead and list locations since it's an email.
8878000	8879000	Fargo, North Dakota.
8879000	8880000	Oh, okay.
8880000	8885000	I think you were the first person from North Dakota I've ever conversed with in any form in my life.
8885000	8886000	There you go.
8886000	8887000	I'm serious.
8887000	8888000	Alright.
8888000	8889000	Which is kind of sad.
8889000	8890000	I want to go there someday.
8890000	8891000	Worldwide show.
8891000	8892000	Yeah.
8892000	8895000	There's listeners everywhere at Orange Lawns Radio, even North Dakota.
8896000	8900000	It proves that there are, you know, when we get Delaware that'll be different.
8900000	8901000	Or Iowa.
8901000	8903000	We've had Iowa, haven't we?
8903000	8904000	We've had Iowa.
8904000	8905000	Hi, Iowa people.
8905000	8906000	Heart.
8906000	8907000	Shout out.
8907000	8908000	Iowa in the house.
8908000	8910000	I would like to find fellow people that live in Alabama and not, you know...
8910000	8912000	You've already met some of those though.
8912000	8917000	No, I was in Louisiana and in Florida, but I've only met like one person in Alabama and I think he moved.
8917000	8918000	Oh.
8918000	8920000	One of the Florida people now is a coworker.
8920000	8921000	Okay.
8921000	8922000	How funny.
8922000	8923000	At Locat.
8923000	8924000	Only is an at-home locatter.
8924000	8925000	Gotcha.
8925000	8926000	So funny.
8926000	8929000	What's up, Orange Lounge guys and gal?
8929000	8930000	Thank you.
8930000	8932000	Black Wolf reminding us the Rob D was in Iowa.
8932000	8933000	I met him at Anime Central years ago.
8933000	8934000	I love the Rob D.
8934000	8935000	He's a nice boy.
8935000	8936000	Where is he these days?
8936000	8937000	Go on.
8937000	8939000	He was a nice boy.
8939000	8946000	I do believe it was the Rob D who delivered...
8946000	8948000	Is that who I got?
8948000	8949000	No.
8949000	8951000	I'm going to have to go back and recheck this.
8951000	8952000	Okay.
8952000	8953000	But I will say this.
8953000	8955000	He had the bomb radio voice.
8955000	8957000	He had a great, like Jason does, he has a great radio voice.
8957000	8960000	And he used to do that show on all games about the history.
8960000	8961000	It was like this day in gaming.
8961000	8962000	T-dig.
8962000	8963000	That was it.
8963000	8964000	It was a fun little show.
8964000	8968000	Well, may I continue with the last and second and only other email?
8968000	8970000	All right.
8970000	8972000	What's up, Orange Lounge guys and gal?
8972000	8974000	Thank you for recognizing me.
8974000	8977000	I feel like you guys are my Monday morning saviors.
8977000	8981000	So much work to do on Mondays and your gaming nonsense and news keep me smiling all day.
8981000	8982000	Aw, shucks.
8982000	8984000	We're a big oxymoron.
8984000	8989000	One, I would love an explanation on Jamie's crazy love of tacos.
8989000	8991000	Never caught the history on that one.
8991000	8993000	Plus I have some recipes to share if she's interested.
8993000	8994000	Okay.
8994000	8996000	My taco thing is actually burrito love.
8996000	8997000	Okay.
8997000	8998000	I've been lying to me all these years.
8998000	8999000	Fuck yeah.
8999000	9000000	Okay.
9000000	9001000	Wait, wait, wait.
9001000	9004000	I really, really love tacos because when I finally got...
9004000	9006000	After being in California for years and years,
9006000	9011000	I finally got introduced to real tacos going to a little taqueria across the street from where I worked.
9011000	9013000	And I'm like, they're not folded.
9013000	9014000	These are fucking good.
9014000	9016000	They're loaded with yummies.
9016000	9018000	Taco Tuesday.
9018000	9020000	And that's where Taco Tuesday was born.
9020000	9023000	Which I still don't understand how we're supposed to answer the question.
9023000	9025000	Like, what's so great about a taco?
9025000	9027000	Have you had one?
9027000	9029000	Like, it's a taco.
9029000	9036000	It's a slightly sweet corn tortilla with delicious meats of any variety you could think of.
9036000	9038000	And the place that I would go to even had tongue tacos.
9038000	9039000	Ew.
9040000	9042000	Rob tongue is meat muscle.
9042000	9043000	It's muscle.
9043000	9045000	You shave the bumpy bits off it, it tastes like meat.
9048000	9050000	I don't know when that happened.
9050000	9054000	I was about to say something and out came a burp.
9054000	9055000	I'm sorry.
9055000	9057000	I'm sorry, listeners.
9057000	9059000	That's what happens when you have too many tacos.
9059000	9062000	No, that comes out the other end.
9062000	9064000	But my true love...
9064000	9066000	What?
9066000	9068000	You nasty.
9068000	9070000	So? You got it wrong.
9070000	9072000	This show. This show.
9072000	9075000	No, seriously. I just was about to open my mouth to retort something.
9075000	9077000	Which I forgot what my retort was.
9077000	9079000	My retort was Choco Taco. That was my retort.
9079000	9081000	Choco Tacos are pretty damn good.
9081000	9084000	But never ever ever put marshmallows on anything ever.
9084000	9087000	Anyway, my true love is burritos.
9087000	9089000	Because burritos are like...
9089000	9095000	Especially carne asada with potato and cheese.
9095000	9097000	Just like that. Or fish or fish burrito.
9097000	9099000	I love fish tacos too.
9099000	9101000	Because I go that way.
9103000	9105000	I love tacos, really.
9105000	9107000	Tacos, you can hold them in.
9107000	9109000	I discovered a new love and I hate fast food.
9109000	9112000	But oh my god, I love the crispy shrimp things from Del Taco.
9112000	9116000	I hope our emailer is happy with this turn of events here.
9116000	9119000	Because I literally can't even right now.
9119000	9121000	Tacos are...
9121000	9123000	Tacos are life.
9123000	9125000	How can you deal with the four of us in this room then?
9126000	9129000	It's a job.
9129000	9131000	Because you literally can't even...
9131000	9133000	Weren't you going somewhere?
9133000	9136000	See, Agdeft agrees with me.
9136000	9139000	And SSJ100Matt agrees that carnitas are good too.
9139000	9143000	I like it that I bring up shrimp.
9143000	9145000	And SSJ100Matt brings up carnitas.
9145000	9147000	We're like the trafiest Jews that ever traffed.
9147000	9150000	Taco Lounge Radio. Live at VOG Network.
9150000	9152000	Every Sunday night at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern.
9152000	9154000	I just...
9154000	9156000	I can't.
9156000	9158000	Two, I'm a huge...
9158000	9160000	Well, if you can't, I already done can't.
9160000	9162000	So, get a new contraction.
9162000	9164000	Bitch, no.
9164000	9166000	Hearts.
9166000	9170000	Two, I'm a huge comic books collecting nerd and I've taken plenty of crap for it.
9170000	9175000	What were the things that you did or still do that people called you nerd for besides gaming?
9175000	9177000	Comics.
9178000	9184000	I had the entire run of like the 80s through 90s Wolverine all up until before I moved out here.
9184000	9188000	Like, from the mid 80s up through the late 90s.
9188000	9192000	And then I gave them to some guy because I knew he'd like them and I couldn't take them with me.
9192000	9194000	This show?
9194000	9196000	I needed Brockie.
9196000	9198000	You think I'm kidding?
9198000	9201000	We've had this show for like 12 years.
9201000	9204000	This show has been on a long time even before I was seeing Alan.
9204000	9207000	And so I would go out on dates with guys and, you know, so what do you do for fun?
9207000	9211000	Well, I have a long running podcast on the internet about video games.
9211000	9215000	Oh, cool.
9215000	9217000	I don't play games.
9217000	9219000	And then turns out...
9219000	9221000	I'm gonna walk this way.
9221000	9223000	Turns out they do play games, just not video games.
9223000	9225000	If you know what I mean.
9225000	9230000	I also larped in college the first time.
9231000	9237000	My friend Ashley and I used to sit in study hall and create our own tabletop RPG.
9237000	9239000	Drawing maps and everything.
9239000	9241000	It was fantastic.
9241000	9244000	Loki, is there something nerdy you still do that you get made fun for?
9244000	9247000	I mean, your wife kind of teases you about everything, doesn't she?
9247000	9249000	Yeah, pretty much everything.
9249000	9251000	I had one other.
9251000	9255000	My friend Courtney and I would sit and quote the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies.
9255000	9257000	Verbatim.
9257000	9260000	Ever since... We did this all the way through middle school.
9260000	9261000	That's pretty nerdy.
9261000	9264000	And then she went to a different high school than I did, but we did them for part of the sole reason,
9264000	9268000	because this other girl named Catherine, who lived around the corner from my house,
9268000	9272000	and her mom and my mom were friends.
9272000	9277000	She used to talk with her mouth full of food and it was gross, so we just started quoting turtle movies.
9277000	9281000	It was awesome. I still have those movies memorized, I swear.
9281000	9283000	Alright, rest of the email.
9283000	9285000	Fuck.
9286000	9290000	I was going to see if you could remember any of the movie, but then I realized it's really a road I don't want to go down.
9292000	9293000	Question.
9293000	9296000	Do you like penicillin on your pizza?
9296000	9298000	Read the rest of the email.
9298000	9301000	You guys are freaking sweet. Keep the show coming.
9301000	9305000	P.S. Thanks for playing my demo track last week while answering the question.
9305000	9308000	I know you didn't have to. Muchas gracias.
9308000	9311000	And I'm not doing it for other people, because I don't want to open the floodgates.
9311000	9313000	You play my song, play my song. No.
9313000	9316000	DJ, play my song now.
9316000	9317000	You heard that song?
9317000	9319000	He gets to do it because he thought of it first.
9319000	9321000	Alright, unless you want to do a new intro.
9321000	9328000	I'm not doing a redub of the turtle movies in my voice, because I can't do the New York-y accent.
9328000	9332000	Unless I did it like an old Jewish man.
9332000	9334000	You could be Splinter.
9335000	9341000	Imagine Splinter instead of having his fake Kevin-class Japanese accent.
9341000	9346000	You know? Sound like an old Hasidic man from prom heights.
9346000	9347000	Mel Brooks, basically.
9347000	9349000	No. No, no, no. Of course.
9349000	9351000	Alright. Is that it for emails?
9354000	9355000	Chevy Nova?
9355000	9357000	Alright, there it is. That's it for the email.
9357000	9358000	You get it!
9358000	9363000	Participate at orangelaungerator.com is the place to send your emails.
9363000	9368000	Alright, I am closing up the listless votes right after this segment, so if you haven't voted,
9368000	9373000	log into the site right now and vote listless, or you are screwed and you don't get to participate.
9373000	9379000	So here it is. The FUs of the week time. Why? Because tradition?
9379000	9380000	Because fuck.
9394000	9402000	Fuck you to act deft for sending me a picture of a chibi Deadpool riding a pig screaming tacos.
9402000	9404000	Oh my god, that sounds amazing.
9404000	9406000	I want this shirt now.
9406000	9407000	What?
9407000	9411000	I want this shirt with every fiber of my being, because he also kind of looks like Gur.
9411000	9420000	That's exactly Gur. The whole thing is it's a parody of Gur writing, because he did the thing where he yelled tacos.
9420000	9422000	I love tacos.
9422000	9428000	But, but, but, I will, I'm going to correct the entire Deadpool fandom.
9428000	9430000	These are two fuck yous.
9430000	9434000	Number one, Deadpool's not a mutant. In the comics, Deadpool's not a mutant.
9434000	9438000	Number two, Deadpool actually does not like chimichangas. He just likes the word.
9438000	9443000	That had been proven in an issue of Cable and Deadpool.
9443000	9444000	Well, it's important.
9444000	9447000	When he comes by, he's saying chimichanga, chimichanga, and she's like, what would you like for dinner?
9447000	9449000	Enchiladas.
9450000	9453000	Because he doesn't actually like chimichangas, so.
9453000	9455000	I know way too much about comics.
9455000	9457000	There were Deadpool cosplayers at Phantom Man. They were really good.
9457000	9464000	They should totally have a 90's sitcom show called Cable and Deadpool.
9464000	9469000	Well, they were sort of like an old married couple, kinda, you know, in the comic.
9469000	9471000	They even made jokes about it.
9471000	9478000	However, what I might do, I'm thinking about doing this, Rob, for the convention if I can't make another cosplay.
9478000	9480000	I'm thinking about making a head pool.
9480000	9482000	Do you know what head pool is?
9482000	9483000	No.
9483000	9485000	The undead head of Deadpool from another dimension.
9485000	9487000	This is a long FU segment.
9487000	9490000	FU to people who get their comic facts wrong.
9490000	9492000	Alright, Jason, you're FU of the week.
9492000	9498000	FU to California for having the bump strips on the inside of your lane and not on the line or over.
9498000	9501000	It's just fucking annoying.
9501000	9503000	There's a lot of weird shit in this state, isn't there?
9503000	9505000	65 mile an hour speed limit on the highway.
9506000	9508000	I think some of them are also wake up bumps.
9508000	9510000	Yeah, but they're not supposed to be inside the lane.
9510000	9512000	You'll get to see 70 on the way to LA tomorrow.
9512000	9518000	I have already driven that once before. Twice before. Possibly thrice before.
9518000	9519000	Oh fine.
9519000	9524000	Tigerclaw, I am going to correct you then. A mutate is not someone who has been experimented on by using mutant DNA.
9524000	9528000	A mutate is a person who has just been mutated post birth.
9528000	9529000	Nine o'clock, people. Nine o'clock.
9529000	9531000	Marvel universe, go catch up.
9531000	9533000	And FU to 100 degree weather.
9533000	9534000	Lowkey.
9534000	9537000	Yeah, just FU to the weather. It's too fucking hot.
9537000	9539000	I don't want to go outside.
9539000	9542000	My FU of the week goes to the migraine I had last night that was killer.
9542000	9544000	Oh my god, it was so awful.
9544000	9547000	I was watching Orange is the New Black because that show was amazing.
9547000	9551000	And like halfway through the second episode, I started getting this massive headache.
9551000	9554000	And I think I might have just OD'd on meat.
9554000	9557000	And the reason why I say that, get your minds out of the gutter.
9557000	9561000	The reason why I say that, we went to this, Flaco Jones had a little birthday thing over the weekend.
9561000	9564000	And we went to this Korean barbecue place. It's not far from where I live.
9564000	9568000	And it's really good, but I ate a lot of meat, you guys.
9568000	9571000	A lot. Because it's all you can eat and you just put it on the grill.
9571000	9574000	You grill it yourself because I guess that's how it's cheap.
9574000	9576000	And I ate a lot of meat.
9576000	9579000	I think I gave myself a meat migraine.
9579000	9583000	FU to Rob. We're talking about a lot of food because I have had no appetite for the last week.
9583000	9584000	Is it a meat grain?
9584000	9586000	A meat grain, yes it was.
9586000	9589000	I've never been to Korean barbecue.
9589000	9591000	You should go somewhere. It was fun.
9591000	9592000	I've never been.
9592000	9593000	You guys will have an OLR date.
9593000	9597000	Alright. It's time to figure out who won List List, you guys.
9597000	9601000	It's over. It's done. We're wrapping it up here.
9601000	9610000	List List tonight is time to figure out what is the thing you are most looking forward to at E3 2014.
9610000	9613000	It's time to reveal the definitive list.
9613000	9616000	Here it is, your top three answers.
9617000	9621000	In a tie for third place. We have a tie for third place tonight.
9621000	9625000	A tie for third place, Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.
9625000	9631000	And an all female game with zero misogyny.
9631000	9632000	Go you.
9632000	9633000	Go feminism.
9633000	9638000	Alright. In second, Well Feminism got third place tonight. Let's see.
9638000	9640000	Hey, this is better than what we normally get.
9641000	9646000	I feel bad laughing at that. That was actually a really good singer, actually.
9646000	9648000	It's fucking true.
9648000	9649000	It's sad, but alright.
9649000	9652000	Alright, here it is. Your number two answer.
9652000	9658000	The definitive list. So again, number three, Mighty No. 9 playable and all female game with zero misogyny ties.
9658000	9664000	Number two, Phantasy Star Online 2 is a Wii U exclusive.
9664000	9670000	Dun, dun, dun. Even though it's already on PC.
9670000	9674000	Loki's rolling his eyes really far back in his head. What?
9674000	9676000	Whatever, I just don't think it's going to happen.
9676000	9683000	And the number one answer tonight, Valve Trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer.
9683000	9684000	That would be fantastic.
9684000	9689000	Number one and number two. What, what, what, what?
9689000	9692000	You listening, Bobby? I got number one and number two this year.
9692000	9696000	That would piss off so many people. It would be fantastic.
9696000	9701000	I think it would be hilarious and I would actually rather another Portal than another Half-Life, but that's me.
9701000	9703000	Because I actually liked Portal better than Half-Life.
9703000	9706000	If you guys don't believe me, it's not making it up, guys. It's right there. There it is.
9706000	9709000	I personally like Portal better than the rest of Half-Life.
9709000	9714000	It announced third sequels for all their other franchises except for Half-Life.
9714000	9718000	Everything else gets a third game. Fuck Half-Life.
9718000	9723000	I would have thought that President Cat 2 Prepare for Kittenfall would have topped the list for sure, to be fair, Loki.
9723000	9725000	It just, fourth place. It just missed it.
9725000	9726000	That's all right.
9726000	9727000	I was a little surprised there. All right.
9727000	9729000	Technically fifth because there was a tie for third.
9729000	9730000	Oh yeah.
9730000	9735000	If you to myself are signing myself up to putting listless in the video because god damn it, it's time consuming.
9735000	9736000	Sorry.
9736000	9737000	Oh god, this is the worst week for that too.
9737000	9738000	We have 15 answers.
9738000	9739000	Oh shit.
9739000	9740000	Have fun. Good luck.
9740000	9741000	All right.
9742000	9743000	Oh no.
9743000	9744000	Masochist much?
9744000	9747000	Maybe I'll just skip it this week. All right, there it is.
9747000	9751000	Let's do a couple more stories then we're going to open up the phone lines quickly.
9751000	9754000	We don't have a whole lot of time for calls because we're running a little long.
9754000	9756000	We're past 9 o'clock already so let's get to it. Loki.
9756000	9760000	All right, lots of apps are coming to the Xbox One and Xbox 360.
9760000	9763000	Some of the new stuff that's going to be happening.
9763000	9765000	Comedy Central is getting an app on Xbox One.
9765000	9770000	Crunchyroll is coming to Xbox One in several territories.
9770000	9775000	FX Now is that like an FX thing? That'd be pretty cool.
9775000	9784000	MTV, K-Drama, Max Dome, MLG, Movieplex, iHeartRadio, HBO Go, which is pretty big.
9784000	9786000	GoPro.
9789000	9792000	I know Twitter is one of them.
9792000	9798000	You'd think that they would have had it by now but Twitter is coming to Xbox One as well.
9798000	9800000	Tune in.
9800000	9801000	Sci-fi Now.
9801000	9802000	Sky Online.
9802000	9803000	Sky News.
9803000	9804000	Yeah.
9804000	9808000	FX Now should be live TV or on-demand TV for the FX network, right?
9808000	9810000	Like what Archer is on and what not?
9810000	9816000	I'm thinking that would be pretty cool because I do need to catch up on some Archer so that would be nice.
9816000	9819000	The only show I actually know that's on that network.
9819000	9822000	So yeah, lots of apps coming later this year.
9822000	9829000	And if you haven't been heard yet, the apps that did require the paywall, I believe that paywall is now gone.
9829000	9832000	So they are available now if you have Xbox Live Silver.
9832000	9836000	So you can watch Netflix without having to pay an extra fee.
9836000	9837000	Alright.
9837000	9845000	And last but not least tonight I have a story about a particular franchise of interest to many of you and that is the Metal Gear franchise.
9845000	9848000	Note that I'm not talking about Metal Gear Solid.
9848000	9851000	I'm talking old school Metal Gear.
9851000	9853000	Now this is pretty cool.
9853000	9858000	Shane may have joked earlier in the show that Konami is going to formally announce that they're killing off Silent Hill at E3.
9858000	9870000	But in real news, Konami actually gave the blessing to a team called the Outer Heaven team to do a full remake of Metal Gear.
9870000	9875000	The 1987 action adventure stealth game Metal Gear for release on Steam.
9875000	9880000	And they're saying it's going to be a full remake of the original game, new script, new models, the works.
9880000	9886000	The theme compositions will be revamped with orchestral arrangements and the Metal Gear Solid 2 style electronic beats.
9886000	9888000	This is from developer Ian Ratcliff.
9888000	9892000	This is really cool that Konami has kind of given this the blessing.
9892000	9895000	They do say it's going to be based off the MSX version of Metal Gear.
9895000	9897000	So for those of you guys...
9897000	9898000	You mean the good ones?
9898000	9899000	Yeah, the good one basically.
9899000	9905000	Well the NES one, you know what, I still have a lot of respect for it because that's what we kind of grew up on.
9905000	9906000	So anyway.
9906000	9910000	More information to come soon.
9910000	9917000	They are still looking for volunteers, including a cutscene animator, a cutscene artist in the style of Yoji Shinkawa or Ashley Wood.
9917000	9921000	Storyboard artist, sound effect artist, composer, and voice over talent.
9921000	9925000	So maybe I should audition to be the new voice of Snake. What do you guys think?
9925000	9929000	How well can you do MMMM Metal Gear?
9929000	9931000	MMMM Metal Gear!
9934000	9935000	Was that good?
9935000	9936000	Wow.
9936000	9938000	I don't know why I expected anything different from him.
9938000	9939000	Nailed it.
9940000	9941000	Nailed it.
9942000	9944000	I'll send him my tape right away.
9944000	9946000	Alright, there it is.
9946000	9948000	So good luck to those guys. Love it.
9948000	9952000	Alright, that is going to do it for the news tonight.
9952000	9953000	But now it's your turn.
9953000	9956000	1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.
9956000	9957000	Orange Lounge Radio.
9957000	9961000	If you'd like to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight.
9961000	9965000	Maybe your own E3, what you're looking forward to in the future.
9965000	9967000	Or whatever.
9967000	9968000	Whatever it is.
9968000	9970000	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype.
9970000	9972000	Orange Lounge Radio.
9972000	9973000	All one word.
9973000	9977000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, Rob Roberts is fabulous Snake.
9979000	9982000	I feel like there should be sparkles that come out when that's said.
9982000	9984000	Alright, oh we do have some calls coming in.
9984000	9986000	Oh no, the truck have started to move.
9986000	9988000	Oh no, the truck have started to move.
9988000	9989000	Oh no.
9989000	9992000	Oh no, the truck have started to move!
9992000	9993000	Gasp!
9993000	9994000	Gasp!
9997000	9999000	Let's get to the phones and take some calls.
9999000	10001000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10001000	10004000	Hey guys, it's Nemesis 47. How y'all doing today?
10004000	10007000	Nemesis 47. I haven't heard you in a while. How you doing?
10007000	10008000	I've been good. I've been good.
10008000	10011000	I've just been busy just moving out and stuff like that.
10011000	10016000	I've also been working on my new job too over at the local King Soopers and stuff.
10016000	10019000	I'm pretty sure that moving is punishment for shoplifting in some countries.
10019000	10022000	So I'm sorry to hear that. It's never a fun process.
10022000	10027000	Well that's okay. I just moved with a buddy of mine, so yeah.
10027000	10030000	That'll be fun. Well what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10030000	10037000	Nothing much. I just want to get my two cents about everything that's going on with E3 this week.
10037000	10044000	I'm actually gonna... I am hoping they also announce a new Hitman game.
10044000	10047000	Ah, a new Hitman game, possibly.
10047000	10054000	Because from what I've seen, some months ago that a picture that...
10054000	10057000	They're actually in the process of filming the new Hitman movie.
10057000	10062000	So a Hitman game is probably a shoo-in or something for E3.
10062000	10069000	And I also heard a rumor that tomorrow the new WW2K15 game is gonna be revealed.
10069000	10072000	Does EA have the license to that? Because that would make sense.
10072000	10074000	No, 2K15 if you take two.
10074000	10076000	Oh, 2K15. Sorry about that.
10076000	10083000	WW2K15. Yeah, that's from the people who make 2K sports and all that.
10083000	10085000	Well, yeah. It's coming out for sure.
10085000	10089000	Shows you how well I watch the sports titles. Sorry about that.
10089000	10091000	But you're looking forward to it, huh?
10091000	10097000	Oh yeah. The one thing I'm hoping is that it's actually more fresh and more...
10097000	10103000	I'm hoping it's a little bit more fresher than having the previous game where they pretty much borrowed everything
10103000	10107000	that they did for THQ and everything.
10107000	10113000	I see. I was gonna ask you what would hopefully be on your wish list of how would it be different this year.
10113000	10117000	Because, you know, a lot of these games get slammed for being roster updates and so forth, so...
10117000	10121000	Well, obviously they are gonna have roster updates.
10121000	10125000	What I'm hearing is there's rumors going on that Goldberg and Sting is gonna be in the game.
10126000	10132000	And the things I'm hoping is I'm hoping they actually make the weapon animations more realistic.
10132000	10137000	Like, instead of the chairs I'm actually disappearing or having three or four hits and they pretty much break
10137000	10144000	or have very unrealistic tables. Like, they actually slide all over the goddamn place.
10144000	10146000	All over the damn place.
10146000	10151000	And I'm hoping they pretty much update the weapon systems and everything like that.
10151000	10158000	Just pretty much make a better wrestling game experience and all that is all.
10158000	10162000	Dungeonbuster in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com talking about the new Hitman game saying
10162000	10166000	the new Hitman game is supposed to be more sandbox-y and fix the problems from the previous one.
10166000	10170000	I thought the last one was pretty sandbox-y from the looks of it.
10170000	10178000	I actually like the new Hitman game. I was actually fambling when I first played the game
10178000	10182000	and also I heard the old voice of 47 because originally they were gonna go with a different voice
10182000	10187000	but they decided to bring back the old 47 voice so I was happy with that.
10187000	10189000	And I actually love the game.
10189000	10194000	Yeah, even I watched it. It's not usually my type of thing but I watched a friend play it and it looked pretty cool.
10194000	10195000	So I was like, oh wow.
10195000	10196000	It is. It is.
10196000	10200000	It was all next gen at that time, although now we're in a whole other generation.
10200000	10203000	So it would look amazing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I'm sure.
10203000	10207000	Oh yeah, and let's see, what else was I gonna say?
10207000	10212000	Oh, did you guys see the new Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD remix trailer?
10212000	10218000	I did, if for nothing else than the last 20 seconds of basically nothing but subtitles saying
10218000	10220000	Kingdom Hearts 3, don't forget.
10220000	10223000	Like literally, what was it, three frames or something.
10223000	10228000	Like three still pictures that rotate super fast. You can't see it at all.
10228000	10230000	Just talk about a tease.
10230000	10235000	All I did was pretty much pause during the scenes.
10235000	10243000	They're pretty much scenes from Kingdom Hearts Triple D, the 3DS.
10243000	10250000	But we'll probably see more about Kingdom Hearts 3 and everything, so yeah.
10250000	10255000	I definitely think it's still a little early.
10255000	10258000	I don't think the game is gonna be playable on the show floor or anything like that.
10258000	10260000	I really don't think it's that far along.
10260000	10266000	But I would love to see a better trailer, like a new little tease would be great.
10266000	10268000	That and 15, but I don't know.
10268000	10271000	Square has come out and said don't expect to see either one at E3, so we'll see.
10271000	10274000	I'm gonna probably say Tokyo Game Show more than likely.
10274000	10279000	Yeah, that's a very good thought, is that these could be things that are being saved for Tokyo Game Show.
10279000	10283000	Because they kinda did say, without saying, they're holding onto it for another expo.
10283000	10286000	Tokyo Game Show would be the highly likely candidate for that.
10286000	10293000	And lastly, there's another big convention that's gonna happen this weekend, besides E3 obviously.
10293000	10294000	What's that?
10294000	10296000	Denver Comic Con.
10296000	10297000	Ah.
10297000	10301000	Over here in Denver. It's the fifth largest convention in the United States.
10301000	10306000	Which I have tickets for, which I am officially missing because it's next weekend.
10306000	10308000	I was gonna say, that's in your backyard and you're gonna have to visit.
10308000	10311000	You're going now, man! I want to meet ya!
10311000	10317000	I bought tickets in March or something like that earlier this year before E3.
10317000	10320000	Before the E3 plan at work had even really come up.
10320000	10325000	I hate to say it, but for me, E3 is trumping Denver Comic Con in a heartbeat.
10325000	10330000	Yeah, yeah, it's understandable. E3 is frickin' amazing.
10330000	10338000	I mean, how? I mean, for me, if I was invited to go between DCC and E3, I'd go with E3 too.
10338000	10341000	Because, come on. That's a big show.
10341000	10344000	Yeah, you're gonna have a lot of fun at Denver Comic Con, though. I mean, come on.
10344000	10350000	Oh, totally, man. Totally. We have, like, Peter Davison. We have Sylvester McCoy, the pimp and the seventh doctor.
10350000	10354000	Oh, you mean David Tennant's father-in-law.
10354000	10355000	Yes, yes.
10355000	10357000	And the guy with pigeon shit all over him.
10357000	10362000	Sorry, I love both of them, but I love making the parallels.
10363000	10370000	Originally, Karen Gellan Amy Pond was gonna be at the con this year, but she had to back out because of a movie commitment and stuff.
10370000	10375000	So, she's, they didn't mention, sorry about that, I tend to stutter a lot, guys.
10375000	10376000	That's okay.
10376000	10380000	They did mention that she might be coming next year, though.
10380000	10384000	Oh, that'd be cool. She owes you guys a make-up. And then that way, Jason can be there.
10384000	10387000	Unless he goes to E3 next year, which, you know, we'll see.
10387000	10393000	All right. Well, Nemesis, I enjoyed the call, enjoyed your predictions. Thanks so much for giving us a call, and have a lot of fun at the Denver Comic-Con.
10393000	10396000	And since we can't be there, say hey to everybody for us.
10396000	10399000	Okay. Okay, guys. I'm happy I'm at E3 this week, all right?
10399000	10402000	We will do. See you on E3.vognetwork.com.
10402000	10403000	All right, man. Big peace.
10403000	10404000	Later.
10404000	10410000	All right. I like hearing from callers who don't always hear from a lot, but I like the regulars, too, don't get me wrong.
10410000	10416000	But it's always nice to hear from a not-so-familiar tone, just to know that, oh, I'm still listening.
10416000	10420000	I've had my tickets on the table right in my front door.
10420000	10421000	You didn't try to give them to somebody?
10421000	10425000	Right inside of my front door. I, you know, I was thinking about that towards the end. I really should have.
10425000	10426000	Yeah.
10426000	10432000	But I was looking at them before this trip started, because I've been out here. I've been away from home for pretty much the entire month of May.
10432000	10437000	I was just looking at it, and I was like, damn, I could do it if I didn't have to drive all weekend and then some.
10437000	10441000	All right. Well, I don't even have to give out the number again, because it's lighting up. Let's go to the phones.
10441000	10443000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10443000	10446000	It's your local residential cosplay whore, Rama.
10446000	10449000	Rama, it just wouldn't be a show without you. What's on your mind, buddy?
10449000	10450000	Sailor Moon.
10450000	10452000	Oh, besides that.
10452000	10456000	So did you find me the little thing that I asked if you could find for me?
10456000	10459000	I could not find any in the dealer's room.
10459000	10463000	Ahhhh. No, Sanketsu.
10463000	10466000	Hey, don't upset her during OLR. What's up, buddy? What's on your mind?
10466000	10470000	I can't help it if I fail the side mission. What am I supposed to do?
10470000	10472000	Make one. Out of life fibers.
10472000	10473000	Do over.
10473000	10476000	And then he can talk to me. When I'm bored at work.
10476000	10478000	Well, what's on your mind, buddy?
10478000	10485000	Not too much. I kind of missed half the show because we were planning stuff out for our podcast this week and some other stuff.
10485000	10487000	Well, how dare you?
10487000	10488000	What?
10488000	10490000	How dare you? How very dare you? I'm just-
10490000	10495000	I'm sorry. People call me. I gotta take calls. Evidently, I'm an important person.
10495000	10502000	I was just gonna say I kind of felt sorry. I said this earlier in the show. I felt sorry for some of the VoG- I think I might have said this on Bobby's show.
10502000	10508000	I feel sorry for some of the VoG programming on tomorrow and Tuesday because gaming really is gonna dominate the conversation.
10508000	10511000	And I know Voice Geeks Network is really about all things geek.
10511000	10519000	But I was like, well, Rama might get out of it because he's a live show so he can kind of adjust to whatever's going on with E3 and all that.
10520000	10526000	That and I have a game filter set up for the chat so it's all anime all day every day so we're good.
10526000	10528000	There you go.
10530000	10537000	Few things. Went to Anime Nexus this past week. It was pretty fun. I met up with Critical Myth so there is a picture of us crossing paths.
10537000	10539000	Oh, that's amazing.
10540000	10550000	Let's see. I did not make it over to the gaming room because it's over in another hotel and it was too hot to walk across to the other side of the location.
10551000	10556000	But I did hear there was some pretty good gaming over there so we'll definitely uncover that.
10556000	10559000	But here's something that was some interesting things though.
10560000	10571000	Most popular cosplay there was from the game Danganronpa which is becoming the game which is actually putting life into the Vita because as we all know the Vita doesn't sell.
10573000	10581000	No, sadly. I'm curious to see what Sony kind of does with that if they do anything with that at E3. We'll find out in 24 hours.
10581000	10591000	Hopefully. And evidently it seems in my areas ever since the Luigi death stairs came about it's been kind of hard to find a Wii U.
10592000	10600000	Really? You know I think I was seeing some sales numbers today and it does look like Wii U outsold Xbox One for the past week.
10600000	10608000	But I mean again it still didn't outsell PlayStation 4 so it's not where it needs to be.
10609000	10620000	I don't expect that to happen but you know I just find all that pretty interesting and pretty cool because now I'm like you know I may just have to get myself a Wii U just for that.
10620000	10627000	And what's interesting is that as I'm running around as Dr. Luigi people are asking me for my death stair which was pretty cool.
10627000	10641000	I was gonna say you know now I don't want to sound like that guy Rama but you do cosplay as a black man as Luigi so you know people are wondering where's my angry black man Luigi?
10641000	10643000	You went there.
10643000	10648000	I live there. I bought a house there. Rama?
10648000	10650000	That's because I gave him permission so it's okay.
10650000	10651000	That's right.
10652000	10654000	And before I get out of here.
10654000	10663000	Wait wait you didn't answer my question. It was a serious question. What am I gonna get my angry Luigi? Are you gonna do an angry Luigi cosplay at some point or no?
10663000	10671000	It'll happen when I end up doing the mushroom doctor which is Luigi cross tenth doctor. I've been asked to do that too.
10671000	10672000	That'll be fun.
10672000	10673000	Green pinstripes?
10674000	10678000	Maybe. The suspenders are sitting on my floor.
10678000	10680000	I remember that dapper hat you had.
10680000	10682000	Alright you said one more thing.
10683000	10697000	I was taking pictures and I came across Death Stair Luigi and I'm posting the picture in the chat room and it's also on my Facebook page. Facebook.com slash I M D G Ron M S. You'll find it there.
10697000	10708000	And it's interesting that Luigi is giving my friend the death stair and the best part is that's my friend Mario. So as you can see Luigi is giving the death stair to Mario.
10708000	10718000	I have a really bad feeling that this angry Luigi meme is gonna get played out at cons real fast. You know I take back my question. You probably shouldn't do angry Luigi.
10718000	10731000	I know but the best part is it was a Waluigi and Wario with go karts running around playing riding dirty all over the convention area throwing stuff at each other. People ate it up.
10731000	10735000	Alright that's fun though. Looks like you guys had fun there at the con.
10735000	10742000	Alright well Rama best of luck with your show on Tuesday. I'm sorry I won't be here to hear it but that's what podcasts are for.
10742000	10745000	Alright take care buddy. We'll see you soon.
10745000	10746000	You too. Take care bro.
10746000	10747000	Alright bye.
10747000	10748000	Alright.
10748000	10755000	Squeeze in one more call if anybody wants to get in. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
10755000	10762000	I did see just a couple tweets come in here so I want to get to those. I read one of them earlier in the show but I saw a couple stories.
10762000	10767000	I'll also go ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories he wants to squeeze in here.
10767000	10775000	Yeah there's some funny stuff. Notch has released a game called Cliff Horse. It's a game about riding horses on cliffs.
10775000	10781000	It's kind of like playing Skyrim because the horses just kind of defy gravity and they ride on a cliff.
10781000	10789000	For anybody that doesn't get it from the outside if you know the meme and seen the image. Physics? I'm a horse bitch.
10790000	10798000	Just a couple tweets that were sent to us here. There was a correction to last week's show from Pika Uno.
10798000	10805000	I don't even remember why Downton Abbey came up on last week's show but it did and we said that it was on the BBC and Pika Uno corrected.
10805000	10806000	PBS you said.
10806000	10808000	It is on, well in overseas.
10808000	10810000	BBC. It was on, was it television 4?
10810000	10811000	It's on ITV.
10811000	10812000	ITV that was it.
10813000	10820000	Pika Uno issuing the correction there which I did retweet and say well sorry but we're kind of busy on Sunday nights when it usually airs.
10820000	10825000	Except for the fact that it airs Sunday morning.
10825000	10828000	Yeah I don't know when it airs over there.
10828000	10833000	But it has my spirit grandmother.
10833000	10834000	Maggie Smith.
10834000	10835000	Heck yeah.
10835000	10837000	It airs on PBS Sunday nights.
10837000	10838000	Yes.
10838000	10839000	Sassy.
10840000	10845000	Satcho and Hunter Matt tweeting us the story about Xbox One controllers are now supported on PC.
10845000	10850000	You must have missed that part of the show Satcho and Hunter Matt but yes you can now use those on PC.
10850000	10853000	And Act Deft sending us to an infamous meme.
10853000	10861000	Speaking of leaks and announcements before E3 here's a preview of Valve's surprise conference and its characters singing on stage in Tomodachi Life.
10861000	10863000	One can only dream.
10863000	10865000	Any other last minute stories Loki?
10866000	10869000	The rumor is that the Nintendo digital event is going to be 30 minutes long.
10869000	10871000	That's it?
10871000	10872000	Wow.
10872000	10874000	It's Nintendo isn't that all they need?
10874000	10878000	It's according to I guess the timetable that they have on Niko Video or whatever.
10878000	10883000	It says 1 to about 130 is the...
10883000	10885000	That could be a placeholder we don't really know.
10885000	10887000	That seems short but then again I mean...
10887000	10890000	And it says Smash Brothers Invitational 8 to 1030.
10890000	10898000	So I guess last year was pretty short too but they could also pull a stupid like...
10898000	10902000	Hey! Yeah here's our digital thing.
10902000	10904000	But we're gonna have 3 more during the week!
10904000	10907000	Well they could. They could.
10907000	10909000	But 30 minutes doesn't seem like enough.
10909000	10910000	Remember they had 3 last year?
10910000	10911000	That's right they did.
10911000	10916000	If they only have one in 30 minutes long that's not a good sign.
10916000	10917000	I think it's a little early though.
10917000	10920000	I mean this isn't an official source.
10920000	10924000	It's probably a placeholder on somebody's schedule just because they had to put something.
10924000	10926000	And that is for Tuesday?
10926000	10928000	Yeah.
10928000	10931000	8 o'clock in the evening for the Invitational.
10931000	10932000	Wow.
10932000	10934000	Well it's Japan time.
10934000	10935000	Alright.
10935000	10937000	I cannot do the type of translation right now.
10937000	10939000	Maybe it's Japanese specific stuff.
10939000	10941000	It's only like 30 minutes.
10941000	10942000	Maybe.
10942000	10943000	Alright I don't know.
10943000	10944000	It's a shot. It's a shot.
10944000	10945000	Alright that's it.
10945000	10947000	We're gonna close up the Skype line because ain't nobody else calling in.
10947000	10949000	So we are gonna wrap up because you know what?
10949000	10950000	I got an early day tomorrow.
10950000	10952000	And it's gonna be a big day for a lot of you guys.
10952000	10953000	You and me both!
10953000	10954000	Road trip buddies!
10954000	10955000	Yay!
10955000	10957000	We also have this cool game I just saw here.
10957000	10958000	What's that?
10958000	10960000	It's called Rollers of the Realm.
10960000	10962000	It's a pinball RPG.
10962000	10963000	Ooh fun!
10963000	10964000	Yeah.
10964000	10965000	I've gotta check that out.
10965000	10966000	Is that on Steam?
10966000	10967000	PS4, Vita, and PC.
10967000	10968000	Oh get out.
10968000	10969000	That sounds awesome.
10969000	10970000	This winter.
10970000	10971000	Nice.
10971000	10972000	It sounds like...
10972000	10973000	What was that game?
10973000	10975000	Kind of like a pinball quest type game.
10975000	10976000	Yeah.
10976000	10977000	Alright.
10977000	10978000	That is it.
10978000	10979000	We are on our way out of here.
10979000	10981000	We're gonna close up shop.
10981000	10984000	Have a great night everybody.
10984000	10986000	Let's thank you for your support first off.
10986000	10989000	Thank you very much for downloading our show and checking us out.
10989000	10992000	And supporting us every week as you always do.
10992000	10993000	555 episodes long.
10993000	10995000	That's 5s across the board.
10995000	11000000	We'll be back to do it again next week with episode number 556 after E3.
11000000	11004000	It's gonna be very interesting to see how we all react to the news.
11004000	11008000	And I want to know how you guys react to all the news going into E3.
11008000	11009000	But have a great show.
11009000	11011000	Those of you guys that are actually gonna be there in person,
11011000	11013000	I hope to see you around the show floor.
11013000	11015000	Those of you guys that are playing the home game and watching at home,
11015000	11017000	please participate with the site.
11017000	11019000	We're there to help you out.
11019000	11022000	So let's get the answers to your questions as best we can.
11022000	11024000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
11024000	11025000	Jason, I want to thank you as always for being here.
11025000	11026000	Of course.
11026000	11027000	Hope you had fun tonight.
11027000	11028000	Do you have a final thought for us?
11028000	11030000	I don't want to wake up tomorrow,
11030000	11035000	but I must because the week starts in pretty much about five hours.
11035000	11039000	You can sleep through like Stockton and Bakersfield,
11039000	11041000	the really unremarkable places.
11041000	11042000	While I'm driving, that sounds scary.
11042000	11043000	No, no, no, no.
11043000	11044000	Take the 99.
11044000	11045000	Sleep through Fresno.
11045000	11047000	Stop at the Bravo Cheese Farm.
11047000	11048000	Well, we don't really want to stop.
11048000	11050000	Yeah, tell that to the lactose intolerant one.
11050000	11051000	No, no, no, no, no.
11051000	11054000	You can find good low lactosey cheeses.
11054000	11056000	Stopping is probably more for the way back.
11056000	11060000	No, you have to stop by the Bravo Cheese Farm and bring me sage cheese.
11060000	11063000	You know they're building a Bravo farm on five as well.
11063000	11064000	No way.
11064000	11066000	In Kettleman City or whatever that is.
11066000	11068000	You know that's still not going to make me take the five and smell the cow shit.
11068000	11069000	All right.
11069000	11073000	Dar Sockers, since you have the mic, your final thought tonight?
11073000	11075000	I really didn't mean to take from Jason's time.
11075000	11079000	Just Bravo Cheese Farm.
11079000	11083000	Everyone look for the deer kitten commercial for Friskies on YouTube.
11083000	11084000	All right.
11084000	11085000	It's the cutest thing.
11085000	11092000	My final thought is OMG, busy week ahead, but I can't wait to do some networking and introduce more people to VOG.
11092000	11094000	And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?
11094000	11096000	Speaking of kittens, my son hung up.
11096000	11101000	He had a cat calendar because he was really excited about having a calendar and he had a cat calendar.
11101000	11102000	Then he didn't give a shit about the calendar.
11102000	11104000	He wanted the cat pictures all over his room.
11104000	11106000	So now his room is covered in cat pictures.
11106000	11107000	He's ready for the internet.
11107000	11109000	Your son's room is a meme.
11109000	11115000	And also, I would like to say that I finally finished my fucking calling script and I think it's all done.
11115000	11118000	And I had it working and I finished converting all the objects over.
11118000	11120000	So now I can start other things again.
11120000	11121000	Hooray.
11121000	11122000	Back to the game.
11122000	11123000	Back to the game.
11123000	11124000	All right, guys.
11124000	11126000	We're out of here because you know what?
11126000	11127000	I got to go pack.
