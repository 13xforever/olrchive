0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Since the last show, Amplitude was funded, but it's not all good news as Harmonix denounced a random layoff shortly following the campaign's end. In this final week before E3, Nintendo breathes new life into GameCube controllers. Get out your way, birds, and join us for the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio with this our 554th episode for June the 1st of 2014.
45000	59000	We're here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host back after a week off. We'll get into that in a little bit. Say hello once again to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
59000	60000	Hi.
60000	62000	How are you? DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?
62000	64000	I'm okay, or well.
64000	67000	You're well? Good. Did you have a good week off last week?
67000	68000	It was alright.
68000	70000	Yeah? Good Memorial Day weekend as a whole?
70000	71000	It was alright.
71000	73000	It was very restful.
73000	75000	There were too many people at my house on Monday.
75000	78000	Oh, did you guys have like a barbecue pinball-a-thon?
78000	79000	Yeah, I hid.
79000	84000	Aww. Did you least get Midna? Pick up Midna and run in the other room?
84000	99000	Middles and I hung out for a bit, but it reiterated my pleasure at my barrenness. I'm glad I don't have kids. I'm glad I will never have kids. And I'm glad that other people can take their kids and leave.
100000	105000	It's okay to love kids for other people's kids, or your own, whatever you're into.
105000	106000	I don't ever want one.
106000	107000	Yeah, that's fair.
107000	110000	So I have been spending the week in gratitude.
110000	116000	But there are mothers and fathers to pets out there, which I think you certainly fall in that category.
116000	128000	Midna doesn't talk back. She meows and begs for food. She doesn't run around knocking over my expensive Japanese dolls, nor does she walk around saying that things belong to her when they don't.
128000	134000	The worst thing she does is sometimes sheds on the bed and claws Dan's chair. That's it.
134000	141000	Speaking of pinball, I see Bobby in the chatroom, our old pal Bobby Blackwolf, over at live.vognetwork.com. Blackwolf says,
141000	146000	Jamie, I played a Metallica pinball table last week. It was euphoric.
146000	147000	I'm glad you like it.
147000	150000	I haven't played Metallica pinball. That sounds awesome.
150000	155000	It was pretty fun. I played it at California Extreme last year.
155000	156000	Good times.
156000	158000	It was really good. Very loud.
158000	161000	All right. Also say hello, everybody, to Techmaster Loki.
161000	162000	Hello.
162000	163000	How are you doing, Loki?
163000	164000	Fine.
164000	165000	Playing pinball lately?
165000	166000	No.
166000	167000	What have you been up to?
167000	168000	Programming.
168000	172000	We're having a conversation in the chatroom about the music in Watch Dogs.
172000	178000	And seriously, some perfect songs that were just missed out in licensing in the game.
178000	180000	Apparently it has really terrible licensed music.
181000	184000	But I said, hey, they should have totally licensed who let the dogs out.
184000	186000	Because that would have been appropriate for that.
186000	191000	And then that was followed up with, you know, Dungewell said, sorry, not even Rockwell, somebody's watching me.
191000	192000	I was just going to say somebody's watching me.
192000	199000	That would be awesome. But no, apparently, no, we don't have any humor that would contribute to the game.
199000	201000	Some of the songs might be a little bit more expensive, too.
201000	205000	I'm sure if the soundtrack on subpar, it was probably some cheap licenses. Who knows?
206000	211000	But if they can afford the license who let the dogs out for every single Disney movie that features a dog,
211000	219000	I'm pretty sure, you know, recent Disney movies that feature a dog, I'm pretty sure that they could, you know, do this.
219000	220000	Yeah.
220000	221000	All right.
221000	228000	Also say hello, folks in studio, joining us once again, filling up the fourth chair as he does for a few weeks at a time.
228000	230000	He leaves a few weeks at a time. He's back a few weeks at a time.
230000	232000	Say hello, everybody, to Jason.
232000	234000	Throw your wave buttons in the air.
234000	236000	Wave them round like you just don't care.
236000	239000	Thirteen years old, ladies and gentlemen.
239000	246000	Melee and the birth of the GameCube controller being significant happened thirteen years ago.
246000	251000	And we're going to probably get another five years at least out of them with the recent announcement.
251000	252000	Yeah.
252000	253000	Which we will cover later.
253000	258000	Of course, of course. So you've been breaking out the GameCube and getting down with some GameCube games lately?
258000	260000	I don't own a GameCube. I actually never did.
260000	261000	What?
261000	262000	I missed that one outright.
262000	263000	What?
263000	264000	I think I have an extra you can borrow.
264000	267000	I was going to say, I think we have two as well. You missed out.
267000	274000	Well, I didn't. I just didn't. I didn't play it at home. I just played it at other people's houses and whatnot.
274000	280000	I still to this day think Animal Crossing on GameCube was the best one because it had the free virtual console, essentially.
280000	284000	There's like twenty old school games tucked away in that game. That's a powerful little disc.
284000	285000	Also F-Zero.
285000	287000	Yes, F-Zero GX.
287000	290000	F-Zero GX just kind of stands on its own.
290000	291000	Yeah.
291000	292000	So flipping good.
292000	295000	You know, there's all these rumors as we're ramping up to E3 week.
295000	304000	There's all these rumors that, you know, GameCube games may become backwards compatible on the Wii U, at least the whole virtual console or whatever.
304000	308000	Anything you would want to check out if that should happen?
308000	313000	I don't know that there's anything that I...
313000	319000	There's nothing that I know I have missed out on and have not had an opportunity to play.
319000	333000	But it's still a Wii inside there. GameCubes. Like the pins in the 3DS, I think it was, the GameCube lockout is a technical band-aid and not a true compatibility issue.
333000	334000	Anything like that.
334000	338000	People have unlocked the ability to play GameCube in the Wii channel.
338000	340000	Yeah, that's true.
341000	350000	And I think there's some fud about, oh, the slot loader isn't geared for the smaller GameCube discs, which is technically true, maybe?
350000	354000	I think there's an email on this a little later on that we'll get into as well.
354000	356000	Well, then I'll shut my mouth for another hour and a half.
356000	359000	No, it's fine. A little teaser there before we get into the email segment.
359000	366000	But I was going to say, there was certainly a lot of GameCube games that could be kind of rediscovered again.
366000	376000	And I would think with the impending Smash Brothers game coming out, there's the old Smash Brothers from GameCube that many people still consider the best one that they've done so far.
376000	381000	I think a lot of people would be very thrilled to kind of play all over again, so to speak.
381000	384000	Especially if they somehow tweaked online into it.
384000	389000	Which, you know, I know we kind of go, LOL Nintendo and online.
389000	395000	But Mario Kart this week, and we'll get into this a little later, Mario Kart this week kind of showed like, alright, we can do this.
395000	397000	Let's do it.
397000	400000	Have classic games actually been changed when they've been brought into the Virtual Console?
400000	404000	Not a lot. And when it happens, it's really like weird and obscure.
404000	410000	One that comes to mind is the Genesis version of Street Fighter II, apparently had it on the Wii.
410000	415000	And it's because, and I didn't even realize this, I guess the Genesis Street Fighter II had code in it for the whole modem thing.
415000	418000	So they kind of leveraged that to work online.
419000	421000	I don't even know all the details since I never bought it.
421000	426000	But apparently, yes, some of them have been altered in that way.
426000	431000	And, you know, I know Nintendo did like the Dr. Luigi, which you can play online.
431000	434000	And kind of taken some of the old classics and buffed them up like that.
434000	441000	So it's just a matter of resources. How many resources is Nintendo willing to allocate to that to make it happen?
441000	443000	Interesting.
443000	447000	Because I haven't bought into the Wii U yet, there's just a lot of details that I just don't get firsthand.
447000	451000	And it's all, you know, I'm going to get one eventually.
451000	455000	Like I mentioned on a previous show, I'm going to step into new consoles eventually.
455000	461000	And just, my life has changed and money is different nowadays.
461000	465000	And especially when you're not even home for more than two months at a time.
465000	469000	Something to consider since we're talking about the whole Nintendo and online and all this.
469000	472000	You know, and we'll talk a little more about Mario Kart 8 in our gaming weeks.
472000	475000	At least I know I want to talk a lot about that.
475000	482000	But with Mario Kart 8 coming out, you know, it's an online game and online is a pretty big component.
482000	486000	Because once you've kind of unlocked everything and done the single player and unlocked everything you can there,
486000	491000	there's really not a lot left except to go online and race your friends and things like that, right?
491000	494000	It's kind of amazing if you think about it.
494000	500000	Almost every game that comes out that has an online component just craps out on day one.
500000	504000	Mario Kart 8 is working. It's still working. It worked all weekend. It's great.
504000	510000	Now I know some of you are going to say, oh, but the Club Nintendo Redemptions, that whole thing crapped out.
510000	517000	Even I, not being a Mario Kart player or Wii U or even I saw that the Club Nintendo was screwed up this weekend.
517000	521000	But to be fair, you know, you still have like what, 60 days to redeem.
521000	524000	If you have a long time to redeem those codes, it's fine. That'll resolve itself out.
524000	527000	And that's honestly not the most important thing.
527000	530000	I would think. I don't know. Maybe for some people it is.
530000	532000	I was able to redeem my free game just persistent.
532000	535000	I just kept trying and trying and trying and trying and eventually it worked.
535000	539000	But I would imagine if you bought Mario Kart 8 because you really wanted to play free Zelda,
539000	542000	then you would have just bought free, or you would have bought Zelda, right?
542000	550000	So I'm thinking, no, because if you buy a game that you, it's the, oh, we had this discussion a couple of weeks ago.
550000	557000	It was the Halo 3 argument. A lot more people bought Crackdown to try Halo.
557000	560000	Because Crackdown was a good game. It was an interesting game.
560000	566000	But the people that were devoutly interested in Halo got Crackdown for Halo.
566000	569000	Yes, I'm with you to a point, like I get that point.
569000	573000	And Mario Kart is a very good game if you're even remotely into racing games.
573000	579000	And they will, but people will buy a game that they personally are okay with to get a free game they really want.
579000	585000	But I would argue that Mario Kart 8 is easily better than any of those games they're giving away. Easily.
585000	589000	It's probably the second best game out on the Wii U right now.
589000	593000	Well, there's new, I mean, new Super Mario Brothers is bad.
593000	599000	No, not at all. Not at all. But Mario, again, Mario Kart 8 is the second best game out on the Wii U right now,
599000	602000	and the best Wii U game that is out right now is not one of the ones they're giving away.
602000	606000	And that's Super Mario 3D World. So...
606000	607000	It depends on what you're into.
607000	611000	Yeah, I guess so. But my point was, before we got on that tangent, my point was,
611000	616000	you know, for all practical purposes, where I feel it's the most important, the online functionality of the game,
616000	618000	it's working and it's working well.
618000	621000	It uses friend codes if you want to actually join us.
621000	622000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
622000	624000	I was hearing something.
624000	629000	The tournaments use codes, but that's one way to get into them.
629000	636000	You can also get into tournaments through, I think, like, you can have them be public, searchable, friends only, but the codes are...
636000	640000	Private, private rooms you need an identifier for.
640000	644000	You have to realize the term friend code gives a lot of people PTSD.
645000	649000	In all fairness, Nintendo's making steps forwards, not backwards.
649000	651000	Yeah, hold on.
651000	652000	With online.
652000	653000	Okay, yes.
653000	654000	With online.
654000	655000	Huge step forward.
655000	656000	With online.
656000	664000	And this could have been the perfect Mario Kart game, except for one really stupid oversight.
664000	666000	I have a feeling. Alright, what is it?
666000	669000	What the fuck were they thinking with Battle Mode?
669000	670000	Yeah, I knew it. I knew it.
670000	676000	Seriously, it's like, how fucking hard is it just to follow the pattern it's established in every single Mario Kart game?
676000	678000	Hey, let's try something different.
678000	680000	Nobody fucking wants different.
680000	683000	They want Battle Mode arenas, not Battle Mode.
683000	689000	I'm too fucking lazy to make a new track, so I'm just gonna make this old track into a Battle Mode.
689000	691000	It's stupid.
691000	698000	I have a feeling it came down to, and I'm not excusing it, because Battle Mode is a weak point in Mario Kart 8,
698000	705000	and it's part of the reason I'm not saying it's the best Wii U game, although it is a great Wii U game and an absolute reason to own a Wii U right now.
705000	711000	But, in all fairness, the Battle Mode is a step backwards compared to the previous games.
711000	713000	I wonder if it didn't come down to performance.
713000	721000	Not that I'm excusing that, but I noticed there were some other interesting decisions made in the game that seemed to come down to a performance issue,
721000	726000	where it had to run HD really smooth, really pushing that hardware.
726000	731000	And I wonder if, for some reason, the Battle Mode that we all want wasn't possible.
731000	733000	But then again, it might show up as DLC later. Who knows?
733000	738000	I just don't buy that. I think because those tracks are really small, I mean, if they want it...
738000	742000	I mean, look at how they had Battle Mode on the Nintendo 64.
742000	745000	I mean, those tracks were pretty simple, and there wasn't much going on.
745000	749000	They don't really have to make it too flashy and glitzy and stuff.
749000	751000	Just make it a fucking track that's fun to play.
752000	755000	Hell, you could take the old retro things and just kind of go with that.
755000	757000	The boxes with the lanes and all those kind of things.
757000	759000	Or just, hey, you want to do something really cool?
759000	763000	Like, have a Mobius strip-type arena or something like that.
763000	764000	I don't know.
764000	767000	Lots of comments from our chatroom on what Loki's saying here.
767000	770000	And Dark Tetsuya starting things off saying, oh, here comes Loki.
770000	774000	And yes, all these comments coming from our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com,
774000	780000	because we do tape Orange Long's Radio Live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,
780000	784000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
784000	791000	Tigerclaw saying, Mario Kart is the type of game that you can bring in people who never played a racing game in their life into the genre and have fun.
791000	794000	You don't have to be a pro to enjoy Mario Kart.
794000	802000	I agree. That's part of the reason why I like Mario Kart and Forza Horizon and some of the more arcade-y blur I thought was a hugely underrated title.
802000	806000	A lot of those arcade-y style races I think are a lot of fun.
806000	811000	Gene in chat says, I haven't played a battle mode since Nintendo 64, and that was for about 10 minutes.
811000	815000	Weiland says, how else will they justify Battle Arena DLC?
815000	818000	ActDef wonders, do people play battle mode extensively?
818000	825000	DarkTetsuya says, I'll give it to Loki on battle mode, but I don't really play the mode myself, so it's not something I'll miss.
825000	829000	And ActDef saying, most of the time I play Mario Kart with friends is races.
829000	832000	I used to play battle mode like crazy, so that's the thing.
832000	841000	I have to admit, when it came to, especially the Super Nintendo and N64 versions, battle mode was played way more than the races.
841000	846000	Yeah, the racing is fun, and that's fine. They have the racing built in there, but here's the thing.
846000	849000	Don't include it then if you're not going to put effort into it.
849000	853000	If it's just something you want to do, just omit it, then people will get pissed off.
853000	856000	But still, it's better than just half-assing it.
856000	866000	I still think what they've got is a little better than that, but I agree that it is a little bit missed that classic battle mode isn't there.
866000	871000	But for me, honestly, Loki, it's a small blemish on an otherwise great game.
871000	875000	Because when it comes down to it, those races are fantastic.
875000	878000	Yeah, I don't doubt that they are, but that's the problem.
879000	885000	They could have easily had it perfect, but they half-assed that part.
885000	889000	And that's what's really sad. I don't know if it's a timed thing or what.
889000	893000	We'll come back to Mario Kart 8 later, because I want to talk about this during my gaming week.
893000	896000	We'll talk about all the other games the folks here in the studio have been playing.
896000	904000	But we weren't here last week, and I do want to apologize, because usually I try to warn you guys in advance if we're going to not have a show.
904000	909000	I didn't do that a couple weeks ago. That's because the cancellation of last week's show was a little bit more sporadic.
909000	914000	I ended up taking a last-minute road trip for Memorial Day, and it was something very spur-of-the-moment.
914000	921000	And to be honest, I don't really regret it, because it was a great break, and I needed it, and I hope everybody got a great break last week.
921000	924000	And when you really kind of go back and look at it, three-day weekends...
924000	926000	Except Bobby. We love you for holding the fort.
926000	930000	Yes, we do. We do. But three-day weekends, and Bobby would probably agree with this.
930000	935000	Three-day weekends are usually our lowest participating times, because between Labor Day and Memorial Day...
935000	939000	And we probably won't have a show Labor Day weekend either, but that has more to do with Dragon Con.
939000	947000	But three-day weekends, people are either out of town, and then we have a lot of people that listen to the show on Monday at work.
947000	954000	Well, there was no Monday at work for many people last week, so I'm sure some of you were looking forward to it and missed it.
955000	963000	Honestly, I was looking into it. The last time we took a show off was when I went to BlizzCon in November.
963000	969000	So, one week, you guys. One week. Every once in a while is alright.
969000	973000	Game of Thrones does, what, ten episodes a year? Are you all obsessed?
973000	978000	I think it's okay that we take one week off, because trust me, guys, a lot goes into this show, not just what you hear.
978000	980000	So take a week off is nice.
980000	983000	But I hope my co-hosts and everybody else had a great Memorial Day weekend.
983000	987000	But we are back this week to talk about what's going on in gaming news.
987000	996000	Now, since we haven't had a week off in a while, we haven't gotten to do this segment in a while, but the news still goes, even when we don't have a show.
996000	1000000	So it's time to do last week's news set to Holik.
1000000	1002000	So let's do last week in gaming news.
1004000	1006000	Last week in gaming news.
1006000	1011000	Some more information on Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U, including the return of Ike to the game.
1011000	1020000	Also, a new GameCube-style controller ended up being announced for the system, which we'll get into a little more later.
1020000	1023000	Because I think last week it was more rumor, this week it became fact.
1023000	1028000	Not necessarily. The one that they're talking about is the one from PDP that works like a classic controller.
1028000	1031000	It plugs into the bottom of a Wii remote.
1031000	1035000	Well, that thing got blown out of the water this week. We'll get into more of that later.
1035000	1042000	Also, some news on Hyrule Warriors. Team Ninja is helping out with the game, and Japan is going to be getting the game on August 14th.
1042000	1048000	Some of the characters for Hyrule Warriors were displayed, and let's just say it's obvious that Team Ninja is having a part in the game.
1048000	1054000	There's a Nintendo patent out there that some folks speculate is Wii Music 2.
1054000	1059000	I don't know why, but that's apparently going to be a thing, so we'll see what happens.
1059000	1068000	Also, the Amplitude Kickstarter, it happened. It was funded last week. They made $844,000 plus.
1068000	1074000	This was thanks to support from Insomniac and other gaming companies. They announced some other artists in the game as well.
1074000	1078000	Also, Night Trap HD, a thing that might be in the works.
1078000	1085000	The Gauntlet game dated September 3rd, and the Oculus Rift coming to Chuck E. Cheese, apparently.
1085000	1092000	Yes, a virtual ticket grab redemption thing. Oculus Rift and Chuck E. Cheese coming together to bring that.
1092000	1098000	We were talking about that a little bit before the show. So we were saying it's Futurama coming to life. Was that you, Jason, saying it's Futurama's happening?
1098000	1105000	Yeah, there was a second or third season where they went to, I believe it was the moon. It may have been Mars.
1105000	1109000	But the cast of crew was walking through the arcade, and there was Steve Ball.
1109000	1111000	That's the very first episode. Or no, second episode.
1111000	1112000	Was it? Seriously?
1112000	1118000	It was the second episode. The very first delivery that they went was to the moon. He got all excited about it because he was going to go to the moon.
1118000	1119000	It was a theme park.
1119000	1125000	So they had skee-ball, they had virtual skee-ball, and virtual virtual skee-ball.
1125000	1127000	We're only one step away.
1127000	1133000	It's an interesting development for the Oculus technology. There's a part of me that's like,
1133000	1138000	but nothing compares to standing in that little tornado room and trying to grab all the money.
1138000	1142000	Usually it was like Monopoly money or tickets or whatever, and grabbing all that you can. That's a fun experience.
1142000	1148000	It seems like the Oculus would really kind of take away from that, but at the same time, because it is new technology,
1148000	1152000	not a lot of people have really got to explore yet, it does sound kind of neat in that regard.
1152000	1162000	Is the Oculus technology safe for kids, though? I know I'm probably going to get side-eye for suggesting that.
1163000	1169000	The reason why I ask that is that I know the 3DS contains all these warnings for kids.
1169000	1170000	So is Oculus okay?
1170000	1176000	Do you really want to have that kind of expensive technology at a place where kids have pizza smeared all over their face?
1176000	1180000	Can you imagine how clean that Rift thing is going to be?
1180000	1184000	Remember when they had the Beachhead 2000 machines at Golf Land and stuff like that,
1184000	1188000	where you could lower that thing under your head and the Sumo and all these weird...
1188000	1189000	I kind of think...
1189000	1190000	The Sumo, what was that?
1190000	1194000	That was the giant Pokeball you would sit in. I don't know why that came to mind, but it did.
1194000	1198000	But anyway, my thought is it might be like a Beachhead 2000 machine,
1198000	1202000	where it's more like you lower this big helmet onto your head that would have the Oculus technology.
1202000	1208000	It's not going to be like a loose thing. Come on, they'd lose that in an instant.
1208000	1210000	I'm pretty sure it's going to be part of a larger machine.
1210000	1214000	I just don't think it's going to be a big draw, the Chuck E. Cheese.
1214000	1220000	Honestly, the ticket machine thing is just kind of...
1220000	1224000	It is what it is. The little kids get excited about it.
1224000	1228000	How old are you really going to be to have a party at Chuck E. Cheese?
1228000	1230000	You're not going to be that old.
1230000	1236000	They don't even let adults in there by themselves. You have to be there for a birthday party.
1236000	1238000	You have to have a child as your chaperone.
1238000	1243000	Yeah, you have to have a chaperone child. That's a real thing.
1243000	1245000	That's how they do it at Fairytale Town.
1245000	1248000	Yeah, there's a lot of kid-oriented places that do that.
1248000	1251000	Which I understand there's creepers that they want to keep out,
1251000	1255000	but what about those of us that just want to act like a kid?
1255000	1257000	We used to love to go to Chuck E. Cheese in college.
1257000	1259000	So that's when I'll borrow Julian.
1259000	1261000	Let's put it this way.
1261000	1263000	Can we borrow one of your kids, Loki, to go to Chuck E. Cheese?
1263000	1265000	Josh likes going to Chuck E. Cheese.
1265000	1267000	Loki's like, fuck yeah, take him off my hands.
1267000	1271000	Here's the thing. The only thing that's good about Chuck E. Cheese is,
1271000	1275000	and I assume this is all of them, but they made it really simple.
1275000	1279000	Now everything is one token to play. Any arcade game is one token.
1279000	1280000	That's good.
1280000	1283000	It really sucks that they don't have any dancing games because that would be fucking...
1283000	1286000	I would be there all day. One token? Fuck yeah.
1286000	1288000	I'd be here for a long time.
1288000	1290000	You know what's really ironic about that?
1290000	1293000	The barcade out in Denver, the one-up. Same exact principle.
1295000	1297000	You know, I noticed it was interesting.
1297000	1299000	I was talking a lot about Scandia here in Sacramento the past couple of weeks
1299000	1303000	because they got all these music games and I suddenly took interest in going to Scandia.
1303000	1307000	And actually, like the 2DX machine, two tokens. Popping music, two tokens.
1307000	1311000	I was like, wow, this is really on the cheap compared to what I remember 10 years ago.
1312000	1316000	I wish they had those nickel arcades still. Remember when they used to have those?
1316000	1317000	Like Nickel City and stuff?
1317000	1321000	You know what's funny? Nickel Mania, one of those places that they used to have out in Roseville.
1321000	1324000	It's like a golf cart shopping store now, if it's even still there.
1324000	1328000	For all I know, they bulldozed it and built a freaking Walmart on top of it or something.
1328000	1334000	But this place called Nickel Mania had one of those machines that you got in and you grabbed as much Monopoly money as possible.
1334000	1337000	And I don't remember why. I guess they had a ticket counter or something.
1337000	1341000	But I also remember they had Mortal Kombat. We used to go there to play Mortal Kombat all the time.
1341000	1346000	Really terrible combination with the ticket grabber and Mortal Kombat inside there at the same time.
1347000	1349000	I applaud their creativity.
1349000	1352000	That was also the only place I ever got to play Time Killers.
1352000	1356000	Was that what it was? Where you had the buttons like head, limb limb limb limb.
1356000	1360000	And like you would keep hitting limb limb limb over and over and you'd like hack off the person's limb.
1360000	1362000	Is that what the game was called?
1362000	1363000	I don't know, it sounds about right.
1363000	1364000	It was like Time Killers or something like that.
1364000	1367000	Because all the characters were from different, like somebody in chat will know.
1367000	1371000	But yeah, I used to play that in Nickel Mania all the time.
1371000	1372000	Those Nickel arcades are awesome.
1372000	1374000	Don't they still have some of those in the Bay Area? I think they do.
1374000	1376000	They used to have them in the Bay Area.
1376000	1381000	We actually had one, the last one I remember was up in Old Zack actually.
1381000	1382000	They had one there.
1382000	1384000	And they had a pump it up machine there.
1384000	1385000	But that was about it.
1385000	1389000	And it was really lame because I went there right when they opened and it was just like,
1389000	1392000	and they just have a pump and that's it.
1393000	1397000	There's like a few games I'll play and it was just pump.
1397000	1399000	But that was the first time I played pump so that was pretty fun.
1400000	1401000	Good times, good times.
1401000	1406000	Alright, let's get into an Alan Alchemy confirming what I was thinking in chat.
1406000	1409000	Agreeing yes, that is Time Killers. Thank you.
1409000	1412000	I just remember there was a guy in it that kind of looked like he was a character from Golden Axe.
1412000	1414000	Like the little guy that actually had the Golden Axe.
1414000	1418000	Like there was a guy like him in it and you'd like lob off people's arms and stuff.
1418000	1419000	It was gross but it was fun.
1419000	1423000	It was all cartoony so it wasn't like real life like Mortal Kombat was.
1423000	1428000	So what you're saying is Thrill Kill got reclaimed into an arcade cabinet and was completely under the radar.
1428000	1430000	And since it was a cartoon it was okay.
1431000	1436000	You know I think we should, since we're talking about fighting games,
1436000	1442000	we should commission the folks behind Dominique Pomplamoose to do a new Clay Fighters game.
1444000	1448000	And honestly, and I gotta be honest here, I have no expectations for characters.
1448000	1453000	So if you want to do like Blob of Clay 1 and Blob of Clay 2, I'm totally fine with that.
1453000	1455000	Well let's call Sega up and see what he thinks.
1455000	1456000	Exactly.
1456000	1459000	I know he didn't program it but he's got connections, why not?
1460000	1463000	He has a claim. I don't know who owns the rights to that game anymore so who knows.
1463000	1465000	Clay Fighters? Who did make that game?
1465000	1466000	The claim did it.
1466000	1467000	Yeah, claim.
1467000	1468000	So I don't know who has it now.
1468000	1473000	Somebody probably bought it on auction for nickels and dimes so I don't know, maybe.
1473000	1476000	Change that they had from a nickel arcade.
1476000	1478000	Who knows, who knows.
1478000	1483000	Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
1483000	1484000	One more note.
1484000	1485000	Oh yeah.
1485000	1493000	In July 2010, WeGo Interactive in Seoul, Korea purchased all IP related with...
1493000	1495000	Oh actually no, that's not everything.
1496000	1501000	Throwback Entertainment in Canada. Seems like a likely candidate to own Clay Fighter anymore.
1501000	1509000	Well I thought for Clay Fighters or like all of the claim stuff, because I know that Warner has a lot of the claim stuff.
1509000	1510000	Most but not all.
1510000	1512000	They have Mortal Combat and Gauntlet.
1512000	1514000	But that's midway. Nevermind.
1514000	1516000	Get my companies mixed up again.
1517000	1519000	Didn't a claim just publish it or...
1519000	1521000	Oh it was an interplay, that's right.
1521000	1522000	Yeah.
1522000	1523000	Yeah it was.
1523000	1526000	Whatever, developers, publishers, I can't remember.
1526000	1529000	I mean that shit was so fucking old. At least they got half of it right.
1529000	1531000	And you never know which one of them really owned it either.
1531000	1532000	Yeah.
1532000	1537000	Because sometimes the developers have to find the publishers, sometimes the publishers contract developer, you know it just depends.
1538000	1543000	These were screens that I just kind of glazed over while I was waiting for the theme song to kick in.
1546000	1548000	Do you have fond memories of Clay Fighters?
1548000	1552000	I know you were a fighting game girl. Did you ever play Clay Fighters?
1552000	1553000	Yeah, I did.
1553000	1555000	I would always play...
1557000	1558000	Bad Mr. Frosty.
1558000	1559000	Yes.
1559000	1561000	And Helga were my two.
1562000	1567000	I always liked Bad Mr. Frosty just because I liked hearing you say, Bad Mr. Frosty.
1567000	1568000	Like the blob.
1568000	1570000	You've been a very bad Mr. Frosty.
1570000	1572000	Alright this might be it guys.
1572000	1576000	It is live radio so I have to do live YouTubes but...
1582000	1583000	It was Ocean huh?
1585000	1589000	This also could be a Europe art piece of art we're seeing here.
1589000	1591000	That says the right music.
1593000	1596000	I was going to say I don't remember vocals but then again I also don't remember music in the game at all.
1596000	1597000	I remember the vocals.
1597000	1600000	That's what I want to see. I want to see the treatment that...
1600000	1603000	The Super Nintendo version had the vocals in it. That's part of what made it so awesome.
1603000	1607000	Like that Killer Instinct had like you know like I think in Killer Instinct it was just this
1607000	1609000	Yeah, yeah, woo hoo hoo.
1609000	1616000	You know an orchids theme but you know it's still it was still like something you didn't hear on Super Nintendo at the time.
1616000	1619000	Graham Norgate re-released that soundtrack on Bandcamp.
1619000	1620000	Oh yeah?
1620000	1624000	Yeah and has like slightly extended versions and a couple remixes that kind of stuff.
1624000	1630000	Grahamnorgate.bandcamp.com that and Timesplitters and I don't remember the other ones.
1630000	1632000	There's a lot of really good stuff on his page.
1632000	1638000	Alright well we could reminisce about fighting games all night and we just might but we're going to start with our gaming week.
1638000	1640000	StarSagra, how was your gaming week?
1640000	1645000	It's been kind of uneventful just because it's been kind of a weird week for me.
1645000	1650000	I've had a lot going on. I have sadly not gotten a chance to play any more Bravely Default.
1650000	1654000	I did play more Animal Crossing because it's easy to do during lunch.
1654000	1662000	I played some Final Fantasy 14 and finally got to go on a treasure hunt that I could contribute to.
1662000	1671000	Instead of just tagging along and getting you know maybe casting a spell here or there and then maybe getting a little bit of XP out of it.
1671000	1679000	But yeah. So I still though need someone to run me through whatever that one that I can never remember the name of but I call it the double D's.
1679000	1680000	Dazmiel Darkholme.
1680000	1689000	Yeah. I still need someone to run me through that one because I'm trying to pull the same thing I did with my WoW character.
1689000	1696000	And that's you know not pug a damn thing until I'm ready to start pugging things after I've already hit endgame.
1696000	1697000	Okay.
1697000	1701000	I didn't pug anything until I tried to earn a pug.
1701000	1706000	The nice thing is in 14 it's really and you know WoW really kind of fixed itself too to be fair.
1706000	1711000	A lot of MMOs are kind of going this direction where yes they're massively multiplayer online games.
1711000	1717000	But you know some people do kind of want to do their own thing and then have the chat room with swords on the side which is a perfectly acceptable play style.
1717000	1723000	So the nice thing about 14 is that yeah I mean you can group up to do those things and you know it sounds like you want to touch each thing once.
1724000	1728000	But you can get through a lot of it just by doing leaves and you know at least leveling.
1728000	1732000	Now yeah you're not going to get through the main story unless you do some of the group up content.
1732000	1736000	But at least you can do that once in a while.
1736000	1742000	I've got about maybe a fifth of my current level to go and then I can start doing story quests again.
1742000	1745000	Because I actually really like the story in the game.
1745000	1747000	It gets really good at the end too.
1747000	1752000	And I'm almost at 46 which is where my next story bit is.
1752000	1758000	You get into the really good stuff. The only problem is you start getting these big level gaps where it's like now you can't do anything until 48.
1758000	1760000	Dear game bite my ass.
1760000	1761000	Yeah that part's going to suck.
1761000	1762000	Sincerely me.
1762000	1763000	But the story's great.
1763000	1765000	PS give me a taco.
1765000	1769000	No I had tacos last week by the way.
1769000	1770000	Congrats.
1770000	1771000	They were amazing.
1772000	1775000	And I did though and we will be touching on this later.
1775000	1778000	I did buy the RPG Humble Bundle.
1778000	1785000	Because I had been looking for a way to do RPG style comics.
1785000	1787000	You know like RPG text.
1787000	1793000	And I think instead of going the flash route so that they are playable on an iOS device.
1793000	1796000	Is I'm going to program them into RPG Maker.
1796000	1798000	And then record them.
1798000	1799000	Nice.
1800000	1802000	So that they are just teeny movies.
1802000	1804000	That's a neat use of it.
1804000	1808000	Because I didn't really think about oh you can do other things than just make games necessarily.
1808000	1811000	Yeah but I have ideas for something.
1813000	1816000	It's right now kind of in the idea phase.
1816000	1818000	So hopefully I'll have time for it.
1818000	1820000	At least you've got your canvas now.
1820000	1822000	At least I have my canvas exactly.
1822000	1823000	There you go. Awesome.
1823000	1826000	Alright well let's move on over to Loki.
1826000	1827000	Who is speaking of canvas.
1827000	1829000	I think he's been busy working on his new games.
1829000	1831000	I don't know if you've played anything else but what's up Loki?
1831000	1833000	Yeah I did play one thing.
1833000	1835000	I played No Brakes Valet last night.
1835000	1837000	Because I bought that for my Android.
1837000	1839000	Just because I was trying to show.
1839000	1842000	Josh was looking at.
1842000	1845000	There was like some cars or something in this book we were looking at.
1845000	1848000	And I'm like yeah it reminds me of this game like No Brakes Valet.
1848000	1849000	I'm all you totally love it.
1849000	1850000	It's cars crashing into each other.
1850000	1851000	So I'm like okay watch this.
1851000	1853000	And so I downloaded it.
1853000	1855000	Well first off I was surprised that they had it for Android.
1855000	1858000	And they have it and it's actually way better than the Wii U version.
1858000	1861000	Although I don't know if they updated it with the Wii U version.
1861000	1866000	But it's got more tracks and different cars.
1866000	1867000	And it's a lot fancier.
1867000	1869000	But still fun and a good time waste.
1869000	1870000	So I played that.
1870000	1872000	But that was pretty much all I played this week.
1872000	1874000	I'm still working on game stuff.
1874000	1879000	Because I've been trying to optimize some of my models in the game.
1879000	1883000	And I tried it one way and it didn't work like I wanted it to.
1883000	1884000	So I'm trying it another way now.
1884000	1887000	And hopefully that one will work.
1887000	1892000	Although I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to do it.
1892000	1895000	Because it gets complicated with rotations and stuff.
1895000	1898000	Anyways so I'm trying to get past all that stuff.
1898000	1901000	So I can get to actually making some models.
1901000	1902000	Because that will be fun.
1902000	1905000	And that was pretty much it.
1905000	1910000	I got a copy of Watch Dogs but I haven't played it yet.
1910000	1916000	So they gave me one for doing something at work.
1916000	1917000	Quickly.
1917000	1920000	He's like I need a favor for you if you do this I'll give you a Watch Dog.
1920000	1921000	I'm like okay cool.
1921000	1924000	So I haven't got a chance to play it yet.
1924000	1925000	But it looks fun.
1925000	1928000	I'm not sure if I want to start it.
1928000	1932000	Because I only have so much free time.
1933000	1936000	I kind of want to focus on programming stuff and not playing games right now.
1936000	1938000	We'll see.
1939000	1940000	Alright.
1941000	1942000	Jason why don't you go next.
1942000	1943000	How was your gaming week?
1943000	1945000	It was actually pretty interesting.
1945000	1948000	My office now also has a Wii U.
1948000	1951000	They got it principally for Mario Kart.
1951000	1955000	But at the same time for some reason it didn't come in on Friday.
1955000	1958000	So I suppose I'll be playing it this coming week instead.
1958000	1963000	But there was New Super Mario Brothers Wii U and Super Mario 3D World.
1963000	1968000	So I actually got to sit down and I played the entire first world of that game.
1968000	1971000	And then more Titanfall as well.
1971000	1974000	And I think that's pretty much it at a high level.
1974000	1975000	But there was something kind of funny.
1975000	1980000	A coworker had just finished setting up, playing the Wii U, updating and all that kind of stuff.
1980000	1983000	And he was playing New Super Mario Brothers U.
1983000	1985000	And I was playing Titanfall.
1985000	1987000	And I just kind of looked over at the other TV.
1987000	1997000	And the Wii U's graphics were rich, vibrant, colorful, primary and just fun.
1997000	2003000	And then I turned back to Titanfall and it's dark, mechanic, gritty.
2003000	2007000	It was, you know, there was of course a granularity argument.
2007000	2011000	Because I was playing a first person shooter and comparing it to a 2D platformer.
2011000	2012000	2D side-scrolling game.
2012000	2017000	But it was just like, we all know this kind of thing.
2017000	2022000	But it just really smacked me because the two TVs are side by side right there.
2022000	2024000	And I just kind of take even a second to look over.
2024000	2027000	It's like, that's really warm and inviting.
2027000	2029000	Well I guess I have to go shoot this guy over here.
2029000	2035000	Yeah, it was just an odd comparison because I don't usually see those situations of things being side by side like that.
2035000	2040000	As invariably a lot of you have seen me posting about on Twitter.
2040000	2044000	I have like 30 clips from Titanfall that are relatively interesting to me.
2044000	2046000	And I really want to hold on to them.
2046000	2051000	But going through and uploading them one by one is a pain in the ass.
2051000	2059000	And it's hilarious to me because I snarked about why when the PS4, the most recent console update happened.
2059000	2065000	I said, why would you want to copy your footage off to a USB drive when you have a capable editor on the PS4?
2065000	2068000	Well, now I want to be able to copy my footage off the Xbox One.
2068000	2075000	And I don't think there's a way to do that unless I manually pick a clip, don't do anything to it.
2075000	2079000	But I have to name it, send it to my OneDrive and just, oh God.
2079000	2083000	Yeah, I very much want to extract my videos off of that.
2083000	2085000	But I don't think I'm going to be able to. And it's very unfortunate.
2085000	2088000	I wonder if that's something they'll end up patching in.
2088000	2092000	Just because especially when, you know, I talked a few weeks ago about PlayStation 4 share factory.
2092000	2097000	And how, you know, for a free download, it's a pretty rad little thing.
2097000	2101000	And you can just yoink things right over to your USB drive.
2101000	2105000	And it made me realize you could take any of your videos and put them on USB drive very easy.
2105000	2110000	And upload studio is great. It is powerful, but it's fucking slow.
2110000	2117000	And I want to just take what I have and be able to, I should try plugging in a mouse and keyboard to the one.
2117000	2120000	It's not going to change anything because like the transition from screen to screen is slow.
2120000	2124000	And because I have to go one clip at a time to preserve each individual clip.
2124000	2128000	But sometimes you want to edit them your way. You don't necessarily want to edit it, you know, Microsoft's way.
2128000	2129000	Absolutely.
2129000	2133000	You know, when I was, you know, again, I have to relate things to share factory because I don't have a one.
2133000	2137000	I have a PlayStation 4, but I know a share factory.
2137000	2143000	One of my things I said might be a drawback is that there are only like four or five templates in the thing.
2143000	2154000	So you're going to see the same damn thing over and over unless game companies or Sony starts releasing DLC either free or small premium expansions to it.
2154000	2161000	So I could see where there's a desire for people to want to just give me the files and I'll do it on Premiere my way or I'll do it on the thing my way.
2161000	2171000	You know, hopefully, you know, as gaming on YouTube and Twitch and all that gets even bigger and bigger, we'll probably see easier ways to do that.
2171000	2181000	There is actually one last thing I've been playing through more and more of Rusty's Real Deal Baseball, which is for a, you know, for an initially free game.
2181000	2186000	But the fact that you can get all the content for about nine dollars.
2186000	2190000	No, probably more like 12 because they're all they range.
2190000	2193000	If you if you do it right, everything's just under two dollars.
2194000	2208000	But for a 15 dollar game, they do whoever like specifically developed that game is a genius because they are taking every single fundamental of baseball and drilling into it.
2208000	2213000	So low level, like so deep into just the specific mechanics of it.
2213000	2216000	And it's it's damn near like rote memorization.
2216000	2218000	But it's really strangely fun.
2218000	2220000	I only have like three of them so far.
2220000	2225000	Umpire Simulator, swinging practice, catching practice.
2225000	2227000	I'm going to get Fielding next.
2227000	2229000	It's really massive amounts of fun.
2229000	2231000	It is surprisingly fun.
2231000	2233000	All right. Nice.
2233000	2235000	All right. Is that it for game week?
2235000	2236000	I think so.
2236000	2237000	All right. Let's talk about my gaming week.
2237000	2239000	I actually have had my hands on a few games this week.
2239000	2245000	The first one I want to talk about, which I'm going to full disclosure possible conflict of interest here.
2245000	2248000	I do a show called Hoard House with my buddy.
2248000	2250000	What? Why can you figure me?
2250000	2256000	OK, I do I do a show called Hoard House with my buddy Ecstifer and his partner is a designer on this game.
2256000	2259000	So but they've been telling me I've got to play this for forever.
2259000	2262000	So finally this week I played Rocksmith 2014.
2262000	2266000	So I'm not really going to review the game, but I'm just going to say I have been playing it.
2266000	2271000	And I was pretty impressed at the I don't know the first goddamn thing about playing the guitar.
2271000	2272000	Right.
2272000	2282000	But the neat thing about Rocksmith 2014 is that it made it look more like rock band, where instead of maybe pressing buttons, it was.
2282000	2286000	Here is a picture of the entire guitar.
2286000	2290000	What do they call the neck or the entire length of the guitar, the neck, the frets.
2290000	2294000	Then then I think it's the neck and the frets are the individual sections.
2294000	2300000	OK, so like it might zoom in and show you like three frets and then start to zoom out if you have to go to a different one.
2300000	2305000	And you kind of learn that the dots are sort of placement on the guitar, like because, you know, it's it's a real guitar.
2305000	2311000	And yeah, like it I found that I was able to play something like Foo Fighters Everlong.
2311000	2314000	Now, I wasn't able to play the whole thing like it's a real guitar.
2314000	2320000	But when you first start, it's like, OK, you'll play like one note here, one note here, one note here.
2320000	2323000	And then the game kind of learns. All right. You did pretty good on that.
2323000	2326000	In fact, you've probably mastered about eight percent of the song.
2326000	2329000	So the next time you play it, we're going to balance it for you.
2329000	2333000	And it adds a few more notes in. So you learn to play a little more and then a little more.
2333000	2335000	You know, so that's kind of the approach in Rocksmith.
2335000	2342000	So I was really surprised that it actually does kind of work because I was a little bit like a little bit apprehensive.
2342000	2350000	Like, is Rocksmith really going to be able to kind of like teach me real guitar without these boring lessons that I sit through and all that?
2350000	2352000	But they definitely have developed a way to do it.
2352000	2358000	So, you know, and whether you want to believe me or not, because of what I just told you, that's fine.
2358000	2361000	But I just would say I was I was pretty impressed with it.
2361000	2367000	So if you have an interest in learning how to play the real guitar, this definitely seems to be a way to do it if you're a gamer.
2367000	2373000	My only my only thing was that and I'm going to be on the song list.
2373000	2378000	There was a lot of stuff in there I didn't recognize, but I also don't listen to a lot of rock music.
2379000	2382000	I'm sure if you guys listen to more of that, you'd see more of that in there.
2382000	2384000	But I wouldn't have to fix that.
2384000	2386000	I know, right? It's just weird. It's just kind of what I do.
2386000	2390000	But most stuff I listen to tends to be more like synth.
2390000	2395000	In fact, if they had a Rocksmith for like piano or keyboard, I would be all over that.
2395000	2399000	I'll be all over that. So I'm kind of kind of secretly hoping that's where they go next with it.
2399000	2404000	But anyway, with with Rocksmith or whatever, I didn't know like a whole lot of songs.
2404000	2409000	But when I went into the shop, the DLC, I was like, oh shit, Smashing Pumpkins.
2409000	2412000	I know that. Oh shit. Garbage. I know that. Oh shit. Maroon 5.
2412000	2415000	Like there was all these songs in the store I knew.
2415000	2418000	I was like, oh, well, I got to spend all that money if I want to get it.
2418000	2423000	But there you go. So I liked I liked Rocksmith.
2424000	2432000	Other games I played this week. I played Zelda The Wind Waker on HD on the Wii U
2432000	2434000	because that was the free game I got with Mario Kart 8.
2434000	2436000	I did not play a lot of this on the GameCube, to be honest.
2436000	2440000	I was living with Loki at the time that game came out. I remember.
2440000	2444000	And I watched Loki play it. And so I never really got hands on it myself.
2444000	2445000	I just watched Loki play some of it.
2445000	2449000	I have a copy somewhere. I think it's my sister's storage.
2449000	2452000	Because I asked her, I'm like, I want my GameCube back. Because I want to play that.
2452000	2455000	And then she's like, it's in storage. I'm like...
2457000	2461000	All these years later. Yeah. But when it first came out, I seem to remember watching you play it.
2461000	2466000	And I was always a little put off by like, oh, it's like there's no world.
2466000	2470000	It's all these little islands. And it's just all this freaking water to get everywhere.
2470000	2475000	But I don't know. Revisiting it on the Wii U, I'm like super into it.
2475000	2479000	I don't know why. I can't really put my finger on it.
2479000	2482000	But I'm just like, it's something that the game does look really good.
2482000	2489000	Because, you know, even though the Wii U isn't necessarily the same oomph as the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One, excuse me,
2489000	2493000	it can do the cartoony looks very, very, very well.
2493000	2496000	Which obviously Wind Waker's style is all in that.
2496000	2501000	And it is really nice having that item screen on your gamepad so you don't have to keep flipping back and forth all the time.
2501000	2505000	Same thing with the maps and all that. So even that integration alone is worth it.
2505000	2506000	The whole...
2506000	2513000	I'm not saying I would be totally down for a toon shaded Zelda game that's like Link to the Past or something.
2514000	2522000	That would be amazing if they did a new game like that where it's just Hyrule with all the exploration and stuff in there.
2522000	2524000	That would be awesome.
2524000	2530000	Also, I'm looking in chat with some other comments here. Sorry, there's some comments on Rocksmith I want to go back to real quick.
2530000	2536000	Dark Tetsuya says, maybe they could call it Rock Synth? Talking about the keyboard game. That would be amazing.
2536000	2540000	Akuma JP says, Skye, was it fun enough to keep you playing Rocksmith?
2540000	2544000	Yes, I want to go back and play more, actually. If I can put down some of these other games.
2544000	2546000	Did you play the arcade stuff?
2546000	2551000	No, I didn't. I only played the learning the songs. There's still stuff in the game I haven't even looked at yet.
2551000	2555000	That's another reason why I didn't really want to review it. I'm just really giving you impressions.
2555000	2559000	Like these are my thoughts. My stream of consciousness thoughts of the game as I usually do.
2559000	2563000	So yeah, Wind Waker, I'm having a lot of fun revisiting it.
2563000	2566000	The Miiverse integration stuff is a little silly, in my opinion.
2566000	2571000	You can take these little selfies and attach them to Miiverse notes and they show up in other people's games.
2571000	2575000	If you set your games so that you can get the little messages in a bottle.
2575000	2579000	I mean, I'm not knocking on it. It's cute.
2579000	2585000	But it's definitely one small little dip in the grander scheme of things.
2585000	2589000	It's still a fun Zelda game that I'm having fun exploring all over again.
2589000	2593000	But let's be real. This week has been all about Mario Kart 8.
2593000	2595000	That's all anybody's talking about this weekend, it seems.
2595000	2598000	It's interesting because Watch Dogs just came out on Tuesday.
2598000	2603000	And if my Twitter feeds any indication, everybody already forgot and is playing Mario Kart 8.
2603000	2606000	No offense to you Watch Dogs fans out there, which I'm sure there are many.
2606000	2610000	But it really seems like Mario Kart 8 has really taken over the conversation the past couple days.
2610000	2613000	And that's probably a really good thing for Nintendo.
2613000	2617000	Because I can't remember the last time the Wii U has been dominating the conversation since it launched.
2617000	2623000	Not even Mario 3D World over the holiday really got that same level of conversation.
2623000	2626000	Well, there's been a lot of conversations, but none of it's been positive.
2626000	2630000	Fair enough. But you know what I mean. The type of buzz Nintendo wants.
2630000	2633000	So, yes, Mario Kart 8 is out.
2633000	2638000	And let me talk about the good, and I'll talk about the not so good.
2638000	2642000	I did mention earlier, I believe this is the second best game that the Wii U has at this time.
2642000	2645000	It's that good. The first being Mario 3D World.
2645000	2650000	I don't think it's as good as that, but I think it's still really, really, really, really damn good.
2650000	2652000	Especially for you fans of Mario Kart.
2652000	2657000	I think it's probably the strongest Mario Kart game in quite a while.
2657000	2658000	Quite a while.
2658000	2661000	Unless you're a huge fan of Battle Mode like Loki.
2661000	2663000	And I will say that is definitely one of the minuses.
2663000	2666000	Is that Battle Mode, it isn't really what you remember.
2666000	2669000	Instead, it's let's go opposite directions.
2669000	2672000	Because you know you're going to unlock all the courses backwards.
2672000	2674000	Because that happens in Mario Kart games.
2674000	2679000	So it's let's race on the course in both directions.
2679000	2681000	And when we pass each other, we'll kill each other.
2681000	2683000	It's kind of, so it's yeah.
2683000	2684000	Anyway.
2686000	2689000	Other things though I want to talk about Mario Kart 8.
2689000	2690000	The good.
2690000	2692000	Track design is great.
2692000	2694000	Some of the courses, gorgeous to look at.
2694000	2698000	The game looks so good on the Wii U.
2698000	2701000	You know, again it goes for that cartoony look.
2701000	2704000	And I was playing the game and even Shane commented and I had to agree.
2704000	2708000	He's watching me play and he goes, why did Mario 3D World look this good?
2708000	2710000	Why didn't they use some of these textures in Mario 3D World?
2710000	2713000	And I kind of had to say like, yeah that's a good point.
2713000	2718000	I don't know why some of the other Wii U games we see don't look quite as good as Mario Kart.
2718000	2720000	But it looks great.
2720000	2721000	It's gorgeous.
2721000	2723000	Like some of the stages are pretty amazing too.
2723000	2725000	Like there's this twisted mansion.
2725000	2727000	Like which is basically like the boo house that you go through.
2727000	2731000	And depending on if you go left or right, you'll either be on the ceiling or on the floor.
2731000	2732000	And you kind of race.
2732000	2735000	So you might be like literally have people above you as you're racing.
2735000	2737000	And you know all those shortcuts.
2737000	2740000	I think one of the most impressive courses in the game is Bowser's Castle.
2740000	2743000	Because there's this room where you go by a giant Bowser.
2743000	2745000	And he punches the sides of the track.
2745000	2747000	So he'll punch the left side.
2747000	2748000	Then he'll punch the right side.
2748000	2750000	And as he punches it, it twists and turns.
2750000	2754000	Because you know the whole big thing in Mario Kart 8 is anti-grav, right?
2754000	2758000	And your car is suddenly turned into Tron when you run over certain parts of the track.
2758000	2760000	And you're like going up walls and shit.
2760000	2761000	It's crazy.
2761000	2764000	So the track design, and they do this stuff on the old tracks too.
2764000	2767000	Like they actually found ways to put anti-grav on the old tracks.
2767000	2771000	And sometimes it's, hey look it's Mario Kart Circuit from the Super Nintendo.
2771000	2774000	Except now we've elevated part of the course.
2774000	2780000	And instead of going around a loop, it now is a vertical loop that you go up and around.
2780000	2782000	It's really crazy, stuff like that.
2782000	2786000	But really impressive to look at from a graphical part.
2786000	2789000	Now actdeftinchat says, Mario 3D World looks great.
2789000	2792000	I do agree actdeft. Mario 3D World does look great.
2792000	2795000	I wouldn't have called it my favorite Wii U game if I thought it looked like crap.
2795000	2799000	But I'm just saying, Mario Kart 8 feels like the bar has gone even higher.
2799000	2800000	You know what I mean?
2800000	2802000	Like in a very short amount of time.
2802000	2804000	So this is very interesting.
2804000	2806000	Also good.
2806000	2812000	For all the LOL Nintendo and online and Nintendo doesn't get online and all this stuff we talk about.
2812000	2815000	Online works really fucking well.
2815000	2817000	I didn't get any hiccups when I played.
2817000	2819000	Didn't see any lag.
2819000	2822000	There is lag. The game is accommodating for it somehow.
2822000	2824000	I don't know how, but it's doing it.
2824000	2826000	I played a couple online races.
2826000	2828000	One with a friend that lives in South Carolina.
2828000	2830000	One random match I had a whole bunch of people join.
2830000	2833000	Like some over California, some in other places.
2833000	2835000	And they all ran really well.
2835000	2838000	Yes, there is voice chat. It works only in the lobby.
2838000	2843000	But because your Wii U gamepad has the microphone built in, you just talk and the Wii U gamepad picks it up.
2843000	2845000	And you hear everybody else.
2845000	2847000	There's a little bit of a delay.
2847000	2852000	It's instantaneous, but I don't think Xbox Live or Playstation Network are any different in that regard.
2852000	2855000	So sometimes you'll hear a little bit of echoing, but all things considered.
2855000	2859000	I'm voice chatting on a Nintendo online game.
2859000	2861000	Oh my god, party like it's 2004.
2861000	2863000	So that's only in the lobby and not in the races?
2863000	2865000	It is only in the lobby and not in the races.
2865000	2869000	That's one, and it's only when you're with friends, not with strangers.
2869000	2874000	They have the whole text, the pre-determined phrases that they have for those other times.
2875000	2877000	Which is fine, whatever. It gets the job done.
2877000	2879000	I don't want to hear strangers anyway.
2879000	2882000	I was a little disappointed it doesn't exist in the races.
2882000	2885000	But I also find that during the races, I'm focused on the race.
2885000	2889000	And it's probably for the best that other people can't hear the things I'm calling them.
2889000	2896000	It would be fun though that if you could have those phrase bubbles or whatever on your gamepad and come by like,
2896000	2898000	Loser!
2899000	2903000	And also, I thought there was a really good variation of cart mods.
2903000	2908000	Which the earlier Mario karts, the last couple have had this too.
2908000	2911000	But there is definitely a variety.
2911000	2914000	And the variety also extends to the character roster.
2914000	2916000	There's 30 characters you can play as.
2916000	2919000	And I think the addition of the Koopa Kids actually was a really smart add to the game.
2919000	2921000	It really helped diversify the roster.
2921000	2924000	However, one small drawback I have with the game is that
2924000	2928000	Some of the characters they have on the roster are a pretty big stretch.
2928000	2932000	And I get why they do it. They're trying to have these different weight classes.
2932000	2936000	Because all three characters, they're all over the spectrum in weights.
2936000	2940000	You don't just have light, medium, heavy anymore. They're all over.
2940000	2942000	But some of the characters are a little dippy.
2942000	2946000	I mean, really? Who's looking forward to playing as Baby Rosalina?
2946000	2950000	Or Pink Gold Peach?
2950000	2954000	Or for that matter, Metal Mario, who I think is a little bit of a ridiculous character as well.
2954000	2958000	Or some of these other characters in the game, you just kind of look at it and go,
2958000	2962000	No. Couldn't we have put another character in the game instead?
2962000	2968000	And I think Shane or Alan or somebody was saying this the other night.
2968000	2973000	If you want another heavy class, why have we never seen Wart from Mario Bros. 2
2973000	2976000	ever show up in another Mario game ever?
2976000	2980000	Like, Wart would have been an awesome heavy racer that could be there instead of Metal Mario.
2980000	2982000	Because he technically wasn't a Mario enemy.
2982000	2986000	Yeah, but neither were the Shy Guys and they show up.
2986000	2990000	I mean, if we go with that logic, then there's other Mario 2 inspired movies.
2990000	2992000	The Shy Guys have shown up in other Mario games.
2992000	2995000	Didn't Wart show up later on in something else? I thought he did.
2995000	2996000	I didn't think so.
2996000	2998000	Hmm. Still, I mean...
2998000	3001000	But my point is that Birdo made the transition.
3001000	3004000	Originally debuted in 2 and has been prolific in the universe.
3004000	3007000	Good point. I didn't even think of Birdo. Birdo doesn't show up in the game as a racer.
3007000	3010000	That's very disappointing. I would have taken Birdo over Toadette.
3010000	3013000	That's for sure.
3013000	3015000	Because they have to diversify.
3015000	3023000	If my brother's playing Metal Mario, then sister needs to play Metal Peach or whatever.
3023000	3026000	They're just trying to even it out that way.
3026000	3028000	Let's see. Tigerclaw says, Here's the thing.
3028000	3033000	Nintendo added all seven Koopalings to the roster. Why not include Bowser Jr.?
3033000	3040000	Because they have... Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Baby Rosalina.
3040000	3042000	Do they really need Baby Bowser on top of all that?
3042000	3045000	Or they could have put Dixie Kong, Diddy Kong.
3045000	3047000	Yeah. Why not Dixie Kong?
3047000	3050000	Oh, because it doesn't really fall into the whole Mario Brothers thing.
3050000	3052000	Donkey Kong Jr. There you go.
3052000	3059000	I do think it's great that Mario Kart does have a really good balance of male and female racers.
3059000	3062000	I think that's really good and a good thing for the industry as a whole.
3062000	3066000	One thing Nintendo does very well is that they always have a lot of good male and female characters.
3066000	3072000	But when you're kind of stretching it, literally Peach is playable three different ways.
3072000	3075000	And so is Mario for that matter.
3075000	3078000	But like you said, Dixie Kong.
3078000	3080000	I don't think they should have had any of the baby characters.
3080000	3083000	I don't think that they should have had the metal characters.
3083000	3086000	Even the Koopalings are kind of like...
3086000	3089000	Don't knock it till you've tried it. The Koopalings are pretty diverse.
3089000	3093000	It just seems like they're trying to pad that roster in to make it even bigger than it is.
3093000	3095000	I think that's okay.
3095000	3097000	But I think what it is, Loki.
3097000	3102000	I think what people are really clamoring for is they want Nintendo Kart, not Mario Kart.
3102000	3104000	Because then we start to say, well, why not have Zelda?
3104000	3107000	Why not have Link? Why not have...
3107000	3112000	I think that would have been a great idea because they could have been a little bit fresh with their tracks.
3112000	3115000	Don't get me wrong. I like the retro tracks in there.
3115000	3120000	But I think that as of late, they've been getting kind of lazy with having a lot of retro tracks in there.
3120000	3122000	Granted, this is the one they did updated.
3122000	3124000	That's what they do in Mario Kart games.
3124000	3127000	Every single Mario Kart game has half new, half old.
3127000	3129000	And that's part of the charm.
3129000	3131000	I totally disagree with you there.
3131000	3135000	I look forward to seeing what retro tracks are available and how they've messed with it.
3135000	3137000	Because there's some really cool tracks that have come back.
3137000	3139000	Well, I'm sure we'll see DLC.
3139000	3140000	I hope so.
3140000	3146000	If Sonic can have a Zelda course in it, I'm sure we'll have a Sonic course.
3146000	3148000	I hope so.
3148000	3152000	The character roster thing, though, is honestly only a very minor bitch.
3152000	3157000	Because I get that they want to have all these selectable and customizable things.
3157000	3160000	And that's a good thing, but it's just like, really?
3160000	3163000	And Weiland's telling me to shut up because he plays Baby Rosalina.
3163000	3166000	Sorry, but it's just, you know, I had to pick on somebody.
3166000	3168000	Alright.
3168000	3172000	The only other thing that I think is a drawback about the game and an otherwise fantastic game is that
3172000	3179000	I thought it was really weird that in two-player mode, you could not have one person on the screen and one on the gamepad.
3179000	3183000	Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed did that.
3183000	3185000	Why can't Mario Kart do that?
3185000	3189000	You have to have the split screen side by side.
3189000	3193000	And I understand the answer might be it was a performance issue.
3193000	3195000	When you do that, you have the frame skip.
3195000	3203000	And I go, okay, well that's an explanation, but it doesn't make it feel any less like, why can't you do that?
3203000	3208000	I mean, you guys have to understand, although you might say, oh well the reason is because of technology.
3208000	3212000	Well then the technology needs to be better or something because it seems really weird.
3212000	3214000	Or at least give me the option.
3214000	3218000	If I play that way and I don't like the frame rate skip, then I go back and play the other way.
3218000	3222000	Or maybe what they used to do in the F-Zero game that was on GameCube.
3222000	3227000	I don't know if you guys noticed in the game, but they would actually take some graphical liberties with the tracks.
3227000	3233000	And when you had four players playing at once, the tracks weren't as graphically involved so that it could get that performance out of it.
3233000	3235000	And I would have liked to see something like that.
3235000	3243000	I thought it was so weird that I couldn't have one on the gamepad, one on the screen, when one of the launch titles racing games had that.
3243000	3248000	And yes, the performance suffers a little bit, but it's not awful.
3248000	3250000	It's not anywhere near awful.
3250000	3256000	But that Sonic racing game, as fun as it is, it's just not in the same club as Mario Kart.
3257000	3259000	But anyway, so yes.
3259000	3261000	Well they have Danica Patrick.
3262000	3268000	Which actually, knock that all you want, but she's a lot of fun to play in that game, so whatever.
3268000	3270000	Whatever with you.
3270000	3271000	Let's see.
3271000	3273000	Let's see.
3273000	3277000	Yeah, Loki, the classic tracks don't even feel like classic tracks. They feel new.
3277000	3280000	Granted, they screwed up Rainbow Road.
3280000	3288000	Yeah, they took Rainbow Road from the Nintendo 64, and although it looks gorgeous in the game, because Rainbow Road on Nintendo 64 was so long, right?
3288000	3291000	They just made it a one-lap race that they split into three parts.
3291000	3293000	Yeah, Loki's rolling his eyes over there.
3293000	3296000	But you know what? It's not that big a deal.
3296000	3298000	I really don't think it's that big a deal.
3299000	3301000	Yeah, that's dumb.
3301000	3306000	I still think that Rainbow Road is better than the new one they put in there. I don't like the new Rainbow Road at all.
3306000	3309000	But, there's like a dance club level.
3309000	3311000	I don't even, the Electrodome, I think it's called.
3311000	3320000	That level is badass. That's like a little dance club, and you see these big monitors where shy guys and Koopas are getting down, dancing on the sides as you're racing through.
3320000	3324000	And then as you're racing on the track, the little neon lights light up on the track as you're racing.
3324000	3327000	And then as you do the skids, the neon lights change color.
3327000	3329000	And it's such just a subtly awesome effect.
3329000	3331000	Anyway, I didn't even get into the online stuff.
3331000	3336000	And the whole like, yes it puts together these highlight reels and you can upload them to YouTube.
3336000	3342000	And it's a really creative way to kind of try to match what PlayStation 4's got going on with the share button.
3342000	3349000	I sort of think these YouTube clips are going to be a dime a dozen and they're going to lose their effectiveness really fast.
3349000	3357000	But for those, like if you have a lot of people over and you want to relive those epic moments like when somebody got hit with a red shell right before they were about to cross the finish line.
3357000	3362000	Those highlight reels serve a pretty good function and I think is an interesting addition to the game.
3362000	3364000	So, anyway.
3364000	3369000	Alright, that's it. That's all I'm going to say about Mario Kart 8. I've said plenty.
3369000	3374000	But overall, even though it sounds like I had a lot of negatives, the positives far outweigh the negatives.
3374000	3377000	And it's a must own game if you are a Wii U owner.
3377000	3381000	And if you're not a Wii U owner, I think this one's going to tip it a lot of ways.
3381000	3385000	I have heard of several people on Twitter went out and got the Mario Kart bundle for the Wii U.
3385000	3387000	Thought about it.
3387000	3390000	Even Loki. Even Loki thought about it.
3390000	3400000	I like Mario Kart, but I had to say, listen, am I going to pay $300 for Mario Kart?
3400000	3404000	And I was just like, you know, I don't know. Not right now maybe.
3404000	3407000	It would be Mario Kart and Zelda because you still get the freebie or whatever.
3407000	3408000	I probably wouldn't do Zelda actually.
3408000	3410000	Or Mario U or whatever you want to get.
3410000	3415000	I don't know, but I just, I don't know. We'll see.
3415000	3418000	It's like if I got it, you know.
3418000	3422000	I think there's a lot of people teetering and now is going to be a great time.
3422000	3425000	I don't think it's going to happen at E3, but I think by the holiday comes around.
3425000	3427000	Well yeah, there's still time too.
3427000	3431000	You have now between now and was it the end of July to kind of decide whether you want to do that or not?
3431000	3433000	So, wait for E3, see what announcements they have.
3433000	3435000	You know, then that might be worth it.
3435000	3439000	I still think come the holiday after that promotion is over, I think Nintendo might come out and finally say,
3439000	3443000	alright, $50 off. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see.
3443000	3447000	I think a lot of us think that that kind of thing has to happen sooner rather than later though.
3447000	3450000	Even going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
3450000	3453000	Rababa says, you made it sound more positive than negative.
3453000	3458000	Oh good. I don't like to be the negative gamer, but I am going to point out issues I have with the game.
3458000	3460000	You know, but overall it's so good.
3460000	3466000	SonicM88 in chat says, I just bought my bundle today, but it was mainly for Wind Waker.
3466000	3470000	Interesting. I guess there are a lot of people that are getting into that Wind Waker.
3470000	3472000	So, alright.
3472000	3478000	Anyhow, that's it. We are going to get into some gaming news, but I want to do housekeeping real quick.
3478000	3484000	Do add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and also we are on Google Plus,
3484000	3490000	google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, and Twitter, twitter.com slash olr.
3490000	3492000	A few things coming up as of note.
3492000	3499000	Speaking of Mario Kart, some other podcast frenzies of mine and I and us here at OLR
3499000	3503000	are going to get together for a Mario Kart tournament on the 22nd,
3503000	3508000	which happens to also be a big night for us because that's going to be our big birthday show.
3508000	3515000	So, plan on the podcast cross zone tournament happening on June 22nd.
3515000	3520000	And the details are being finalized right now, so I'll have more info for you probably next week.
3520000	3524000	But just kind of set aside some time there to participate in that tournament.
3524000	3529000	I think we're going to give away a game, and it's all in celebration of podcast cross zone.
3529000	3536000	There's going to be a panel at GamerX again this year with myself, the guys from Koopa Club,
3536000	3544000	the guys from Game Buoy, the guys from Game Bar, that's G-A-Y-M-E-B-A-R, and Video Game Realness.
3544000	3548000	I'm not sure if they're actually attending in person, but they'll be there in spirit because they're awesome too.
3548000	3552000	They're going to be there as well, and I feel like I'm leaving somebody out and I'm feeling horrible.
3552000	3554000	Probably because there's OLR and Horde House.
3556000	3560000	Shit, if I'm leaving somebody out, then I'm really, really, really sorry, but I think that's it.
3560000	3569000	But all those groups are getting together to bring you the podcast cross zone tournament on the 22nd, so stay tuned for more information on that.
3569000	3571000	That'll be a lot of fun.
3571000	3573000	And then there's going to be, we'll do something with VOG as well.
3573000	3578000	Like I know, especially when Mario Kart 7 first came out, we were playing all the time on breaks and things like that,
3578000	3585000	so we'll look at doing something similar to that for those of you guys that are really into Mario Kart and want to race online and all that.
3586000	3592000	Also, I want to give a quick shout out to another podcast that was kind enough to have me on their program this week.
3592000	3598000	The podcast is called Killer Queens from Outer Space, and it's episode 13 that I was on.
3598000	3603000	The interesting thing is that it actually is no video game talk from me on this particular show,
3603000	3611000	because this is a podcast about movies, focusing a lot on scary movies, which I'm not usually super into,
3611000	3615000	but this particular week was on musical and cult scary movies, which is the stuff I do.
3615000	3621000	So we talked Rocky Horror, we talked Repo, the genetic opera, and because I guess the Blu-ray just came out,
3621000	3626000	this movie came up, and I'm a big fan of this scary movie, Sleepaway Camp.
3628000	3632000	Which if you've never seen Sleepaway Camp, don't spoil it.
3632000	3635000	You've got to go into this movie not knowing anything about it.
3635000	3639000	It's like a really cheesy thriller from the 80s, and if you don't know the ending...
3639000	3642000	Didn't they remake that? I thought they were talking about remaking that.
3642000	3646000	I think they did another sequel, like a Sleepaway Camp 4 or something that came out not that long ago.
3646000	3649000	But do you know what I learned on Killer Queens from Outer Space?
3649000	3654000	This has nothing to do with video games, but I have to share this. I learned this on Killer Queens from Outer Space.
3654000	3662000	Did you know that in the flashback scenes, there's a little boy, right? In the flashback scenes that you see, right?
3663000	3668000	That little boy is the situation from Jersey Shore's brother.
3671000	3677000	Because apparently that guy was at some screening that one of the hosts on this show went to, and I was like, get the hell out.
3677000	3679000	I scoffed, and then I chuckled.
3679000	3686000	That was the situation's brother was in Sleepaway Camp, and that makes it like ten times funnier if you know what the ending is.
3687000	3689000	But I'm not going to say anything.
3692000	3696000	And SSG100Matt is like, oh god, Sleepaway Camp is on Blu-ray? Yep.
3696000	3700000	We'll talk all about it on that show, so check that out. That was episode 13 of Killer Queens from Outer Space.
3700000	3704000	They're on iTunes and all that good stuff, Twitter. Just Google it, you'll find it.
3704000	3707000	Alright, now we can get into some news.
3707000	3711000	A little bit of gaming news this week. A little lighter leading up to E3 week.
3711000	3715000	Next week I think is going to be a ton of news, and then of course in two weeks there's a ton.
3715000	3720000	Speaking of E3, I should get this out. I was going to talk about this at the beginning of part B, but I guess I'll say this quickly now.
3720000	3726000	VOG will be at E3 2014, just like we were last year, except there's more of us going this year.
3726000	3732000	Last year Bobby had to do it by himself. This year myself, Bobby, and Jason all going to E3.
3732000	3737000	And we will be participating in the interactive coverage.
3737000	3741000	If you want to check this out, just go to E3.vognetwork.com.
3741000	3747000	I think for the next couple days you're still going to see 2013's coverage, but I'll give you a taste of what it is.
3747000	3751000	But Bobby's going to flip the switch to turn it to 2014 at some point this week.
3751000	3757000	In a nutshell, we do not want to be the first place that you go to for E3 news.
3757000	3760000	Because we can't be that. We're not going to be delusional.
3760000	3766000	You're going to watch streams online. You're going to watch the TV stations.
3766000	3772000	You're going to look at the Twitch, or you're going to go to these big corporate sites because they always get the exclusives.
3772000	3774000	And that's fine. We understand we can't compete with that.
3774000	3777000	So we don't want to be the first. We want to be the second.
3777000	3783000	Now that you're armed with all the script information, because they're just reading all the bullet points and script.
3783000	3788000	Now that you're armed with what all those first sites are giving you, what is it you really want to know about the games?
3788000	3794000	That's what we're after at the Voice of Geeks Network is letting your voices be heard on the floor at E3.
3794000	3800000	So you can actually post questions to our board by clicking on an interactive site map of the E3 show floor.
3800000	3805000	Let's say you have a question for Konami. You can click on Konami's booth.
3805000	3809000	Let's say, heaven forbid, they announce a new DDR game at E3 or something.
3809000	3813000	You can click on Konami's booth and you can ask a question like, is Sandstorm going to be in it?
3813000	3816000	We will try to find out that answer for you.
3816000	3820000	Keep in mind, some companies, not as forthcoming as others.
3820000	3823000	We will try our best, I guarantee it.
3823000	3827000	But usually the bigger the company at E3, the tighter the script.
3827000	3829000	And they don't really like to deviate from that.
3829000	3835000	If they talk about Kingdom Hearts 3 at E3, probably they're not going to take questions on it.
3835000	3838000	Nobody's probably going to be talking about it because they're just not ready to.
3838000	3847000	But if you like games from those developers that are a little bit, not maybe the first tier, triple A developers,
3847000	3852000	but maybe the A minus B plus developers, they tend to send their creators to E3.
3852000	3857000	They'll talk a lot more about their games and if you have questions about them, we will do our darndest to find answers.
3857000	3859000	And we got some great answers last year.
3859000	3864000	We had some chat with the folks behind The Witcher 3, which I think we're seeing them again this year.
3864000	3866000	I remember Disney Infinity.
3866000	3869000	We were the ones to break the news on the price of the figures for Disney Infinity,
3869000	3871000	and that was all because of your question.
3871000	3875000	So that's the type of stuff we're looking to bring you in this next year.
3875000	3878000	So check it out, E3.vognetwork.com.
3878000	3881000	And we'll be able to ask two times.
3881000	3884000	Bobby, I think he said he answered over 100 questions last year.
3884000	3886000	Does that count the ones he zonked out?
3886000	3889000	Because that seems like so many, but I would believe it.
3889000	3892000	So I guess our goal is 200 this year. We'll see.
3892000	3893000	All right.
3893000	3894000	250.
3894000	3896000	250. That's right. Set the bar high.
3896000	3899000	All right. Let's get to it. Let's get into gaming news.
3899000	3901000	And leading into E3, what is going on? Loki.
3901000	3909000	So you may remember that there was a whole lot of issues with Let's Players and Nintendo games
3909000	3915000	that they were finding that they're not only getting content ID hits,
3915000	3920000	but also that revenue was going to Nintendo for the ads and stuff.
3920000	3924000	Well, now Nintendo is going to be offering an affiliate program
3924000	3927000	with basically it's going to be like a rev-share model
3927000	3934000	where Google, Nintendo, and the video creators will be able to share the revenue from their ads.
3934000	3940000	And I guess they've already been tagging recent YouTube videos of Nintendo games
3940000	3943000	and Nintendo ads are appearing on those videos.
3944000	3950000	I guess before, because they were just kind of taking all the revenue
3950000	3953000	or at least splitting it between Google and themselves,
3953000	3961000	but I guess now they're saying, hey, we're going to share it with people that want to make money off of it as well.
3961000	3963000	And their comment, of course,
3963000	3966000	Nintendo has been permitting the use of Nintendo copyright materials
3966000	3969000	in videos on YouTube under appropriate circumstances.
3969000	3973000	Advertisements may accompany those videos and keep you on previous policy
3973000	3976000	that revenue is shared between YouTube and Nintendo.
3976000	3980000	In addition, for those who wish to use the material more proactively,
3980000	3986000	we are preparing an affiliate program which portions of the advertising profit is given to the creator.
3986000	3989000	Details about this affiliate program will be announced in the future.
3989000	3992000	I don't know.
3992000	3997000	I mean, yeah, it's well within the right to do that, but it kind of seems like a dick move anyways.
3997000	4008000	I don't know why they should even make revenue off of creative content made with their stuff.
4008000	4010000	I just don't understand why they would do that.
4010000	4013000	I mean, yeah, it's free advertising.
4013000	4015000	Yeah, they may not want the free advertising,
4015000	4020000	but it's kind of lame when there's so many other developers out there
4020000	4024000	that just don't give a shit about people making money off of their content
4024000	4030000	and people are more inclined to show that kind of content versus, you know,
4030000	4034000	I don't know a lot of people that would be dedicated to, say, a Nintendo-only channel or something
4034000	4040000	and now they're making even less revenue per view or whatever from YouTube
4040000	4043000	than they would with another game.
4043000	4049000	And ad per view anyways nowadays, it's not that much to begin with, so I don't know.
4049000	4051000	I'm going to be honest.
4051000	4055000	This might not be the popular opinion, but sometimes I don't have the popular opinion.
4055000	4061000	I kind of think it's fair for Nintendo to take a piece of it, and I am a YouTube content creator myself,
4061000	4066000	and I think if Nintendo, the game developer themselves, wants to have a piece of the pie,
4066000	4070000	you know what, they do make the games that we're broadcasting over.
4070000	4075000	And I realize some people do commentary and some people do the jokes and things,
4075000	4079000	but guys, you can say that all you want, but the reality is you wouldn't have any of that
4079000	4082000	if you didn't have the game to go with it.
4082000	4085000	Like, let's be real, you guys. Come on.
4085000	4088000	You would not have that commentary if it wasn't for the game.
4088000	4093000	And if you want to do that type of stuff without the game imagery and without the game music
4093000	4097000	and all that stuff that goes into making a game, you can do that,
4097000	4099000	and then you can have all the profits or whatever,
4099000	4104000	but I think if you are going to try to make a living, so to speak,
4104000	4108000	off of all these clips that Nintendo had a hand in,
4108000	4110000	you know what, Nintendo has a right to some of the money.
4110000	4115000	However, that being said, now, where do we draw the line?
4115000	4119000	Because I think if you're going to be reviewing a Nintendo product
4119000	4122000	and you use clips from Nintendo games in your review,
4122000	4126000	I question if it's ethical for Nintendo to be taking a share of that,
4126000	4133000	because those reviews are supposed to be something that is supposed to give that light to Nintendo and so forth,
4133000	4138000	but I'm not talking like five-minute let's plays being reviews.
4138000	4141000	I'm talking like 30-second clips of the game being in reviews.
4141000	4144000	I'm not so sure Nintendo should be entitled in those types of situations,
4144000	4148000	but that's the problem with something like this is it's complicated,
4148000	4155000	and YouTube wants to make these blanket decisions that don't always make sense,
4155000	4160000	and where I get really pissed off is I get really pissed off
4160000	4166000	with non-Nintendo companies, third parties that aren't even involved with the game making,
4166000	4171000	making copyright claims against things that are out there publicly as
4171000	4174000	you can make this content and you can make money off this content.
4174000	4177000	Like I mentioned a couple weeks ago on the show, Super Hexagon.
4177000	4181000	I had a copyright claim on one of those, and I was really pissed,
4181000	4186000	and I want to know where's the strike against them for doing those claims,
4186000	4190000	and we got into it last week about the whole which side are they on,
4190000	4193000	the consumer themselves and so forth, and I'm not trying to rehash that argument,
4193000	4200000	but I'm just saying that this is why there's really a concern about this whole Nintendo thing is
4200000	4208000	is Nintendo going to start to claim on things that maybe they really don't actually have business making money off of?
4208000	4213000	It's a complicated situation, and I know they're also talking about this whole like,
4213000	4219000	oh, well, you have to get permission first and all this, but if you're making it that easy to upload YouTube clips
4219000	4224000	or upload clips to YouTube of Mario Kart and all this other stuff, then you know what?
4224000	4228000	Signing up as a revenue sharing partner needs to be just as easy.
4228000	4233000	I shouldn't have to fill out a 20-step form and wait 30 days or whatever it is.
4233000	4240000	Or just make it automatic. If you monetize it, Nintendo's going to get cut as well.
4240000	4247000	Just have that disclaimer there. This content's owned by Nintendo. Nintendo's taking a cut of it.
4247000	4251000	I think people will be okay with that, and that's fine. Now this is out there,
4251000	4255000	so it gives people that do the Let's Play videos an option.
4255000	4262000	If you want to make a video using Nintendo products, just know that you're going to be making less money,
4262000	4266000	which I guess is better than no money that was the situation before.
4266000	4271000	Exactly, but Loki, my point is, and I know not everybody's going to agree with me,
4271000	4275000	because people want to say, oh, fair use and all this stuff, but the harsh reality is,
4275000	4279000	if you didn't have those games to begin with, then you wouldn't have had a revenue to begin with.
4279000	4282000	But they would have a different game. They'd be using a different game then.
4282000	4285000	Unless all game companies went down this road.
4285000	4287000	Not all game companies are going to go down that road, though.
4287000	4289000	Some of the bigger ones might.
4289000	4293000	But some of the bigger ones aren't as big a deal nowadays.
4293000	4299000	It's a lot of indie uprising now, whereas these big game companies,
4299000	4302000	not a lot of people care about doing Let's Plays on them.
4302000	4307000	I don't know. You have your options. That's what it is, I guess.
4307000	4313000	All this being said, Loki, I know you don't do a lot of YouTube, but let's say you did.
4313000	4319000	Would you make videos featuring Nintendo comment knowing this, or would you say,
4319000	4322000	you know what, no, I'm not going to do this?
4322000	4326000	I'd probably be more inclined, if I'm going to put the effort into making a Let's Play video
4326000	4330000	that's of a significant length in the amount of effort it takes to make the video,
4330000	4335000	I'd probably be more inclined to do a title that I'd be making more money off of.
4335000	4341000	Because why would I spend the effort to make a video that I'm getting a fraction of
4341000	4344000	what I could be getting from another game?
4344000	4353000	All right. Well, what I want to do is I actually want to go and I want to actually ask our listeners.
4353000	4358000	We haven't done this in a while, but I want to ask our listeners about what they think on this topic.
4358000	4361000	You know what's funny? You want to hear something funny related to YouTube and all this?
4361000	4366000	So I used to have a YouTube of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Ask the audience music that I'd always play in the background.
4366000	4372000	I just tried to bring it up for this. It's gone. Talk about ironic.
4372000	4376000	Let me see if this one works. Let me see if this one works.
4376000	4381000	All right. Good enough. All right. So we're going to go ask our VoG network participants right now.
4381000	4388000	And if you are actually on live.vognetwork.com, you should see this question pop up on your screen shortly here.
4388000	4390000	And I'm going to make this very simple.
4390000	4398000	Is Nintendo's new revenue sharing policy on YouTube fair? Yes or no?
4398000	4403000	And I realize there's a lot of in-betweens on this, and I'm actually trying to discourage that.
4403000	4408000	I really want to know, as this information is being presented, do you believe it's fair? Yes or no?
4408000	4412000	Should Nintendo be allowed to take a cut? So it's up there right now.
4412000	4415000	We'll have that open for a little bit and check in on your results in just a minute.
4415000	4418000	Live.vognetwork.com.
4418000	4424000	DarkSakura, I know you've been a little bit quiet tonight, but I know you've been participating in chat and chatting with all of them.
4424000	4431000	But you have a good sense of judgment with some of this stuff when it comes to these legal things sometimes.
4431000	4434000	I'm really curious. What do you think? Is Nintendo entitled to a cut?
4434000	4445000	If it's their product, then yes, they're entitled to a cut. However, as far as implementing it fairly, that is a different story.
4445000	4449000	But yeah, I think they're entitled. Very base level.
4449000	4454000	If they own the original product, they should get a little bit of something out of it.
4454000	4460000	It sounds like you and I are on a very similar page here, because I also have that hesitation where it's like, in theory, yes.
4460000	4465000	If what Nintendo is doing is where the industry went, then yes, I would be fine with that.
4465000	4471000	And I'm a content creator myself, and I'm fine with that. But the reality is, are they going to do it right?
4471000	4478000	Probably not. And that's what I'm considering. Judging on these other things I'm seeing happening on YouTube, probably not.
4478000	4489000	But the hope is that since Nintendo likes to do things differently, they may have a different solution. We just don't know what it is.
4489000	4494000	Alright. Alright.
4494000	4499000	They do like to sort of drop shit on us from, you know, orbit when we least expect it.
4499000	4506000	Alright, let's leave the question up just a little bit while we go into this next story, and then we'll get into the results here in a moment.
4506000	4512000	But I'm going to say right now, it's overwhelmingly yes. So we'll see. We'll see here in a minute, though, where things shake out.
4512000	4519000	In the meantime, while we wait for the votes to finalize on that, speaking of Nintendo, and I actually dipped into this a little bit with last week's news,
4519000	4525000	but Loki was clarifying the difference, that there was like a third-party GameCube adapter that was going to be coming last week.
4525000	4527000	Well, Nintendo just...
4527000	4531000	It's not even an adapter. It's just a controller that's shaped like a GameCube.
4531000	4541000	Well, Nintendo just crapped on that this week by announcing that they're going to be putting out an adapter that you can actually plug your GameCube controller into this adapter,
4541000	4546000	and you plug it into Wii U. You'll be able to use the GameCube controller in Smash Bros. Wii U.
4546000	4551000	This was actually tucked away in a Smash Bros. announcement. Jason, you touched on this earlier in the show as well.
4551000	4553000	Throw your Wavebirds in the air!
4553000	4555000	You excited about this?
4555000	4567000	I still have my Wavebird. I was actually going through a tub of something, looking for some stuff a couple weeks ago before I came out here, and I found my Wavebird, and I would love to put it to use.
4567000	4573000	Using the Wiimote with Brawl was okay. Using the Nunchuck didn't. I didn't really get used to that.
4573000	4581000	But yeah, for stuff like this, anything that's a full-handed controller is great, and the Wavebird fit my hands really fucking well.
4581000	4583000	I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
4583000	4591000	Yeah, the GameCube controller. You and I were talking a little bit before the show, too, as you were kind of saying, like, what other controllers lasted 13-plus years?
4591000	4598000	And I tried to argue a little bit, well, the DualShock really hasn't changed that much, especially from PS1 to PS2 to PS3.
4598000	4603000	Now, granted, PS4, I would say, they've changed enough to make it a different controller, but it's still...
4603000	4610000	The thing about the PlayStation 4 controller and why it's still a great controller is it still kind of keeps everything that the DualShock does right.
4610000	4611000	Yep.
4611000	4623000	But anyway, I totally get your point, is that here we are, we're now having an adapter two life cycles later to use these old controllers, because people are that attached to them. It's really something.
4623000	4634000	And controllers, you know, the button reconfiguration is actually a bit of a sordid issue, where the Wii U Pro Controller and Classic Controller...
4634000	4648000	No, I'm sorry, the Wii Pro Controller and Classic Controller went back to the standard cross-action buttons, where the GameCube, like the N64, both of those controllers had very specific differences that really made a difference in the game as you played them.
4648000	4665000	There is no controller that has lasted this long cross-systems. The Wii had four native GameCube ports in the side of the machine. This accessory looks identical. You plug it in once and it's the full array.
4665000	4674000	And who's to say that they're not going to revitalize old GameCube controllers again, but if you have them, then you get to put them used.
4674000	4677000	Yeah, there's nice save slots in there.
4677000	4680000	Oh, I didn't even think about that. Well, you don't need to.
4680000	4694000	But if we're going to go down the route of that there's a possibility for GameCube Virtual Console games, wouldn't it be awesome to be able to load up your save from the GameCube and play it on the GameCube Virtual Console version?
4694000	4696000	Just saying.
4696000	4699000	GameCubes are too hard to come by.
4700000	4713000	Some folks in chat are talking about this. Rama in our chat asks, will it be PC compatible? And you know what, it should be noted that because the Wii U takes these things via USB, that yes, this GameCube adapter is a USB.
4713000	4716000	So I would think it's only a matter of time before somebody makes a driver for it.
4716000	4717000	Official or hacked?
4717000	4718000	Official or hacked?
4718000	4719000	Official or hacked?
4719000	4720000	Official or hacked? Interesting.
4721000	4734000	I made this point a number of months ago. I have paired my PS4 controller with my computer, but it seems to not work so well with Steam, so I have to use it physically. I have to use it hardwired.
4734000	4745000	But we've also talked about the PlayStation 4 direct input translator thing, so games that support what the Xbox controller winds up doing, you can do with the PS4.
4745000	4752000	Yeah, because if you can plug it into a computer, people can write something to work with it. Period. End of discussion.
4753000	4763000	Now of course, this is starting all the rumors about, is Nintendo going to announce GameCube Virtual Console games at E3? What do you guys think with that?
4764000	4779000	I mean, it does seem like a really logical next step. You know, a lot of people missed out on the GameCube, although a lot of people are missing out on the Wii U as well, but you still are probably going to have a good bunch of people who do have a Wii U who didn't have a GameCube, and I think, you know, it seems logical, doesn't it?
4780000	4796000	We make the point that Nintendo is very good at getting you to buy the same game, exactly the same game, three times. A decade later. So, yeah. If they are capable of doing so, why not? It seems inevitable, I don't see why not.
4797000	4804000	It's really interesting how much press this news has gotten too, considering it was really a footnote in a larger discussion on Smash Brothers, so it's just kind of neat.
4804000	4805000	Big deal with the FGC.
4805000	4824000	Well, especially if you take this stuff really seriously, which even Nintendo is, by having this official Smash Brothers tournament, this E3, I mean, Smash Brothers is their bread and butter this holiday season, and yes, I know there's Bayonetta 2, and yes, I know there's the X and all this other stuff, but let's be real, Nintendo is putting all their eggs in Smash Brothers Basket, and with good reason.
4825000	4826000	Now that Mario Kart finally came out.
4826000	4827000	Now that Mario Kart's finally out.
4827000	4829000	And Zelda, kind of, and Mario World.
4830000	4834000	Alright, let's go to the results of our poll.
4834000	4840000	Again, we asked you guys live, is Nintendo's new revenue sharing policy on YouTube fair?
4840000	4848000	And get this, roughly 85% of you guys, that's 84.62%, said yes, it's fair.
4848000	4852000	Interesting. That's an overwhelming majority. Like, that's not even close.
4852000	4863000	Now, granted, there were some of you that said no, and I hope to hear from you guys later in the program, if not, you know, via email, or via the Skype line, at, of course, you can always send this email, participate at orangelandsready.com.
4863000	4868000	If you get it in now, it's probably not going to make it for tonight, but I would be really curious to hear from some of you no's.
4869000	4876000	Not in a combative way. I mean, I might have said that yes, I believe it's fair, but I expressed my hesitations, so I actually do want to hear.
4876000	4881000	I want to see if you guys can maybe rip that open a little more, and kind of, I'm really curious about your guys' thoughts.
4881000	4889000	So, maybe, maybe hear from some more of you guys a little later in the show, but yeah, 84.62% said yes, 15.38% said no.
4889000	4895000	So, thank you guys for participating. We haven't done a live poll in forever. I need to bring those back, because it's a lot of fun to do.
4895000	4898000	See what the audience thinks right as we're listening. Love it.
4898000	4901000	Alright, let's move on. Away from Nintendo, finally, this week.
4901000	4903000	Darstokker, what do you have for us?
4903000	4917000	Well, for fans of Bioshock, which I know we have quite a number of them, Take-Two has stated that there is a new Red Dead Redemption game on the way, and that Bioshock is not dead.
4917000	4928000	Of course, you know, we still have the whole, you know, story being told now being concluded through the season pass for Bioshock Infinite.
4928000	4935000	But they're saying that there may be a bit more to handle, a bit more going on in the future of the Bioshock series.
4935000	4947000	But, yeah, there's definitely, though, we're going to see some more items, some Red Dead Redemption, more Borderlands, and, of course, the NBA games.
4947000	4956000	And they, this isn't new news for Bioshock, even after the, whoo, completely forgot his name, after, like, the series, the series developer, the series creator.
4956000	4957000	Ken Levine?
4957000	4966000	Yeah, when Ken Levine was retasked, they said that Bioshock wasn't done, it's just not something that he's going to be continuing to spearhead anymore.
4966000	4975000	What that means isn't so much of a surprise, but, obviously, this is quite good news for the rest of the series to continue on their universes, continue on their story.
4975000	4986000	Alright. Well, I mean, a lot of this, I mean, I'm not really surprised to hear any of this, but it's nice to have the official confirmation, especially in the Department of Red Dead Redemption.
4986000	4992000	Because I know we've had some rumors on that, and so it's really neat to kind of see that really gaining steam.
4992000	4995000	So, alright, moving on, Loki.
4996000	5005000	Alright. So, this is pretty cool. But, apparently, I don't know.
5005000	5012000	Apparently, there's going to be some more games announced this year, because some of the major ones that they announced at E3 last year have been delayed to 2015.
5012000	5020000	So, the Order 1886 was something that, actually, they had an event recently where they had shown off quite a bit of gameplay for it.
5020000	5024000	It is now expected to be coming out early 2015.
5024000	5034000	So, that kind of sucks on the PlayStation 4, but, equally so, Quantum Break is going to be coming out in 2015 as well.
5034000	5038000	And, apparently, they're going to reveal that at Gamescom.
5038000	5042000	So, we're, I don't know.
5042000	5046000	So, that means that there's got to be something coming out in the fourth quarter.
5046000	5056000	Because, right now, at least on the Xbox side, Halo and Quantum Break are now next year, and the Order is next year.
5056000	5061000	So, what's fourth quarter? I don't know.
5061000	5065000	We know that maybe there's another Forza Horizon game coming, so maybe that.
5065000	5068000	But, aside from that, I don't know.
5068000	5074000	There could be surprises. I think there's surprises still in the back pocket. There usually is at E3.
5074000	5076000	There'll be some type of surprise. It's like, this is this year.
5076000	5079000	Well, we had the rumble a couple weeks ago when we had the show.
5079000	5086000	I know the Halo rumors were spinning really big about the Xbox One might have this Halo collection, which could sway me.
5086000	5091000	I mean, honestly, Quantum Break was what I was waiting for to get the Xbox One.
5091000	5094000	So, hearing that it's 2015 is making me kind of make a...
5094000	5097000	Sunset Overdrive looks pretty good. That's supposed to be coming out this year.
5097000	5104000	Forza Horizon 2 would sure sweeten the pot over there. That's probably a game that would make me finally take the plunge, too.
5104000	5108000	But, yeah, I don't know. It'd be interesting.
5108000	5114000	Of course, I'm disappointed to hear about the Order going to 2015, but especially after seeing some of the previews in the past week.
5114000	5119000	I know that was the week we were off, but they did a pretty extensive preview of the Order that showed what the game looked like, and it looks hot.
5119000	5124000	It's a neat look, and I'm not even really good at those type of shooter games, but why not?
5124000	5134000	But, considering the way the Order looked last year at E3, I kind of always in my mind thought, this game is way out.
5134000	5137000	This is one of those way out games.
5137000	5145000	It was never something I was really anticipating in 2014, so I'm actually not as disappointed to hear about that.
5145000	5150000	I didn't realize that was such a huge thing for people this year. I always thought it was next year.
5150000	5154000	I wasn't that excited about it when they showed it. I was like, eh, it's alright.
5154000	5160000	I'm not a super huge fan of steampunk. I think it's cool, but it's not going to get me the bi game.
5160000	5168000	I still wonder if Sony isn't going to come out and say, hey, remember The Last Guardian? PlayStation 4 and this year?
5168000	5177000	That's kind of the sleeping giant that Sony's got. That could be it.
5177000	5182000	Also, you know another thing that's surprising? LittleBigPlanet? Where'd that go?
5182000	5187000	I know Media Molecules moved on to other things, but I can't imagine Sony's let that franchise go.
5187000	5191000	Somebody else did the Vita version, and the Vita version came out fine.
5191000	5196000	So I imagine somebody's developing LittleBigPlanet on PlayStation 4, and we haven't seen anything on that.
5196000	5202000	So that could be another little surprise holiday title. That seems very likely.
5202000	5207000	Since we're going to go down this path here, because they've had different LittleBigPlanet-type games and stuff.
5207000	5214000	Wouldn't it be kind of cool? A LittleBigPlanet-type game crossed with Animal Crossing or something?
5214000	5221000	Where you build up your own town, literally build it up out of stuff. That'd be pretty cool.
5221000	5227000	You'd be able to share that kind of environment and build your own theme, park rides or something like that.
5227000	5235000	LittleBigPlanet Cardio was pretty cool, and that was done by a completely different developer.
5235000	5237000	I'd be interested to see anything.
5237000	5243000	Dungeonbuster in our chat says, I'm not holding my breath for Last Guardian. If it arrives, it arrives.
5243000	5250000	And our pal Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm all over an Xbox One Forza Horizon. All over in Act F degrees.
5250000	5254000	If that gets announced for Xbox One, I'll be getting one. And Forza 5 as well.
5254000	5258000	See, I'm not as big on the main Forza series, because those are the types of racers I'm really not good at.
5258000	5263000	Same thing with Gran Turismo. I'm really shitty at those games.
5263000	5270000	I don't really have as interested in them as I do the Burnouts, the Mario Karts, the Forza Horizons, the more arcadey-style games.
5270000	5272000	Oh man, a new Burnout game.
5272000	5274000	Yeah, where'd that go?
5274000	5277000	Criterion's now making fucking terrible Need for Speed games.
5277000	5281000	What? They're not making one this year. There's no Need for Speed this year.
5281000	5287000	Crossing my fingers that the reason there is no Need for Speed this year is because they're making a Burnout game.
5287000	5289000	Oh god, I hope so.
5289000	5295000	Blender's in chat pointing out that LittleBigPlanet 2 is still putting out DLC.
5295000	5302000	And where the fuck is the free-to-play LittleBigPlanet game that they were supposed to have?
5302000	5304000	Oh, I forgot that that was supposed to be a thing.
5304000	5306000	Yeah, exactly. Everybody did. Where the fuck is it?
5306000	5313000	Loki. Maybe it's PlayStation 4 now. There's other free-to-play stuff on PlayStation 4. Who knows?
5313000	5316000	But seriously, a new Burnout game, I would be all over it.
5316000	5324000	Well, here's the good news. In literally one week and one day, we'll know.
5324000	5326000	I'll be watching all those conferences, but yeah.
5326000	5331000	We'll know. Here's the crazy thing too. I don't even know if I told you guys. You might be finding this out for the first time.
5331000	5334000	Bobby and I are fortunate enough. We are going to Sony's conference.
5334000	5335000	Yeah, I already knew that.
5335000	5340000	I'm excited. It's fun. I've actually never been to one of the big press conferences. This is the first year I'm going to one.
5340000	5341000	So this will be a lot of fun.
5344000	5349000	Anyway, but here's the thing. Here's my question. What can I do for you guys at the conference?
5349000	5355000	Because y'all are going to be watching it, so I'd be an idiot to say like,
5355000	5360000	Oh, I'll be sure to break all the news for you guys. Like, come on. You're all going to be watching it.
5360000	5362000	You're all going to know. You all have an internet.
5362000	5366000	It's all part of E3. It's going to roll into the coverage that you were already planning on anyway.
5366000	5370000	I will try to keep my eyes and ears open, like around, and see what else.
5370000	5375000	Especially like what types of promo things might they have there, and what they seem to be pushing.
5375000	5378000	In a really quiet moment where they're announcing something that's really kind of ho-hum, you've got to yell,
5378000	5379000	WOOOO!
5381000	5382000	And we'll know.
5382000	5387000	I'm not going to promise anything because I'd like to be invited back in the future, but...
5387000	5389000	But they would invite back because of your enthusiasm.
5389000	5394000	I mean, if boring shit like that is getting you that hyped up, they're going to watch you there every year.
5394000	5397000	We'll see. We'll see.
5397000	5399000	This year it's coming out white. WOOOO! White!
5399000	5404000	No, I love the sentiment, guys. ActDeaf says, yell VOG RULES.
5404000	5410000	I appreciate the sentiment, but again, I'd like to be asked back in a future year, so that's one way to not get asked back.
5410000	5417000	So, yeah. Anyway, I doubt they have many mics on that portion of the audience anyway.
5418000	5421000	Alright, moving on, Jason.
5422000	5429000	As everyone heard, I expect that was following this game even remotely, Amplitude's Kickstarter succeeded.
5429000	5434000	Their original goal of 750,000 in an 18-day span was finished.
5434000	5441000	Harmonix did a lot of live broadcasting. Telethon style was their claim.
5441000	5444000	I missed all of it for some reason. Apparently I was really busy.
5444000	5446000	I kind of don't remember why, to be honest.
5446000	5454000	But they did a lot of really fun, engaging community stuff in the lead up to the end of the Kickstarter, and they pulled it out.
5454000	5459000	They exceeded it by about 100,000 when it all winds down, which is great.
5459000	5465000	I don't think that covered any of the stretch goals, but the game is funded and they're going to do their damnedest.
5465000	5469000	This is good news considering what the two weeks lead up was.
5469000	5481000	It is not all good news. Within a week, I believe, of that even closing, one of the first backer updates was talking about the fact that Harmonix is laying off 37 members of staff.
5481000	5490000	A spokesperson says, Harmonix is in the process of restructuring our organization to bring it into alignment with our current and future product development plans.
5490000	5494000	Unfortunately, this means making the difficult decision to reduce the number of full-time staff.
5494000	5497000	We sincerely appreciate the work of each and every one of these employees.
5497000	5503000	Harmonix is working to ensure that those affected are well taken care of as we make this change.
5503000	5510000	And that these changes will not affect their current plans for Amplitude and Disney Fantasia Music Evolved.
5510000	5514000	I am very opinionated on this right now.
5514000	5523000	So the first thing that you keep in mind is that Harmonix, any company, does not discuss personal specifics.
5524000	5528000	They use the time full-time jobs, which usually means that it should have been core staff.
5528000	5532000	But you know what also wound down when Amplitude finished?
5532000	5534000	Chroma.
5534000	5537000	They don't need system administrators to run their servers.
5537000	5540000	They don't need as much engineering effort to fix issues.
5540000	5545000	They don't need creative designers to add new content to the game as quickly as when the game was running.
5545000	5547000	This is not like...
5547000	5550000	The way that I see this, the way that I see these layoffs, is that...
5550000	5552000	Can you back up a minute? What the fuck happened to Chroma?
5552000	5554000	Because Chroma was...
5554000	5558000	It was Alpha. It was in Beta. It was not supposed to just be playable until the release.
5558000	5559000	Right.
5559000	5564000	They've got the information that they want. They are going to refine the game and go to step B.
5564000	5565000	Huh.
5565000	5568000	It was a limited public demo of which they've never done before.
5568000	5572000	A lot of people were thinking this would lead to Beta leads to full release.
5572000	5573000	And they broke the mold.
5573000	5574000	That's weird.
5574000	5577000	Which is good because that game has a lot of edges that need to be filled out.
5577000	5579000	And I'm looking forward to them being able to do that.
5579000	5582000	So I saw this announcement, and it sucked.
5582000	5586000	As we always say, nobody wants to hear about lost jobs. Period.
5586000	5591000	There was a lot of really weird stuff about people that were equally as snarky about the Kickstarter.
5591000	5595000	How about you use some of that $800,000 and help the people that lost their job?
5595000	5596000	They did.
5596000	5598000	Yeah, I mean...
5598000	5604000	I wouldn't call myself a snarky person about the Kickstarter, but I presented my reasons and everything.
5604000	5609000	The really scary kind of element here is that that whole Kickstarter...
5609000	5616000	I mean, literally, it's very obvious now, was literally a last-ditch effort by this company to save jobs.
5616000	5619000	Because now you see why it was that 18-day window.
5619000	5626000	Which even I was one of those people that was like, you're shooting yourself in the foot by giving yourself only 18 days.
5626000	5634000	Well, somebody up above knew, come the end of May, I'm gonna have to lose 65 people or something like that.
5634000	5643000	Unless I can raise three-quarters of a million dollars, like literally pull this money out of my ass to save at least half the jobs.
5643000	5647000	How can I pull money out of my ass? Let's go to Kickstarter!
5647000	5653000	But it's true. This number invariably would have been bigger had Kickstarter not finished.
5653000	5655000	There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever.
5655000	5662000	And they did what they could to secure the workforce that they need to be able to complete their jobs.
5662000	5665000	To complete the game, rather, and fulfill their jobs.
5665000	5674000	I think that had they made stretch goals, they would have been able to keep another five people, maybe.
5674000	5682000	I think the $1 million tier was simultaneous multiplayer, where right now the game is only anticipated on being offline.
5682000	5684000	Offline local multiplayer.
5684000	5691000	But they don't necessarily need everybody's specialties, or they just don't need that extra engineering effort.
5691000	5699000	So, some people that may have been a part of this project, ultimately, invariably, ultimately, in theory, got let down at the conclusion of it.
5699000	5704000	But I have to think that number has shrunk by at least a dozen, if not more.
5704000	5713000	You know what's really interesting, though, is that if some of those stretch goals had been hit, probably with each stretch goal they hit, that would have been like two, three more jobs it would have saved.
5713000	5718000	But it was, this was going to happen, everybody knew about it, as you just said.
5718000	5727000	That time window was, one, it was a great period of time to let those people be able to find other things, other places to go, other things to do.
5727000	5730000	And then they rescued, they held onto as many of them as they could.
5730000	5741000	I gotta say, you all know how I felt about the Kickstarter, and the industry is the industry the way that it is, it doesn't change my opinion or anything I said a few weeks ago or whatever.
5741000	5749000	But I gotta say, you know, for better or for worse, this is one of the most desperate things I've ever seen a game company do.
5749000	5755000	In the years, in the twelve years we've been doing this show, this is one of the most desperate maneuvers I've ever seen happen.
5755000	5769000	And that's, I mean, it's kind of sad, I wish it wasn't happening to Harmonix, because I do believe overall they make really good stuff, and it just kind of sucks that they're really sometimes at the mercy of a fickle music industry, so to speak.
5770000	5776000	You know, the gaming industry and so forth, but what a desperate move that Kickstarter was now in retrospect.
5776000	5777000	Did you actually wind up backing it?
5777000	5778000	I did not.
5778000	5779000	Loki?
5779000	5780000	Nope.
5780000	5781000	Jamie?
5781000	5783000	I'm not a huge fan of Amplitude.
5783000	5784000	No.
5784000	5785000	I did.
5785000	5798000	I did not until after it passed, which I'm still very mixed about, but as soon as it was obvious that it was gonna hit the home stretch with still a good twenty hours remaining, I threw mine in and I'll be good in the game.
5799000	5812000	You know, and I still stand by everything I said before. I mean, with all this information, it kind of sucks and so forth, but this thing happens in the industry all the time at the same time.
5812000	5824000	You know, and those guys will move on and hopefully be able to get in at another studio, or maybe sometimes these people start new studios, and the ebb and flow will continue of these development cycles.
5824000	5836000	But yeah, again, I personally don't believe in paying for a game a year and a half before it's out with no investor perks. But that's me. Poop on me.
5836000	5840000	No, you are good with your reasoning and you stuck by it.
5840000	5855000	But I'll tell you this. I will abso-frickin'-lutely check this game out when the demo's out there, when some of my backer friends have the game, and if I like it, which I'm 95% sure I will, then I'll buy it when it's out. Why won't I? Absolutely. I love music games.
5855000	5863000	You know, there is actually some more news regarding this that I don't think was in the show role. There's actually been a lot of really good announcements about it.
5864000	5888000	Danny Baranowski is going to be on the soundtrack, the author, the composer of Super Meat Boy soundtrack, and Dungeon Defenders most recently, I think, and a number, Biden of Isaac, and a number of other incredibly noteworthy games in just the last year and a half or two years.
5888000	5903000	And there were a couple of other people, Onomatoguchi and C4118, which is interesting. Did you notice that when they announced that, that was really the start of the upswing of the Kickstarter?
5903000	5911000	But again, I don't think they necessarily had those people signed on the dotted line until they announced it.
5911000	5916000	They couldn't afford to pay them until the game was looking to be solidified.
5916000	5923000	This is all, it's looking more and more like this was literally, they made it up as they went along. I think in some ways.
5923000	5929000	You have to establish the game before you can establish the details. So as soon as they were finally able to do that, the news kept rolling.
5929000	5934000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura has some news about money spending.
5934000	5940000	Well, I mentioned this at the start of the show, but I put money towards the Humble Weekly Bundle.
5940000	5949000	And it's actually a big RPG Maker fest, which I've been wanting to get my hands on some of them, but they were a little too pricey for me.
5950000	5964000	So I have RPG Maker in this, like two of the different builds of RPG Maker, several DLC bundles that have music and graphic assets.
5964000	5973000	You also get Skyborne, Sweet Lily Dreams. There are also a few other homebrew titles thrown in there.
5973000	5982000	It comes also with Deadly Sin 2 and To The Moon, which is a game that I absolutely, absolutely love.
5982000	5994000	So, I say it's worth getting. $6 gets you all of the goodies, and so I put $10 towards it.
5995000	6006000	And right now, they're saying if you pay more than $12, you get everything in there, plus you get DLC bundle number 3 and Legionwood 2, Rise of Eternals Realm.
6006000	6015000	The money's going to, in part, to indicate Foundation and Child's Play. So, it's only Windows right now, but get it. Just do it.
6015000	6022000	Do it and play To The Moon and you'll thank me. I've had parts of that game that made me sob.
6022000	6026000	Yeah. Was To The Moon done in this RPG Maker?
6026000	6027000	I don't recall.
6027000	6029000	Yes. All the games that are part of this are done in the RPG Maker.
6029000	6031000	Wow. I didn't realize that.
6031000	6033000	Yeah, you can publish games with it.
6033000	6039000	I didn't realize it was that powerful. That's amazing. I have played a little bit of To The Moon, but just enough to go through some of the intro sequences.
6039000	6042000	Not to get into any of the emotional parts you guys are talking about.
6042000	6044000	The very beginning of the game is emotional to me.
6044000	6052000	Well, yeah. A little bit. Yeah, a little bit. There's definitely some feels in the very beginning moments of the game, but, you know.
6052000	6059000	And before anyone asks, I've already passed on my bonus To The Moon. I've gifted it to a friend.
6059000	6061000	Fair enough. Fair enough.
6061000	6068000	Because I've already played it. But, if somebody is really nice to me, I might just consider getting it for them.
6068000	6071000	I might pick it up as well.
6071000	6072000	I thought you already had it.
6072000	6074000	I do not have RPG Maker, believe it or not.
6074000	6075000	I meant To The Moon.
6075000	6078000	Oh, no. I have To The Moon. But, I was thinking about picking up this bundle.
6078000	6085000	I thought about doing it, too. But, see, then again, once again, it's distractions. But, it is nice to have stuff that I may use eventually.
6085000	6090000	But, I would really encourage you guys. You know, the one thing. I mean, it's one thing to, you know, give codes away to friends and stuff.
6090000	6094000	But, I've said this before about Humble Bundles. Like, you guys really should just, if you're interested in this, go check it.
6095000	6098000	It's a Humble Bundle. You can pay whatever you want. And, it's all for charity.
6098000	6104000	Like, it's, you know. Don't be too much of a hard-ass like I am with Kickstarter.
6104000	6106000	Go check out the Humble Bundles.
6106000	6110000	Alright. Let us travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6110000	6115000	And, look at some games coming to a, maybe, retail store near you. Maybe not the Humble Store.
6115000	6118000	But, maybe the Humble Store. We'll see. Loki.
6118000	6120000	Let's see. Not a whole ton of stuff coming out of this week.
6120000	6133000	Pretty much just Murdered Soul Suspect, which is out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, and Xbox 360, actually.
6133000	6140000	Then, also, I want to say, I think it's this week. On Friday is the...
6141000	6142000	What was that?
6144000	6146000	I didn't have all this stuff screwed up here.
6146000	6149000	Okay. Anyways. The...
6152000	6156000	No, actually, no. That was it. I'm sorry. Murdered Soul Suspect. That is the game of the week.
6156000	6158000	I would be surprised if it's an awfully slow week.
6158000	6160000	Oh, nope. I'm sorry. There's one that is snuck in here.
6160000	6162000	Damn, Loki. Sorry.
6162000	6167000	I forgot. They added this last minute. Hyperdimension Neptunia PP for Vita.
6167000	6168000	Oh, wow.
6168000	6170000	It's coming out. I mean, they've had it.
6170000	6173000	And then, oh, I guess it was this Friday. I think it was the Friday after.
6173000	6176000	But, apparently, Tomodachi Life on 3DS.
6176000	6177000	Oh, yeah.
6177000	6178000	And Wildstar on PC.
6180000	6185000	Rob, you would know this. What is this Wildstar weekend thing that I've been seeing everybody talk about?
6185000	6191000	I believe the game soft-launched over the weekend. You know, I've got to be honest. It's not an MMO I've been following very closely.
6191000	6193000	I have a lot of friends that have been following it.
6193000	6194000	But, I believe...
6194000	6195000	I hated it.
6195000	6196000	You didn't like it?
6196000	6197000	No.
6197000	6200000	Shane was saying some good things about it. I haven't even really looked at it at all.
6202000	6207000	It was way too cartoony and way too motiony and it just made me feel sick.
6207000	6209000	I didn't like it.
6209000	6212000	See, I hear some people are really into the cartoony look, though.
6212000	6217000	So, just kind of like... I know Sil, who's from Girls Gone Wild here at VoG and has been on Horde House a couple times.
6217000	6219000	She was really into it and I think was doing the launch weekend.
6219000	6221000	So, you know, it just kind of depends what you're into.
6221000	6227000	But, yeah. The game, I believe, had its early launch or whatever happened this weekend.
6227000	6229000	And, of course, the whole thing is...
6229000	6231000	Seen a lot of streamers talking about it.
6231000	6233000	It shit the bed the minute it launched.
6233000	6235000	As these online games tend to do.
6235000	6241000	That does explain why some people were playing it at 4 AM their time when I know that they don't usually play it out late. At least not publicly.
6241000	6243000	Probably the only time they could get on.
6243000	6248000	Just like anything else, when you have enough of an established fan base and everybody has to connect to a central service.
6248000	6250000	Gasp! It falls over.
6250000	6253000	Gasp! But, again, Mario Kart 8 did alright.
6253000	6257000	Alright, moving along. In Japan, let's check out what's happening with the Japanese releases.
6257000	6262000	On the PlayStation 4 this week, Japan's actually getting a bundle that contains FIFA 14.
6262000	6264000	They're getting a little bundle that has that.
6264000	6267000	There's also a bundle that comes with FIFA 14 and the camera.
6267000	6270000	So, you can get all the kit and kaboodle there in Japan this week.
6270000	6275000	As far as games go, though, on the PlayStation 4 this week, the New Order Wolfenstein is out.
6275000	6278000	So, if you want to check that out in Japan, you can.
6278000	6283000	I believe that game had just come out here in this past week or two.
6283000	6290000	In fact, just talking about recent releases, I see in chat that Code Man is asking about Transistor.
6290000	6296000	You know, I missed talking about that game in my gaming week because that's the game I would have talked about had there been a show last week.
6296000	6299000	But I'll just quickly say, I liked it.
6299000	6301000	And I am liking that game.
6301000	6307000	That's a pretty cool little, like, I love how you shift between, like, if you want to do an action-y type of game, you can do that.
6307000	6309000	Or you can hit the button and do a more tactical type of game.
6309000	6312000	Like, I love that. Like, switch back and forth. That's a really neat mechanic.
6312000	6315000	It's like a combination of Parasite-even tactics.
6315000	6319000	Yeah, I'll have to talk more about Transistor at some point later on, maybe at the top of the next segment.
6319000	6322000	But we're running long for now, so let me get back to these releases.
6322000	6328000	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Reign also Wolfenstein The New Order on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
6328000	6332000	On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, yes, there is stuff on the Xbox 360.
6332000	6335000	Because Wolfenstein The New Order is also on the 360.
6335000	6339000	As well as Ken no Machi no Ihujin Shiro no Okyuu comes out.
6339000	6341000	That's the first print edition there.
6341000	6345000	You want to hear a fun fact about Wolfenstein on 360?
6345000	6347000	It's four discs.
6347000	6350000	Thank you, idtech5 or whatever that is.
6350000	6352000	Wow, I didn't realize that.
6352000	6356000	On the PlayStation Vita, Tokaiden comes out this week.
6356000	6359000	That's a price reduction, however. That moves into the best on the Vita.
6359000	6363000	And on the Wii U this week in Japan, nothing.
6363000	6367000	But next week we'll see the release of One Piece Unlimited World.
6367000	6372000	And lastly but not leastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth.
6372000	6376000	That is such a big game, it's getting its own 3DS XL set.
6376000	6379000	Aww, that is a big release on Nintendo 3DS this week.
6379000	6383000	There's also a game called Card Fight Vanguard Lock on Victory.
6384000	6387000	Let's travel to the UK with Dark Sakura.
6387000	6395000	Well, coming out on the 3rd is 1001 Spikes for Mac and PC and WildStar for PC.
6395000	6404000	On the 4th, PlayStation Vita Pets, Tango Fiesta for PC, Ultra Street Fighter IV for PS3 and Xbox 360.
6404000	6410000	On the 6th is Hyperdimension Idol Neptunia PP, Tomodachi Life,
6410000	6414000	Murdered Soul Suspect on Damn Near Everything, and that's it.
6416000	6422000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then Dark Sakura will give us the classic game of the week.
6422000	6424000	But first, Loki.
6424000	6435000	Alright, so you may remember as of recent, they have been doing a lot of tweaks to some of the stuff on Xbox Live and with the Xbox One, that kind of thing.
6435000	6439000	Well, one of the things now they get tweaked is the Games with Gold program.
6439000	6446000	You may remember they were doing two games per month, and you get those for free for your gold number.
6446000	6451000	Plus, you get to basically keep them forever once you have downloaded those.
6451000	6466000	Now, they're going kind of the route of the PlayStation Plus program, where instead of two games per month, now they're going to give away five games, at least in June.
6466000	6476000	Three of those this time are actually going to be on Xbox 360, and then the other two are going to be on Xbox One.
6476000	6482000	So for Xbox One in June, you're getting Max the Curse of Brotherhood and Halo Spartan Assault.
6482000	6490000	And then on 360, Charlie Murder, Dark Souls, and Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition.
6491000	6493000	So those are going to be available.
6493000	6499000	But the difference now, though, is you have to be a member of Xbox Live Gold in order to have access to those games.
6499000	6504000	If you, for whatever reason, let your account lapse, you will not be able to play those anymore.
6504000	6512000	I know people are upset to hear that, but at the same time, that's what Sony's done this whole time, and we were all just waiting for Microsoft to follow suit.
6512000	6514000	They didn't want to give them away. They had to.
6514000	6518000	Well, I'll get into why I think they're doing that in just a second here.
6518000	6522000	PlayStation Plus also having a little bit of a tweak as well.
6522000	6535000	Unlike previous, where the InstaGame collection, they will add a few titles each month, and those will kind of roll on for several months before they finally kind of expire and take them off there.
6535000	6538000	Now they're going to be rotating those through every month.
6538000	6544000	So it's going to be six games every month, two on PlayStation 4, two on PlayStation 3, and two on Vita.
6545000	6555000	And I guess they're saying starting in July, they announced those titles already, I guess, oh, I'm sorry, for June.
6555000	6571000	Okay, so June, they're going to have Trine 2, The Complete Story, Pixel Junk Shooter Ultimate, that's for PlayStation 4, PS3, you get NBA 2K14 and Sly Cooper, Thieves in Time, and Vita, Terraria, and Mutant Mudds Deluxe.
6572000	6581000	So that's pretty cool. And also, I guess Sly Cooper, Thieves in Time is a cross-buy game, so you technically also get that if you play PlayStation 3 as well.
6581000	6593000	The reason why I think they're doing it this way now, not only to get more games in there, it's harder for them to negotiate a game to be free for several months versus just one month.
6594000	6604000	And I think that's why it should be able to get more titles in there. That's why I think Microsoft's had trouble getting decent titles in there because now they're basically saying, oh, you get them for free, forever.
6604000	6618000	Now if they limit it to just one month and have it where it expires and stuff that they're able to negotiate, maybe it'll be cheaper for them to get that free title instead of having to pay for downloads for six months versus a month.
6618000	6619000	That makes sense.
6619000	6621000	At least that's my thought. I don't know.
6621000	6623000	It's perfectly logical.
6624000	6635000	By the way, since you brought up the whole PlayStation Plus thing as well, I want to make sure I brought this up at some point because this came up in the chat room when I was talking about the whole Sony press conference, but for some reason it didn't make our show roll, but this is pretty big news.
6635000	6645000	I don't know if you guys heard, but Sony is actually putting their press conference, not just where you can watch it live on the internet in a tiny little browser window, they're putting it on movie screens.
6645000	6655000	You can actually go to movie theaters. There's certain ones around the country, not all of them, but think of it like one of those Fathom events or something when they do the Metropolitan Opera or something on the big screen.
6655000	6659000	Basically, Sony is taking that type of thing over for a night and presenting their press conference in theaters.
6659000	6666000	I know you can snatch up the tickets online. I imagine a lot of them are already gone, but I thought that was a pretty interesting little way.
6666000	6667000	Is it free?
6667000	6668000	Yeah, totally free.
6668000	6673000	And they're saying that there might even be little giveaways. I imagine there'll probably be some type of Sony representative.
6673000	6677000	They probably have retail reps around the country, so they probably have a representative at each of these showings.
6677000	6680000	Probably just trying to get people jazzed up, talking about Sony.
6680000	6687000	Why not create these mob mentality environments where people are going to get really psyched for these games?
6687000	6699000	I thought it was a pretty clever little idea, and putting a lot of these trailers for high, high definition, high frame rate games on a movie screen is going to be interesting.
6699000	6704000	So it's like going to your friend's house who has the big screen TV only. This is a really big screen TV.
6704000	6708000	Well, hold on a second. You just said something really silly.
6709000	6720000	Yes, the resolution in a movie theater is better, but when projectors stream at 24 frames per second versus our 60 frames per second monitors?
6720000	6724000	True, but is that how fast the high def is?
6724000	6727000	I admittedly don't know if they do things different for live.
6727000	6731000	They don't stream at 60 frames per second from those events.
6731000	6737000	I thought they made a big freaking deal about the whole Lord of the Rings was in this ultra high frame rate.
6737000	6738000	48.
6738000	6742000	But that's still slower than 60 hertz freaking TV.
6742000	6744000	It's still probably going to be better than it'll look over the internet.
6744000	6747000	Not according to what everybody thought of The Hobbit.
6747000	6749000	Let's be real here.
6749000	6756000	Movie theaters are 24. I don't know if they do things differently for non-film studio master, that kind of stuff.
6756000	6758000	But that was just a silly statement.
6758000	6767000	Well, they've tried doing 48 for video game high school last season.
6767000	6770000	Whenever it was in the video game, they doubled the frame rate on it.
6770000	6772000	Actually, the whole thing was shot in 48.
6772000	6785000	The whole thing, they had it in a 48 frames per second format, but they doubled each frame for the 24 portions.
6785000	6791000	But they have actually, I think, built their own player to do that because it wasn't something that you can stream.
6791000	6793000	So I don't think that you're going to really miss anything.
6796000	6801000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, screw.
6801000	6803000	Alright, well let's move on.
6803000	6807000	This is something you might see at the Sony press conference, or you might see it at the Microsoft one.
6807000	6811000	Or, neither one, but it'll probably be on the show floor at E3 somewhere.
6811000	6814000	And that is the rumblings of a new Mortal Kombat game.
6814000	6819000	And thanks to a poster that was spotted on Reddit, there was a whole little thing that says, who's next?
6819000	6824000	And it showed the Mortal Kombat dragon logo and the cracked bones of a spine.
6824000	6830000	And you might remember that the last Mortal Kombat game in 2011 had the whole x-ray maneuvers and things like that.
6830000	6837000	So, you know, that would probably be in character that if there is a Mortal Kombat 2 coming, which is really Mortal Kombat 10?
6837000	6838000	Nine? Ten?
6838000	6839000	Ten.
6839000	6840000	God, I'm losing count.
6840000	6846000	So, wherever they're at, this would probably be a part of it, the whole x-ray thing.
6846000	6850000	This in addition to, by the way, that Ed Boon, who is with NetherRealm Studios, who made the last Mortal Kombat game,
6850000	6854000	who is also a co-creator of the game, has been posting all these cryptic messages on Twitter.
6854000	6860000	So, I think it's a given that we're getting Mortal Kombat, it's just a matter of when they choose to announce it.
6860000	6865000	Although, one of the countdown clocks that he's been running on Twitter ends tomorrow.
6865000	6868000	So, they'll probably be a little bit of that hype leading up to E3.
6868000	6873000	So, looks like that's one of the things you're going to see coming out of E3 is a new Mortal Kombat game.
6873000	6875000	Very curious to see where they go with it.
6875000	6879000	The last Mortal Kombat game was very good, and so I'm excited to see one.
6879000	6887000	I imagine if there is a Mortal Kombat 2, I'm using my quote-y fingers, if there's a Mortal Kombat 2, it's going to be on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.
6887000	6892000	It's going to look, you know, even better, and it's probably going to have a roster that's pretty impressive.
6892000	6894000	So, I'm very curious to see.
6894000	6896000	And I want to see if Freddy Krueger comes back.
6896000	6898000	So, all right.
6898000	6902000	Anyhow, let's go back to a time when gaming was a little simpler.
6902000	6910000	And you know what, you didn't have a roster of like 40 characters in your fighting game, plus 10 DLC characters featuring Freddy Krueger.
6910000	6913000	You had like 12, and you liked it.
6913000	6916000	It's the classic game of the week.
6917000	6925000	We're going to take a trip down memory lane with Dark Sakura as she explores, in this case it looks like a fighting game, similar to Mortal Kombat, that is a classic.
6925000	6929000	Dark Sakura, dive in the gaming vault and find a game that the kids should be playing this week.
6929000	6933000	The game I picked this week is Galaxy Fight Universal Warriors.
6933000	6936000	I don't know if anyone's ever remembered Galaxy Fight.
6936000	6938000	It was kind of an interesting game.
6938000	6942000	It was done by Sunsoft for the Neo Geo MVS.
6942000	6951000	It was their second fighting game that came out after the Super Famicom spinoff of the Heberike series, the Sugoi Heberike.
6952000	6957000	And this one is their first sideways 2D fighting game.
6959000	6964000	They also did another fighting game after this called Waku Waku 7. Do you remember that?
6964000	6966000	That might sound more familiar?
6966000	6969000	No. You know what's funny is I think I've actually seen this one.
6971000	6979000	After that in 1998, they worked with a company called Santa Claus to do Astro Superstars, another fighting game.
6979000	6983000	But Galaxy Fight was just a really interesting fighting game.
6983000	6987000	It sort of serves as a prequel to Waku Waku 7.
6987000	6994000	They use the same engine and they have a few things in common, including their mid-boss bonus-kun.
6994000	7006000	You play as one of eight characters and you go throughout the solar system to defeat opponents that inhabit each of the planets before fighting Theldin to settle their score.
7006000	7010000	It's a four-button layout. Of course, it's a Neo Geo game.
7010000	7015000	The first three are used for striking attacks and the fourth is a taunt.
7015000	7019000	But using the buttons together, of course, they're special moves.
7021000	7030000	It doesn't have anything extra, including new Superbars or anything, as other games that came out around that time had Superbars.
7030000	7036000	This is pretty much an old-school fighting game, just one of the last old-school fighting games for the Neo Geo.
7036000	7041000	You have all kinds of different characters. You have your bruisers, you have your quick ones.
7041000	7050000	The names are Alvin, you have Bonus-kun, who I just mentioned, who's actually a parody of you from Street Fighter.
7050000	7069000	Gunder, you have Theldin, I think it's Jidan, Juri, Kazuma, Musafar, who is a robot, Rolf, Rumi, Ro, and Yakopu, who is a pet rabbit.
7069000	7076000	So yeah, it did come out on the AES home console system. It also did have a Neo Geo CD version.
7076000	7081000	There was arranged music for the AES version, too, though that was pretty cool.
7081000	7087000	It was ported to the Sega Saturn. It came out on PlayStation only in Japan.
7087000	7099000	In 2008, the Neo Geo CD version of Galaxy Fight was included with Waku Waku 7 in the Neo Geo Online collection that came out on PS2.
7099000	7108000	There were all kinds of different versions that came out. And now, Galaxy Fight.
7108000	7117000	I laughed at this girl, Rumi, her little victory pose. She looks like she's wearing these gigantic mitts.
7117000	7123000	She just did a big victory pose where she puts one hand in the air and the other hand in the air, and then her boobs are way too big and they jiggle.
7123000	7126000	It's that typical 90s fighting game girl thing.
7127000	7136000	At any rate, the AES version of this was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on March 23, 2010.
7139000	7145000	The soundtrack was released by Pony Canyon on March 17, 1995.
7145000	7150000	It has all the background music, sound effects, and voice samples from the arcade version.
7150000	7160000	Music was composed by Masato Arakawa and Takuya Sasaki, and performed by Jun Kojimae.
7160000	7163000	So, there you go.
7163000	7168000	Galaxy Fight. It's a weird game. With boobs.
7168000	7169000	With boobs, for sure.
7169000	7170000	And playing as a rabbit.
7170000	7175000	I like these cute little characters in the background who bounce up and down.
7175000	7177000	It's kind of old school, though, isn't it?
7177000	7182000	It is. It's a very, you know, neo-geo fighting game. That's all you have to say. It's a neo-geo fighting game.
7182000	7189000	It is. And I'm not going to say there's anything super special about it, you know, but it's a fun little fighting game.
7189000	7191000	Well, then isn't that what games are supposed to be?
7191000	7193000	Yeah, I guess.
7193000	7194000	Alright.
7194000	7197000	Ew! God, what the hell are you making me look at, chat room?
7197000	7198000	What did they do?
7198000	7200000	Flamin' Hot Cheetos Burrito?
7200000	7202000	Oh, lord. Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.
7202000	7204000	Act up. That is gross. Stop it.
7204000	7209000	Your classic game of the week. Less gross. Galaxy fight on the neo-geo.
7209000	7214000	Alright, wow. This is a long show tonight. I guess we just broke two hours for part A.
7214000	7217000	We have to make up for lost time from last week, don't we, kids?
7217000	7220000	So, anyway, we will be right back. We're going to take a quick break.
7220000	7226000	And when we come back, there's rapid-fire news, the FUGO Question of the Week, and plenty more show right after this quick break
7226000	7229000	when we're back with more of Orange Lawn's radio.
7235000	7245000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this June 1st, 2014, with the 554th episode of our show.
7245000	7251000	I hope you guys will also come back next week, because next week, of course, June 8th, will be 555.
7251000	7257000	Or, as Dark Soccer, I believe, called it a couple weeks ago, the Previl show, because it's 555.
7257000	7261000	So, we'll be having that, but that is actually our pre-E3 show.
7261000	7267000	And, you know, every pre-E3, we've got to bring back Listless to do our official E3 predictions.
7267000	7270000	So, count on that for next week. You're going to be here, right, Jason?
7270000	7271000	Yeah, absolutely.
7271000	7272000	Good. We'll have a...
7272000	7277000	There are certain occasions where I will make YouTube videos fancy again.
7277000	7279000	Listless is going to be one of them.
7279000	7285000	We haven't been doing the OLR Games as much lately. There's just been a lot of other news and other things to clearly fill time.
7285000	7290000	We're way over time tonight, and I've got to keep things moving here, but Listless is always a good one to bring back.
7290000	7294000	We had to do Match Game again eventually, too, and come up with some new OLR Games.
7294000	7298000	What was the last time we played Beat the Host? That was like 200 episodes ago, probably.
7298000	7300000	That's a side show game.
7300000	7305000	I think it started there. Well, actually, a lot of people don't know this.
7305000	7311000	Listless actually started on, well, to be fair, it was actually ripped off another TV show.
7311000	7320000	But we started doing it on my college radio show back in 90... God, what year would that have been?
7320000	7323000	About 97, 98, when we were doing it. That's when Listless was born.
7323000	7329000	Let me put it this way, Jason. Do you know who came up with the name Listless? My ex-girlfriend.
7329000	7334000	That says a lot.
7334000	7338000	Is Jason... Oh, no, Jason's muted. I'm sorry, Jason.
7339000	7342000	Well, they missed my reveal, but that's okay. I haven't said anything meaningful.
7342000	7346000	Oh, no, I did. I was just going to say that, fret not, people who keep up with YouTube,
7346000	7351000	there are certain occasions where I will put work into having everything visualized,
7351000	7354000	and Listless is going to be a big one, because it is very, very notable.
7354000	7358000	Sorry for the dead area, guys. You've got to enjoy live radio.
7358000	7359000	Womp womp.
7359000	7363000	Yeah, my mixing board over here is kind of crappy, because one of the ports I don't think really works,
7363000	7369000	so I have to kind of do things in a jig-jag pattern, and if I mess it up, then somebody's mic doesn't get turned on.
7369000	7373000	I've done it to Jamie. I've done it to Jason. I hate it, so...
7373000	7374000	Rude.
7374000	7375000	Sorry, didn't mean to do that.
7375000	7376000	Rude.
7376000	7381000	So, yeah, where was I anyway? Oh, yes, I was talking about my ex-girlfriend was the one that came up with the name Listless,
7381000	7385000	and we're actually still good friends today. She does Rocky Horror stuff like I do.
7385000	7388000	She does it all in the Bay Area. She's also the one that got me into that.
7388000	7395000	So, yeah, it's just funny, but that's how old that whole segment is, so we'll be playing that again next week, something to look forward to.
7395000	7403000	All right, let us get into some rapid-fire news. We've still got plenty of show to go, so let's get to it. Loki.
7403000	7411000	All right, so, let's see, starting off here, we've got ARMA 3. Now, this is kind of funny.
7411000	7415000	They had a little bit of, like, I don't know if this was back from April Fools. Oh, it was April Fools.
7415000	7422000	I do remember seeing this now because they did a parody of that Jean-Claude Van Damme, you know, the split video thing.
7422000	7430000	But ARMA Carts is now real DLC, so now they have kart racing in ARMA 3, so you can check that out if you want.
7430000	7437000	It's at $1.99 for that expansion, and they have, I guess, a number of track objectives and checkpoint races.
7437000	7444000	And then, of course, I guess they're saying that they're going to launch a major gameplay expansion for ARMA by late 2015.
7444000	7456000	And as of right now, they have sold one million copies to date, so not bad. Kind of interesting to check out kart racing.
7456000	7466000	I'm kind of excited about this. You know, I've talked a lot about Goat Simulator, but they're doing their big 1.1 patch, which is coming on June 3rd.
7466000	7473000	Now, it's not just a patch for the game. They add a ton of stuff to this. They have a brand new map in the game.
7473000	7480000	They've got a bunch of new goats in there as well. Split-screen multiplayer for up to four people. Goat Parkour.
7480000	7490000	And they even have, what they're teasing now, is a Minecraft-like goat that allows you to build grass blocks by the looks of it.
7490000	7496000	So that's going to be in there as well, and it's just going to be one glitchy, fun game.
7496000	7503000	The best part about it? It's free. It's a free patch. So you'll be getting all that content starting June 3rd.
7503000	7510000	And last but not least, Watch Dogs. They've broken Ubisoft's day one sales record.
7510000	7516000	Definitely a lot of people were waiting for the game. In fact, several months, because it was supposed to be out in November.
7517000	7523000	12.5 million copies within the first five months of release was the original record.
7523000	7531000	That was held by Assassin's Creed 3. Apparently, though, Watch Dogs did say what they actually sold.
7531000	7537000	No, it hasn't said what they've sold exactly, but it sold more copies than Assassin's Creed 3.
7539000	7544000	Well, I guess we'll just have to wait for the NPD numbers to get the actual number of copies sold.
7544000	7550000	Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see if it keeps momentum, too, because it definitely seemed like a lot of people were really excited about Watch Dogs.
7550000	7554000	And then, you know, obviously Mario Kart 8 has been dominating the conversation over the weekend.
7554000	7558000	But now that those games will both be out, it'll be interesting to see kind of that longevity factor.
7558000	7561000	Because the Watch Dogs reviews seem to be a little tepid to me.
7561000	7566000	Seems like there was a lot more hype behind that game than where people actually ended up kind of feeling about it.
7566000	7570000	I have a feeling there's going to be, granted, a lot of 5 DLC announcements probably at E3.
7570000	7571000	Yeah.
7571000	7580000	Because they've been prepping a major story DLC in there. I mean, they're slowly adding things in each patch to kind of prep it for the new stuff.
7580000	7582000	Things have been kind of quiet on the Grand Theft Auto front.
7582000	7588000	So, I think we're going to see a lot from that. Although, that might put a little bit of a damper there.
7588000	7594000	But, again, not to say that Ubisoft doesn't have any DLC plans. They have a season passing available for Watch Dogs.
7595000	7602000	Pre-summer is a good time to release a game because there's not a whole ton coming out during the summer.
7602000	7604000	Jason, what do you have for us?
7604000	7612000	A bunch of quick, fun little things as the reason why we call this rapid fire news.
7612000	7613000	Rapid fire news?
7613000	7616000	Yeah, that's the second time my brain decided to just stop. That's wonderful.
7616000	7619000	You could just make a name up and we'd probably believe you.
7620000	7623000	I was thinking lightning something? Shit.
7623000	7627000	If you said quick fire news, I'd probably look at you funny, but I'd be like, okay, just roll with it.
7627000	7631000	I also usually don't do this segment, so that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.
7631000	7637000	Anyways, NES Remix 2. Some individuals are not able to actually unlock all of the titles in the game.
7637000	7643000	The remix producer Hayashida posted an entry to Miiverse in practically every language, too.
7643000	7650000	That was denoting that there is a secret code to unlock all the titles you have not yet or if you just want to do it from the start.
7650000	7653000	The hint is star, test, clear.
7653000	7661000	And if you're not going to look at the comments and just look it up, the secret is it is an anagram for start, select, R, A.
7661000	7665000	Start the game, hold start, select, R, press A.
7665000	7672000	Boom. Game starts, you have all the titles unlocked and you can go crazy with playing the rest of the challenges involved in each of them.
7672000	7681000	Capcom, quite notably, finally disbanded Mega Man Legends 3 and there's a bit of hemming and hawing about whether or not that game is actually going to happen.
7681000	7684000	The producer wants it to, but well, he's not with Capcom anymore.
7684000	7699000	So when Capcom fails, fans unite and a team of people under the name of Jisaku-3 has the goal of creating a prototype version of Mega Man Legends 3 in Unity.
7699000	7710000	It is being based off the media that has been released in footage so far and there is a video available out there looking for Mega Man Legends 3 Unity prototype.
7710000	7721000	They're going to give it a shot and we'll see what the internet bicker fest holds to see should this actually come to fruition and the team of people being capable enough to actually create something.
7721000	7724000	Snark aside, this sounds like a really fun thing.
7724000	7732000	I did not get very far in Legends 2. Legends 1 I absolutely adored. I would love to see the series continue in some way.
7732000	7738000	There is a lot of fun, friendliness, mechanics, that kind of stuff in this game that I would like to see again.
7738000	7748000	Last but not least, a museum in New Mexico has identified 700 copies of all of the copies of E.T. that were unearthed last month.
7748000	7750000	It was already a month ago, Jesus Christ.
7750000	7758000	As of the dig last month, 700 copies have been identified as capable of being sold.
7758000	7768000	They are going to be appraised and handed over to a museum for curation, displaying, and selling because they are now artifacts.
7768000	7776000	Artifacts of a day gone by and urban legends aplenty and everything that was talked about in the lead up to that movie.
7776000	7778000	Exactly.
7778000	7782000	I can't help but think, how much is one of these really worth?
7782000	7784000	No prices announced yet.
7784000	7790000	Yes, I realize they have 700 or whatever, but you know there's thousands more still in the ground.
7790000	7792000	You're essentially buying garbage.
7792000	7794000	Thank you, you are buying garbage.
7794000	7802000	But they will be appraised, they will be invariably cleaned up superficially, just ground dirt.
7802000	7805000	Great, so you're going to get garbage that isn't garbage anymore.
7805000	7807000	With a certificate of authenticity.
7807000	7809000	More garbage.
7809000	7811000	We authenticate this garbage as garbage.
7811000	7817000	That's what artifacts are though. You're buying into a memory.
7817000	7819000	You're buying into a story.
7819000	7821000	Why would you buy into a memory of terrible?
7821000	7825000	I remember this game being shit.
7825000	7827000	I bought it, it's shit.
7827000	7831000	And it sat with shit for 20 years.
7831000	7835000	Oh my god, I'm sorry. People will buy it.
7835000	7840000	Well if there's less snark from you guys, then they will be available.
7840000	7844000	There's a part of me that's like, maybe for 20 bucks I'd do it.
7844000	7846000	Good luck.
7846000	7848000	20 bucks buys you one of the ones they couldn't restore.
7848000	7852000	20 bucks buys me the dog shit that it sat next to.
7852000	7855000	It actually probably buys you 20 of them that they wouldn't be willing to sell.
7855000	7859000	Probably more like 200 if that, probably even more, we'll see.
7860000	7862000	Alright, DarkSaga.
7862000	7864000	Oh yeah, stuff.
7864000	7866000	Yes. Not just garbage.
7866000	7872000	Well, Mario Kart 8 is going to be bringing some DLC in Japan at any rate.
7872000	7876000	They've got apparently a deal with Mercedes.
7876000	7881000	So Mario will be driving around a teeny little Mercedes kart.
7881000	7884000	Yeah, whatever.
7884000	7889000	Hey, I'm excited that DLC is going to be a thing for this Mario Kart.
7889000	7894000	Even if, whatever, free Mercedes kart, I'm hoping this means tracks.
7894000	7899000	Yes? Tracks? Tracks? Nintendo? Tracks? Hello? Tracks? Anybody? Tracks?
7899000	7901000	Maybe.
7901000	7903000	Alright, tracks.
7903000	7905000	Wasn't that a bad game or something?
7905000	7909000	Actual battle mode tracks and not shit? Just saying.
7909000	7911000	An ET track?
7911000	7918000	Battle mode on the Nintendo 64? I think the Wii U is more powerful than the Nintendo 64.
7918000	7921000	Alright, we can sit here and bitch all night. Sorry, JB.
7921000	7928000	At any rate, there is going to be a Famicom game coming out to the west.
7928000	7936000	Finally, it will be on, actually, the European 3DS virtual console on May 29th.
7936000	7941000	I don't see anything on a US date for this, but it's the mysterious Muramase Castle.
7941000	7947000	It's the game that Nintendo Land's attraction, Takamaru's Ninja Castle, is based off of.
7947000	7957000	But it will be coming out for 4.49 in pounds for 4.99 euro.
7957000	7965000	And then, last but not least, as soon as it loads,
7965000	7969000	we can say goodbye to Mythic Entertainment.
7969000	7971000	Depressing.
7971000	7973000	Quite. The article still won't load, sorry.
7973000	7975000	That's alright.
7975000	7977000	That's pretty much all there is to say.
7977000	7982000	EA closes yet another studio, and these are the guys that brought you Dark Ages of Camelot,
7982000	7987000	and Warhammer Online, which I understand was not the big success they wanted it to be,
7987000	7992000	but EA fucks up another studio, I thought.
7992000	7994000	Good job. Thumbs up.
7994000	7996000	That's my reaction.
7996000	7998000	Yeah.
7998000	8004000	Well, I mean, to be fair, though, Mythic didn't have a grand slam in their last couple releases,
8004000	8008000	but there's a lot of fans of the Camelot game that was very upset, which I can understand.
8008000	8012000	So, sorry to hear it, to those that work there.
8012000	8014000	Alright, let's go to the Fookle Question of the Week.
8014000	8018000	In happier news, we talk to you guys every week in a statement we call the Fookle Question of the Week.
8018000	8023000	You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam it together, and you get one hell of a social network.
8023000	8030000	It's very uncomfortable.
8030000	8033000	Here's what we asked the Fooklers this week.
8033000	8035000	That's my new name, the Fooklers.
8035000	8039000	Meet the Fooklers, starring Neil Patrick Harris.
8039000	8043000	We are back this week after a week off, and did you hear?
8043000	8047000	There's some nice sales on RPG Maker on the Humble Bundle and Steam this week.
8047000	8052000	I forgot to mention, the Steam weekend sale was RPG Maker 4, so they kind of got in on this, too.
8053000	8061000	Between that and Loki's talk about game building and my stories about the love of ZZT, an early game maker game,
8061000	8063000	this question is all about creation.
8063000	8065000	Have you ever created a game, be it big or small?
8065000	8067000	What was it about and what inspired you to do it?
8067000	8073000	So, when we talk about game making, we sadly don't have a lot of answers, but we'll read what we got.
8073000	8078000	Now, Jonko, one of our buddies from Koopa Club, answered the question.
8078000	8081000	I don't know if this is a game he actually made, or if he thought this question was,
8081000	8084000	what is a game you'd like to see made, but we'll roll with it.
8084000	8086000	We'll just pretend Jonko made this game in his head.
8086000	8090000	He said, well, we already have first person shooters and third person shooters,
8090000	8092000	but what about a second person shooter?
8092000	8096000	You play as a blind assassin who has the power to possess the eyesight of others.
8096000	8099000	Your objective is to possess the eyesight of your enemy,
8099000	8102000	and then hunt down and kill that person while seeing from their perspective.
8102000	8106000	Or would a second person shooter just be a game about shooting yourself in the head?
8106000	8109000	Damn, Atlus already beat me to that one with Persona 3.
8109000	8111000	I feel like that is a game.
8111000	8120000	There was a game that consisted of, you had sight into zombie creatures or something of the sort,
8120000	8124000	and you could look into their eyes and figure out where the safe path is,
8124000	8128000	what they can and can't see based off your route.
8128000	8131000	I don't suppose it sounds familiar to anyone.
8131000	8134000	It was on the PlayStation 2, I remember, but for the life of me, I can't think of the other game.
8134000	8136000	I'm sure the chat will jump. That's why I love having a live chat room,
8136000	8138000	because they think of that stuff when we don't.
8138000	8143000	Japanese, 1400s, classic Japanese kind of game.
8143000	8145000	It was in that sort of mythos.
8145000	8148000	Kaijuta says, call it Eye of the Beholder.
8148000	8149000	Already exists.
8149000	8150000	Does it? Wow.
8150000	8151000	Yeah.
8151000	8153000	It's a D&D license.
8153000	8156000	Oh, yeah. It was also a movie, I think, with Ashley Judd,
8156000	8158000	which I'm sure the two have nothing in common.
8160000	8162000	But they should. Ashley Judd's kind of awesome.
8162000	8165000	What was the PS3? Eye of Judgment, never mind.
8167000	8169000	MXC says Siren.
8169000	8170000	Joosten says Geist.
8170000	8172000	Bonds006 says Geist.
8172000	8174000	Geist sounds familiar.
8174000	8175000	Yeah, it does.
8175000	8176000	It does.
8176000	8177000	I think that's it.
8177000	8179000	I know of Siren, but I don't think that's it.
8179000	8180000	Oh, look it up.
8180000	8181000	Look it up, look it up.
8181000	8182000	To the wiki.
8182000	8184000	Meanwhile, while he looks that up,
8184000	8186000	going to our buddy Rene from Koopa Club,
8186000	8189000	who says, yes, I have, but it was a vampire LARP,
8189000	8190000	or live action roleplay,
8190000	8192000	which has the additional factor of players doing the weirdest
8192000	8194000	and most random shit you could think of,
8194000	8196000	but when people told you how much they enjoyed the game
8196000	8198000	and chasing down a zombie gorilla,
8198000	8200000	it makes it all worthwhile.
8200000	8202000	So your game involved zombie gorillas. Tell me more.
8202000	8203000	I LARPed.
8203000	8206000	Yeah. I never did LARP, but I did D&D.
8206000	8209000	I did vampire LARP, which is the nerdiest of LARPing ever.
8209000	8213000	All those games, roleplaying, be it table, live action, whatever,
8213000	8215000	involved imagination and creating.
8215000	8217000	Dude, I'm still playing D&D on Saturdays.
8217000	8218000	Nice.
8218000	8219000	I had to order more dice.
8220000	8222000	All right. Moving on.
8222000	8225000	Andy R. says, I made some small games in high school.
8225000	8227000	Took a web design course that ended up being pretty much
8227000	8229000	just flash in our biweekly projects.
8229000	8230000	I made a couple of games.
8230000	8232000	Most of them were terrible clones.
8232000	8234000	Sly Red Panda says,
8234000	8238000	I made a Flappy Bird clone with Ornacia from RuPaul's Drag Race.
8239000	8241000	I saw that game on Twitter.
8241000	8245000	Did RuPaul's Drag Race or Vivacious ever see that?
8245000	8248000	You need to do a small update and send it out again, if not.
8248000	8251000	You need to call the game. Mother has arrived.
8252000	8253000	Anyway.
8253000	8255000	I've made some Unreal 3 mods with UDK.
8255000	8257000	Starting to experiment with UE4.
8257000	8260000	Working with RPG Maker VX Ace right now.
8260000	8262000	Twine and Construct 2 are great for beginners.
8263000	8265000	Hitstun says, making games is fun.
8265000	8267000	I come up with game ideas much faster than I build them.
8267000	8271000	I got my start with some crappy TI-83 basic games in high school
8271000	8275000	before moving on to Game Maker 6, HTML5, and Unity 2D.
8275000	8278000	We used Torque Game Builder to make The Adventures of Thong Girl,
8278000	8282000	a 2D platforming beat-em-up with a scantily clad superhero
8282000	8284000	that shoots lasers out of her butt.
8285000	8286000	That's awesome.
8286000	8289000	That's a bit like powdered toast man's premise.
8289000	8297000	Check out that game and my Ludum Dare games at bakamostudios.com.
8297000	8300000	That's baka as in stupid and mo as in moron.
8300000	8303000	We're three stupid morons from Columbus making games.
8303000	8304000	That's awesome.
8307000	8308000	Bravo.
8308000	8309000	Yes, I will check those out.
8310000	8311000	You know what?
8311000	8314000	It's not often I just let people come on this show
8314000	8316000	and hawk whatever it is they're selling,
8316000	8319000	but if you're selling me girls shooting lasers out of their butt
8319000	8323000	from your game studio called Stupid Moron Games,
8323000	8325000	you know what?
8325000	8327000	Props to you mama.
8327000	8330000	All right.
8330000	8334000	Going over to Google Plus where we have a couple answers.
8334000	8335000	I'm sorry.
8335000	8336000	Nothing's going to top that, you guys.
8336000	8338000	All right, DarkTetsuya.
8340000	8341000	Can't wait until I play the game.
8341000	8342000	DarkTetsuya says,
8342000	8346000	I really wanted to get into Unity but ran into hang-ups
8346000	8348000	trying to get the programming code to work.
8348000	8349000	Frowned.
8349000	8351000	Prior to that, I wrote a few games in the games factory.
8351000	8352000	Search on the VoG forums.
8352000	8353000	I made a post about them.
8353000	8354000	Nice plug.
8354000	8356000	Lastly, AJ Twist says,
8356000	8359000	I tried making a fighting game on Flash nearly a decade ago.
8359000	8361000	Hit boxes and life bars are hard,
8361000	8363000	but I did make a card game.
8363000	8365000	Cutting perfectly shaped cards is hard.
8365000	8368000	Inspirations, anime, Tekken, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh,
8368000	8370000	and the love of creating.
8370000	8371000	There you go.
8371000	8374000	That game's getting linked in our chat room right now.
8374000	8376000	You're going to see a spike in downloads this week.
8376000	8377000	Check that out.
8377000	8378000	That's awesome.
8378000	8379000	It looks like MXC was correct.
8379000	8381000	Of the two, Geist was a GameCube name.
8381000	8382000	It didn't sound any bit familiar,
8382000	8384000	but Sirens seems like it matches up.
8384000	8387000	I don't remember playing more than 20 minutes of it,
8387000	8389000	but definitely something I want to revisit.
8389000	8393000	Not game production, but production on a game system.
8393000	8395000	When I was in high school,
8395000	8399000	a friend of mine had a MTV music generator for the PS2,
8399000	8404000	and he actually put together some very interesting songs
8404000	8408000	just kind of mixing the samples and instruments available to you
8408000	8409000	in the game itself.
8409000	8410000	He didn't have...
8410000	8412000	There was some peripheral.
8412000	8414000	I think it was just like a karaoke revolution microphone
8414000	8417000	that you could use to record new stuff and put it in.
8417000	8419000	But he actually did something with it,
8419000	8423000	and I still have the exported songs on my computer
8423000	8426000	in my library to this day, I think.
8426000	8427000	All right, well...
8427000	8429000	I was going to say real quick,
8429000	8433000	I made a couple games back when click and play was a thing.
8433000	8436000	In Windows 3.1, yes.
8436000	8439000	I made a game called Shoot First, Ask Questions Later,
8439000	8442000	and it was basically a game where it was...
8442000	8445000	Like, a shooting game where you shot, like, hedgehogs.
8445000	8448000	Like, there was evil hedgehogs, and it was so stupid.
8448000	8451000	You should have made Shoot First, Ask Questions Later 2
8451000	8452000	as one of your projects.
8452000	8454000	Nah, it's too dumb.
8454000	8455000	Somebody needs to remake Boom.
8455000	8457000	Jamie, have you ever made a game?
8457000	8459000	I guess you did talk about the roleplay.
8459000	8463000	Yeah, I did make an environment in D&D.
8463000	8464000	I mean, that's about it.
8464000	8468000	And I've, you know, created my own written languages.
8468000	8470000	That's about as close as I've gotten.
8470000	8471000	Very cool.
8471000	8473000	I used to make little things in ZZT,
8473000	8475000	but nothing really cool, yeah.
8475000	8478000	All right, well, joining us here, walking into the studio,
8478000	8482000	taking a break from Mario Kart 8 to bless us with his presence.
8482000	8483000	Say hello to Shane.
8483000	8484000	Hi.
8484000	8486000	And Shane wanted to answer the question.
8486000	8487000	Make sure you talk loud.
8487000	8489000	I made DDR, bye.
8489000	8490000	Wait a minute.
8490000	8491000	Wait a minute, Shane.
8491000	8492000	You didn't make DDR.
8492000	8495000	You did not create DDR.
8495000	8499000	Oh, he wanted to rub it in that he helped to make DDR.
8499000	8501000	Yeah, well, where's DDR now?
8501000	8504000	Do you still work for them, Shane?
8504000	8506000	I'm just saying, I could remake DDR, you know,
8506000	8507000	but I have a thought.
8507000	8508000	I don't know.
8508000	8509000	I don't know.
8509000	8510000	I don't know.
8510000	8511000	I don't know.
8511000	8512000	I don't know.
8512000	8513000	I don't know.
8513000	8514000	I don't know.
8514000	8515000	I don't know.
8515000	8516000	I don't know.
8516000	8517000	I don't know.
8517000	8520000	I couldn't remake DDR, you know, but I have the concept.
8520000	8521000	It's up in my head.
8521000	8523000	It's just, you know, getting it out on program.
8523000	8524000	Some day.
8524000	8526000	Some day I will.
8526000	8527000	Or make something that's like it.
8527000	8530000	One of these, one of these days.
8530000	8532000	One of these days, Shane, one of these days.
8532000	8534000	Because I know you still talk to all of them.
8534000	8537000	I want you to get all your buddies from the Konami days
8537000	8542000	and get them all over here, and we're just going to dish,
8542000	8545000	because I know that's an episode people want to hear.
8545000	8547000	Alright, anyway, moving on.
8547000	8552000	Let's get into some more news here, because again, we're running a little long.
8552000	8553000	I have a follow-up.
8553000	8555000	Uh-oh, Shane has a follow-up.
8555000	8556000	Hurry up, Shane.
8556000	8558000	It's a five-hour show tonight.
8558000	8562000	Just get Flaco Jones over here and we'll talk about how we got drunk at work all the time.
8564000	8567000	That would explain why some of the steps you made were so bad.
8568000	8569000	He wasn't drunk then.
8569000	8571000	He wasn't very good at making steps.
8571000	8572000	I'd have been better if he was drunk.
8572000	8573000	Just kidding.
8574000	8576000	I never played him, so I don't know.
8576000	8577000	Dungeonbuster in chat says,
8577000	8580000	A Shane appears, wielding the power of DDR.
8580000	8581000	Alright.
8581000	8584000	UltraMix isn't even backwards compatible.
8587000	8589000	He just yelled from the other room,
8589000	8591000	You're not backwards compatible.
8592000	8594000	Nice retort, nice retort.
8594000	8597000	Alright, let's get into some other news.
8597000	8598000	Loki.
8598000	8602000	And we had to announce it officially news because it leaked out everywhere news.
8602000	8605000	Battlefield Hardline was announced this week.
8605000	8607000	It's going to have its official reveal on June 9th,
8607000	8610000	when it was originally going to have its official reveal,
8610000	8614000	and not previously when all the different assets and shit started leaking out.
8614000	8618000	Or in, hey, internal gameplay video that they had from six months ago.
8618000	8621000	That's fantastic, when it was codename Omaha.
8622000	8630000	But Battlefield Hardline is going to be a cops versus criminals Battlefield type game.
8630000	8636000	And kind of think a little bit along the lines of like a Grand Theft Auto 5 meets Pay Day,
8636000	8639000	in like the Battlefield type gameplay.
8639000	8641000	So you're going to be doing heists,
8641000	8646000	you're going to be fighting off against criminals, police, and whatnot.
8646000	8648000	So it looks pretty cool.
8649000	8651000	And of course, it's supposed to be coming out later this year,
8651000	8653000	and they're going to show it off at E3.
8653000	8654000	I'm actually kind of excited about it.
8654000	8655000	It looks pretty sweet.
8655000	8659000	It's kind of like all the excitement they were saying they were going to have with the heists in Grand Theft Auto 5,
8659000	8663000	which are kind of lame for the most part.
8663000	8667000	And I know with online they were doing these heists, and it's just still not very exciting.
8667000	8672000	But all the Battlefield gameplay has always looked exciting, so I kind of want to check it out.
8673000	8676000	Alright, I'm sure there will be more to come at E3.
8677000	8681000	Alright, moving on to some other quick updates here.
8681000	8685000	This is still more fallout from the whole closure of GameSpy and all that.
8685000	8691000	But the good news is Epic is serving up a patch to help Unreal Tournament 3 get off those servers.
8691000	8695000	That patch is now out, and it will send players to new servers,
8695000	8699000	meaning Unreal Tournament 3 no longer tied to GameSpy.
8699000	8703000	You can check out that patch, which will work with the Steam version of Unreal Tournament 3.
8703000	8708000	You can check that all out at EpicGames.com if you want to do that,
8708000	8710000	because of course there is no more GameSpy.
8710000	8713000	Speaking of games getting off cancelled services,
8713000	8716000	Games for Windows Live is going to be shutting its doors in August,
8716000	8720000	so Capcom is getting Super Street Fighter IV the hell off of the service.
8720000	8724000	So Super Street Fighter IV is now available on Steam.
8724000	8729000	That's the new platform of choice, and you can get that on Steam at 75% off.
8729000	8733000	It's only $8 on Steam before June 1st. That's not so bad at all.
8733000	8737000	Now, here's the problem, is that because of the shift from Games for Windows Live,
8737000	8741000	you may lose some of your DLC costumes.
8741000	8745000	DLC costumes that were issued to the retail Games for Windows Live version of the game
8745000	8749000	are tied to the game's physical disk and are not able to jump to Steam
8749000	8751000	along with the rest of the components.
8751000	8757000	So, again, one of the downsides of this DLC, it's always only ever temporary.
8757000	8761000	Anyway, at least those games will continue in one way or another.
8761000	8763000	Rob, all things are temporary.
8763000	8764000	I guess that's true.
8764000	8765000	Everything ends.
8765000	8766000	That's true.
8766000	8767000	Even us.
8767000	8769000	That's right, we're slowly dying right now.
8769000	8770000	Right now.
8772000	8774000	All we are is dust in the wind.
8775000	8776000	Dust.
8777000	8778000	Wind.
8778000	8779000	Dude.
8780000	8783000	What a nice positive show we're having tonight.
8783000	8784000	Hey, I quoted Bill & Ted.
8784000	8786000	Hey, have a great E3, everybody. You're gonna die.
8788000	8792000	Hey, I was just quoting Bill & Ted in that last bit.
8792000	8793000	I know, I know.
8793000	8796000	You're gonna die soon, you're gonna die soon.
8796000	8798000	It's not cold in here, you're just dying.
8798000	8799000	Thank you, Sarah Silverman.
8799000	8801000	Alright, moving on.
8801000	8802000	Dark Soccer.
8802000	8804000	Hopefully you have some more positive news for us.
8804000	8805000	Nope.
8805000	8806000	It's all shit.
8806000	8807000	Uh-oh.
8807000	8817000	Representative Bob Latta, who is a Republican from Ohio, filed legislation that would prevent
8817000	8824000	the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, from attempting to regulate broadband internet.
8824000	8827000	So, yeah, this is more net neutrality bullshit.
8827000	8834000	Turns out, this guy, he was funded by a telecommunications campaign group.
8834000	8835000	Of course.
8835000	8836000	Of course.
8836000	8845000	He received $51,000 from cable company interests for about two years, ending December 2013.
8845000	8849000	And there is a group called Open Secrets.
8849000	8851000	It's a campaign finance watchdog group.
8851000	8860000	He was one of 28 House members who lobbied to drop net neutrality after they got kind of paid off.
8860000	8869000	So he got part of his money, it looks like, money from AT&T, money from a national cable
8869000	8876000	and telecommunications association, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, American Cable Association,
8876000	8879000	CenturyLink, and Comcast.
8880000	8886000	And his bill is to, quote, amend the Communications Act of 1934 to limit the authority of the
8886000	8892000	Federal Communications Commission over providers of broadband internet access service.
8892000	8894000	He wants to keep the internet open and accessible.
8894000	8895000	No.
8895000	8899000	He wants to keep the internet monetized for the people who are paying him off.
8899000	8906000	I just still find it so weird how we are trying to alter a global service.
8906000	8912000	I mean, when you start to create that some sites work differently than other sites, isn't
8912000	8915000	that how the internet works in, like, China?
8915000	8920000	I mean, granted, I might be being a little bit extreme and shocking, but this is shocking.
8920000	8922000	It's not that they slow it down.
8922000	8924000	They just plain block them.
8924000	8926000	I know that's what they do in China.
8926000	8930000	But my point is, like, what's really the difference at the end of the day?
8930000	8931000	Okay, maybe.
8931000	8932000	All right.
8932000	8935000	Some people might have very impassioned answers to that.
8935000	8939000	But my point is, is that, you know, this whole net neutrality thing, this is going
8939000	8942000	a little too far, especially when she's talking about things like this.
8942000	8948000	So I'm just going to say, y'all, let your congressperson know that you do not support
8948000	8951000	candidates who, you know, are supporting.
8951000	8954000	Vote the bastards out and they can eat a bowl of dicks.
8954000	8959000	Well, if they don't do anything about it, if you keep telling your congressman to do
8959000	8963000	something and you have a bunch of people doing that and they just still just kind of sit
8963000	8965000	there with their thumbs up their ass and yes, vote them out.
8965000	8969000	Vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.
8969000	8975000	You know, I realize it's a worldwide show, but, you know, participate in your government,
8975000	8977000	you know, however you're able to.
8977000	8979000	And here in America, we vote.
8979000	8981000	So please vote.
8981000	8982000	Thankfully.
8982000	8986000	He has no co-sponsors, so it really is just him.
8986000	8991000	The bill has gone to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
8991000	8996000	So, yeah, vote the bastards out, send them a bowl of dicks.
8996000	9001000	Hopefully they're candy dicks, but instead of actually tasting like candy, they taste
9001000	9003000	like, I don't know, pee.
9003000	9006000	They taste like E.T. cartridges that have been buried in the ground.
9006000	9013000	They taste like the tears of children, which is probably what I would say some conservatives
9013000	9014000	feed on.
9014000	9016000	Is that a Jelly Belly?
9016000	9020000	You just take, you take the cartridges from, you know, the buried E.T.s, you grind them
9020000	9025000	up into a fine powder, you take the tears of crying children, you make it into a paste,
9025000	9029000	form the molds into little penises and then mail those off to, you know.
9029000	9031000	Here, a bag of dicks.
9031000	9036000	Now, you know, you know, I just want you guys have really active imaginations right now,
9036000	9039000	and it's a little bit alarming.
9039000	9042000	Like, I'm just saying.
9043000	9049000	Anyway, so one, there's something really, really wrong with this article, and I think
9049000	9052000	I just saw it explained at the end of it.
9052000	9058000	Bob Latta, the legislation that he's filing would prevent the FCC from attempting to regulate
9058000	9063000	broadband internet service as a public utility under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.
9063000	9071000	That is what people that are fighting for net neutrality want to have happen.
9071000	9075000	That's not what the FCC said they were going to do.
9075000	9080000	They were going to allow fast lanes, breaking net neutrality.
9080000	9083000	So, like, first of all, both of these are steps in the wrong direction.
9083000	9087000	Bob Latta is fucking it over, period, but the FCC was going to anyway.
9087000	9090000	So there's, there's like a whole second layer of this article.
9090000	9092000	He doesn't know what the fuck is going on in the first place.
9092000	9097000	We want it to, I want it to be filed to be, to be classified as a public utility.
9097000	9098000	I want it to be.
9098000	9099000	And I believe that as well.
9099000	9100000	Yes.
9100000	9102000	But, and, and he's preventing that.
9102000	9103000	So the problem is still there.
9103000	9109000	The problem is he's doing it by preventing the FCC from doing it, which is irrelevant.
9109000	9114000	So file this one under left hand, not doing, not knowing what the right hand's doing.
9114000	9117000	Well, he's just making sure that they can't do that.
9117000	9118000	Sure.
9118000	9119000	Because they could change their mind later.
9119000	9121000	He's protecting his little side paycheck.
9121000	9126000	It's a preemptive strike because we know the FCC is under a lot of pressure to change there.
9126000	9127000	That's, that's what's happening.
9127000	9128000	Sure.
9128000	9130000	And, and, and he's getting calls from other Congress people.
9130000	9134000	I believe, don't quote me on this because I'm going off of like what I think I read
9134000	9135000	a couple of weeks ago.
9135000	9140000	I believe Al Franken has been trying to get internet put as a utility.
9140000	9143000	So I think this is a preemptive strike against that.
9143000	9145000	So, yeah, not any better.
9145000	9148000	It's just, there's, there's, yeah, like I said, a whole second layer of just fucked
9148000	9149000	up-ness here.
9149000	9150000	Yeah.
9150000	9151000	So, all right.
9151000	9155000	Uh, anyhow, let's, I'm still off from moving to Finland.
9155000	9157000	Let's let's go to AKA Ripper's house in Sweden.
9157000	9158000	We can stay with AKA Ripper.
9158000	9159000	I don't know that-
9159000	9161000	Does he still listen to this show?
9161000	9162000	I don't know.
9162000	9165000	But this, okay.
9165000	9169000	I, right, I, I would say that we should move to Australia, but right now Tony Abbott is
9169000	9173000	a big, um, well, he, um, he can eat shit.
9173000	9175000	We don't need to move anywhere.
9175000	9177000	We need to fix this country we've got.
9177000	9178000	That's what we need to do.
9178000	9183000	We need, we need to divide this country into four smaller, more easily, uh,
9184000	9186000	Administrated countries.
9186000	9188000	And mine's going to be called Awesome.
9188000	9189000	All right.
9189000	9190000	Because-
9190000	9191000	Let's move, let's move on.
9191000	9193000	Where people will be fed on dreams and rainbows.
9193000	9196000	We could talk about Jamie's plans to take over the world all night, but, uh, we do have
9196000	9197000	to keep moving on.
9197000	9198000	I don't want to take over the world.
9198000	9199000	Too much fucking work.
9199000	9200000	Loki.
9200000	9203000	Well, we can talk about world domination.
9203000	9204000	It's kind of fun.
9204000	9210000	Um, Steam, you may remember they have their Linux machines that are supposed to be coming
9210000	9211000	out at some point.
9211000	9214000	Well, they probably aren't.
9214000	9219000	Apparently the Steam controller, uh, which is supposed to be coming out, um, sometime
9219000	9223000	in 2014 is now, um, getting a release window of some time in 2015.
9223000	9228000	So, you know, people are thinking it's implied that the Steam machines won't be coming out
9228000	9229000	until 2015.
9229000	9231000	Which, honestly, at this point, I don't know.
9231000	9236000	It doesn't really, it does, to me, the Steam machines don't really sound that interesting
9236000	9237000	yet.
9238000	9241000	You haven't really sold me yet on why I need one.
9241000	9245000	That's pretty much where I'm at right now.
9245000	9246000	So.
9246000	9248000	Maybe this delay is to kind of help make that argument?
9248000	9254000	Or maybe add some features to SteamOS, because I don't know where they're at with, you know,
9254000	9257000	integration with, like, certain apps and stuff like that.
9257000	9262000	Because, you know, they were doing, like, some basic, like, music app, but they don't
9262000	9266000	really have a whole ton of features yet.
9266000	9267000	Alright.
9267000	9271000	Uh, let's move on, just for time's sake.
9271000	9272000	Jason.
9272000	9273000	Contin- ow.
9273000	9275000	Way to bite your tongue, Jason.
9275000	9280000	In, uh, in further, everybody hears about Kickstarter news, uh, Reading Rainbow, uh,
9280000	9285000	fronted, quite obviously by LeVar Burton, landed only, what, four or five days ago at
9285000	9286000	this point?
9286000	9288000	And in the first day, already beat its million dollar goal.
9288000	9295000	Uh, it is on pace to be the first double-digit, double-digit, double-digit funded, double-digit
9295000	9299000	in the millions funded Kickstarter that I know of, at any rate.
9299000	9300000	Maybe-
9300000	9302000	Why can't we elect LeVar Burton to Congress?
9302000	9303000	That's what I want to-
9303000	9306000	Clearly, America loves LeVar Burton, which, and rightfully so.
9306000	9309000	There is some very interesting backlash against this Kickstarter, but I'm not well informed
9309000	9310000	enough to comment-
9310000	9312000	There's always some goddamn back-
9312000	9313000	Just saying.
9313000	9315000	Which, isn't that ironic that I'm the one saying this?
9315000	9320000	But there's always, there's always some goddamn backlash, you know what I mean?
9320000	9321000	But here's, here's the difference.
9322000	9325000	I like to think my opinions were well thought out and reasonable.
9325000	9328000	This other stuff, just stop.
9328000	9329000	Stop.
9329000	9330000	I'm right.
9330000	9331000	You're not.
9331000	9332000	Exactly.
9332000	9333000	I thought about it.
9333000	9334000	Exactly.
9334000	9335000	You just came up with it.
9335000	9336000	Wait.
9336000	9339000	Uh, Reading Rainbow obviously has already had a successful Kickstarter and they are
9339000	9342000	laying down the stretch goals.
9342000	9347000	The next goal that I don't think they've hit yet, but I'm going to look, is five million.
9347000	9352000	And when they do that, their intention is to bring the media created by Reading Rainbow
9352000	9355000	to, well, pretty much fucking everything.
9355000	9360000	Phones, Android, game consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation, set-top boxes, a la Apple
9360000	9363000	TV, Roku, and I guess Fire TV as well.
9363000	9365000	I could have Reading Rainbow on the PlayStation.
9365000	9366000	That's fun.
9366000	9369000	You could have it on literally everything you own in this house.
9369000	9370000	That's-
9370000	9371000	And not just PBS and the anarchy that that is.
9371000	9376000	So it's like, reading Linux, basically.
9376000	9379000	And Windows and ARM and-
9379000	9382000	Rama says $3.2 million is the current tally.
9382000	9384000	With 30 days to go.
9384000	9386000	Oh my God.
9386000	9390000	Is this stat have the potential to make more money than any other Kickstarter ever?
9390000	9391000	That I know of.
9391000	9392000	How much do you make?
9392000	9393000	Six million?
9393000	9399000	You mean like, I don't know, too much money for what they did with it.
9399000	9401000	Let's put it that way.
9401000	9402000	All right.
9403000	9406000	I saw an update the other day that certain titles are coming to Ouya.
9406000	9407000	I'm like, Ouya's still around?
9407000	9410000	Just a hair shy of 8.6 is what Ouya landed on.
9410000	9411000	Okay.
9411000	9414000	So, okay, there's still a long ways to go before Reading Rainbow.
9414000	9415000	You still have 30 days.
9415000	9421000	I was just shocked at the supermarket today when I looked at the counter of the DVDs they're
9421000	9424000	trying to hawk it and I was like, Veronica Mars?
9424000	9425000	The movie?
9425000	9426000	Oh yeah.
9426000	9428000	Yeah, that was a thing.
9428000	9429000	Oh yeah.
9429000	9430000	All right.
9430000	9431000	All right.
9431000	9434000	Well, I'd be excited to see a Reading Rainbow app on console.
9434000	9437000	Why don't they do this for other PBS programs?
9437000	9441000	Because, didn't Sesame Street get enough funding for PBS?
9441000	9443000	Sesame Street had a Kinect thing, didn't they?
9443000	9445000	That was one of the big things they were touting with the Kinect for so much.
9445000	9448000	Yeah, they had that thing for Sesame Street, but they only did two seasons of it and that
9448000	9449000	was it.
9449000	9450000	I don't know.
9450000	9454000	Maybe it's just my older age, but PBS isn't what I remember.
9454000	9460000	You know, they don't have Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood or 321 Contact or...
9460000	9461000	The Electric Company.
9461000	9463000	Yeah, the Electric Company or Square One Television.
9463000	9464000	The Electric Company.
9464000	9465000	That was coming back, though.
9465000	9466000	Is it?
9466000	9467000	I thought it was.
9467000	9468000	Weren't they rebooting it?
9468000	9470000	What does PBS educate the kids with now, besides Sesame Street?
9470000	9471000	PBS is...
9471000	9473000	They're not young enough to be able to answer that question.
9473000	9475000	They've got the Cat in the Hat.
9475000	9478000	Wasn't PBS also fucking Barney?
9478000	9479000	Barney is on PBS.
9479000	9480000	And Lamb Chops.
9480000	9481000	Oh, but Lamb Chops.
9481000	9482000	Lamb Chops.
9482000	9483000	Play along.
9483000	9484000	She died, though.
9484000	9485000	Oh, yeah.
9485000	9490000	Well, those socks only last so long.
9490000	9492000	Wow.
9492000	9495000	You're going to special, hell.
9495000	9496000	Well done.
9496000	9498000	Anyways, so they've got that.
9498000	9502000	They have Caillou, which teaches the kids about whining.
9502000	9508000	They've got Dinosaur Train and...
9508000	9511000	What other crap does my son watch?
9511000	9512000	All right.
9512000	9516000	Rama says the most funded Kickstarter was the Pebble Watch.
9516000	9517000	10.2 million.
9517000	9523000	So I guess I lied about the tens of millions backing, but they are on track to shatter
9523000	9525000	this very quickly.
9525000	9526000	Interesting.
9526000	9528000	Three, two, one, contact came back.
9528000	9530000	Get out.
9530000	9532000	I miss Mr. Rogers, though.
9532000	9534000	And you can't recreate Mr. Rogers.
9534000	9535000	You know what else I miss from PBS?
9535000	9536000	I'm sorry.
9536000	9537000	I'm just making this show longer.
9537000	9543000	But God dammit, for people like Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross, I'm going to take a moment to
9543000	9547000	remember, because Bob Ross was the best.
9547000	9548000	The best.
9548000	9550000	Fluffy white clouds.
9550000	9552000	This old house was awesome.
9552000	9555000	And as much as I like Norm, though, I do miss Bob Vila doing it.
9555000	9557000	You know what PBS does have, though?
9557000	9558000	Downton Abbey.
9558000	9560000	There is that.
9560000	9561000	And you know what?
9561000	9562000	In the Bay Area...
9562000	9564000	It's a BBC show, but PBS has it here.
9564000	9565000	And the Bay Area?
9565000	9566000	They had Yen Can Cook.
9566000	9567000	Alright.
9567000	9568000	Anyway.
9568000	9569000	That's fucking awesome.
9569000	9570000	Let's move on.
9570000	9574000	Rama in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Square One TV is my jam.
9574000	9575000	Oh my God.
9575000	9576000	Like, I know we've had our Square...
9576000	9577000	And, and, and!
9577000	9579000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
9579000	9580000	Yes.
9580000	9581000	And Ghostwriter.
9581000	9582000	And...
9582000	9583000	I don't know.
9583000	9586000	Square One TV brought us MathNet.
9586000	9587000	Oh my God.
9587000	9588000	MathMan.
9588000	9589000	MathMan.
9589000	9590000	MathMan.
9590000	9591000	MathMan.
9591000	9592000	MathNet was way better.
9592000	9593000	MathNet was way better.
9593000	9594000	Anyway.
9594000	9595000	Alright.
9595000	9596000	Let's move on.
9596000	9597000	We gotta get to the mailbag.
9597000	9604600	So, thanks to shows like Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and 321 Contact, you can read and you can
9604600	9605600	write.
9605600	9608000	And so you've sent us emails.
9608000	9609000	Elite Most...
9609000	9610000	Two story?
9610000	9611000	Most of you can.
9611000	9612000	Two story, Rob?
9612000	9613000	Yes.
9613000	9614000	I've been able to read since I was two.
9614000	9615000	Yeah.
9615000	9617000	I was two and a half.
9617000	9618000	Yeah.
9618000	9619000	Crazy, huh?
9619000	9621000	My first book that I read?
9621000	9627000	Like I would probably say actual novel length book was Little House in the Big Woods.
9627000	9628000	I always...
9628000	9629000	When I was four.
9629000	9633000	I always look back at like what a smart kid I was and I go, what happened?
9633000	9636000	Video games.
9636000	9638000	And on that note, let's get to the mailbag.
9638000	9640000	Every week you guys send us emails.
9640000	9644000	Participate at Orangelauntrady.com if you want to participate at the show.
9644000	9645000	We got a few emails.
9645000	9646000	We have to catch up from a week off.
9646000	9648000	So, I know Dr. Sakai has a few emails tonight.
9648000	9649000	So, let's get to it.
9649000	9650000	We do.
9650000	9651000	We have a few.
9651000	9656000	The first one is from EA Skizie.
9656000	9659000	Wiggity, wiggity, what's up, Orangelauntrady.
9659000	9660000	Smile.
9660000	9661000	Yep, I'm a huge dork.
9661000	9665000	Your Christopher 10 segment was great and I downloaded Baba Yetu as soon as the show
9665000	9666000	was over.
9666000	9669000	The segment prompted me to send some of the music I've been working on to you.
9669000	9670000	One song is attached.
9670000	9674000	It's free for anybody to listen to use or listen to.
9674000	9676000	So, no worries on the right to whatever.
9676000	9679000	FYI, I am currently searching for the vocal artists.
9679000	9681000	Think back to high school or early college.
9681000	9684000	What was your first drinking party experience and what was it like?
9684000	9687000	Tell us some funny stories of the first time you were inebriated.
9687000	9689000	You know they're usually funny.
9689000	9690000	Okay, I'll tell you right now.
9690000	9692000	The first time I was drunk I was two years old.
9692000	9693000	Wait, wait, wait.
9693000	9694000	Hold on.
9694000	9695000	Hold on.
9695000	9696000	Wait, which email is this?
9696000	9697000	Is this the Skizie one?
9697000	9698000	Yeah, Skizie.
9698000	9699000	Okay.
9699000	9702000	Because I have to play the song while we tell our drunk stories.
9702000	9705000	So, this is the song that he attached to the email.
9705000	9709000	And I can't.
9709000	9711000	How do I change the volume?
9711000	9712000	Where did it go?
9712000	9713000	Ah.
9713000	9714000	Ah.
9714000	9715000	Fail.
9715000	9719000	Live radio is really hard.
9719000	9720000	Hold on.
9720000	9721000	We've got to start.
9721000	9722000	Hold on.
9722000	9723000	Live radio is really, really hard, you guys.
9723000	9724000	All right.
9724000	9725000	Jamie will tell her story and then I'll get the song.
9725000	9726000	All right.
9726000	9727000	Okay.
9727000	9728000	So, yeah.
9728000	9732000	I was two years old and my mom's boyfriend got me drunk on a couple of beers.
9732000	9737000	Anyway, that's where the source of my superpowers came from.
9737000	9741000	This is how I found out, though, that I can't get hangovers.
9741000	9747000	Is I was at my friend Michelle's house and this is, we were in Mississippi.
9747000	9749000	Some kind of dumb party.
9749000	9750000	We were just drinking the whole time.
9750000	9755000	I had to have been like 19, 20, something like that.
9755000	9760000	And we were, this is also how I found out that I like to mix really weird things because
9760000	9763000	I want to start tasting the alcohol after a certain point.
9763000	9765000	And you've had my concoctions, Rob.
9765000	9767000	You know how far I'll take it.
9767000	9768000	Some of them are really good.
9768000	9771000	So I was just drinking everything.
9771000	9773000	I mean, they put it in front of me.
9773000	9776000	That's also how I found out that I hate Jaeger because I didn't realize it was licorice and
9776000	9778000	I hate licorice like a lot.
9778000	9784000	But I drank some of everything and then I realized I found orange juice in the fridge
9784000	9785000	so I mixed tequila in it.
9785000	9789000	What I didn't know is that the orange juice was screwdrivers.
9789000	9797000	So I took screwdrivers already and added tequila to it and drank two whole pint glasses
9797000	9802000	full of it along with Everclear shots.
9802000	9807000	And, um, God, I don't remember what else the fuck I had that night.
9807000	9811000	And I woke up the next morning hungry.
9811000	9813000	That's how I found out that I don't get hangovers.
9813000	9815000	Slow jams starting on this song.
9815000	9819000	I'm going to take Skeezy's song down here a little bit so I can tell you my story real quick.
9819000	9820000	I'll make this quick.
9820000	9821000	First time I ever drank.
9821000	9823000	One thing, Brad, I'm sorry.
9823000	9826000	It is physically impossible for me to have a hangover.
9826000	9827000	You have no idea.
9827000	9829000	I cannot get a hangover.
9829000	9830000	And I've tried.
9830000	9831000	That sounds like a challenge, though.
9831000	9832000	You've seen me.
9832000	9833000	Yeah, no, I know.
9833000	9834000	I know.
9834000	9838000	But I also remember you passed out on the bed demanding waffles or something like that.
9838000	9840000	Anyway, that was an early OLR episode.
9840000	9844000	Anyway, first time I ever drank was in college, which is where I think a lot of people start
9844000	9848000	it, although it was shots of Bacardi 151, although I only had a few, so I didn't really
9848000	9849000	get drunk.
9849000	9853000	The first time I ever got like super rip roaring drunk was actually I was kind of a late bloomer
9853000	9854000	in this regard.
9854000	9857000	The first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience of the 25th anniversary
9857000	9859000	Rocky Horror Convention.
9859000	9865000	I was with Jessica from under station live and I we had a warp core breach.
9865000	9867000	We quote unquote shared a warp core breach.
9867000	9871000	But that means Jessica had like two sips and I had the rest of the fishbowl.
9871000	9873000	And yeah, I got really, really drunk.
9873000	9878000	And there's a voicemail I left to Travis because under station live was going at the
9878000	9879000	time.
9879000	9884000	And Travis still plays that goddamn voicemail on that show to this day.
9884000	9886000	So there you go.
9886000	9888000	And no, I'm not playing it for you here.
9888000	9891000	You can go check out under station live, although they're on hiatus right now.
9891000	9892000	We can check out their old episodes.
9892000	9897000	And now with that, there's actually a follow up to this, you know, when Jessica and I went
9897000	9902000	to the Star Trek experience and we had two warp core breaches.
9902000	9906000	And these people left their warp core breach and we finished it.
9906000	9907000	Wow.
9907000	9908000	Drinking other people's booze.
9908000	9909000	That's awful.
9909000	9910000	No, they're like, we can't finish it.
9910000	9912000	Like alcohol is fucking sterile.
9912000	9913000	We'll drink it.
9913000	9915000	Do you guys want the rest of our drink?
9915000	9916000	Yeah, sure.
9916000	9917000	Drink.
9917000	9924000	So that's where we developed the pattern of going on the ride sober, drinking a lot, then
9924000	9928000	going on the ride drunk, then going on the ride while you're sobering.
9928000	9931000	And I think we called you at that time.
9931000	9932000	And then we called Travis.
9932000	9933000	Yep.
9933000	9937000	And that was, and we also played DDR on that machine.
9937000	9938000	All right.
9938000	9939000	Easy song has a minute left.
9939000	9943000	So Jason or Loki, you have an inebriation story to share.
9943000	9948000	If you're a late bloomer, I'm still gestating because I don't have such stories.
9948000	9949000	Really?
9949000	9951000	I have a dream.
9951000	9952000	E3 is coming up.
9952000	9953000	All right.
9953000	9957000	And I am going to be surrounded by a hell of a lot of people that I do trust my life
9957000	9958000	with.
9959000	9961000	Loki, anything quickly you want to share?
9961000	9962000	Um, I don't know.
9962000	9965000	I've gotten sick on the show before because I got drunk drinking screwdrivers.
9965000	9967000	Actually, I think skeezy, you want to go back in the night.
9967000	9969000	I was making the screwdrivers.
9969000	9970000	What episode was it?
9970000	9971000	No, I was making the screwdrivers.
9971000	9974000	I just kept using the double shot shot glasses.
9974000	9975000	It's shot.
9975000	9981000	So I kept putting too much, um, that I probably shouldn't have had that much minestrone before,
9981000	9983000	you know, coming into the show.
9983000	9984000	It's very acidic.
9984000	9987000	Well, we, all right, we have more of the email.
9987000	9988000	You know how I talk about, sorry.
9988000	9991000	Oh, LR was a very, very different show in the earlier days.
9991000	9992000	Maybe dark tissue.
9992000	9995000	You can tell you what episode number it was because Lord knows I forgot, but there's an
9995000	9999000	episode where we got so, or I got so drunk on air.
9999000	10005000	We're on air and I'm lying on the ground with the microphone and I'm kicking the wall.
10005000	10007000	I'm kicking the wall going, I'm in the matrix.
10007000	10009000	I'm in the matrix.
10009000	10012000	And this was somehow a radio show that we did now.
10012000	10014000	Was that episode 69 granted?
10014000	10016000	We haven't improved that much.
10016000	10019000	No, we didn't, we didn't drink on episode 69.
10019000	10020000	Some people did.
10020000	10021000	It was like one of our anniversary shows.
10021000	10028000	I remember a party over at that apartment where Shane and I were drinking and watching
10028000	10033000	all you guys play spin the bottle and we decided to replace the word drunk with dunk because
10033000	10034000	it was funny.
10034000	10035000	Yeah.
10035000	10036000	Shane.
10036000	10037000	Aim red.
10037000	10038000	All right.
10038000	10040000	Back when I used to make super bacon.
10040000	10041000	Rest of the email.
10041000	10042000	Rest of the email.
10042000	10043000	Okay.
10043000	10044000	Rest of the email.
10044000	10045000	Uh, Oh yeah.
10045000	10046000	Once again, love you guys.
10046000	10047000	Keep gaming.
10047000	10048000	Keep podcasting.
10048000	10049000	Keep caring.
10049000	10052440	Uh, that's from EA skeezy from Wisconsin.
10052440	10054000	We have a few listeners in Wisconsin.
10054000	10055000	There you go.
10055000	10057000	He just filled like six or seven minutes of the show.
10057000	10059000	We got to get high.
10059000	10060000	Hi.
10060000	10061000	It's, it's a Swede.
10061000	10063000	We have another Swede.
10063000	10064000	Sweet.
10064000	10068400	I'm going to say, because there's not a name on this, I'm going to say inkblot.
10068400	10072000	We need, we need a, we need more places to crash in Sweden.
10072000	10073000	Hi.
10073000	10077000	Here's some technical reasons for why the Wii U doesn't have GameCube games.
10077000	10080000	As far as I see it now, this is an older email.
10080000	10081000	Okay.
10081000	10084000	It was, uh, came in the week we were off, but this is what I was referencing earlier.
10084000	10085000	Jason was this email.
10085000	10089000	Maybe it will interest you and I don't have a question, but I think the situation is pretty
10089000	10090000	interesting.
10090000	10096000	Just a cool thing about the Wii U home brewers have made GameCube ISOs available on Wii U's
10096000	10099000	Wii section via devolution on the home brew channel.
10099000	10103000	Since Wii and GameCube have the same architecture, the hacker explained it as just showing the
10103000	10107000	GameCube games the hardware that the GameCube had.
10107000	10112000	Uh, just like devoting a portion of the Wii RAM so the memory addresses, uh, addresses
10112000	10115000	map the same way as it did on the GameCube.
10115000	10116000	It's not emulation.
10116000	10118000	Really cool stuff.
10118000	10123000	It's the same technique Nintendo used for the 3DS's ambassador program, GBA games.
10123000	10128000	But Nintendo never went forward with this on the 3DS for GBA on Virtual Console since
10128000	10131000	it runs off the 3DS's DS hardware.
10131000	10137000	While it's in DS mode, the actual 3DS hardware is shut off.
10137000	10139000	No street pass, internet browsing, etc.
10139000	10145000	It's not ideal and Nintendo wants ideal so they would want it to run on the 3DS mode
10145000	10148000	hardware which would require emulation.
10148000	10154000	They've had that problem developing such an emulator ergo no GBA 3DS VC games.
10154000	10155000	Yeah.
10155000	10160000	Um, it's the same situation on Wii U so Nintendo probably won't use the Wii U's capability
10160000	10162000	to run GameCube games almost natively.
10162000	10168000	If GameCube comes to Wii U, it will probably be an HD rendering emulator from a Swede
10168000	10170000	who listens every week love the show.
10170000	10171000	Thank you Swede.
10171000	10175000	I, I am okay with them, um, doing that HD upres and stuff.
10175000	10176000	They're not.
10176000	10177000	They won't.
10177000	10178000	Yeah, I know.
10178000	10179000	You know why?
10179000	10180000	Why?
10180000	10181000	Because the Wii doesn't upres.
10181000	10182000	So they're not gonna fuckin' do it.
10182000	10188000	Well, if they develop that and they start upresing Wii games, that'd be pretty cool.
10188000	10189000	But they're not.
10189000	10192000	Why doesn't Nintendo just one up the homebrew community and take some of these things that
10192000	10194000	they do and sell it?
10194000	10195000	Oh my god.
10195000	10196000	I don't know.
10196000	10197000	Alright.
10197000	10198000	Anyway.
10198000	10199000	Thank you for the email.
10199000	10200000	Three words.
10200000	10202000	Japanese corporate culture.
10202000	10203000	Okay.
10203000	10207260	Dark Tetsuya says, by the way just so you know, first Drunk Show was number 29, after
10207260	10214060	that was 33, and after that was number 148, the three year anniversary where Loki's story
10214060	10215060	took place.
10215060	10218740	So I'm guessing episode 148 was that show I'm thinking of.
10218740	10221100	Which is probably in the OL archive somewhere.
10221100	10223660	You'll have to, you'll have to come ask Dark Tetsuya for it.
10223660	10224660	Now one of these days.
10224660	10225660	Lord knows I'm not making that shit.
10225660	10230460	One of these days we need to have like a Drunk Show marathon like block where we just have
10230460	10232700	all the Drunk Shows playing back to back.
10232700	10234140	That'd be funny.
10234140	10235140	Love it.
10235140	10236140	Alright.
10236140	10237140	Next email.
10237140	10238140	Oh yeah.
10238140	10239140	Okay.
10239140	10240140	Um.
10240140	10241140	Hello.
10241140	10242620	My name is Matt and I am a new listener to OLR.
10242620	10243620	Hi Matt.
10243620	10244620	Hi Matt.
10244620	10248660	A friend and I started a gaming podcast about two months ago and I have been listening to
10248660	10250540	other gaming pods for inspiration.
10250540	10256780	I have to say by a mile OLR is the best in terms of content I've heard thus far.
10256780	10259100	Keep producing great content and I'll keep listening.
10259100	10260100	A new listener.
10260100	10261100	Matt.
10261100	10262100	Thank you Matt.
10262100	10263100	Get out.
10263100	10264100	That's it?
10264100	10265100	There's no plug for the show?
10265100	10266100	No.
10266140	10269900	Let us know your information and we will give you a plug-o-rama.
10269900	10270900	You know what though?
10270900	10274640	That's I mean I'm all for plugging other indie shows like that that's not a problem or whatever
10274640	10280860	but like the fact that he didn't do that like really makes those words genuine in a way
10280860	10284520	like it's not just hey I'm gonna kiss your ass you'll promote my show like it's like
10284520	10286820	super genuine so thank you.
10286820	10292580	That's positive words like that go so far in motivating what we do week after week after
10292580	10294300	week so thank you so much.
10294300	10295300	You rule.
10295300	10296300	Yes.
10296300	10302980	You rule like a lot but but yeah yeah you rule a lot but send us the stuff like I said.
10302980	10305620	Good luck with your show but you could do a better job promoting it.
10305620	10306620	We'll push.
10306620	10310300	That's Orange On Radio tip number one.
10310300	10311300	Rab stop.
10311300	10312300	Stop it.
10312300	10314300	I'm giving him a hard time.
10314300	10315300	All right.
10315300	10324260	All right so hey guys I'm not a guy found this show during the early years of podcasting
10324260	10329620	tuned into the latest episode at the time episode 57 one day and have been laughing
10329620	10331780	ever since you guys are great.
10331780	10334660	Is there a P.O. box where I can send you a gift?
10334660	10339100	I recently replaced my old microphone and instead of selling it I thought of O.L.R.
10339100	10341940	It's a blue snowball microphone and it needs a home.
10341940	10342940	Wow.
10342940	10346620	I figured what better way to give back to the show that's been with me through the years.
10346620	10350340	If not then that's cool too I just wanted to let you guys know to keep up the good work
10350340	10352020	that comes from Randy.
10352020	10356220	I will have to contact this person off air so don't delete that email and give that address.
10356220	10357860	I don't ever delete the emails anymore.
10357860	10358860	Yeah.
10358860	10359860	OK.
10359860	10362060	Except for the ones that come from marketers that we don't get anymore.
10362060	10363060	Yeah.
10363060	10364740	So that's awesome.
10364740	10368700	I laughed a little bit there because I know another friend of ours Cody said he was going
10368700	10370100	to send some mics.
10370100	10375060	These mics we use right now were donated by Pod Culture and they work great.
10375060	10376260	But here's my deal.
10376260	10379660	If we get more mics than we can use which I somehow doubt that will happen because I
10379660	10384180	know one of these mics is already going bad because they just go through a lot of abuse.
10384180	10388380	So I know we can replace but I promise that we'll pay it forward.
10388380	10391900	So because I know a lot of podcasters in the Bay Area I don't know a lot but I know enough
10391900	10396280	in the Bay Area and they would happily take other mics and things like that.
10396280	10399700	So I'm all for like paying it forward and all that.
10399700	10402980	So yeah I'm curious to see what mic this might be.
10402980	10404460	I'll contact this person off air.
10404460	10406580	Thank you very much for the offer.
10406580	10409820	I own one of those microphones as a matter of fact.
10409820	10410820	Do you?
10410820	10411820	What are they?
10411820	10412820	Are they more hand mics or is that?
10412820	10417740	No it's actually it's actually by no means a hand mic because it's literally just a ball.
10417740	10419820	It's a it's it's a desktop stand mic.
10419820	10425660	It's intended to kind of like be the play setting and it's it's not it is cardioid because
10425660	10426660	these are dynamic.
10426660	10427660	Yeah.
10427660	10430780	Or I always get it backwards but it's intended to just be a desk mic that you have there
10430780	10434140	and it picks up enough of the room that you can just talk and yeah it's not a hand mic
10434140	10435140	at all.
10435140	10437620	I'd love to have on the kitchen counter for when people come in here screaming things
10437620	10438940	like Shane tried to do earlier.
10438940	10440220	It would be very good for ambient noise.
10440220	10441580	Yeah it would be good for that.
10441580	10442580	Ambient pickups rather.
10442580	10443580	That'd be great.
10443580	10444580	You guys rule.
10444580	10445580	You guys don't have to give us anything.
10445580	10446580	Just as we say at the end of every show.
10446580	10447580	Tacos.
10447580	10449040	Tell a listener or two about the show.
10449040	10451740	You know somebody contacted me on Twitter going how can I send Jamie tacos.
10451740	10453940	You know that I got that mail.
10453940	10461380	You know actually I really tacos I can't really have them too often because I am eating ketogenic
10461380	10462620	because I'm going back to the gym.
10462620	10463620	Right.
10463620	10464620	I thought you said adopt a kitten instead.
10464840	10469900	Adopt a kitten do that adopt a kitten in my name and take care of this kitten and raise
10469900	10476460	her or him with all the love in your heart and get it also contribute to having strays
10476460	10477460	spayed and neutered.
10477460	10480240	And it might love you back when it feels like it.
10480240	10486320	You might see love in the shape of claws to your face or mid this thing lately is crawling
10486320	10491160	up on this on my side like when I'm at my computer chair and like she'll attach with
10491160	10494560	her claws on the side of my chair and then pat me on my shoulder.
10494560	10498200	But sometimes she'll miss and get my armpit like mom.
10498200	10499200	Mom love me.
10499200	10500200	Pet pet.
10500200	10501200	OK.
10501200	10502200	I'm done.
10502200	10503200	Bye.
10503200	10504200	She fucks off.
10504200	10506160	Brad from Pod Culture says that MXL nine ninety I sent will pick up a cat fart from three
10506160	10507360	blocks away.
10507360	10508360	That is true.
10508360	10511720	I tried to use that mic and I was like OK this thing is way too sensitive.
10511720	10512720	Like I can't.
10512720	10516520	It's it's in one of the other boxes in the back room just because I was like I can't
10516520	10519800	use this because we are all loud ass bitches.
10519800	10521800	And this thing is going to.
10521800	10527360	But I thought I actually was hanging on to it because there is a project in my mind right
10527360	10532520	now where that other room is going to get turned into my little twitch lounge.
10532520	10533720	So we'll see.
10533720	10534720	Anyway.
10534720	10535720	Dot dot.
10535720	10536720	Moving on.
10536720	10537720	All right.
10537720	10539840	Well we have one last email.
10539840	10541160	Dear OLR.
10541160	10543560	You've made a fuck show.
10543560	10545200	You've had a marathon episode.
10545200	10547920	You've definitely had a few drunk shows as well.
10547920	10552440	My question to the host is what will be the next theme or for lack of a better term gimmick
10552440	10555240	of the next special episode of OLR.
10555240	10558400	Whenever that happens Jason is all the hosts.
10558400	10561620	Sky only allowed to speak with his Kermit the Frog voice.
10561620	10565860	Randomly censoring yourself as we log OK.
10565860	10569160	Randomly censoring yourself with real and or fake fart noises.
10569160	10571400	Your audience demands clarity.
10571400	10574960	Signed the nasty canasta.
10575520	10578120	Did he say I am all the hosts.
10578120	10582280	Yes you take over all of our positions.
10582280	10584680	Whoo boy that's.
10584680	10588800	I don't even know like I have the power.
10588800	10589800	I don't.
10589800	10592160	I kind of think that I sound kind of dumb.
10592160	10596440	So I don't know how you would imitate me.
10596440	10599040	I would say my voice.
10599080	10605360	I would say that for a special theme show.
10605360	10611840	I would say the very last show of OLR will be the next theme show.
10617720	10619840	We do the pot brownie show.
10619840	10621920	No no no no.
10621920	10622920	I'm just kidding.
10622920	10623920	By the way.
10623920	10624920	Don't panic.
10624920	10625920	That's my smart ass answer.
10625920	10626920	The last OLR.
10626920	10627920	Don't panic.
10627920	10630000	That's our hitchhiker's guide theme show.
10630000	10631240	We all have towels and toothbrushes.
10631240	10633280	Theme shows are what we do with Rocky Horror.
10633280	10634280	All right.
10634280	10636280	We'll do the Rocky Horror OLR show.
10636280	10640040	It was great when it all began.
10640040	10644280	I was a regular vog fan.
10644280	10646640	Only if Loki agrees to play Frank N Furter.
10646640	10649320	No no no no no no no.
10649320	10653320	I veto that because Rob I have seen you in a corset and you were fabulous.
10653320	10654320	How do you do I.
10654320	10666400	See you've met my fabulous unity game.
10666400	10669840	I just don't have that much enthusiasm.
10669840	10671680	I think you'd make a great meatloaf.
10671680	10674120	I mean you're going to die halfway through the show.
10674120	10675120	Yes.
10675120	10676520	You're using an axe.
10676520	10677520	That would be Jason.
10677520	10680840	I mean no offense Jason but it would be really funny because he's only here for half of it
10680840	10683160	and then he comes back as somebody else.
10683160	10684160	That would be it.
10684200	10687640	No I was Dr. Scott once.
10687640	10690120	I flipped off an entire room because I was Dr. Scott.
10690120	10691120	There you go.
10691120	10692360	That was great.
10692360	10693680	The Rocky Horror OLR show.
10693680	10694680	That's my answer.
10694680	10695680	OK.
10695680	10696680	The Rocky Horror OLR show.
10696680	10697680	That's it.
10697680	10698680	That's it.
10698680	10699680	At least it's not shock treatment.
10699680	10700680	All right.
10700680	10701680	If you want to.
10701680	10702680	Oh my God.
10702680	10703680	Shock treatment.
10703680	10704680	Watching that.
10704680	10705680	OK.
10705680	10709840	Evan when Evan lived with Jessica and he made those hacker cookies that like had no doughs
10709840	10712080	cooked into the cookies.
10712080	10713080	Oh.
10713080	10715280	The OLR baking show.
10715280	10716280	Yes.
10716280	10717840	I can't bake for shit but yes.
10717840	10719480	The kitchen is right there.
10719480	10721520	Oh Alan hates this idea already.
10721520	10724520	Well I remember when I made lobster on the show.
10724520	10725520	I do.
10725520	10726520	I do.
10726520	10727520	Rock lobster.
10727520	10728520	All right.
10728520	10729680	9 20 and we're not even at calls yet.
10729680	10732880	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
10732880	10734600	Every week we do some FUs of the week.
10734600	10735600	Why?
10735600	10736600	Because we're mad.
10736600	10756680	Bless you.
10756680	10766560	I don't know FU too too much stuff too many things that I don't have a name for.
10766560	10773480	And apple pie moonshine that I drank a lot of last night and then I started playing
10773480	10778720	Final Fantasy 14 because I forgot that I had to go to bed.
10778720	10779720	All right.
10779720	10781060	That it.
10781060	10787160	Also FU to how they did the very very very very end thing after X-Men Days of Future
10787160	10791200	Past which I'm not going to spoil it for people who haven't seen it but fuck how they did
10791200	10794600	that because he doesn't look a damn thing like that.
10794600	10795600	All right.
10795640	10796640	Lowkey.
10796640	10808120	I guess FU to trying to call these objects without having Unity Pro or as Unity Pro I
10808120	10810120	just say call these objects.
10810120	10816120	Unity free I have to come up with some creative solutions and it's a pain in the ass.
10816120	10817120	All right.
10817120	10820520	My FU of the week just goes to the fact that I am like really really busy this upcoming
10820520	10825760	month between E3 and Disney 3 and Rocky Horror at the end of the month and my birthday and
10825760	10831160	NSF pride and work where where I have a lot going on at work right now.
10831160	10833000	Yeah I'm really busy this month.
10833000	10839880	So if my gaming weeks start to dry up over the next few weeks just stop and also a big
10839880	10844920	FU to the fact that I was trying to be a good boy and I went to the gym first time in forever
10844920	10846480	over Memorial Day holiday.
10846480	10848960	I was sore for five days.
10848960	10852240	I was walking like a rubber band and I know that's a good thing like it's your body making
10852240	10857200	the muscle or whatever but me not being able to walk at work is not a good thing.
10857200	10859960	So FU to the fact that I'm so fat and out of shape.
10859960	10860960	Jason.
10860960	10865240	Yeah that makes three out of the four of us FU to time.
10865240	10868560	Hey time not out of shape you know that's technically true for me too.
10868560	10871040	But I'm really good about that and I am losing weight for Amy.
10871040	10872320	That's not what this segment is for.
10872320	10873960	Yeah FU to time.
10873960	10880040	I was I felt strapped for time getting set for this latest trip because I had what five
10880040	10884640	things to plan for and four of them have finished at this point.
10884640	10891080	And so the last thing is B3 and then getting home and then coming back for a week later.
10891080	10892080	Wish I were doing it.
10892080	10893080	Sort of.
10893080	10896680	All right there it is your FUs of the week although I do want to mention this from our
10896680	10900120	chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because it didn't come up in the show elsewhere.
10900120	10903560	Blender says FU'd and B Davis dying.
10903560	10904880	That is true.
10904880	10911840	Alice from the Brady Bunch their homemaker or whatever was died today.
10911840	10915280	Although I'm going to admit like I don't want to sound crass or rude but it was one of those
10915280	10918800	things where when they announced it I said she wasn't already dead.
10918800	10919800	You know I just.
10919800	10920800	Oh she was still alive.
10920800	10922840	But unfortunately people disappear like that.
10922840	10923840	You know.
10923840	10924840	Anyway.
10924840	10926440	But rest in peace.
10926440	10929840	I grew up on the Brady Bunch reruns as I'm sure a lot of other people did.
10930120	10931120	All right.
10931120	10935160	Just a couple quick stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1 8 7 7 game OLR it's
10935160	10938320	going to be a quick Skype line tonight because we're running way over it's almost 930 on
10938320	10939320	the West Coast.
10939320	10940320	So Loki.
10940320	10941320	All right.
10941320	10950040	So EA has basically come to a settlement agreement with the whole NCAA football and basketball
10950040	10954720	thing where they were basically having the college students in the game but not actually
10954720	10958200	paying for them to be in the game.
10958200	10962800	So it's in the game except you're not getting paid for it.
10962800	10963800	Yeah.
10963800	10969480	So now they have to pay almost a thousand dollars per college athlete in the game.
10969480	10974780	So that's not really much compensation considering that they've made a lot of money in that.
10974780	10978280	But well.
10978280	10982280	Thousand dollars per student I guess is still a bit of money.
10982280	10985080	It's quite quite another.
10985080	10986240	All right.
10986280	10992160	Lastly there was a little bit of excitement over and not an announcement but basically
10992160	10996040	a revealed rating so to speak on Germany's rating board.
10996040	11001720	It was a rating for a game called Gianna sisters versus Super Meat Boy which instantly brought
11001720	11004720	all those thoughts to people's heads like oh there could be a game where like the two
11004720	11008040	of them kind of because you know they're both platforming games they're both indie they're
11008040	11012760	both fun and the thought was that oh they maybe you're going to do like a mashup type
11012760	11013760	of game.
11013760	11014760	That would be a lot of fun.
11014800	11018880	I know people are running rampant about oh is this like an E3 thing or what but no no
11018880	11019960	it actually isn't.
11019960	11025280	A press release from Head Up Games confirms that what this is it's just a bundle of Gianna
11025280	11027880	Sisters Twisted Dreams and Super Meat Boy.
11027880	11032060	It's only available in Germany at least right now on June 26th.
11032060	11034520	My birthday is when this is coming out.
11034520	11038560	So it is a repackaging of two other great I mean they are good games that are worth
11038560	11043840	your time if you somehow haven't already played them but maybe they were out a little later
11043840	11045240	in Germany I don't know.
11045240	11047560	So there you go.
11047560	11048560	That does it.
11048560	11051460	So we're going to open up the Skype line to take your calls.
11051460	11056880	It's that time 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio if you wish to
11056880	11059320	give us a call we will set that up.
11059320	11063720	I got to make sure that the calls can actually come through tonight so we'll set that up.
11063720	11067640	Okay so 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us
11067640	11069160	a call.
11069160	11071480	Meanwhile last minute stories if we have any.
11071480	11072480	Loki?
11072480	11073480	Nope.
11073480	11076400	I do have one that flew under the radar last week.
11076400	11080940	There was an announcement that Samsung and Oculus VR are entering a partnership.
11080940	11086160	The quick version is that Oculus gives Samsung early access to its mobile software development
11086160	11090540	kit and helps develop user interface software while Samsung gives Oculus early access to
11090540	11095160	its next-gen OLED screens because Samsung is joining the race without having to do the
11095160	11096160	hard work.
11096160	11098920	Let's go to the phones.
11098920	11099920	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11099920	11100920	Who's this?
11101360	11102360	Hey it's Ron.
11102360	11103360	How's everyone doing tonight?
11103360	11104360	Of course it is.
11104360	11105360	Rama.
11105360	11106360	How you doing Rama?
11106360	11107360	We're good.
11107360	11110840	And sorry we weren't here last week for you to call first.
11110840	11111840	It's quite alright.
11111840	11115440	I found myself doing other things like you know catching up with stuff on the DVR.
11115440	11118600	I've been sitting on my DVR since summer of 2013.
11118600	11122840	I figured that's what a lot of people were making out of the holidays so what's up?
11122840	11123840	Not much.
11123840	11126920	I want to talk about something slightly different and I'll be on my merry little way.
11126920	11127920	Okay.
11128920	11129920	Um.
11129920	11130920	Rhythm games.
11130920	11132920	Let's talk about that.
11132920	11134920	Of course.
11134920	11140800	I recently stumbled upon a game for Android which is also available for iOS called Love
11140800	11142960	Live School Idol Project.
11142960	11143960	Okay.
11143960	11148080	Also you can get it in the US on the download stores as Idol Project.
11148080	11154600	Pretty much you are a manager of an idol group and people ask to join and you train with
11154600	11155600	them.
11155600	11160880	You train with them with the music and what it is is all of the members of the band which
11160880	11165480	I believe is about nine of them and these circles come down from the center and you
11165480	11169800	just tap the screen you know for perfect timing.
11169800	11177040	It's sort of like the timing plays sort of similar to the Sega musical games like K-On!
11177040	11178040	and Project Diva.
11178040	11179040	Right.
11179040	11180040	Hatsune Miku.
11180040	11181040	Sure.
11181040	11184040	It's pretty fun and as you play the songs you go back into the story mode.
11184040	11187560	You discover more characters, more people that want to join and then you go back into
11187560	11194320	the game mode and you play the songs again to increase your combination, earn points
11194320	11196720	and raise the idols levels.
11196720	11202080	And you can do special practices where as you collect members of your team they're like
11202080	11203080	trading cards.
11203080	11207240	You can merge the cards together and get a better character and train off of that.
11207240	11208240	It's kind of fun.
11208240	11212400	Now AkumaJP in chat says Idol Master and yeah that does kind of sound like what you're describing
11212400	11218040	here is kind of like a IOS version of that probably like a knockoff in a way.
11218040	11222600	Something like that but it is actually based off the anime Love Live school idol project.
11222600	11223600	Got it.
11223600	11228120	It's kind of might be from the same people but I do know what's kind of interesting is
11228120	11231720	that one of the companies that's behind this is ASCII media.
11231720	11236320	The same company that had ASCIIware, same company made those awesome ASCII sticks back
11236320	11238320	in the day.
11238320	11239320	Wow.
11239320	11240560	Interesting how far these companies have come.
11240560	11243960	It's so interesting to see like who all's gone mobile because the answer is like everybody
11243960	11248480	except like Nintendo and even Nintendo is finally going to do what Miiverse or something.
11248480	11251960	So I wonder if that'll happen during E3.
11251960	11252960	Anyway.
11252960	11253960	OK.
11253960	11254960	Well that's cool.
11254960	11255960	So so you enjoy the game.
11255960	11256960	Is it worth it.
11256960	11257960	How much is it.
11257960	11258960	It's free.
11258960	11259960	Really.
11259960	11261720	Oh so they must make the money off some of the cards and these other enhancements right.
11261720	11264960	It's like buying gems and other items to raise your characters.
11264960	11268960	But to be perfectly honest you really don't need to do any in-app purchases.
11268960	11270200	Just play the game through.
11270200	11272180	How's the music in it though.
11272180	11273280	It's very cute.
11273280	11276600	It's very anime J-Poppy which is kind of a given.
11276600	11277600	Of course.
11277600	11278600	Of course.

11281600	11284180	I might have to check that out myself.

11289200	11292520	So we're trying to help each other out as we're playing through the game so you should
11292520	11293520	join us.

11294520	11295520	One more time the name.
11295520	11298500	The name of the anime is called Love Life School Idol Project.
11298500	11304580	You can find it on iTunes Store and Google Play as Idol Project or School Project.
11304580	11305580	All right.
11305580	11306580	Idol Project.

11307580	11308580	You got it.
11308580	11309580	If not just find a school project.

11314260	11316680	system that you have.
11316680	11317680	I'm trying to look at it.

11320340	11325740	See it might be under School Project.

11331740	11332740	I know.
11332740	11333740	Shit.
11333740	11334740	I was in the music store.
11334740	11340180	I hate how there's the two separate stores I mean I get why they do it but OK so school
11340180	11343000	Idol Festival Jax.
11343000	11351300	This is great radio but hey free game y'all schools of chaos school Idol Festival that's

11354300	11355300	OK.
11355300	11356300	School Idol Festival.
11356860	11360500	Yeah they had to change the name because the actual anime series has not been licensed
11360500	11361500	here just yet.
11361500	11362500	All the way.
11362500	11364500	So you know.
11364500	11365500	Sounds good.
11365500	11368260	I imagine you guys talked a lot about this on anime jam session.
11368260	11369260	Actually no.
11369260	11372540	I started playing this like a few days ago on occasion but I may have to bring it up
11372540	11377340	because it is fun and I've noticed a few of my friends one of the reason why they're upgrading
11377340	11381620	their Android is just so they can have something powerful enough so they can play this game.
11381620	11382620	Love it.
11382620	11383620	All right.
11383620	11384620	All right.
11384620	11385620	Rama.
11385620	11386620	Here are the thoughts before I let you go.
11386620	11387620	No that's it.
11387620	11391900	But I left you a message because I have a I have some stuff to send you.
11391900	11392900	Oh OK.
11392900	11393900	I'm a little behind.
11393900	11394900	Oh I just see my little red.
11394900	11395900	OK.
11395900	11396900	You got it.
11396900	11397900	I will send that right away.
11397900	11398900	Awesome.
11398900	11399900	Thanks a lot bro.
11399900	11400900	Bye.
11400900	11401900	I love how people use the Skype line.
11401900	11404820	Hey check your private messages.
11404820	11407740	Sorry I'm trying to do a show live radio is kind of hard.
11407740	11409140	You know it's a little bit difficult.
11409140	11410420	You said it was hard.
11410420	11411420	Shush.
11411420	11412420	Shush.
11412420	11418100	1 8 7 7 game OLR username on Skype orange lounge radio.
11418100	11421020	Many other last minute stories Jason.
11421020	11424380	All right.
11424380	11431260	Who is going to use a VR headset for a mobile phone.
11431260	11433300	I just.
11433300	11438700	The same people who buy the 3DS version of Skylanders.
11438700	11441220	Like why would you haul around that big portal and things everywhere.
11441260	11443140	I don't understand.
11443140	11444860	You don't.
11444860	11445860	You don't.
11445860	11446860	No you don't.
11446860	11447860	I thought you had to.
11447860	11448860	You load your character.
11448860	11452100	It has like so many slots of characters you can store so you put a few characters in there
11452100	11453100	you swap between them.
11453100	11454100	All right.
11454100	11455100	That makes a little more sense.
11455100	11460040	The Oculus thing with the phone is it's for stuff we haven't thought of yet or stuff they
11460040	11462420	haven't thought of yet as far as using Oculus Rift.
11462420	11466940	But when you can't see the phone like there's no you need another sensor to know where the
11466940	11467940	hell you're.
11467940	11471740	But if you're able to interact with it like you can with like Google Glass or something
11471740	11476780	like that there is currently no input mechanism in the in the Oculus currently and that's
11476780	11477780	your whole point.
11477780	11478780	OK.
11478780	11479780	One more.
11479780	11481860	I'm going to put one more call out for the Skype line 1 8 7 7 game OLR username on Skype
11481860	11482860	orange launch radio.

11486380	11487660	got other things she's got to get to.
11487660	11489860	But final thoughts for our listeners tonight.
11489860	11490860	Al.
11490860	11491860	Al.

11497220	11498220	All right.
11498220	11499220	If you need a band aid I have those two.
11499220	11500220	All right.
11500220	11501220	I don't know if you can put a band aid on my brain.
11501220	11502220	Oh no.
11502220	11503220	Feel better.

11509220	11510220	I miss those.
11510220	11511220	All right.
11511220	11512220	It looks like we do have at least one more call coming in.
11512220	11513220	So let's get to it.
11513220	11514220	Have a great night.

11525220	11526220	How you doing.
11526260	11529260	I actually moved out to Nashville Tennessee.
11529260	11532260	Not in California anymore.
11532260	11536260	I was in Nashville when I was 17 years old for one whole day.
11536260	11538260	Oh really.
11538260	11539260	Yeah.
11539260	11540260	I imagine it's changed a lot.
11540260	11542260	We went to Graceland and signed.
11542260	11544260	I remember writing something on the wall.
11544260	11546260	Where all those messages were to Elvis.
11546260	11548260	And that's all I remember.
11548260	11549260	And show no's.
11549260	11550260	Yeah.
11550260	11551260	That's cool.
11551260	11552260	Yeah.
11552260	11554260	So what's up buddy.
11554300	11555300	No.
11555300	11557300	I was telling you.
11557300	11558300	Well.
11558300	11559300	You know the situation.
11559300	11560300	You know I've talked about it.
11560300	11561300	You guys.
11561300	11565300	I was a home caregiver for my grandparents for 12 years.
11565300	11566300	Right.
11566300	11568300	And unfortunately they passed away last month.
11568300	11574300	And I actually passed through Salt Lake City.
11574300	11576300	A couple days before I left.
11576300	11577300	Right.
11577300	11579300	And they had the Salt Lake City Comic Con.
11579300	11580300	And I went through there.
11580300	11583300	Oh how was that.
11583340	11585340	That was freaking awesome man.
11585340	11587340	They had everybody there.
11587340	11588340	Yeah.
11588340	11593340	I had a couple friends that actually were running the thing.
11593340	11597340	And they had over 100,000 people shut up for that weekend.
11597340	11598340	Holy moly.
11598340	11599340	But.
11599340	11600340	Yeah.
11600340	11603340	It's the third biggest Comic Con in the country right now.
11603340	11604340	Is it really.
11604340	11605340	You know.
11605340	11607340	I am and I'm not surprised to hear that.
11607340	11609340	Because there's a part of you that kind of goes.
11609340	11610340	Or of me anyway.
11610340	11611340	That kind of goes.
11611380	11613380	Well what the hell is there in Salt Lake City.
11613380	11614380	Like who knew there were that many people.
11614380	11615380	But at the same time.
11615380	11616380	Yeah.
11616380	11621380	Like you know there's a lot of very small remote areas just for hundreds of miles.
11621380	11625380	Like Salt Lake City really is the biggest city for hundreds of miles in any direction.
11625380	11626380	I mean it really is.
11626380	11627380	Yeah.
11627380	11628380	Salt Lake City is huge.
11628380	11629380	Like when I think about.
11629380	11630380	Yeah.
11630380	11631380	I went in there on a whim.
11631380	11632380	I was just like well.
11632380	11633380	Because I knew the guys.
11633380	11634380	Because I listened to you guys.
11634380	11638380	And I listened to the guys who used to podcast back in 2010.
11638380	11639380	Right.
11639420	11643420	Their first year was like 10,000 people shut up.
11643420	11645420	And then boom.
11645420	11648420	2014 they had 100,000 people shut up.
11648420	11649420	Wow.
11649420	11651420	And I walked in the front door and there's like a line.
11651420	11653420	And I'm like who's this?
11653420	11655420	Line for it.
11655420	11657420	Nathan fill in right there.
11657420	11659420	Just walked in.
11659420	11660420	That's awesome.
11660420	11661420	Yeah.
11661420	11663420	I mean it was a huge turnout.
11663420	11665420	I mean they're having another one in September.
11665420	11666420	I'm not plugging anything.
11666460	11667460	But I'm just saying.
11667460	11672460	The thing that I found about it was it's like the middle of the country.
11672460	11673460	So you don't have to go.
11673460	11674460	Yeah.
11674460	11675460	Well not middle.
11675460	11681460	But you know if you're on the east coast and you want to go.
11681460	11683460	You know for the right convention.
11683460	11685460	You don't have to travel all the way to Anaheim.
11685460	11687460	For the right convention there's always time for travel.
11687460	11690460	Because I go to Atlanta for Dragon Con.
11690460	11693460	I had a blast last year and already got my ticket for this year.
11693460	11697460	So it's awesome to hear that you had a good time at the convention.
11697460	11701460	I'm sorry to hear about the circumstance that kind of had you moving from one coast to the other.
11701460	11702460	But you know.
11702460	11704460	But now that you're back in.
11704460	11707460	Or now that you're in Nashville have you been doing any gaming?
11707460	11709460	Is there any games that you're into?
11709460	11712460	You know I'm getting at a lot of board gaming man.
11712460	11714460	I got a six year old nephew.
11714460	11718460	And so I'm getting at all these little board gaming.
11718460	11720460	You know just because he's into baseball.
11720460	11724460	And you know I'm trying to teach him a little bit more about strategic stuff.
11724460	11727460	You know so he's learning a lot more about.
11727460	11729460	You know and just sitting down on the table.
11729460	11732460	And just let's think about what we're doing here.
11732460	11736460	I don't think we give board games enough credit here on OLR.
11736460	11738460	And that you know we don't talk about that enough.
11738460	11741460	And board games are awesome.
11741460	11743460	Like who doesn't enjoy a good board game night.
11743460	11745460	Like what a fun way to hang out with friends.
11745460	11748460	And I've been introduced to a lot of like fun ones lately.
11748460	11750460	Like I like well this isn't really a board game.
11750460	11753460	But a Dominion was one that Xtover's partner introduced me to.
11753460	11755460	That I had a lot of fun with that.
11755460	11756460	It's more of a card game I suppose.
11756460	11757460	But that's a lot of fun.
11757460	11759460	And yeah yeah.
11759460	11763460	What's one board game we here at OLR ought to check out?
11763460	11765460	I'll tell you what.
11765460	11768460	You know the best thing and it's something you guys can sit down and play.
11768460	11770460	While you're doing a show.
11770460	11772460	It's called Zombie Dice.
11772460	11775460	And you can buy it at Target for like ten bucks.
11775460	11777460	I've heard of this.
11777460	11779460	Somebody showed this to me once.
11779460	11782460	Tell it quickly because I got to wrap up here soon for time.
11782460	11784460	But quickly what is Zombie Dice?
11784460	11789460	Well it's just like a bar dice game.
11789460	11791460	Like liar's dice or whatever.
11791460	11793460	But you know you just roll your dice.
11793460	11795460	And you're apparently the zombie.
11795460	11800460	And you either roll a brain, a shotgun, or feet.
11800460	11804460	And whoever gets scored a 13 wins the game.
11804460	11811460	And the cool thing about it is like my sister had to do some laundry at the laundromat the other day.
11811460	11817460	And me and my nephew sat at the laundromat and rolled out the Zombie Dice and started playing right there.
11817460	11820460	And everybody else is like what the heck are these people doing?
11820460	11822460	But we're just having fun down at the laundromat.
11822460	11824460	That's great.
11824460	11825460	That's great.
11825460	11826460	Alright.
11826460	11828460	Well Blender Buddy it's so good to hear from you.
11828460	11831460	I always love to hear you know listeners that would call in a lot a few years ago.
11831460	11835460	And then have kind of moved on to whatever and then come on back to the show.
11835460	11838460	So I'm so glad to hear from you.
11838460	11840460	But I hope everything is tricky in Nashville.
11840460	11844460	And thank you for reminding us how amazing board games are.
11844460	11845460	Alright take care buddy.
11845460	11847460	Alright take care buddy.
11847460	11848460	Bye bye.
11848460	11849460	Some folks in chat.
11849460	11851460	We see a few people in our chat room here.
11851460	11854460	Like we have Kaijudo saying board games for the win.
11854460	11858460	Akuma JP says board game is fun if you have friends to play with.
11858460	11861460	Justin says a big fan of Love Letter.
11861460	11864460	It's a super quick card game based on bluffing.
11864460	11868460	Also in that vein, Coup is another great card.
11868460	11870460	Is another great bluffing card game.
11870460	11873460	And Black Wolf says King of Tokyo is awesome.
11873460	11877460	So it sounds like a lot of these games I'm going to have to play over at Dragon Con and so forth.
11877460	11879460	So anyway.
11879460	11881460	That is going to do it for the Skypline tonight.
11881460	11885460	I'm sadly going to close things up because we're really long tonight.
11885460	11886460	And we got to wrap up.
11886460	11888460	We already had a host bail on us.
11888460	11890460	But you know we had to make up for lost time a little bit.
11890460	11893460	So thank you guys for staying up late with us.
11893460	11897460	And thank you guys for supporting the show and listening.
11897460	11899460	And glad you're back after a week off.
11899460	11904460	And let's get ready because it's going to be a heck of a month between E3 and our 12th birthday.
11904460	11905460	And have a lot of fun.
11905460	11906460	You ready Jason?
11906460	11907460	Yeah.
11907460	11908460	It'll be fun.
11908460	11913460	Alright for now let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as we wrap things up.
11913460	11914460	I do want to say really quick though.
11914460	11916460	Of course if you do like what you've heard here at OLR.
11916460	11917460	Don't forget.
11917460	11919460	Support the show by just telling a friend or two.
11919460	11921460	I mean the offers of gifts and things are really nice.
11921460	11924460	But I don't want your money.
11924460	11926460	I know it seems like a weird thing to say.
11926460	11929460	But I want your love.
11929460	11931460	Tell a friend or two about the show.
11931460	11934460	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
11934460	11936460	And yeah.
11936460	11939460	That's all we really ask here at OLR.
11939460	11942460	Just help our family grow a little bit with like minded individuals.
11942460	11944460	That are not jerks when it comes to video games.
11944460	11946460	That are there for the fun.
11946460	11948460	Leave a nice word on iTunes.
11948460	11950460	Stitcher Radio really helps too.
11950460	11951460	And anywhere.
11951460	11952460	Wherever you heard about this podcast.
11952460	11955460	There's probably a bunch of other people waiting to hear about some new podcasts.
11955460	11957460	And we'll hope they'll check us out.
11957460	11958460	Jason.
11958460	11959460	Thank you for being here.
11959460	11961460	As you have been for the past few weeks.
11961460	11962460	We'll see you again next week.
11962460	11963460	As always.
11963460	11964460	You absolutely will because.
11964460	11965460	That's right.
11965460	11968460	Our fun starts 12 hours after the show finishes.
11968460	11970460	And we gotta get in the car early too.
11970460	11972460	Because we gotta be in LA by like.
11972460	11973460	No later.
11973460	11974460	Like 3 or 4.
11974460	11975460	So.
11975460	11976460	Because the Sony thing is like.
11976460	11978460	I think it's like 6 o'clock or something.
11978460	11979460	So.
11979460	11980460	Lots of stuff going on that day.
11980460	11981460	So.
11981460	11982460	We're gonna have a busy busy week next week.
11982460	11983460	Final thoughts for our listeners.
11983460	11985460	I really need to start writing things down.
11985460	11989460	Because I remember having a thought either today or yesterday about a perfect ending.
11989460	11990460	Yep.
11990460	11991460	Don't remember it.
11991460	11992460	Write shit down.
11992460	11993460	Helps you remember.
11993460	11994460	Like get a voice recorder.
11994460	11995460	Just record yourself.
11995460	11996460	Like come on.
11996460	11997460	Alright.
11997460	12000460	My final thought for the night is.
12000460	12001460	It's almost 10 o'clock.
12001460	12002460	Do I still go to the gym?
12002460	12003460	Yes or no?
12003460	12004460	Shane's nodding yes.
12004460	12005460	We'll see.
12005460	12006460	I gotta get up at 630 in the morning.
12006460	12007460	We'll see.
12007460	12008460	Alright.
12008460	12009460	Last but not least.
12009460	12010460	Loki your final thought tonight.
12010460	12011460	I have to go to work tomorrow.
12011460	12012460	Oh my gosh.
12012460	12014460	You gotta work like the rest of us again.
12014460	12016460	Well you've been working from home though.
12016460	12017460	Any full time dad.
12017460	12018460	That's a job.
12018460	12019460	Yeah.
12019460	12020460	It's actually a little.
12020460	12021460	It's easier now.
12021460	12022460	Well except Thursday I have to watch him again.
12022460	12023460	Because.
12023460	12024460	You know our babysitter.
12024460	12025460	She's going to the doctor.
12025460	12026460	In San Jose.
12026460	12027460	It's like three hours fucking away.
12027460	12028460	I hope she's okay.
12028460	12031460	It's usually a specialist of some sort.
12031460	12032460	Anyways.
12032460	12034460	It's just whatever.
12034460	12035460	So.

12042460	12044460	And now I have to talk to you on the phone.
