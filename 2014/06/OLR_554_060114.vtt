Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Since the last show, Amplitude was funded, but it's not all good news as Harmonix denounced a random layoff shortly following the campaign's end. In this final week before E3, Nintendo breathes new life into GameCube controllers. Get out your way, birds, and join us for the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio with this our 554th episode for June the 1st of 2014.

00:45.000 --> 00:59.000
We're here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host back after a week off. We'll get into that in a little bit. Say hello once again to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
How are you? DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm okay, or well.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
You're well? Good. Did you have a good week off last week?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
It was alright.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah? Good Memorial Day weekend as a whole?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
It was alright.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
It was very restful.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
There were too many people at my house on Monday.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, did you guys have like a barbecue pinball-a-thon?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah, I hid.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
Aww. Did you least get Midna? Pick up Midna and run in the other room?

01:24.000 --> 01:39.000
Middles and I hung out for a bit, but it reiterated my pleasure at my barrenness. I'm glad I don't have kids. I'm glad I will never have kids. And I'm glad that other people can take their kids and leave.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
It's okay to love kids for other people's kids, or your own, whatever you're into.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I don't ever want one.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah, that's fair.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
So I have been spending the week in gratitude.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
But there are mothers and fathers to pets out there, which I think you certainly fall in that category.

01:56.000 --> 02:08.000
Midna doesn't talk back. She meows and begs for food. She doesn't run around knocking over my expensive Japanese dolls, nor does she walk around saying that things belong to her when they don't.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
The worst thing she does is sometimes sheds on the bed and claws Dan's chair. That's it.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
Speaking of pinball, I see Bobby in the chatroom, our old pal Bobby Blackwolf, over at live.vognetwork.com. Blackwolf says,

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
Jamie, I played a Metallica pinball table last week. It was euphoric.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm glad you like it.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
I haven't played Metallica pinball. That sounds awesome.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
It was pretty fun. I played it at California Extreme last year.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Good times.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It was really good. Very loud.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
All right. Also say hello, everybody, to Techmaster Loki.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Hello.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
How are you doing, Loki?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Fine.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Playing pinball lately?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
No.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
What have you been up to?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Programming.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
We're having a conversation in the chatroom about the music in Watch Dogs.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
And seriously, some perfect songs that were just missed out in licensing in the game.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Apparently it has really terrible licensed music.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
But I said, hey, they should have totally licensed who let the dogs out.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Because that would have been appropriate for that.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
And then that was followed up with, you know, Dungewell said, sorry, not even Rockwell, somebody's watching me.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I was just going to say somebody's watching me.

03:12.000 --> 03:19.000
That would be awesome. But no, apparently, no, we don't have any humor that would contribute to the game.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Some of the songs might be a little bit more expensive, too.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm sure if the soundtrack on subpar, it was probably some cheap licenses. Who knows?

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
But if they can afford the license who let the dogs out for every single Disney movie that features a dog,

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm pretty sure, you know, recent Disney movies that feature a dog, I'm pretty sure that they could, you know, do this.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
All right.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
Also say hello, folks in studio, joining us once again, filling up the fourth chair as he does for a few weeks at a time.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
He leaves a few weeks at a time. He's back a few weeks at a time.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Say hello, everybody, to Jason.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Throw your wave buttons in the air.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Wave them round like you just don't care.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Thirteen years old, ladies and gentlemen.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
Melee and the birth of the GameCube controller being significant happened thirteen years ago.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
And we're going to probably get another five years at least out of them with the recent announcement.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Which we will cover later.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
Of course, of course. So you've been breaking out the GameCube and getting down with some GameCube games lately?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I don't own a GameCube. I actually never did.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
What?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I missed that one outright.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
What?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I think I have an extra you can borrow.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I was going to say, I think we have two as well. You missed out.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
Well, I didn't. I just didn't. I didn't play it at home. I just played it at other people's houses and whatnot.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
I still to this day think Animal Crossing on GameCube was the best one because it had the free virtual console, essentially.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
There's like twenty old school games tucked away in that game. That's a powerful little disc.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Also F-Zero.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Yes, F-Zero GX.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
F-Zero GX just kind of stands on its own.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
So flipping good.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
You know, there's all these rumors as we're ramping up to E3 week.

04:55.000 --> 05:04.000
There's all these rumors that, you know, GameCube games may become backwards compatible on the Wii U, at least the whole virtual console or whatever.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Anything you would want to check out if that should happen?

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
I don't know that there's anything that I...

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
There's nothing that I know I have missed out on and have not had an opportunity to play.

05:19.000 --> 05:33.000
But it's still a Wii inside there. GameCubes. Like the pins in the 3DS, I think it was, the GameCube lockout is a technical band-aid and not a true compatibility issue.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Anything like that.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
People have unlocked the ability to play GameCube in the Wii channel.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah, that's true.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.000
And I think there's some fud about, oh, the slot loader isn't geared for the smaller GameCube discs, which is technically true, maybe?

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
I think there's an email on this a little later on that we'll get into as well.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Well, then I'll shut my mouth for another hour and a half.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
No, it's fine. A little teaser there before we get into the email segment.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
But I was going to say, there was certainly a lot of GameCube games that could be kind of rediscovered again.

06:06.000 --> 06:16.000
And I would think with the impending Smash Brothers game coming out, there's the old Smash Brothers from GameCube that many people still consider the best one that they've done so far.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
I think a lot of people would be very thrilled to kind of play all over again, so to speak.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Especially if they somehow tweaked online into it.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
Which, you know, I know we kind of go, LOL Nintendo and online.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
But Mario Kart this week, and we'll get into this a little later, Mario Kart this week kind of showed like, alright, we can do this.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Let's do it.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Have classic games actually been changed when they've been brought into the Virtual Console?

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Not a lot. And when it happens, it's really like weird and obscure.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
One that comes to mind is the Genesis version of Street Fighter II, apparently had it on the Wii.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
And it's because, and I didn't even realize this, I guess the Genesis Street Fighter II had code in it for the whole modem thing.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
So they kind of leveraged that to work online.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I don't even know all the details since I never bought it.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
But apparently, yes, some of them have been altered in that way.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
And, you know, I know Nintendo did like the Dr. Luigi, which you can play online.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
And kind of taken some of the old classics and buffed them up like that.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
So it's just a matter of resources. How many resources is Nintendo willing to allocate to that to make it happen?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Interesting.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Because I haven't bought into the Wii U yet, there's just a lot of details that I just don't get firsthand.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
And it's all, you know, I'm going to get one eventually.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Like I mentioned on a previous show, I'm going to step into new consoles eventually.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
And just, my life has changed and money is different nowadays.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
And especially when you're not even home for more than two months at a time.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Something to consider since we're talking about the whole Nintendo and online and all this.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
You know, and we'll talk a little more about Mario Kart 8 in our gaming weeks.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
At least I know I want to talk a lot about that.

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
But with Mario Kart 8 coming out, you know, it's an online game and online is a pretty big component.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Because once you've kind of unlocked everything and done the single player and unlocked everything you can there,

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
there's really not a lot left except to go online and race your friends and things like that, right?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
It's kind of amazing if you think about it.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
Almost every game that comes out that has an online component just craps out on day one.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Mario Kart 8 is working. It's still working. It worked all weekend. It's great.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
Now I know some of you are going to say, oh, but the Club Nintendo Redemptions, that whole thing crapped out.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
Even I, not being a Mario Kart player or Wii U or even I saw that the Club Nintendo was screwed up this weekend.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
But to be fair, you know, you still have like what, 60 days to redeem.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
If you have a long time to redeem those codes, it's fine. That'll resolve itself out.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
And that's honestly not the most important thing.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I would think. I don't know. Maybe for some people it is.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I was able to redeem my free game just persistent.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I just kept trying and trying and trying and trying and eventually it worked.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
But I would imagine if you bought Mario Kart 8 because you really wanted to play free Zelda,

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
then you would have just bought free, or you would have bought Zelda, right?

09:02.000 --> 09:10.000
So I'm thinking, no, because if you buy a game that you, it's the, oh, we had this discussion a couple of weeks ago.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
It was the Halo 3 argument. A lot more people bought Crackdown to try Halo.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Because Crackdown was a good game. It was an interesting game.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
But the people that were devoutly interested in Halo got Crackdown for Halo.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Yes, I'm with you to a point, like I get that point.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
And Mario Kart is a very good game if you're even remotely into racing games.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
And they will, but people will buy a game that they personally are okay with to get a free game they really want.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
But I would argue that Mario Kart 8 is easily better than any of those games they're giving away. Easily.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
It's probably the second best game out on the Wii U right now.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
Well, there's new, I mean, new Super Mario Brothers is bad.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
No, not at all. Not at all. But Mario, again, Mario Kart 8 is the second best game out on the Wii U right now,

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
and the best Wii U game that is out right now is not one of the ones they're giving away.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
And that's Super Mario 3D World. So...

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
It depends on what you're into.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah, I guess so. But my point was, before we got on that tangent, my point was,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
you know, for all practical purposes, where I feel it's the most important, the online functionality of the game,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
it's working and it's working well.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
It uses friend codes if you want to actually join us.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I was hearing something.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
The tournaments use codes, but that's one way to get into them.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
You can also get into tournaments through, I think, like, you can have them be public, searchable, friends only, but the codes are...

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Private, private rooms you need an identifier for.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
You have to realize the term friend code gives a lot of people PTSD.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
In all fairness, Nintendo's making steps forwards, not backwards.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah, hold on.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
With online.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Okay, yes.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
With online.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Huge step forward.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
With online.

10:56.000 --> 11:04.000
And this could have been the perfect Mario Kart game, except for one really stupid oversight.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I have a feeling. Alright, what is it?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
What the fuck were they thinking with Battle Mode?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah, I knew it. I knew it.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
Seriously, it's like, how fucking hard is it just to follow the pattern it's established in every single Mario Kart game?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Hey, let's try something different.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Nobody fucking wants different.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
They want Battle Mode arenas, not Battle Mode.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
I'm too fucking lazy to make a new track, so I'm just gonna make this old track into a Battle Mode.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
It's stupid.

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
I have a feeling it came down to, and I'm not excusing it, because Battle Mode is a weak point in Mario Kart 8,

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
and it's part of the reason I'm not saying it's the best Wii U game, although it is a great Wii U game and an absolute reason to own a Wii U right now.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
But, in all fairness, the Battle Mode is a step backwards compared to the previous games.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I wonder if it didn't come down to performance.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
Not that I'm excusing that, but I noticed there were some other interesting decisions made in the game that seemed to come down to a performance issue,

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
where it had to run HD really smooth, really pushing that hardware.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
And I wonder if, for some reason, the Battle Mode that we all want wasn't possible.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
But then again, it might show up as DLC later. Who knows?

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
I just don't buy that. I think because those tracks are really small, I mean, if they want it...

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
I mean, look at how they had Battle Mode on the Nintendo 64.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I mean, those tracks were pretty simple, and there wasn't much going on.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
They don't really have to make it too flashy and glitzy and stuff.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Just make it a fucking track that's fun to play.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Hell, you could take the old retro things and just kind of go with that.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
The boxes with the lanes and all those kind of things.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Or just, hey, you want to do something really cool?

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Like, have a Mobius strip-type arena or something like that.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I don't know.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Lots of comments from our chatroom on what Loki's saying here.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
And Dark Tetsuya starting things off saying, oh, here comes Loki.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
And yes, all these comments coming from our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com,

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
because we do tape Orange Long's Radio Live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
Tigerclaw saying, Mario Kart is the type of game that you can bring in people who never played a racing game in their life into the genre and have fun.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
You don't have to be a pro to enjoy Mario Kart.

13:14.000 --> 13:22.000
I agree. That's part of the reason why I like Mario Kart and Forza Horizon and some of the more arcade-y blur I thought was a hugely underrated title.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
A lot of those arcade-y style races I think are a lot of fun.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Gene in chat says, I haven't played a battle mode since Nintendo 64, and that was for about 10 minutes.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Weiland says, how else will they justify Battle Arena DLC?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
ActDef wonders, do people play battle mode extensively?

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
DarkTetsuya says, I'll give it to Loki on battle mode, but I don't really play the mode myself, so it's not something I'll miss.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
And ActDef saying, most of the time I play Mario Kart with friends is races.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
I used to play battle mode like crazy, so that's the thing.

13:52.000 --> 14:01.000
I have to admit, when it came to, especially the Super Nintendo and N64 versions, battle mode was played way more than the races.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
Yeah, the racing is fun, and that's fine. They have the racing built in there, but here's the thing.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Don't include it then if you're not going to put effort into it.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
If it's just something you want to do, just omit it, then people will get pissed off.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
But still, it's better than just half-assing it.

14:16.000 --> 14:26.000
I still think what they've got is a little better than that, but I agree that it is a little bit missed that classic battle mode isn't there.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
But for me, honestly, Loki, it's a small blemish on an otherwise great game.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Because when it comes down to it, those races are fantastic.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Yeah, I don't doubt that they are, but that's the problem.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
They could have easily had it perfect, but they half-assed that part.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
And that's what's really sad. I don't know if it's a timed thing or what.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
We'll come back to Mario Kart 8 later, because I want to talk about this during my gaming week.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
We'll talk about all the other games the folks here in the studio have been playing.

14:56.000 --> 15:04.000
But we weren't here last week, and I do want to apologize, because usually I try to warn you guys in advance if we're going to not have a show.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
I didn't do that a couple weeks ago. That's because the cancellation of last week's show was a little bit more sporadic.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
I ended up taking a last-minute road trip for Memorial Day, and it was something very spur-of-the-moment.

15:14.000 --> 15:21.000
And to be honest, I don't really regret it, because it was a great break, and I needed it, and I hope everybody got a great break last week.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
And when you really kind of go back and look at it, three-day weekends...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Except Bobby. We love you for holding the fort.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Yes, we do. We do. But three-day weekends, and Bobby would probably agree with this.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
Three-day weekends are usually our lowest participating times, because between Labor Day and Memorial Day...

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
And we probably won't have a show Labor Day weekend either, but that has more to do with Dragon Con.

15:39.000 --> 15:47.000
But three-day weekends, people are either out of town, and then we have a lot of people that listen to the show on Monday at work.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
Well, there was no Monday at work for many people last week, so I'm sure some of you were looking forward to it and missed it.

15:55.000 --> 16:03.000
Honestly, I was looking into it. The last time we took a show off was when I went to BlizzCon in November.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
So, one week, you guys. One week. Every once in a while is alright.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
Game of Thrones does, what, ten episodes a year? Are you all obsessed?

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
I think it's okay that we take one week off, because trust me, guys, a lot goes into this show, not just what you hear.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
So take a week off is nice.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
But I hope my co-hosts and everybody else had a great Memorial Day weekend.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
But we are back this week to talk about what's going on in gaming news.

16:27.000 --> 16:36.000
Now, since we haven't had a week off in a while, we haven't gotten to do this segment in a while, but the news still goes, even when we don't have a show.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
So it's time to do last week's news set to Holik.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
So let's do last week in gaming news.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Last week in gaming news.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
Some more information on Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U, including the return of Ike to the game.

16:51.000 --> 17:00.000
Also, a new GameCube-style controller ended up being announced for the system, which we'll get into a little more later.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Because I think last week it was more rumor, this week it became fact.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
Not necessarily. The one that they're talking about is the one from PDP that works like a classic controller.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It plugs into the bottom of a Wii remote.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Well, that thing got blown out of the water this week. We'll get into more of that later.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
Also, some news on Hyrule Warriors. Team Ninja is helping out with the game, and Japan is going to be getting the game on August 14th.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
Some of the characters for Hyrule Warriors were displayed, and let's just say it's obvious that Team Ninja is having a part in the game.

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
There's a Nintendo patent out there that some folks speculate is Wii Music 2.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
I don't know why, but that's apparently going to be a thing, so we'll see what happens.

17:39.000 --> 17:48.000
Also, the Amplitude Kickstarter, it happened. It was funded last week. They made $844,000 plus.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
This was thanks to support from Insomniac and other gaming companies. They announced some other artists in the game as well.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Also, Night Trap HD, a thing that might be in the works.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
The Gauntlet game dated September 3rd, and the Oculus Rift coming to Chuck E. Cheese, apparently.

18:05.000 --> 18:12.000
Yes, a virtual ticket grab redemption thing. Oculus Rift and Chuck E. Cheese coming together to bring that.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
We were talking about that a little bit before the show. So we were saying it's Futurama coming to life. Was that you, Jason, saying it's Futurama's happening?

18:18.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, there was a second or third season where they went to, I believe it was the moon. It may have been Mars.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
But the cast of crew was walking through the arcade, and there was Steve Ball.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
That's the very first episode. Or no, second episode.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Was it? Seriously?

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
It was the second episode. The very first delivery that they went was to the moon. He got all excited about it because he was going to go to the moon.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
It was a theme park.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
So they had skee-ball, they had virtual skee-ball, and virtual virtual skee-ball.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
We're only one step away.

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
It's an interesting development for the Oculus technology. There's a part of me that's like,

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
but nothing compares to standing in that little tornado room and trying to grab all the money.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Usually it was like Monopoly money or tickets or whatever, and grabbing all that you can. That's a fun experience.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
It seems like the Oculus would really kind of take away from that, but at the same time, because it is new technology,

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
not a lot of people have really got to explore yet, it does sound kind of neat in that regard.

19:12.000 --> 19:22.000
Is the Oculus technology safe for kids, though? I know I'm probably going to get side-eye for suggesting that.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
The reason why I ask that is that I know the 3DS contains all these warnings for kids.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
So is Oculus okay?

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
Do you really want to have that kind of expensive technology at a place where kids have pizza smeared all over their face?

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
Can you imagine how clean that Rift thing is going to be?

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Remember when they had the Beachhead 2000 machines at Golf Land and stuff like that,

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
where you could lower that thing under your head and the Sumo and all these weird...

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I kind of think...

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
The Sumo, what was that?

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
That was the giant Pokeball you would sit in. I don't know why that came to mind, but it did.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
But anyway, my thought is it might be like a Beachhead 2000 machine,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
where it's more like you lower this big helmet onto your head that would have the Oculus technology.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
It's not going to be like a loose thing. Come on, they'd lose that in an instant.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I'm pretty sure it's going to be part of a larger machine.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
I just don't think it's going to be a big draw, the Chuck E. Cheese.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
Honestly, the ticket machine thing is just kind of...

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
It is what it is. The little kids get excited about it.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
How old are you really going to be to have a party at Chuck E. Cheese?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
You're not going to be that old.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
They don't even let adults in there by themselves. You have to be there for a birthday party.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
You have to have a child as your chaperone.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
Yeah, you have to have a chaperone child. That's a real thing.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
That's how they do it at Fairytale Town.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Yeah, there's a lot of kid-oriented places that do that.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Which I understand there's creepers that they want to keep out,

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
but what about those of us that just want to act like a kid?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
We used to love to go to Chuck E. Cheese in college.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
So that's when I'll borrow Julian.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Let's put it this way.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Can we borrow one of your kids, Loki, to go to Chuck E. Cheese?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Josh likes going to Chuck E. Cheese.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Loki's like, fuck yeah, take him off my hands.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
Here's the thing. The only thing that's good about Chuck E. Cheese is,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
and I assume this is all of them, but they made it really simple.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Now everything is one token to play. Any arcade game is one token.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
That's good.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
It really sucks that they don't have any dancing games because that would be fucking...

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
I would be there all day. One token? Fuck yeah.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I'd be here for a long time.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
You know what's really ironic about that?

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
The barcade out in Denver, the one-up. Same exact principle.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
You know, I noticed it was interesting.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I was talking a lot about Scandia here in Sacramento the past couple of weeks

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
because they got all these music games and I suddenly took interest in going to Scandia.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
And actually, like the 2DX machine, two tokens. Popping music, two tokens.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
I was like, wow, this is really on the cheap compared to what I remember 10 years ago.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
I wish they had those nickel arcades still. Remember when they used to have those?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Like Nickel City and stuff?

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
You know what's funny? Nickel Mania, one of those places that they used to have out in Roseville.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
It's like a golf cart shopping store now, if it's even still there.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
For all I know, they bulldozed it and built a freaking Walmart on top of it or something.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
But this place called Nickel Mania had one of those machines that you got in and you grabbed as much Monopoly money as possible.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
And I don't remember why. I guess they had a ticket counter or something.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
But I also remember they had Mortal Kombat. We used to go there to play Mortal Kombat all the time.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
Really terrible combination with the ticket grabber and Mortal Kombat inside there at the same time.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I applaud their creativity.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
That was also the only place I ever got to play Time Killers.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
Was that what it was? Where you had the buttons like head, limb limb limb limb.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
And like you would keep hitting limb limb limb over and over and you'd like hack off the person's limb.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Is that what the game was called?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
I don't know, it sounds about right.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
It was like Time Killers or something like that.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Because all the characters were from different, like somebody in chat will know.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
But yeah, I used to play that in Nickel Mania all the time.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Those Nickel arcades are awesome.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Don't they still have some of those in the Bay Area? I think they do.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
They used to have them in the Bay Area.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
We actually had one, the last one I remember was up in Old Zack actually.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
They had one there.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And they had a pump it up machine there.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
But that was about it.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
And it was really lame because I went there right when they opened and it was just like,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
and they just have a pump and that's it.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
There's like a few games I'll play and it was just pump.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
But that was the first time I played pump so that was pretty fun.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Good times, good times.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
Alright, let's get into an Alan Alchemy confirming what I was thinking in chat.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Agreeing yes, that is Time Killers. Thank you.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
I just remember there was a guy in it that kind of looked like he was a character from Golden Axe.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Like the little guy that actually had the Golden Axe.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
Like there was a guy like him in it and you'd like lob off people's arms and stuff.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
It was gross but it was fun.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
It was all cartoony so it wasn't like real life like Mortal Kombat was.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
So what you're saying is Thrill Kill got reclaimed into an arcade cabinet and was completely under the radar.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And since it was a cartoon it was okay.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
You know I think we should, since we're talking about fighting games,

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
we should commission the folks behind Dominique Pomplamoose to do a new Clay Fighters game.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
And honestly, and I gotta be honest here, I have no expectations for characters.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
So if you want to do like Blob of Clay 1 and Blob of Clay 2, I'm totally fine with that.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Well let's call Sega up and see what he thinks.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Exactly.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
I know he didn't program it but he's got connections, why not?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
He has a claim. I don't know who owns the rights to that game anymore so who knows.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Clay Fighters? Who did make that game?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
The claim did it.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Yeah, claim.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
So I don't know who has it now.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
Somebody probably bought it on auction for nickels and dimes so I don't know, maybe.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Change that they had from a nickel arcade.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Who knows, who knows.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
One more note.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Oh yeah.

24:45.000 --> 24:53.000
In July 2010, WeGo Interactive in Seoul, Korea purchased all IP related with...

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Oh actually no, that's not everything.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
Throwback Entertainment in Canada. Seems like a likely candidate to own Clay Fighter anymore.

25:01.000 --> 25:09.000
Well I thought for Clay Fighters or like all of the claim stuff, because I know that Warner has a lot of the claim stuff.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Most but not all.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
They have Mortal Combat and Gauntlet.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But that's midway. Nevermind.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Get my companies mixed up again.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Didn't a claim just publish it or...

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Oh it was an interplay, that's right.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Yeah it was.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Whatever, developers, publishers, I can't remember.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
I mean that shit was so fucking old. At least they got half of it right.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
And you never know which one of them really owned it either.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
Because sometimes the developers have to find the publishers, sometimes the publishers contract developer, you know it just depends.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
These were screens that I just kind of glazed over while I was waiting for the theme song to kick in.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Do you have fond memories of Clay Fighters?

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
I know you were a fighting game girl. Did you ever play Clay Fighters?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah, I did.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I would always play...

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Bad Mr. Frosty.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Yes.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And Helga were my two.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
I always liked Bad Mr. Frosty just because I liked hearing you say, Bad Mr. Frosty.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Like the blob.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
You've been a very bad Mr. Frosty.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Alright this might be it guys.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
It is live radio so I have to do live YouTubes but...

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
It was Ocean huh?

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
This also could be a Europe art piece of art we're seeing here.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
That says the right music.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
I was going to say I don't remember vocals but then again I also don't remember music in the game at all.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
I remember the vocals.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
That's what I want to see. I want to see the treatment that...

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
The Super Nintendo version had the vocals in it. That's part of what made it so awesome.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
Like that Killer Instinct had like you know like I think in Killer Instinct it was just this

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Yeah, yeah, woo hoo hoo.

26:49.000 --> 26:56.000
You know an orchids theme but you know it's still it was still like something you didn't hear on Super Nintendo at the time.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Graham Norgate re-released that soundtrack on Bandcamp.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Oh yeah?

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
Yeah and has like slightly extended versions and a couple remixes that kind of stuff.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
Grahamnorgate.bandcamp.com that and Timesplitters and I don't remember the other ones.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
There's a lot of really good stuff on his page.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
Alright well we could reminisce about fighting games all night and we just might but we're going to start with our gaming week.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
StarSagra, how was your gaming week?

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
It's been kind of uneventful just because it's been kind of a weird week for me.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
I've had a lot going on. I have sadly not gotten a chance to play any more Bravely Default.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
I did play more Animal Crossing because it's easy to do during lunch.

27:34.000 --> 27:42.000
I played some Final Fantasy 14 and finally got to go on a treasure hunt that I could contribute to.

27:42.000 --> 27:51.000
Instead of just tagging along and getting you know maybe casting a spell here or there and then maybe getting a little bit of XP out of it.

27:51.000 --> 27:59.000
But yeah. So I still though need someone to run me through whatever that one that I can never remember the name of but I call it the double D's.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Dazmiel Darkholme.

28:00.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah. I still need someone to run me through that one because I'm trying to pull the same thing I did with my WoW character.

28:09.000 --> 28:16.000
And that's you know not pug a damn thing until I'm ready to start pugging things after I've already hit endgame.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Okay.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
I didn't pug anything until I tried to earn a pug.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
The nice thing is in 14 it's really and you know WoW really kind of fixed itself too to be fair.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
A lot of MMOs are kind of going this direction where yes they're massively multiplayer online games.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
But you know some people do kind of want to do their own thing and then have the chat room with swords on the side which is a perfectly acceptable play style.

28:37.000 --> 28:43.000
So the nice thing about 14 is that yeah I mean you can group up to do those things and you know it sounds like you want to touch each thing once.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
But you can get through a lot of it just by doing leaves and you know at least leveling.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
Now yeah you're not going to get through the main story unless you do some of the group up content.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
But at least you can do that once in a while.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
I've got about maybe a fifth of my current level to go and then I can start doing story quests again.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Because I actually really like the story in the game.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
It gets really good at the end too.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
And I'm almost at 46 which is where my next story bit is.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
You get into the really good stuff. The only problem is you start getting these big level gaps where it's like now you can't do anything until 48.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Dear game bite my ass.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Yeah that part's going to suck.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Sincerely me.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
But the story's great.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
PS give me a taco.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
No I had tacos last week by the way.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Congrats.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
They were amazing.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
And I did though and we will be touching on this later.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I did buy the RPG Humble Bundle.

29:38.000 --> 29:45.000
Because I had been looking for a way to do RPG style comics.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
You know like RPG text.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
And I think instead of going the flash route so that they are playable on an iOS device.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Is I'm going to program them into RPG Maker.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
And then record them.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Nice.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
So that they are just teeny movies.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
That's a neat use of it.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
Because I didn't really think about oh you can do other things than just make games necessarily.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Yeah but I have ideas for something.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
It's right now kind of in the idea phase.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
So hopefully I'll have time for it.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
At least you've got your canvas now.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
At least I have my canvas exactly.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
There you go. Awesome.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
Alright well let's move on over to Loki.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Who is speaking of canvas.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I think he's been busy working on his new games.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I don't know if you've played anything else but what's up Loki?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah I did play one thing.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I played No Brakes Valet last night.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Because I bought that for my Android.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Just because I was trying to show.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Josh was looking at.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
There was like some cars or something in this book we were looking at.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
And I'm like yeah it reminds me of this game like No Brakes Valet.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
I'm all you totally love it.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
It's cars crashing into each other.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
So I'm like okay watch this.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
And so I downloaded it.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Well first off I was surprised that they had it for Android.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
And they have it and it's actually way better than the Wii U version.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
Although I don't know if they updated it with the Wii U version.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
But it's got more tracks and different cars.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
And it's a lot fancier.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
But still fun and a good time waste.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
So I played that.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
But that was pretty much all I played this week.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I'm still working on game stuff.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
Because I've been trying to optimize some of my models in the game.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
And I tried it one way and it didn't work like I wanted it to.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
So I'm trying it another way now.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
And hopefully that one will work.

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
Although I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to do it.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Because it gets complicated with rotations and stuff.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Anyways so I'm trying to get past all that stuff.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
So I can get to actually making some models.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Because that will be fun.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
And that was pretty much it.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
I got a copy of Watch Dogs but I haven't played it yet.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
So they gave me one for doing something at work.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Quickly.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
He's like I need a favor for you if you do this I'll give you a Watch Dog.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
I'm like okay cool.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
So I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
But it looks fun.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
I'm not sure if I want to start it.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Because I only have so much free time.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
I kind of want to focus on programming stuff and not playing games right now.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
We'll see.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Alright.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Jason why don't you go next.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
How was your gaming week?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
It was actually pretty interesting.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
My office now also has a Wii U.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
They got it principally for Mario Kart.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
But at the same time for some reason it didn't come in on Friday.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
So I suppose I'll be playing it this coming week instead.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
But there was New Super Mario Brothers Wii U and Super Mario 3D World.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
So I actually got to sit down and I played the entire first world of that game.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
And then more Titanfall as well.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
And I think that's pretty much it at a high level.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
But there was something kind of funny.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
A coworker had just finished setting up, playing the Wii U, updating and all that kind of stuff.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
And he was playing New Super Mario Brothers U.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
And I was playing Titanfall.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
And I just kind of looked over at the other TV.

33:07.000 --> 33:17.000
And the Wii U's graphics were rich, vibrant, colorful, primary and just fun.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.000
And then I turned back to Titanfall and it's dark, mechanic, gritty.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
It was, you know, there was of course a granularity argument.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Because I was playing a first person shooter and comparing it to a 2D platformer.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
2D side-scrolling game.

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
But it was just like, we all know this kind of thing.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
But it just really smacked me because the two TVs are side by side right there.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
And I just kind of take even a second to look over.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
It's like, that's really warm and inviting.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Well I guess I have to go shoot this guy over here.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
Yeah, it was just an odd comparison because I don't usually see those situations of things being side by side like that.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
As invariably a lot of you have seen me posting about on Twitter.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
I have like 30 clips from Titanfall that are relatively interesting to me.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
And I really want to hold on to them.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
But going through and uploading them one by one is a pain in the ass.

34:11.000 --> 34:19.000
And it's hilarious to me because I snarked about why when the PS4, the most recent console update happened.

34:19.000 --> 34:25.000
I said, why would you want to copy your footage off to a USB drive when you have a capable editor on the PS4?

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
Well, now I want to be able to copy my footage off the Xbox One.

34:28.000 --> 34:35.000
And I don't think there's a way to do that unless I manually pick a clip, don't do anything to it.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
But I have to name it, send it to my OneDrive and just, oh God.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah, I very much want to extract my videos off of that.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
But I don't think I'm going to be able to. And it's very unfortunate.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
I wonder if that's something they'll end up patching in.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
Just because especially when, you know, I talked a few weeks ago about PlayStation 4 share factory.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
And how, you know, for a free download, it's a pretty rad little thing.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
And you can just yoink things right over to your USB drive.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
And it made me realize you could take any of your videos and put them on USB drive very easy.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
And upload studio is great. It is powerful, but it's fucking slow.

35:10.000 --> 35:17.000
And I want to just take what I have and be able to, I should try plugging in a mouse and keyboard to the one.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
It's not going to change anything because like the transition from screen to screen is slow.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
And because I have to go one clip at a time to preserve each individual clip.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
But sometimes you want to edit them your way. You don't necessarily want to edit it, you know, Microsoft's way.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Absolutely.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
You know, when I was, you know, again, I have to relate things to share factory because I don't have a one.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
I have a PlayStation 4, but I know a share factory.

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
One of my things I said might be a drawback is that there are only like four or five templates in the thing.

35:43.000 --> 35:54.000
So you're going to see the same damn thing over and over unless game companies or Sony starts releasing DLC either free or small premium expansions to it.

35:54.000 --> 36:01.000
So I could see where there's a desire for people to want to just give me the files and I'll do it on Premiere my way or I'll do it on the thing my way.

36:01.000 --> 36:11.000
You know, hopefully, you know, as gaming on YouTube and Twitch and all that gets even bigger and bigger, we'll probably see easier ways to do that.

36:11.000 --> 36:21.000
There is actually one last thing I've been playing through more and more of Rusty's Real Deal Baseball, which is for a, you know, for an initially free game.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
But the fact that you can get all the content for about nine dollars.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
No, probably more like 12 because they're all they range.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
If you if you do it right, everything's just under two dollars.

36:34.000 --> 36:48.000
But for a 15 dollar game, they do whoever like specifically developed that game is a genius because they are taking every single fundamental of baseball and drilling into it.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
So low level, like so deep into just the specific mechanics of it.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
And it's it's damn near like rote memorization.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
But it's really strangely fun.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I only have like three of them so far.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
Umpire Simulator, swinging practice, catching practice.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I'm going to get Fielding next.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
It's really massive amounts of fun.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
It is surprisingly fun.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
All right. Nice.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
All right. Is that it for game week?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
I think so.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
All right. Let's talk about my gaming week.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I actually have had my hands on a few games this week.

37:19.000 --> 37:25.000
The first one I want to talk about, which I'm going to full disclosure possible conflict of interest here.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I do a show called Hoard House with my buddy.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
What? Why can you figure me?

37:30.000 --> 37:36.000
OK, I do I do a show called Hoard House with my buddy Ecstifer and his partner is a designer on this game.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
So but they've been telling me I've got to play this for forever.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
So finally this week I played Rocksmith 2014.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
So I'm not really going to review the game, but I'm just going to say I have been playing it.

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
And I was pretty impressed at the I don't know the first goddamn thing about playing the guitar.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Right.

37:52.000 --> 38:02.000
But the neat thing about Rocksmith 2014 is that it made it look more like rock band, where instead of maybe pressing buttons, it was.

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
Here is a picture of the entire guitar.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
What do they call the neck or the entire length of the guitar, the neck, the frets.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
Then then I think it's the neck and the frets are the individual sections.

38:14.000 --> 38:20.000
OK, so like it might zoom in and show you like three frets and then start to zoom out if you have to go to a different one.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
And you kind of learn that the dots are sort of placement on the guitar, like because, you know, it's it's a real guitar.

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
And yeah, like it I found that I was able to play something like Foo Fighters Everlong.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Now, I wasn't able to play the whole thing like it's a real guitar.

38:34.000 --> 38:40.000
But when you first start, it's like, OK, you'll play like one note here, one note here, one note here.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
And then the game kind of learns. All right. You did pretty good on that.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
In fact, you've probably mastered about eight percent of the song.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
So the next time you play it, we're going to balance it for you.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
And it adds a few more notes in. So you learn to play a little more and then a little more.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
You know, so that's kind of the approach in Rocksmith.

38:55.000 --> 39:02.000
So I was really surprised that it actually does kind of work because I was a little bit like a little bit apprehensive.

39:02.000 --> 39:10.000
Like, is Rocksmith really going to be able to kind of like teach me real guitar without these boring lessons that I sit through and all that?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
But they definitely have developed a way to do it.

39:12.000 --> 39:18.000
So, you know, and whether you want to believe me or not, because of what I just told you, that's fine.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
But I just would say I was I was pretty impressed with it.

39:21.000 --> 39:27.000
So if you have an interest in learning how to play the real guitar, this definitely seems to be a way to do it if you're a gamer.

39:27.000 --> 39:33.000
My only my only thing was that and I'm going to be on the song list.

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
There was a lot of stuff in there I didn't recognize, but I also don't listen to a lot of rock music.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
I'm sure if you guys listen to more of that, you'd see more of that in there.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
But I wouldn't have to fix that.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
I know, right? It's just weird. It's just kind of what I do.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
But most stuff I listen to tends to be more like synth.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
In fact, if they had a Rocksmith for like piano or keyboard, I would be all over that.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
I'll be all over that. So I'm kind of kind of secretly hoping that's where they go next with it.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
But anyway, with with Rocksmith or whatever, I didn't know like a whole lot of songs.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
But when I went into the shop, the DLC, I was like, oh shit, Smashing Pumpkins.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
I know that. Oh shit. Garbage. I know that. Oh shit. Maroon 5.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Like there was all these songs in the store I knew.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
I was like, oh, well, I got to spend all that money if I want to get it.

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
But there you go. So I liked I liked Rocksmith.

40:24.000 --> 40:32.000
Other games I played this week. I played Zelda The Wind Waker on HD on the Wii U

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
because that was the free game I got with Mario Kart 8.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I did not play a lot of this on the GameCube, to be honest.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
I was living with Loki at the time that game came out. I remember.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
And I watched Loki play it. And so I never really got hands on it myself.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
I just watched Loki play some of it.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
I have a copy somewhere. I think it's my sister's storage.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Because I asked her, I'm like, I want my GameCube back. Because I want to play that.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
And then she's like, it's in storage. I'm like...

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
All these years later. Yeah. But when it first came out, I seem to remember watching you play it.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
And I was always a little put off by like, oh, it's like there's no world.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
It's all these little islands. And it's just all this freaking water to get everywhere.

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
But I don't know. Revisiting it on the Wii U, I'm like super into it.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
I don't know why. I can't really put my finger on it.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
But I'm just like, it's something that the game does look really good.

41:22.000 --> 41:29.000
Because, you know, even though the Wii U isn't necessarily the same oomph as the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One, excuse me,

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
it can do the cartoony looks very, very, very well.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Which obviously Wind Waker's style is all in that.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
And it is really nice having that item screen on your gamepad so you don't have to keep flipping back and forth all the time.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
Same thing with the maps and all that. So even that integration alone is worth it.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
The whole...

41:46.000 --> 41:53.000
I'm not saying I would be totally down for a toon shaded Zelda game that's like Link to the Past or something.

41:54.000 --> 42:02.000
That would be amazing if they did a new game like that where it's just Hyrule with all the exploration and stuff in there.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
That would be awesome.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
Also, I'm looking in chat with some other comments here. Sorry, there's some comments on Rocksmith I want to go back to real quick.

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
Dark Tetsuya says, maybe they could call it Rock Synth? Talking about the keyboard game. That would be amazing.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
Akuma JP says, Skye, was it fun enough to keep you playing Rocksmith?

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
Yes, I want to go back and play more, actually. If I can put down some of these other games.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Did you play the arcade stuff?

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
No, I didn't. I only played the learning the songs. There's still stuff in the game I haven't even looked at yet.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
That's another reason why I didn't really want to review it. I'm just really giving you impressions.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Like these are my thoughts. My stream of consciousness thoughts of the game as I usually do.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
So yeah, Wind Waker, I'm having a lot of fun revisiting it.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
The Miiverse integration stuff is a little silly, in my opinion.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
You can take these little selfies and attach them to Miiverse notes and they show up in other people's games.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
If you set your games so that you can get the little messages in a bottle.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
I mean, I'm not knocking on it. It's cute.

42:59.000 --> 43:05.000
But it's definitely one small little dip in the grander scheme of things.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
It's still a fun Zelda game that I'm having fun exploring all over again.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
But let's be real. This week has been all about Mario Kart 8.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
That's all anybody's talking about this weekend, it seems.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
It's interesting because Watch Dogs just came out on Tuesday.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
And if my Twitter feeds any indication, everybody already forgot and is playing Mario Kart 8.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
No offense to you Watch Dogs fans out there, which I'm sure there are many.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
But it really seems like Mario Kart 8 has really taken over the conversation the past couple days.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
And that's probably a really good thing for Nintendo.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
Because I can't remember the last time the Wii U has been dominating the conversation since it launched.

43:37.000 --> 43:43.000
Not even Mario 3D World over the holiday really got that same level of conversation.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Well, there's been a lot of conversations, but none of it's been positive.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
Fair enough. But you know what I mean. The type of buzz Nintendo wants.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
So, yes, Mario Kart 8 is out.

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
And let me talk about the good, and I'll talk about the not so good.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
I did mention earlier, I believe this is the second best game that the Wii U has at this time.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
It's that good. The first being Mario 3D World.

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
I don't think it's as good as that, but I think it's still really, really, really, really damn good.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Especially for you fans of Mario Kart.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
I think it's probably the strongest Mario Kart game in quite a while.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Quite a while.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
Unless you're a huge fan of Battle Mode like Loki.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
And I will say that is definitely one of the minuses.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
Is that Battle Mode, it isn't really what you remember.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Instead, it's let's go opposite directions.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
Because you know you're going to unlock all the courses backwards.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Because that happens in Mario Kart games.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
So it's let's race on the course in both directions.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
And when we pass each other, we'll kill each other.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
It's kind of, so it's yeah.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Anyway.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
Other things though I want to talk about Mario Kart 8.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
The good.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Track design is great.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Some of the courses, gorgeous to look at.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
The game looks so good on the Wii U.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
You know, again it goes for that cartoony look.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
And I was playing the game and even Shane commented and I had to agree.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
He's watching me play and he goes, why did Mario 3D World look this good?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Why didn't they use some of these textures in Mario 3D World?

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
And I kind of had to say like, yeah that's a good point.

45:13.000 --> 45:18.000
I don't know why some of the other Wii U games we see don't look quite as good as Mario Kart.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
But it looks great.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
It's gorgeous.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Like some of the stages are pretty amazing too.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Like there's this twisted mansion.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Like which is basically like the boo house that you go through.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
And depending on if you go left or right, you'll either be on the ceiling or on the floor.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
And you kind of race.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
So you might be like literally have people above you as you're racing.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
And you know all those shortcuts.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
I think one of the most impressive courses in the game is Bowser's Castle.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
Because there's this room where you go by a giant Bowser.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
And he punches the sides of the track.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
So he'll punch the left side.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Then he'll punch the right side.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And as he punches it, it twists and turns.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
Because you know the whole big thing in Mario Kart 8 is anti-grav, right?

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
And your car is suddenly turned into Tron when you run over certain parts of the track.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
And you're like going up walls and shit.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
It's crazy.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
So the track design, and they do this stuff on the old tracks too.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
Like they actually found ways to put anti-grav on the old tracks.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
And sometimes it's, hey look it's Mario Kart Circuit from the Super Nintendo.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
Except now we've elevated part of the course.

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
And instead of going around a loop, it now is a vertical loop that you go up and around.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
It's really crazy, stuff like that.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
But really impressive to look at from a graphical part.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Now actdeftinchat says, Mario 3D World looks great.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
I do agree actdeft. Mario 3D World does look great.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
I wouldn't have called it my favorite Wii U game if I thought it looked like crap.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
But I'm just saying, Mario Kart 8 feels like the bar has gone even higher.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
You know what I mean?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Like in a very short amount of time.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
So this is very interesting.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Also good.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
For all the LOL Nintendo and online and Nintendo doesn't get online and all this stuff we talk about.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
Online works really fucking well.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I didn't get any hiccups when I played.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Didn't see any lag.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
There is lag. The game is accommodating for it somehow.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I don't know how, but it's doing it.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I played a couple online races.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
One with a friend that lives in South Carolina.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
One random match I had a whole bunch of people join.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Like some over California, some in other places.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
And they all ran really well.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
Yes, there is voice chat. It works only in the lobby.

47:18.000 --> 47:23.000
But because your Wii U gamepad has the microphone built in, you just talk and the Wii U gamepad picks it up.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
And you hear everybody else.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
There's a little bit of a delay.

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
It's instantaneous, but I don't think Xbox Live or Playstation Network are any different in that regard.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
So sometimes you'll hear a little bit of echoing, but all things considered.

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
I'm voice chatting on a Nintendo online game.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Oh my god, party like it's 2004.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
So that's only in the lobby and not in the races?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
It is only in the lobby and not in the races.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
That's one, and it's only when you're with friends, not with strangers.

47:49.000 --> 47:54.000
They have the whole text, the pre-determined phrases that they have for those other times.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Which is fine, whatever. It gets the job done.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I don't want to hear strangers anyway.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
I was a little disappointed it doesn't exist in the races.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
But I also find that during the races, I'm focused on the race.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
And it's probably for the best that other people can't hear the things I'm calling them.

48:09.000 --> 48:16.000
It would be fun though that if you could have those phrase bubbles or whatever on your gamepad and come by like,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Loser!

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
And also, I thought there was a really good variation of cart mods.

48:23.000 --> 48:28.000
Which the earlier Mario karts, the last couple have had this too.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
But there is definitely a variety.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
And the variety also extends to the character roster.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
There's 30 characters you can play as.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
And I think the addition of the Koopa Kids actually was a really smart add to the game.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
It really helped diversify the roster.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
However, one small drawback I have with the game is that

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
Some of the characters they have on the roster are a pretty big stretch.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
And I get why they do it. They're trying to have these different weight classes.

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
Because all three characters, they're all over the spectrum in weights.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
You don't just have light, medium, heavy anymore. They're all over.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
But some of the characters are a little dippy.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
I mean, really? Who's looking forward to playing as Baby Rosalina?

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
Or Pink Gold Peach?

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
Or for that matter, Metal Mario, who I think is a little bit of a ridiculous character as well.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Or some of these other characters in the game, you just kind of look at it and go,

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
No. Couldn't we have put another character in the game instead?

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
And I think Shane or Alan or somebody was saying this the other night.

49:28.000 --> 49:33.000
If you want another heavy class, why have we never seen Wart from Mario Bros. 2

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
ever show up in another Mario game ever?

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
Like, Wart would have been an awesome heavy racer that could be there instead of Metal Mario.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Because he technically wasn't a Mario enemy.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
Yeah, but neither were the Shy Guys and they show up.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
I mean, if we go with that logic, then there's other Mario 2 inspired movies.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
The Shy Guys have shown up in other Mario games.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
Didn't Wart show up later on in something else? I thought he did.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
I didn't think so.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Hmm. Still, I mean...

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
But my point is that Birdo made the transition.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
Originally debuted in 2 and has been prolific in the universe.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
Good point. I didn't even think of Birdo. Birdo doesn't show up in the game as a racer.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
That's very disappointing. I would have taken Birdo over Toadette.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
That's for sure.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Because they have to diversify.

50:15.000 --> 50:23.000
If my brother's playing Metal Mario, then sister needs to play Metal Peach or whatever.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
They're just trying to even it out that way.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Let's see. Tigerclaw says, Here's the thing.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
Nintendo added all seven Koopalings to the roster. Why not include Bowser Jr.?

50:33.000 --> 50:40.000
Because they have... Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Baby Rosalina.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Do they really need Baby Bowser on top of all that?

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
Or they could have put Dixie Kong, Diddy Kong.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Yeah. Why not Dixie Kong?

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
Oh, because it doesn't really fall into the whole Mario Brothers thing.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Donkey Kong Jr. There you go.

50:52.000 --> 50:59.000
I do think it's great that Mario Kart does have a really good balance of male and female racers.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
I think that's really good and a good thing for the industry as a whole.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
One thing Nintendo does very well is that they always have a lot of good male and female characters.

51:06.000 --> 51:12.000
But when you're kind of stretching it, literally Peach is playable three different ways.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
And so is Mario for that matter.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
But like you said, Dixie Kong.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I don't think they should have had any of the baby characters.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
I don't think that they should have had the metal characters.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Even the Koopalings are kind of like...

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
Don't knock it till you've tried it. The Koopalings are pretty diverse.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
It just seems like they're trying to pad that roster in to make it even bigger than it is.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I think that's okay.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
But I think what it is, Loki.

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
I think what people are really clamoring for is they want Nintendo Kart, not Mario Kart.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Because then we start to say, well, why not have Zelda?

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
Why not have Link? Why not have...

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
I think that would have been a great idea because they could have been a little bit fresh with their tracks.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
Don't get me wrong. I like the retro tracks in there.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
But I think that as of late, they've been getting kind of lazy with having a lot of retro tracks in there.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Granted, this is the one they did updated.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
That's what they do in Mario Kart games.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
Every single Mario Kart game has half new, half old.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
And that's part of the charm.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I totally disagree with you there.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
I look forward to seeing what retro tracks are available and how they've messed with it.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Because there's some really cool tracks that have come back.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Well, I'm sure we'll see DLC.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
I hope so.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
If Sonic can have a Zelda course in it, I'm sure we'll have a Sonic course.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I hope so.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
The character roster thing, though, is honestly only a very minor bitch.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
Because I get that they want to have all these selectable and customizable things.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
And that's a good thing, but it's just like, really?

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
And Weiland's telling me to shut up because he plays Baby Rosalina.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
Sorry, but it's just, you know, I had to pick on somebody.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Alright.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
The only other thing that I think is a drawback about the game and an otherwise fantastic game is that

52:52.000 --> 52:59.000
I thought it was really weird that in two-player mode, you could not have one person on the screen and one on the gamepad.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed did that.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Why can't Mario Kart do that?

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
You have to have the split screen side by side.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
And I understand the answer might be it was a performance issue.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
When you do that, you have the frame skip.

53:15.000 --> 53:23.000
And I go, okay, well that's an explanation, but it doesn't make it feel any less like, why can't you do that?

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
I mean, you guys have to understand, although you might say, oh well the reason is because of technology.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
Well then the technology needs to be better or something because it seems really weird.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Or at least give me the option.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
If I play that way and I don't like the frame rate skip, then I go back and play the other way.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Or maybe what they used to do in the F-Zero game that was on GameCube.

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
I don't know if you guys noticed in the game, but they would actually take some graphical liberties with the tracks.

53:47.000 --> 53:53.000
And when you had four players playing at once, the tracks weren't as graphically involved so that it could get that performance out of it.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
And I would have liked to see something like that.

53:55.000 --> 54:03.000
I thought it was so weird that I couldn't have one on the gamepad, one on the screen, when one of the launch titles racing games had that.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
And yes, the performance suffers a little bit, but it's not awful.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
It's not anywhere near awful.

54:10.000 --> 54:16.000
But that Sonic racing game, as fun as it is, it's just not in the same club as Mario Kart.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
But anyway, so yes.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Well they have Danica Patrick.

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
Which actually, knock that all you want, but she's a lot of fun to play in that game, so whatever.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Whatever with you.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Let's see.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Let's see.

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah, Loki, the classic tracks don't even feel like classic tracks. They feel new.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
Granted, they screwed up Rainbow Road.

54:40.000 --> 54:48.000
Yeah, they took Rainbow Road from the Nintendo 64, and although it looks gorgeous in the game, because Rainbow Road on Nintendo 64 was so long, right?

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
They just made it a one-lap race that they split into three parts.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Yeah, Loki's rolling his eyes over there.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
But you know what? It's not that big a deal.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I really don't think it's that big a deal.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Yeah, that's dumb.

55:01.000 --> 55:06.000
I still think that Rainbow Road is better than the new one they put in there. I don't like the new Rainbow Road at all.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
But, there's like a dance club level.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I don't even, the Electrodome, I think it's called.

55:11.000 --> 55:20.000
That level is badass. That's like a little dance club, and you see these big monitors where shy guys and Koopas are getting down, dancing on the sides as you're racing through.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
And then as you're racing on the track, the little neon lights light up on the track as you're racing.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
And then as you do the skids, the neon lights change color.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
And it's such just a subtly awesome effect.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Anyway, I didn't even get into the online stuff.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.000
And the whole like, yes it puts together these highlight reels and you can upload them to YouTube.

55:36.000 --> 55:42.000
And it's a really creative way to kind of try to match what PlayStation 4's got going on with the share button.

55:42.000 --> 55:49.000
I sort of think these YouTube clips are going to be a dime a dozen and they're going to lose their effectiveness really fast.

55:49.000 --> 55:57.000
But for those, like if you have a lot of people over and you want to relive those epic moments like when somebody got hit with a red shell right before they were about to cross the finish line.

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
Those highlight reels serve a pretty good function and I think is an interesting addition to the game.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
So, anyway.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
Alright, that's it. That's all I'm going to say about Mario Kart 8. I've said plenty.

56:09.000 --> 56:14.000
But overall, even though it sounds like I had a lot of negatives, the positives far outweigh the negatives.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
And it's a must own game if you are a Wii U owner.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
And if you're not a Wii U owner, I think this one's going to tip it a lot of ways.

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
I have heard of several people on Twitter went out and got the Mario Kart bundle for the Wii U.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Thought about it.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
Even Loki. Even Loki thought about it.

56:30.000 --> 56:40.000
I like Mario Kart, but I had to say, listen, am I going to pay $300 for Mario Kart?

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
And I was just like, you know, I don't know. Not right now maybe.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
It would be Mario Kart and Zelda because you still get the freebie or whatever.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
I probably wouldn't do Zelda actually.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Or Mario U or whatever you want to get.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
I don't know, but I just, I don't know. We'll see.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
It's like if I got it, you know.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
I think there's a lot of people teetering and now is going to be a great time.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
I don't think it's going to happen at E3, but I think by the holiday comes around.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Well yeah, there's still time too.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
You have now between now and was it the end of July to kind of decide whether you want to do that or not?

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
So, wait for E3, see what announcements they have.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
You know, then that might be worth it.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
I still think come the holiday after that promotion is over, I think Nintendo might come out and finally say,

57:19.000 --> 57:23.000
alright, $50 off. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
I think a lot of us think that that kind of thing has to happen sooner rather than later though.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
Even going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
Rababa says, you made it sound more positive than negative.

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
Oh good. I don't like to be the negative gamer, but I am going to point out issues I have with the game.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
You know, but overall it's so good.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
SonicM88 in chat says, I just bought my bundle today, but it was mainly for Wind Waker.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
Interesting. I guess there are a lot of people that are getting into that Wind Waker.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
So, alright.

57:52.000 --> 57:58.000
Anyhow, that's it. We are going to get into some gaming news, but I want to do housekeeping real quick.

57:58.000 --> 58:04.000
Do add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and also we are on Google Plus,

58:04.000 --> 58:10.000
google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, and Twitter, twitter.com slash olr.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
A few things coming up as of note.

58:12.000 --> 58:19.000
Speaking of Mario Kart, some other podcast frenzies of mine and I and us here at OLR

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
are going to get together for a Mario Kart tournament on the 22nd,

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
which happens to also be a big night for us because that's going to be our big birthday show.

58:28.000 --> 58:35.000
So, plan on the podcast cross zone tournament happening on June 22nd.

58:35.000 --> 58:40.000
And the details are being finalized right now, so I'll have more info for you probably next week.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
But just kind of set aside some time there to participate in that tournament.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
I think we're going to give away a game, and it's all in celebration of podcast cross zone.

58:49.000 --> 58:56.000
There's going to be a panel at GamerX again this year with myself, the guys from Koopa Club,

58:56.000 --> 59:04.000
the guys from Game Buoy, the guys from Game Bar, that's G-A-Y-M-E-B-A-R, and Video Game Realness.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
I'm not sure if they're actually attending in person, but they'll be there in spirit because they're awesome too.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
They're going to be there as well, and I feel like I'm leaving somebody out and I'm feeling horrible.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Probably because there's OLR and Horde House.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
Shit, if I'm leaving somebody out, then I'm really, really, really sorry, but I think that's it.

59:20.000 --> 59:29.000
But all those groups are getting together to bring you the podcast cross zone tournament on the 22nd, so stay tuned for more information on that.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
That'll be a lot of fun.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
And then there's going to be, we'll do something with VOG as well.

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
Like I know, especially when Mario Kart 7 first came out, we were playing all the time on breaks and things like that,

59:38.000 --> 59:45.000
so we'll look at doing something similar to that for those of you guys that are really into Mario Kart and want to race online and all that.

59:46.000 --> 59:52.000
Also, I want to give a quick shout out to another podcast that was kind enough to have me on their program this week.

59:52.000 --> 59:58.000
The podcast is called Killer Queens from Outer Space, and it's episode 13 that I was on.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
The interesting thing is that it actually is no video game talk from me on this particular show,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:11.000
because this is a podcast about movies, focusing a lot on scary movies, which I'm not usually super into,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
but this particular week was on musical and cult scary movies, which is the stuff I do.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000
So we talked Rocky Horror, we talked Repo, the genetic opera, and because I guess the Blu-ray just came out,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
this movie came up, and I'm a big fan of this scary movie, Sleepaway Camp.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Which if you've never seen Sleepaway Camp, don't spoil it.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
You've got to go into this movie not knowing anything about it.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
It's like a really cheesy thriller from the 80s, and if you don't know the ending...

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Didn't they remake that? I thought they were talking about remaking that.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I think they did another sequel, like a Sleepaway Camp 4 or something that came out not that long ago.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
But do you know what I learned on Killer Queens from Outer Space?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
This has nothing to do with video games, but I have to share this. I learned this on Killer Queens from Outer Space.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Did you know that in the flashback scenes, there's a little boy, right? In the flashback scenes that you see, right?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
That little boy is the situation from Jersey Shore's brother.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Because apparently that guy was at some screening that one of the hosts on this show went to, and I was like, get the hell out.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I scoffed, and then I chuckled.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:26.000
That was the situation's brother was in Sleepaway Camp, and that makes it like ten times funnier if you know what the ending is.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
But I'm not going to say anything.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And SSG100Matt is like, oh god, Sleepaway Camp is on Blu-ray? Yep.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
We'll talk all about it on that show, so check that out. That was episode 13 of Killer Queens from Outer Space.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
They're on iTunes and all that good stuff, Twitter. Just Google it, you'll find it.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Alright, now we can get into some news.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
A little bit of gaming news this week. A little lighter leading up to E3 week.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Next week I think is going to be a ton of news, and then of course in two weeks there's a ton.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Speaking of E3, I should get this out. I was going to talk about this at the beginning of part B, but I guess I'll say this quickly now.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.000
VOG will be at E3 2014, just like we were last year, except there's more of us going this year.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Last year Bobby had to do it by himself. This year myself, Bobby, and Jason all going to E3.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And we will be participating in the interactive coverage.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
If you want to check this out, just go to E3.vognetwork.com.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I think for the next couple days you're still going to see 2013's coverage, but I'll give you a taste of what it is.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But Bobby's going to flip the switch to turn it to 2014 at some point this week.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
In a nutshell, we do not want to be the first place that you go to for E3 news.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Because we can't be that. We're not going to be delusional.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000
You're going to watch streams online. You're going to watch the TV stations.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
You're going to look at the Twitch, or you're going to go to these big corporate sites because they always get the exclusives.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And that's fine. We understand we can't compete with that.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
So we don't want to be the first. We want to be the second.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Now that you're armed with all the script information, because they're just reading all the bullet points and script.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Now that you're armed with what all those first sites are giving you, what is it you really want to know about the games?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
That's what we're after at the Voice of Geeks Network is letting your voices be heard on the floor at E3.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So you can actually post questions to our board by clicking on an interactive site map of the E3 show floor.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Let's say you have a question for Konami. You can click on Konami's booth.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Let's say, heaven forbid, they announce a new DDR game at E3 or something.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
You can click on Konami's booth and you can ask a question like, is Sandstorm going to be in it?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
We will try to find out that answer for you.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Keep in mind, some companies, not as forthcoming as others.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
We will try our best, I guarantee it.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
But usually the bigger the company at E3, the tighter the script.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And they don't really like to deviate from that.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.000
If they talk about Kingdom Hearts 3 at E3, probably they're not going to take questions on it.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Nobody's probably going to be talking about it because they're just not ready to.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But if you like games from those developers that are a little bit, not maybe the first tier, triple A developers,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
but maybe the A minus B plus developers, they tend to send their creators to E3.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000
They'll talk a lot more about their games and if you have questions about them, we will do our darndest to find answers.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And we got some great answers last year.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
We had some chat with the folks behind The Witcher 3, which I think we're seeing them again this year.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I remember Disney Infinity.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
We were the ones to break the news on the price of the figures for Disney Infinity,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
and that was all because of your question.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So that's the type of stuff we're looking to bring you in this next year.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
So check it out, E3.vognetwork.com.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And we'll be able to ask two times.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Bobby, I think he said he answered over 100 questions last year.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Does that count the ones he zonked out?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Because that seems like so many, but I would believe it.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
So I guess our goal is 200 this year. We'll see.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
All right.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
250.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
250. That's right. Set the bar high.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
All right. Let's get to it. Let's get into gaming news.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And leading into E3, what is going on? Loki.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000
So you may remember that there was a whole lot of issues with Let's Players and Nintendo games

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.000
that they were finding that they're not only getting content ID hits,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000
but also that revenue was going to Nintendo for the ads and stuff.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Well, now Nintendo is going to be offering an affiliate program

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
with basically it's going to be like a rev-share model

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000
where Google, Nintendo, and the video creators will be able to share the revenue from their ads.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And I guess they've already been tagging recent YouTube videos of Nintendo games

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
and Nintendo ads are appearing on those videos.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I guess before, because they were just kind of taking all the revenue

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
or at least splitting it between Google and themselves,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:01.000
but I guess now they're saying, hey, we're going to share it with people that want to make money off of it as well.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And their comment, of course,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Nintendo has been permitting the use of Nintendo copyright materials

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
in videos on YouTube under appropriate circumstances.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Advertisements may accompany those videos and keep you on previous policy

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
that revenue is shared between YouTube and Nintendo.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
In addition, for those who wish to use the material more proactively,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000
we are preparing an affiliate program which portions of the advertising profit is given to the creator.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Details about this affiliate program will be announced in the future.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I don't know.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I mean, yeah, it's well within the right to do that, but it kind of seems like a dick move anyways.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I don't know why they should even make revenue off of creative content made with their stuff.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I just don't understand why they would do that.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I mean, yeah, it's free advertising.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yeah, they may not want the free advertising,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
but it's kind of lame when there's so many other developers out there

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
that just don't give a shit about people making money off of their content

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.000
and people are more inclined to show that kind of content versus, you know,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I don't know a lot of people that would be dedicated to, say, a Nintendo-only channel or something

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000
and now they're making even less revenue per view or whatever from YouTube

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
than they would with another game.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And ad per view anyways nowadays, it's not that much to begin with, so I don't know.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I'm going to be honest.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
This might not be the popular opinion, but sometimes I don't have the popular opinion.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I kind of think it's fair for Nintendo to take a piece of it, and I am a YouTube content creator myself,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
and I think if Nintendo, the game developer themselves, wants to have a piece of the pie,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
you know what, they do make the games that we're broadcasting over.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And I realize some people do commentary and some people do the jokes and things,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
but guys, you can say that all you want, but the reality is you wouldn't have any of that

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
if you didn't have the game to go with it.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Like, let's be real, you guys. Come on.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
You would not have that commentary if it wasn't for the game.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And if you want to do that type of stuff without the game imagery and without the game music

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and all that stuff that goes into making a game, you can do that,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
and then you can have all the profits or whatever,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
but I think if you are going to try to make a living, so to speak,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
off of all these clips that Nintendo had a hand in,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
you know what, Nintendo has a right to some of the money.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000
However, that being said, now, where do we draw the line?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Because I think if you're going to be reviewing a Nintendo product

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
and you use clips from Nintendo games in your review,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I question if it's ethical for Nintendo to be taking a share of that,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:53.000
because those reviews are supposed to be something that is supposed to give that light to Nintendo and so forth,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
but I'm not talking like five-minute let's plays being reviews.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I'm talking like 30-second clips of the game being in reviews.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I'm not so sure Nintendo should be entitled in those types of situations,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
but that's the problem with something like this is it's complicated,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and YouTube wants to make these blanket decisions that don't always make sense,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
and where I get really pissed off is I get really pissed off

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000
with non-Nintendo companies, third parties that aren't even involved with the game making,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
making copyright claims against things that are out there publicly as

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
you can make this content and you can make money off this content.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Like I mentioned a couple weeks ago on the show, Super Hexagon.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I had a copyright claim on one of those, and I was really pissed,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000
and I want to know where's the strike against them for doing those claims,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
and we got into it last week about the whole which side are they on,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
the consumer themselves and so forth, and I'm not trying to rehash that argument,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:00.000
but I'm just saying that this is why there's really a concern about this whole Nintendo thing is

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000
is Nintendo going to start to claim on things that maybe they really don't actually have business making money off of?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
It's a complicated situation, and I know they're also talking about this whole like,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000
oh, well, you have to get permission first and all this, but if you're making it that easy to upload YouTube clips

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
or upload clips to YouTube of Mario Kart and all this other stuff, then you know what?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Signing up as a revenue sharing partner needs to be just as easy.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I shouldn't have to fill out a 20-step form and wait 30 days or whatever it is.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Or just make it automatic. If you monetize it, Nintendo's going to get cut as well.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Just have that disclaimer there. This content's owned by Nintendo. Nintendo's taking a cut of it.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I think people will be okay with that, and that's fine. Now this is out there,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
so it gives people that do the Let's Play videos an option.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.000
If you want to make a video using Nintendo products, just know that you're going to be making less money,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
which I guess is better than no money that was the situation before.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Exactly, but Loki, my point is, and I know not everybody's going to agree with me,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
because people want to say, oh, fair use and all this stuff, but the harsh reality is,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
if you didn't have those games to begin with, then you wouldn't have had a revenue to begin with.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
But they would have a different game. They'd be using a different game then.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Unless all game companies went down this road.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Not all game companies are going to go down that road, though.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Some of the bigger ones might.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
But some of the bigger ones aren't as big a deal nowadays.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000
It's a lot of indie uprising now, whereas these big game companies,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
not a lot of people care about doing Let's Plays on them.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I don't know. You have your options. That's what it is, I guess.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
All this being said, Loki, I know you don't do a lot of YouTube, but let's say you did.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Would you make videos featuring Nintendo comment knowing this, or would you say,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
you know what, no, I'm not going to do this?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I'd probably be more inclined, if I'm going to put the effort into making a Let's Play video

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
that's of a significant length in the amount of effort it takes to make the video,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I'd probably be more inclined to do a title that I'd be making more money off of.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Because why would I spend the effort to make a video that I'm getting a fraction of

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
what I could be getting from another game?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:33.000
All right. Well, what I want to do is I actually want to go and I want to actually ask our listeners.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
We haven't done this in a while, but I want to ask our listeners about what they think on this topic.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You know what's funny? You want to hear something funny related to YouTube and all this?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
So I used to have a YouTube of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Ask the audience music that I'd always play in the background.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I just tried to bring it up for this. It's gone. Talk about ironic.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Let me see if this one works. Let me see if this one works.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
All right. Good enough. All right. So we're going to go ask our VoG network participants right now.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:08.000
And if you are actually on live.vognetwork.com, you should see this question pop up on your screen shortly here.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
And I'm going to make this very simple.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Is Nintendo's new revenue sharing policy on YouTube fair? Yes or no?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And I realize there's a lot of in-betweens on this, and I'm actually trying to discourage that.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I really want to know, as this information is being presented, do you believe it's fair? Yes or no?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Should Nintendo be allowed to take a cut? So it's up there right now.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
We'll have that open for a little bit and check in on your results in just a minute.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Live.vognetwork.com.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.000
DarkSakura, I know you've been a little bit quiet tonight, but I know you've been participating in chat and chatting with all of them.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:51.000
But you have a good sense of judgment with some of this stuff when it comes to these legal things sometimes.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I'm really curious. What do you think? Is Nintendo entitled to a cut?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:05.000
If it's their product, then yes, they're entitled to a cut. However, as far as implementing it fairly, that is a different story.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
But yeah, I think they're entitled. Very base level.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
If they own the original product, they should get a little bit of something out of it.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000
It sounds like you and I are on a very similar page here, because I also have that hesitation where it's like, in theory, yes.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
If what Nintendo is doing is where the industry went, then yes, I would be fine with that.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And I'm a content creator myself, and I'm fine with that. But the reality is, are they going to do it right?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Probably not. And that's what I'm considering. Judging on these other things I'm seeing happening on YouTube, probably not.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:49.000
But the hope is that since Nintendo likes to do things differently, they may have a different solution. We just don't know what it is.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Alright. Alright.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
They do like to sort of drop shit on us from, you know, orbit when we least expect it.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Alright, let's leave the question up just a little bit while we go into this next story, and then we'll get into the results here in a moment.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000
But I'm going to say right now, it's overwhelmingly yes. So we'll see. We'll see here in a minute, though, where things shake out.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:19.000
In the meantime, while we wait for the votes to finalize on that, speaking of Nintendo, and I actually dipped into this a little bit with last week's news,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000
but Loki was clarifying the difference, that there was like a third-party GameCube adapter that was going to be coming last week.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Well, Nintendo just...

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
It's not even an adapter. It's just a controller that's shaped like a GameCube.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Well, Nintendo just crapped on that this week by announcing that they're going to be putting out an adapter that you can actually plug your GameCube controller into this adapter,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
and you plug it into Wii U. You'll be able to use the GameCube controller in Smash Bros. Wii U.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
This was actually tucked away in a Smash Bros. announcement. Jason, you touched on this earlier in the show as well.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Throw your Wavebirds in the air!

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
You excited about this?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I still have my Wavebird. I was actually going through a tub of something, looking for some stuff a couple weeks ago before I came out here, and I found my Wavebird, and I would love to put it to use.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Using the Wiimote with Brawl was okay. Using the Nunchuck didn't. I didn't really get used to that.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:21.000
But yeah, for stuff like this, anything that's a full-handed controller is great, and the Wavebird fit my hands really fucking well.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Yeah, the GameCube controller. You and I were talking a little bit before the show, too, as you were kind of saying, like, what other controllers lasted 13-plus years?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And I tried to argue a little bit, well, the DualShock really hasn't changed that much, especially from PS1 to PS2 to PS3.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Now, granted, PS4, I would say, they've changed enough to make it a different controller, but it's still...

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.000
The thing about the PlayStation 4 controller and why it's still a great controller is it still kind of keeps everything that the DualShock does right.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Yep.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:03.000
But anyway, I totally get your point, is that here we are, we're now having an adapter two life cycles later to use these old controllers, because people are that attached to them. It's really something.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And controllers, you know, the button reconfiguration is actually a bit of a sordid issue, where the Wii U Pro Controller and Classic Controller...

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:28.000
No, I'm sorry, the Wii Pro Controller and Classic Controller went back to the standard cross-action buttons, where the GameCube, like the N64, both of those controllers had very specific differences that really made a difference in the game as you played them.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:45.000
There is no controller that has lasted this long cross-systems. The Wii had four native GameCube ports in the side of the machine. This accessory looks identical. You plug it in once and it's the full array.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And who's to say that they're not going to revitalize old GameCube controllers again, but if you have them, then you get to put them used.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Yeah, there's nice save slots in there.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Oh, I didn't even think about that. Well, you don't need to.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:14.000
But if we're going to go down the route of that there's a possibility for GameCube Virtual Console games, wouldn't it be awesome to be able to load up your save from the GameCube and play it on the GameCube Virtual Console version?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Just saying.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
GameCubes are too hard to come by.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Some folks in chat are talking about this. Rama in our chat asks, will it be PC compatible? And you know what, it should be noted that because the Wii U takes these things via USB, that yes, this GameCube adapter is a USB.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
So I would think it's only a matter of time before somebody makes a driver for it.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Official or hacked?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Official or hacked?

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Official or hacked?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Official or hacked? Interesting.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I made this point a number of months ago. I have paired my PS4 controller with my computer, but it seems to not work so well with Steam, so I have to use it physically. I have to use it hardwired.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:05.000
But we've also talked about the PlayStation 4 direct input translator thing, so games that support what the Xbox controller winds up doing, you can do with the PS4.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Yeah, because if you can plug it into a computer, people can write something to work with it. Period. End of discussion.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Now of course, this is starting all the rumors about, is Nintendo going to announce GameCube Virtual Console games at E3? What do you guys think with that?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I mean, it does seem like a really logical next step. You know, a lot of people missed out on the GameCube, although a lot of people are missing out on the Wii U as well, but you still are probably going to have a good bunch of people who do have a Wii U who didn't have a GameCube, and I think, you know, it seems logical, doesn't it?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:56.000
We make the point that Nintendo is very good at getting you to buy the same game, exactly the same game, three times. A decade later. So, yeah. If they are capable of doing so, why not? It seems inevitable, I don't see why not.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000
It's really interesting how much press this news has gotten too, considering it was really a footnote in a larger discussion on Smash Brothers, so it's just kind of neat.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Big deal with the FGC.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Well, especially if you take this stuff really seriously, which even Nintendo is, by having this official Smash Brothers tournament, this E3, I mean, Smash Brothers is their bread and butter this holiday season, and yes, I know there's Bayonetta 2, and yes, I know there's the X and all this other stuff, but let's be real, Nintendo is putting all their eggs in Smash Brothers Basket, and with good reason.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Now that Mario Kart finally came out.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Now that Mario Kart's finally out.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And Zelda, kind of, and Mario World.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Alright, let's go to the results of our poll.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Again, we asked you guys live, is Nintendo's new revenue sharing policy on YouTube fair?

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:48.000
And get this, roughly 85% of you guys, that's 84.62%, said yes, it's fair.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Interesting. That's an overwhelming majority. Like, that's not even close.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Now, granted, there were some of you that said no, and I hope to hear from you guys later in the program, if not, you know, via email, or via the Skype line, at, of course, you can always send this email, participate at orangelandsready.com.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000
If you get it in now, it's probably not going to make it for tonight, but I would be really curious to hear from some of you no's.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Not in a combative way. I mean, I might have said that yes, I believe it's fair, but I expressed my hesitations, so I actually do want to hear.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000
I want to see if you guys can maybe rip that open a little more, and kind of, I'm really curious about your guys' thoughts.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:29.000
So, maybe, maybe hear from some more of you guys a little later in the show, but yeah, 84.62% said yes, 15.38% said no.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So, thank you guys for participating. We haven't done a live poll in forever. I need to bring those back, because it's a lot of fun to do.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
See what the audience thinks right as we're listening. Love it.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Alright, let's move on. Away from Nintendo, finally, this week.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Darstokker, what do you have for us?

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Well, for fans of Bioshock, which I know we have quite a number of them, Take-Two has stated that there is a new Red Dead Redemption game on the way, and that Bioshock is not dead.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Of course, you know, we still have the whole, you know, story being told now being concluded through the season pass for Bioshock Infinite.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.000
But they're saying that there may be a bit more to handle, a bit more going on in the future of the Bioshock series.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:27.000
But, yeah, there's definitely, though, we're going to see some more items, some Red Dead Redemption, more Borderlands, and, of course, the NBA games.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And they, this isn't new news for Bioshock, even after the, whoo, completely forgot his name, after, like, the series, the series developer, the series creator.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Ken Levine?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Yeah, when Ken Levine was retasked, they said that Bioshock wasn't done, it's just not something that he's going to be continuing to spearhead anymore.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:55.000
What that means isn't so much of a surprise, but, obviously, this is quite good news for the rest of the series to continue on their universes, continue on their story.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Alright. Well, I mean, a lot of this, I mean, I'm not really surprised to hear any of this, but it's nice to have the official confirmation, especially in the Department of Red Dead Redemption.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Because I know we've had some rumors on that, and so it's really neat to kind of see that really gaining steam.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
So, alright, moving on, Loki.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Alright. So, this is pretty cool. But, apparently, I don't know.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Apparently, there's going to be some more games announced this year, because some of the major ones that they announced at E3 last year have been delayed to 2015.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:40.000
So, the Order 1886 was something that, actually, they had an event recently where they had shown off quite a bit of gameplay for it.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
It is now expected to be coming out early 2015.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:54.000
So, that kind of sucks on the PlayStation 4, but, equally so, Quantum Break is going to be coming out in 2015 as well.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And, apparently, they're going to reveal that at Gamescom.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
So, we're, I don't know.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
So, that means that there's got to be something coming out in the fourth quarter.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Because, right now, at least on the Xbox side, Halo and Quantum Break are now next year, and the Order is next year.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
So, what's fourth quarter? I don't know.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
We know that maybe there's another Forza Horizon game coming, so maybe that.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
But, aside from that, I don't know.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:34.000
There could be surprises. I think there's surprises still in the back pocket. There usually is at E3.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
There'll be some type of surprise. It's like, this is this year.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Well, we had the rumble a couple weeks ago when we had the show.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I know the Halo rumors were spinning really big about the Xbox One might have this Halo collection, which could sway me.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I mean, honestly, Quantum Break was what I was waiting for to get the Xbox One.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
So, hearing that it's 2015 is making me kind of make a...

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Sunset Overdrive looks pretty good. That's supposed to be coming out this year.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Forza Horizon 2 would sure sweeten the pot over there. That's probably a game that would make me finally take the plunge, too.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
But, yeah, I don't know. It'd be interesting.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Of course, I'm disappointed to hear about the Order going to 2015, but especially after seeing some of the previews in the past week.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I know that was the week we were off, but they did a pretty extensive preview of the Order that showed what the game looked like, and it looks hot.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000
It's a neat look, and I'm not even really good at those type of shooter games, but why not?

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:34.000
But, considering the way the Order looked last year at E3, I kind of always in my mind thought, this game is way out.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
This is one of those way out games.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:45.000
It was never something I was really anticipating in 2014, so I'm actually not as disappointed to hear about that.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I didn't realize that was such a huge thing for people this year. I always thought it was next year.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I wasn't that excited about it when they showed it. I was like, eh, it's alright.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.000
I'm not a super huge fan of steampunk. I think it's cool, but it's not going to get me the bi game.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:08.000
I still wonder if Sony isn't going to come out and say, hey, remember The Last Guardian? PlayStation 4 and this year?

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:17.000
That's kind of the sleeping giant that Sony's got. That could be it.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Also, you know another thing that's surprising? LittleBigPlanet? Where'd that go?

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I know Media Molecules moved on to other things, but I can't imagine Sony's let that franchise go.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Somebody else did the Vita version, and the Vita version came out fine.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000
So I imagine somebody's developing LittleBigPlanet on PlayStation 4, and we haven't seen anything on that.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So that could be another little surprise holiday title. That seems very likely.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Since we're going to go down this path here, because they've had different LittleBigPlanet-type games and stuff.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Wouldn't it be kind of cool? A LittleBigPlanet-type game crossed with Animal Crossing or something?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Where you build up your own town, literally build it up out of stuff. That'd be pretty cool.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000
You'd be able to share that kind of environment and build your own theme, park rides or something like that.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:15.000
LittleBigPlanet Cardio was pretty cool, and that was done by a completely different developer.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I'd be interested to see anything.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Dungeonbuster in our chat says, I'm not holding my breath for Last Guardian. If it arrives, it arrives.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And our pal Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm all over an Xbox One Forza Horizon. All over in Act F degrees.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
If that gets announced for Xbox One, I'll be getting one. And Forza 5 as well.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
See, I'm not as big on the main Forza series, because those are the types of racers I'm really not good at.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Same thing with Gran Turismo. I'm really shitty at those games.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I don't really have as interested in them as I do the Burnouts, the Mario Karts, the Forza Horizons, the more arcadey-style games.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Oh man, a new Burnout game.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Yeah, where'd that go?

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Criterion's now making fucking terrible Need for Speed games.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
What? They're not making one this year. There's no Need for Speed this year.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Crossing my fingers that the reason there is no Need for Speed this year is because they're making a Burnout game.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Oh god, I hope so.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Blender's in chat pointing out that LittleBigPlanet 2 is still putting out DLC.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And where the fuck is the free-to-play LittleBigPlanet game that they were supposed to have?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Oh, I forgot that that was supposed to be a thing.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Yeah, exactly. Everybody did. Where the fuck is it?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Loki. Maybe it's PlayStation 4 now. There's other free-to-play stuff on PlayStation 4. Who knows?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
But seriously, a new Burnout game, I would be all over it.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Well, here's the good news. In literally one week and one day, we'll know.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I'll be watching all those conferences, but yeah.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000
We'll know. Here's the crazy thing too. I don't even know if I told you guys. You might be finding this out for the first time.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Bobby and I are fortunate enough. We are going to Sony's conference.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Yeah, I already knew that.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I'm excited. It's fun. I've actually never been to one of the big press conferences. This is the first year I'm going to one.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
So this will be a lot of fun.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Anyway, but here's the thing. Here's my question. What can I do for you guys at the conference?

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Because y'all are going to be watching it, so I'd be an idiot to say like,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Oh, I'll be sure to break all the news for you guys. Like, come on. You're all going to be watching it.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
You're all going to know. You all have an internet.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
It's all part of E3. It's going to roll into the coverage that you were already planning on anyway.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I will try to keep my eyes and ears open, like around, and see what else.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Especially like what types of promo things might they have there, and what they seem to be pushing.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
In a really quiet moment where they're announcing something that's really kind of ho-hum, you've got to yell,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
WOOOO!

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And we'll know.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I'm not going to promise anything because I'd like to be invited back in the future, but...

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
But they would invite back because of your enthusiasm.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I mean, if boring shit like that is getting you that hyped up, they're going to watch you there every year.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
We'll see. We'll see.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
This year it's coming out white. WOOOO! White!

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:04.000
No, I love the sentiment, guys. ActDeaf says, yell VOG RULES.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I appreciate the sentiment, but again, I'd like to be asked back in a future year, so that's one way to not get asked back.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
So, yeah. Anyway, I doubt they have many mics on that portion of the audience anyway.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Alright, moving on, Jason.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:29.000
As everyone heard, I expect that was following this game even remotely, Amplitude's Kickstarter succeeded.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Their original goal of 750,000 in an 18-day span was finished.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Harmonix did a lot of live broadcasting. Telethon style was their claim.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I missed all of it for some reason. Apparently I was really busy.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I kind of don't remember why, to be honest.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:54.000
But they did a lot of really fun, engaging community stuff in the lead up to the end of the Kickstarter, and they pulled it out.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.000
They exceeded it by about 100,000 when it all winds down, which is great.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I don't think that covered any of the stretch goals, but the game is funded and they're going to do their damnedest.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
This is good news considering what the two weeks lead up was.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:21.000
It is not all good news. Within a week, I believe, of that even closing, one of the first backer updates was talking about the fact that Harmonix is laying off 37 members of staff.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:30.000
A spokesperson says, Harmonix is in the process of restructuring our organization to bring it into alignment with our current and future product development plans.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Unfortunately, this means making the difficult decision to reduce the number of full-time staff.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
We sincerely appreciate the work of each and every one of these employees.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Harmonix is working to ensure that those affected are well taken care of as we make this change.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And that these changes will not affect their current plans for Amplitude and Disney Fantasia Music Evolved.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I am very opinionated on this right now.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So the first thing that you keep in mind is that Harmonix, any company, does not discuss personal specifics.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
They use the time full-time jobs, which usually means that it should have been core staff.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
But you know what also wound down when Amplitude finished?

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Chroma.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
They don't need system administrators to run their servers.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
They don't need as much engineering effort to fix issues.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:25.000
They don't need creative designers to add new content to the game as quickly as when the game was running.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
This is not like...

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
The way that I see this, the way that I see these layoffs, is that...

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Can you back up a minute? What the fuck happened to Chroma?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Because Chroma was...

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
It was Alpha. It was in Beta. It was not supposed to just be playable until the release.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Right.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
They've got the information that they want. They are going to refine the game and go to step B.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Huh.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
It was a limited public demo of which they've never done before.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
A lot of people were thinking this would lead to Beta leads to full release.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And they broke the mold.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
That's weird.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Which is good because that game has a lot of edges that need to be filled out.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And I'm looking forward to them being able to do that.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
So I saw this announcement, and it sucked.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
As we always say, nobody wants to hear about lost jobs. Period.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.000
There was a lot of really weird stuff about people that were equally as snarky about the Kickstarter.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000
How about you use some of that $800,000 and help the people that lost their job?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
They did.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Yeah, I mean...

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I wouldn't call myself a snarky person about the Kickstarter, but I presented my reasons and everything.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
The really scary kind of element here is that that whole Kickstarter...

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I mean, literally, it's very obvious now, was literally a last-ditch effort by this company to save jobs.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Because now you see why it was that 18-day window.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Which even I was one of those people that was like, you're shooting yourself in the foot by giving yourself only 18 days.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Well, somebody up above knew, come the end of May, I'm gonna have to lose 65 people or something like that.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Unless I can raise three-quarters of a million dollars, like literally pull this money out of my ass to save at least half the jobs.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
How can I pull money out of my ass? Let's go to Kickstarter!

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But it's true. This number invariably would have been bigger had Kickstarter not finished.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:22.000
And they did what they could to secure the workforce that they need to be able to complete their jobs.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
To complete the game, rather, and fulfill their jobs.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I think that had they made stretch goals, they would have been able to keep another five people, maybe.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I think the $1 million tier was simultaneous multiplayer, where right now the game is only anticipated on being offline.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Offline local multiplayer.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:51.000
But they don't necessarily need everybody's specialties, or they just don't need that extra engineering effort.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:59.000
So, some people that may have been a part of this project, ultimately, invariably, ultimately, in theory, got let down at the conclusion of it.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
But I have to think that number has shrunk by at least a dozen, if not more.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:13.000
You know what's really interesting, though, is that if some of those stretch goals had been hit, probably with each stretch goal they hit, that would have been like two, three more jobs it would have saved.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.000
But it was, this was going to happen, everybody knew about it, as you just said.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:27.000
That time window was, one, it was a great period of time to let those people be able to find other things, other places to go, other things to do.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And then they rescued, they held onto as many of them as they could.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I gotta say, you all know how I felt about the Kickstarter, and the industry is the industry the way that it is, it doesn't change my opinion or anything I said a few weeks ago or whatever.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:49.000
But I gotta say, you know, for better or for worse, this is one of the most desperate things I've ever seen a game company do.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.000
In the years, in the twelve years we've been doing this show, this is one of the most desperate maneuvers I've ever seen happen.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And that's, I mean, it's kind of sad, I wish it wasn't happening to Harmonix, because I do believe overall they make really good stuff, and it just kind of sucks that they're really sometimes at the mercy of a fickle music industry, so to speak.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.000
You know, the gaming industry and so forth, but what a desperate move that Kickstarter was now in retrospect.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Did you actually wind up backing it?

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I did not.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Loki?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Nope.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Jamie?

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I'm not a huge fan of Amplitude.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
No.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
I did.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I did not until after it passed, which I'm still very mixed about, but as soon as it was obvious that it was gonna hit the home stretch with still a good twenty hours remaining, I threw mine in and I'll be good in the game.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:52.000
You know, and I still stand by everything I said before. I mean, with all this information, it kind of sucks and so forth, but this thing happens in the industry all the time at the same time.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:04.000
You know, and those guys will move on and hopefully be able to get in at another studio, or maybe sometimes these people start new studios, and the ebb and flow will continue of these development cycles.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:16.000
But yeah, again, I personally don't believe in paying for a game a year and a half before it's out with no investor perks. But that's me. Poop on me.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000
No, you are good with your reasoning and you stuck by it.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:35.000
But I'll tell you this. I will abso-frickin'-lutely check this game out when the demo's out there, when some of my backer friends have the game, and if I like it, which I'm 95% sure I will, then I'll buy it when it's out. Why won't I? Absolutely. I love music games.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:43.000
You know, there is actually some more news regarding this that I don't think was in the show role. There's actually been a lot of really good announcements about it.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Danny Baranowski is going to be on the soundtrack, the author, the composer of Super Meat Boy soundtrack, and Dungeon Defenders most recently, I think, and a number, Biden of Isaac, and a number of other incredibly noteworthy games in just the last year and a half or two years.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:23.000
And there were a couple of other people, Onomatoguchi and C4118, which is interesting. Did you notice that when they announced that, that was really the start of the upswing of the Kickstarter?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:31.000
But again, I don't think they necessarily had those people signed on the dotted line until they announced it.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
They couldn't afford to pay them until the game was looking to be solidified.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000
This is all, it's looking more and more like this was literally, they made it up as they went along. I think in some ways.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.000
You have to establish the game before you can establish the details. So as soon as they were finally able to do that, the news kept rolling.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura has some news about money spending.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Well, I mentioned this at the start of the show, but I put money towards the Humble Weekly Bundle.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:09.000
And it's actually a big RPG Maker fest, which I've been wanting to get my hands on some of them, but they were a little too pricey for me.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:24.000
So I have RPG Maker in this, like two of the different builds of RPG Maker, several DLC bundles that have music and graphic assets.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:33.000
You also get Skyborne, Sweet Lily Dreams. There are also a few other homebrew titles thrown in there.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:42.000
It comes also with Deadly Sin 2 and To The Moon, which is a game that I absolutely, absolutely love.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:54.000
So, I say it's worth getting. $6 gets you all of the goodies, and so I put $10 towards it.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And right now, they're saying if you pay more than $12, you get everything in there, plus you get DLC bundle number 3 and Legionwood 2, Rise of Eternals Realm.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:15.000
The money's going to, in part, to indicate Foundation and Child's Play. So, it's only Windows right now, but get it. Just do it.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Do it and play To The Moon and you'll thank me. I've had parts of that game that made me sob.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Yeah. Was To The Moon done in this RPG Maker?

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I don't recall.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Yes. All the games that are part of this are done in the RPG Maker.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Wow. I didn't realize that.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Yeah, you can publish games with it.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I didn't realize it was that powerful. That's amazing. I have played a little bit of To The Moon, but just enough to go through some of the intro sequences.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Not to get into any of the emotional parts you guys are talking about.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
The very beginning of the game is emotional to me.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Well, yeah. A little bit. Yeah, a little bit. There's definitely some feels in the very beginning moments of the game, but, you know.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And before anyone asks, I've already passed on my bonus To The Moon. I've gifted it to a friend.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Because I've already played it. But, if somebody is really nice to me, I might just consider getting it for them.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I might pick it up as well.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I thought you already had it.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I do not have RPG Maker, believe it or not.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I meant To The Moon.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Oh, no. I have To The Moon. But, I was thinking about picking up this bundle.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:25.000
I thought about doing it, too. But, see, then again, once again, it's distractions. But, it is nice to have stuff that I may use eventually.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000
But, I would really encourage you guys. You know, the one thing. I mean, it's one thing to, you know, give codes away to friends and stuff.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
But, I've said this before about Humble Bundles. Like, you guys really should just, if you're interested in this, go check it.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
It's a Humble Bundle. You can pay whatever you want. And, it's all for charity.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Like, it's, you know. Don't be too much of a hard-ass like I am with Kickstarter.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Go check out the Humble Bundles.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Alright. Let us travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.000
And, look at some games coming to a, maybe, retail store near you. Maybe not the Humble Store.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
But, maybe the Humble Store. We'll see. Loki.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Let's see. Not a whole ton of stuff coming out of this week.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Pretty much just Murdered Soul Suspect, which is out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, and Xbox 360, actually.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Then, also, I want to say, I think it's this week. On Friday is the...

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
What was that?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I didn't have all this stuff screwed up here.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Okay. Anyways. The...

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000
No, actually, no. That was it. I'm sorry. Murdered Soul Suspect. That is the game of the week.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I would be surprised if it's an awfully slow week.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Oh, nope. I'm sorry. There's one that is snuck in here.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Damn, Loki. Sorry.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I forgot. They added this last minute. Hyperdimension Neptunia PP for Vita.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Oh, wow.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
It's coming out. I mean, they've had it.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
And then, oh, I guess it was this Friday. I think it was the Friday after.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000
But, apparently, Tomodachi Life on 3DS.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Oh, yeah.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
And Wildstar on PC.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Rob, you would know this. What is this Wildstar weekend thing that I've been seeing everybody talk about?

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:11.000
I believe the game soft-launched over the weekend. You know, I've got to be honest. It's not an MMO I've been following very closely.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I have a lot of friends that have been following it.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
But, I believe...

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000
I hated it.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
You didn't like it?

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
No.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Shane was saying some good things about it. I haven't even really looked at it at all.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000
It was way too cartoony and way too motiony and it just made me feel sick.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I didn't like it.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
See, I hear some people are really into the cartoony look, though.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.000
So, just kind of like... I know Sil, who's from Girls Gone Wild here at VoG and has been on Horde House a couple times.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
She was really into it and I think was doing the launch weekend.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
So, you know, it just kind of depends what you're into.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:47.000
But, yeah. The game, I believe, had its early launch or whatever happened this weekend.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
And, of course, the whole thing is...

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Seen a lot of streamers talking about it.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
It shit the bed the minute it launched.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
As these online games tend to do.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:01.000
That does explain why some people were playing it at 4 AM their time when I know that they don't usually play it out late. At least not publicly.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Probably the only time they could get on.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Just like anything else, when you have enough of an established fan base and everybody has to connect to a central service.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Gasp! It falls over.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Gasp! But, again, Mario Kart 8 did alright.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Alright, moving along. In Japan, let's check out what's happening with the Japanese releases.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000
On the PlayStation 4 this week, Japan's actually getting a bundle that contains FIFA 14.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
They're getting a little bundle that has that.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000
There's also a bundle that comes with FIFA 14 and the camera.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
So, you can get all the kit and kaboodle there in Japan this week.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
As far as games go, though, on the PlayStation 4 this week, the New Order Wolfenstein is out.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
So, if you want to check that out in Japan, you can.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I believe that game had just come out here in this past week or two.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:50.000
In fact, just talking about recent releases, I see in chat that Code Man is asking about Transistor.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.000
You know, I missed talking about that game in my gaming week because that's the game I would have talked about had there been a show last week.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
But I'll just quickly say, I liked it.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
And I am liking that game.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:07.000
That's a pretty cool little, like, I love how you shift between, like, if you want to do an action-y type of game, you can do that.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Or you can hit the button and do a more tactical type of game.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Like, I love that. Like, switch back and forth. That's a really neat mechanic.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.000
It's like a combination of Parasite-even tactics.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Yeah, I'll have to talk more about Transistor at some point later on, maybe at the top of the next segment.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
But we're running long for now, so let me get back to these releases.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:28.000
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Reign also Wolfenstein The New Order on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000
On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, yes, there is stuff on the Xbox 360.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Because Wolfenstein The New Order is also on the 360.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
As well as Ken no Machi no Ihujin Shiro no Okyuu comes out.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
That's the first print edition there.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000
You want to hear a fun fact about Wolfenstein on 360?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
It's four discs.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Thank you, idtech5 or whatever that is.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Wow, I didn't realize that.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
On the PlayStation Vita, Tokaiden comes out this week.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
That's a price reduction, however. That moves into the best on the Vita.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And on the Wii U this week in Japan, nothing.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.000
But next week we'll see the release of One Piece Unlimited World.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000
And lastly but not leastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000
That is such a big game, it's getting its own 3DS XL set.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Aww, that is a big release on Nintendo 3DS this week.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
There's also a game called Card Fight Vanguard Lock on Victory.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Let's travel to the UK with Dark Sakura.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Well, coming out on the 3rd is 1001 Spikes for Mac and PC and WildStar for PC.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:44.000
On the 4th, PlayStation Vita Pets, Tango Fiesta for PC, Ultra Street Fighter IV for PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:50.000
On the 6th is Hyperdimension Idol Neptunia PP, Tomodachi Life,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Murdered Soul Suspect on Damn Near Everything, and that's it.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then Dark Sakura will give us the classic game of the week.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
But first, Loki.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Alright, so you may remember as of recent, they have been doing a lot of tweaks to some of the stuff on Xbox Live and with the Xbox One, that kind of thing.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Well, one of the things now they get tweaked is the Games with Gold program.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:26.000
You may remember they were doing two games per month, and you get those for free for your gold number.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Plus, you get to basically keep them forever once you have downloaded those.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Now, they're going kind of the route of the PlayStation Plus program, where instead of two games per month, now they're going to give away five games, at least in June.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Three of those this time are actually going to be on Xbox 360, and then the other two are going to be on Xbox One.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:02.000
So for Xbox One in June, you're getting Max the Curse of Brotherhood and Halo Spartan Assault.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:10.000
And then on 360, Charlie Murder, Dark Souls, and Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
So those are going to be available.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:19.000
But the difference now, though, is you have to be a member of Xbox Live Gold in order to have access to those games.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000
If you, for whatever reason, let your account lapse, you will not be able to play those anymore.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I know people are upset to hear that, but at the same time, that's what Sony's done this whole time, and we were all just waiting for Microsoft to follow suit.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
They didn't want to give them away. They had to.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Well, I'll get into why I think they're doing that in just a second here.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000
PlayStation Plus also having a little bit of a tweak as well.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Unlike previous, where the InstaGame collection, they will add a few titles each month, and those will kind of roll on for several months before they finally kind of expire and take them off there.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Now they're going to be rotating those through every month.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:04.000
So it's going to be six games every month, two on PlayStation 4, two on PlayStation 3, and two on Vita.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:15.000
And I guess they're saying starting in July, they announced those titles already, I guess, oh, I'm sorry, for June.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Okay, so June, they're going to have Trine 2, The Complete Story, Pixel Junk Shooter Ultimate, that's for PlayStation 4, PS3, you get NBA 2K14 and Sly Cooper, Thieves in Time, and Vita, Terraria, and Mutant Mudds Deluxe.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:41.000
So that's pretty cool. And also, I guess Sly Cooper, Thieves in Time is a cross-buy game, so you technically also get that if you play PlayStation 3 as well.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:53.000
The reason why I think they're doing it this way now, not only to get more games in there, it's harder for them to negotiate a game to be free for several months versus just one month.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:04.000
And I think that's why it should be able to get more titles in there. That's why I think Microsoft's had trouble getting decent titles in there because now they're basically saying, oh, you get them for free, forever.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Now if they limit it to just one month and have it where it expires and stuff that they're able to negotiate, maybe it'll be cheaper for them to get that free title instead of having to pay for downloads for six months versus a month.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.000
That makes sense.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
At least that's my thought. I don't know.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
It's perfectly logical.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:35.000
By the way, since you brought up the whole PlayStation Plus thing as well, I want to make sure I brought this up at some point because this came up in the chat room when I was talking about the whole Sony press conference, but for some reason it didn't make our show roll, but this is pretty big news.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:45.000
I don't know if you guys heard, but Sony is actually putting their press conference, not just where you can watch it live on the internet in a tiny little browser window, they're putting it on movie screens.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:55.000
You can actually go to movie theaters. There's certain ones around the country, not all of them, but think of it like one of those Fathom events or something when they do the Metropolitan Opera or something on the big screen.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Basically, Sony is taking that type of thing over for a night and presenting their press conference in theaters.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I know you can snatch up the tickets online. I imagine a lot of them are already gone, but I thought that was a pretty interesting little way.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Is it free?

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Yeah, totally free.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000
And they're saying that there might even be little giveaways. I imagine there'll probably be some type of Sony representative.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
They probably have retail reps around the country, so they probably have a representative at each of these showings.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Probably just trying to get people jazzed up, talking about Sony.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Why not create these mob mentality environments where people are going to get really psyched for these games?

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I thought it was a pretty clever little idea, and putting a lot of these trailers for high, high definition, high frame rate games on a movie screen is going to be interesting.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.000
So it's like going to your friend's house who has the big screen TV only. This is a really big screen TV.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Well, hold on a second. You just said something really silly.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Yes, the resolution in a movie theater is better, but when projectors stream at 24 frames per second versus our 60 frames per second monitors?

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
True, but is that how fast the high def is?

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I admittedly don't know if they do things different for live.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000
They don't stream at 60 frames per second from those events.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:17.000
I thought they made a big freaking deal about the whole Lord of the Rings was in this ultra high frame rate.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
48.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.000
But that's still slower than 60 hertz freaking TV.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
It's still probably going to be better than it'll look over the internet.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Not according to what everybody thought of The Hobbit.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Let's be real here.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Movie theaters are 24. I don't know if they do things differently for non-film studio master, that kind of stuff.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
But that was just a silly statement.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Well, they've tried doing 48 for video game high school last season.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Whenever it was in the video game, they doubled the frame rate on it.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Actually, the whole thing was shot in 48.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:05.000
The whole thing, they had it in a 48 frames per second format, but they doubled each frame for the 24 portions.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:11.000
But they have actually, I think, built their own player to do that because it wasn't something that you can stream.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
So I don't think that you're going to really miss anything.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, screw.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Alright, well let's move on.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000
This is something you might see at the Sony press conference, or you might see it at the Microsoft one.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Or, neither one, but it'll probably be on the show floor at E3 somewhere.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000
And that is the rumblings of a new Mortal Kombat game.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:39.000
And thanks to a poster that was spotted on Reddit, there was a whole little thing that says, who's next?

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000
And it showed the Mortal Kombat dragon logo and the cracked bones of a spine.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:50.000
And you might remember that the last Mortal Kombat game in 2011 had the whole x-ray maneuvers and things like that.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:57.000
So, you know, that would probably be in character that if there is a Mortal Kombat 2 coming, which is really Mortal Kombat 10?

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Nine? Ten?

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Ten.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
God, I'm losing count.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.000
So, wherever they're at, this would probably be a part of it, the whole x-ray thing.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000
This in addition to, by the way, that Ed Boon, who is with NetherRealm Studios, who made the last Mortal Kombat game,

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000
who is also a co-creator of the game, has been posting all these cryptic messages on Twitter.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:20.000
So, I think it's a given that we're getting Mortal Kombat, it's just a matter of when they choose to announce it.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Although, one of the countdown clocks that he's been running on Twitter ends tomorrow.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
So, they'll probably be a little bit of that hype leading up to E3.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:33.000
So, looks like that's one of the things you're going to see coming out of E3 is a new Mortal Kombat game.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Very curious to see where they go with it.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000
The last Mortal Kombat game was very good, and so I'm excited to see one.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:47.000
I imagine if there is a Mortal Kombat 2, I'm using my quote-y fingers, if there's a Mortal Kombat 2, it's going to be on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000
It's going to look, you know, even better, and it's probably going to have a roster that's pretty impressive.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
So, I'm very curious to see.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
And I want to see if Freddy Krueger comes back.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
So, all right.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Anyhow, let's go back to a time when gaming was a little simpler.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:10.000
And you know what, you didn't have a roster of like 40 characters in your fighting game, plus 10 DLC characters featuring Freddy Krueger.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
You had like 12, and you liked it.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:25.000
We're going to take a trip down memory lane with Dark Sakura as she explores, in this case it looks like a fighting game, similar to Mortal Kombat, that is a classic.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Dark Sakura, dive in the gaming vault and find a game that the kids should be playing this week.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
The game I picked this week is Galaxy Fight Universal Warriors.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
I don't know if anyone's ever remembered Galaxy Fight.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
It was kind of an interesting game.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.000
It was done by Sunsoft for the Neo Geo MVS.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:51.000
It was their second fighting game that came out after the Super Famicom spinoff of the Heberike series, the Sugoi Heberike.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.000
And this one is their first sideways 2D fighting game.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.000
They also did another fighting game after this called Waku Waku 7. Do you remember that?

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
That might sound more familiar?

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
No. You know what's funny is I think I've actually seen this one.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:19.000
After that in 1998, they worked with a company called Santa Claus to do Astro Superstars, another fighting game.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000
But Galaxy Fight was just a really interesting fighting game.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
It sort of serves as a prequel to Waku Waku 7.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:34.000
They use the same engine and they have a few things in common, including their mid-boss bonus-kun.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:46.000
You play as one of eight characters and you go throughout the solar system to defeat opponents that inhabit each of the planets before fighting Theldin to settle their score.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000
It's a four-button layout. Of course, it's a Neo Geo game.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.000
The first three are used for striking attacks and the fourth is a taunt.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.000
But using the buttons together, of course, they're special moves.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:10.000
It doesn't have anything extra, including new Superbars or anything, as other games that came out around that time had Superbars.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:16.000
This is pretty much an old-school fighting game, just one of the last old-school fighting games for the Neo Geo.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.000
You have all kinds of different characters. You have your bruisers, you have your quick ones.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:30.000
The names are Alvin, you have Bonus-kun, who I just mentioned, who's actually a parody of you from Street Fighter.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Gunder, you have Theldin, I think it's Jidan, Juri, Kazuma, Musafar, who is a robot, Rolf, Rumi, Ro, and Yakopu, who is a pet rabbit.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:56.000
So yeah, it did come out on the AES home console system. It also did have a Neo Geo CD version.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:01.000
There was arranged music for the AES version, too, though that was pretty cool.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:07.000
It was ported to the Sega Saturn. It came out on PlayStation only in Japan.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:19.000
In 2008, the Neo Geo CD version of Galaxy Fight was included with Waku Waku 7 in the Neo Geo Online collection that came out on PS2.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:28.000
There were all kinds of different versions that came out. And now, Galaxy Fight.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:37.000
I laughed at this girl, Rumi, her little victory pose. She looks like she's wearing these gigantic mitts.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:43.000
She just did a big victory pose where she puts one hand in the air and the other hand in the air, and then her boobs are way too big and they jiggle.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
It's that typical 90s fighting game girl thing.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:56.000
At any rate, the AES version of this was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on March 23, 2010.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:05.000
The soundtrack was released by Pony Canyon on March 17, 1995.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:10.000
It has all the background music, sound effects, and voice samples from the arcade version.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Music was composed by Masato Arakawa and Takuya Sasaki, and performed by Jun Kojimae.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.000
So, there you go.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Galaxy Fight. It's a weird game. With boobs.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000
With boobs, for sure.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.000
And playing as a rabbit.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I like these cute little characters in the background who bounce up and down.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
It's kind of old school, though, isn't it?

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
It is. It's a very, you know, neo-geo fighting game. That's all you have to say. It's a neo-geo fighting game.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:49.000
It is. And I'm not going to say there's anything super special about it, you know, but it's a fun little fighting game.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Well, then isn't that what games are supposed to be?

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Yeah, I guess.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Alright.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Ew! God, what the hell are you making me look at, chat room?

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000
What did they do?

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Flamin' Hot Cheetos Burrito?

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Oh, lord. Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Act up. That is gross. Stop it.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Your classic game of the week. Less gross. Galaxy fight on the neo-geo.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Alright, wow. This is a long show tonight. I guess we just broke two hours for part A.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
We have to make up for lost time from last week, don't we, kids?

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
So, anyway, we will be right back. We're going to take a quick break.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:26.000
And when we come back, there's rapid-fire news, the FUGO Question of the Week, and plenty more show right after this quick break

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000
when we're back with more of Orange Lawn's radio.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this June 1st, 2014, with the 554th episode of our show.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:51.000
I hope you guys will also come back next week, because next week, of course, June 8th, will be 555.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Or, as Dark Soccer, I believe, called it a couple weeks ago, the Previl show, because it's 555.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.000
So, we'll be having that, but that is actually our pre-E3 show.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:07.000
And, you know, every pre-E3, we've got to bring back Listless to do our official E3 predictions.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
So, count on that for next week. You're going to be here, right, Jason?

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Yeah, absolutely.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Good. We'll have a...

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.000
There are certain occasions where I will make YouTube videos fancy again.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Listless is going to be one of them.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:25.000
We haven't been doing the OLR Games as much lately. There's just been a lot of other news and other things to clearly fill time.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000
We're way over time tonight, and I've got to keep things moving here, but Listless is always a good one to bring back.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.000
We had to do Match Game again eventually, too, and come up with some new OLR Games.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:38.000
What was the last time we played Beat the Host? That was like 200 episodes ago, probably.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
That's a side show game.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.000
I think it started there. Well, actually, a lot of people don't know this.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Listless actually started on, well, to be fair, it was actually ripped off another TV show.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:02:00.000
But we started doing it on my college radio show back in 90... God, what year would that have been?

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
About 97, 98, when we were doing it. That's when Listless was born.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Let me put it this way, Jason. Do you know who came up with the name Listless? My ex-girlfriend.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:14.000
That says a lot.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Is Jason... Oh, no, Jason's muted. I'm sorry, Jason.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Well, they missed my reveal, but that's okay. I haven't said anything meaningful.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Oh, no, I did. I was just going to say that, fret not, people who keep up with YouTube,

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
there are certain occasions where I will put work into having everything visualized,

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000
and Listless is going to be a big one, because it is very, very notable.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Sorry for the dead area, guys. You've got to enjoy live radio.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Womp womp.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Yeah, my mixing board over here is kind of crappy, because one of the ports I don't think really works,

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.000
so I have to kind of do things in a jig-jag pattern, and if I mess it up, then somebody's mic doesn't get turned on.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
I've done it to Jamie. I've done it to Jason. I hate it, so...

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Rude.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Sorry, didn't mean to do that.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Rude.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000
So, yeah, where was I anyway? Oh, yes, I was talking about my ex-girlfriend was the one that came up with the name Listless,

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.000
and we're actually still good friends today. She does Rocky Horror stuff like I do.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
She does it all in the Bay Area. She's also the one that got me into that.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:15.000
So, yeah, it's just funny, but that's how old that whole segment is, so we'll be playing that again next week, something to look forward to.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:23.000
All right, let us get into some rapid-fire news. We've still got plenty of show to go, so let's get to it. Loki.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:31.000
All right, so, let's see, starting off here, we've got ARMA 3. Now, this is kind of funny.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.000
They had a little bit of, like, I don't know if this was back from April Fools. Oh, it was April Fools.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I do remember seeing this now because they did a parody of that Jean-Claude Van Damme, you know, the split video thing.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:50.000
But ARMA Carts is now real DLC, so now they have kart racing in ARMA 3, so you can check that out if you want.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:57.000
It's at $1.99 for that expansion, and they have, I guess, a number of track objectives and checkpoint races.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:04.000
And then, of course, I guess they're saying that they're going to launch a major gameplay expansion for ARMA by late 2015.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:16.000
And as of right now, they have sold one million copies to date, so not bad. Kind of interesting to check out kart racing.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I'm kind of excited about this. You know, I've talked a lot about Goat Simulator, but they're doing their big 1.1 patch, which is coming on June 3rd.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Now, it's not just a patch for the game. They add a ton of stuff to this. They have a brand new map in the game.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:40.000
They've got a bunch of new goats in there as well. Split-screen multiplayer for up to four people. Goat Parkour.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:50.000
And they even have, what they're teasing now, is a Minecraft-like goat that allows you to build grass blocks by the looks of it.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.000
So that's going to be in there as well, and it's just going to be one glitchy, fun game.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:03.000
The best part about it? It's free. It's a free patch. So you'll be getting all that content starting June 3rd.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:10.000
And last but not least, Watch Dogs. They've broken Ubisoft's day one sales record.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Definitely a lot of people were waiting for the game. In fact, several months, because it was supposed to be out in November.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:23.000
12.5 million copies within the first five months of release was the original record.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:31.000
That was held by Assassin's Creed 3. Apparently, though, Watch Dogs did say what they actually sold.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:37.000
No, it hasn't said what they've sold exactly, but it sold more copies than Assassin's Creed 3.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait for the NPD numbers to get the actual number of copies sold.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see if it keeps momentum, too, because it definitely seemed like a lot of people were really excited about Watch Dogs.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.000
And then, you know, obviously Mario Kart 8 has been dominating the conversation over the weekend.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.000
But now that those games will both be out, it'll be interesting to see kind of that longevity factor.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Because the Watch Dogs reviews seem to be a little tepid to me.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Seems like there was a lot more hype behind that game than where people actually ended up kind of feeling about it.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.000
I have a feeling there's going to be, granted, a lot of 5 DLC announcements probably at E3.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Yeah.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Because they've been prepping a major story DLC in there. I mean, they're slowly adding things in each patch to kind of prep it for the new stuff.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Things have been kind of quiet on the Grand Theft Auto front.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:28.000
So, I think we're going to see a lot from that. Although, that might put a little bit of a damper there.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:34.000
But, again, not to say that Ubisoft doesn't have any DLC plans. They have a season passing available for Watch Dogs.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Pre-summer is a good time to release a game because there's not a whole ton coming out during the summer.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Jason, what do you have for us?

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:52.000
A bunch of quick, fun little things as the reason why we call this rapid fire news.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Rapid fire news?

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Yeah, that's the second time my brain decided to just stop. That's wonderful.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
You could just make a name up and we'd probably believe you.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.000
I was thinking lightning something? Shit.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000
If you said quick fire news, I'd probably look at you funny, but I'd be like, okay, just roll with it.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000
I also usually don't do this segment, so that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Anyways, NES Remix 2. Some individuals are not able to actually unlock all of the titles in the game.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:23.000
The remix producer Hayashida posted an entry to Miiverse in practically every language, too.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:30.000
That was denoting that there is a secret code to unlock all the titles you have not yet or if you just want to do it from the start.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000
The hint is star, test, clear.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:41.000
And if you're not going to look at the comments and just look it up, the secret is it is an anagram for start, select, R, A.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Start the game, hold start, select, R, press A.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Boom. Game starts, you have all the titles unlocked and you can go crazy with playing the rest of the challenges involved in each of them.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Capcom, quite notably, finally disbanded Mega Man Legends 3 and there's a bit of hemming and hawing about whether or not that game is actually going to happen.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000
The producer wants it to, but well, he's not with Capcom anymore.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:19.000
So when Capcom fails, fans unite and a team of people under the name of Jisaku-3 has the goal of creating a prototype version of Mega Man Legends 3 in Unity.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:30.000
It is being based off the media that has been released in footage so far and there is a video available out there looking for Mega Man Legends 3 Unity prototype.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:41.000
They're going to give it a shot and we'll see what the internet bicker fest holds to see should this actually come to fruition and the team of people being capable enough to actually create something.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Snark aside, this sounds like a really fun thing.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:52.000
I did not get very far in Legends 2. Legends 1 I absolutely adored. I would love to see the series continue in some way.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.000
There is a lot of fun, friendliness, mechanics, that kind of stuff in this game that I would like to see again.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Last but not least, a museum in New Mexico has identified 700 copies of all of the copies of E.T. that were unearthed last month.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
It was already a month ago, Jesus Christ.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:18.000
As of the dig last month, 700 copies have been identified as capable of being sold.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:28.000
They are going to be appraised and handed over to a museum for curation, displaying, and selling because they are now artifacts.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Artifacts of a day gone by and urban legends aplenty and everything that was talked about in the lead up to that movie.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Exactly.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
I can't help but think, how much is one of these really worth?

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
No prices announced yet.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Yes, I realize they have 700 or whatever, but you know there's thousands more still in the ground.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
You're essentially buying garbage.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Thank you, you are buying garbage.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:02.000
But they will be appraised, they will be invariably cleaned up superficially, just ground dirt.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Great, so you're going to get garbage that isn't garbage anymore.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
With a certificate of authenticity.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
More garbage.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
We authenticate this garbage as garbage.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:17.000
That's what artifacts are though. You're buying into a memory.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
You're buying into a story.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Why would you buy into a memory of terrible?

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.000
I remember this game being shit.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I bought it, it's shit.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.000
And it sat with shit for 20 years.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Oh my god, I'm sorry. People will buy it.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Well if there's less snark from you guys, then they will be available.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:44.000
There's a part of me that's like, maybe for 20 bucks I'd do it.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Good luck.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
20 bucks buys you one of the ones they couldn't restore.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
20 bucks buys me the dog shit that it sat next to.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
It actually probably buys you 20 of them that they wouldn't be willing to sell.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Probably more like 200 if that, probably even more, we'll see.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Alright, DarkSaga.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Oh yeah, stuff.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Yes. Not just garbage.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Well, Mario Kart 8 is going to be bringing some DLC in Japan at any rate.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
They've got apparently a deal with Mercedes.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.000
So Mario will be driving around a teeny little Mercedes kart.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Yeah, whatever.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Hey, I'm excited that DLC is going to be a thing for this Mario Kart.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Even if, whatever, free Mercedes kart, I'm hoping this means tracks.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Yes? Tracks? Tracks? Nintendo? Tracks? Hello? Tracks? Anybody? Tracks?

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Maybe.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Alright, tracks.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Wasn't that a bad game or something?

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Actual battle mode tracks and not shit? Just saying.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
An ET track?

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Battle mode on the Nintendo 64? I think the Wii U is more powerful than the Nintendo 64.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Alright, we can sit here and bitch all night. Sorry, JB.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:08.000
At any rate, there is going to be a Famicom game coming out to the west.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Finally, it will be on, actually, the European 3DS virtual console on May 29th.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:21.000
I don't see anything on a US date for this, but it's the mysterious Muramase Castle.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:27.000
It's the game that Nintendo Land's attraction, Takamaru's Ninja Castle, is based off of.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:37.000
But it will be coming out for 4.49 in pounds for 4.99 euro.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:45.000
And then, last but not least, as soon as it loads,

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.000
we can say goodbye to Mythic Entertainment.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Depressing.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Quite. The article still won't load, sorry.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
That's alright.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
That's pretty much all there is to say.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:02.000
EA closes yet another studio, and these are the guys that brought you Dark Ages of Camelot,

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
and Warhammer Online, which I understand was not the big success they wanted it to be,

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:12.000
but EA fucks up another studio, I thought.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Good job. Thumbs up.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
That's my reaction.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Yeah.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Well, I mean, to be fair, though, Mythic didn't have a grand slam in their last couple releases,

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000
but there's a lot of fans of the Camelot game that was very upset, which I can understand.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.000
So, sorry to hear it, to those that work there.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Alright, let's go to the Fookle Question of the Week.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.000
In happier news, we talk to you guys every week in a statement we call the Fookle Question of the Week.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.000
You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam it together, and you get one hell of a social network.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:50.000
It's very uncomfortable.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Here's what we asked the Fooklers this week.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
That's my new name, the Fooklers.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Meet the Fooklers, starring Neil Patrick Harris.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.000
We are back this week after a week off, and did you hear?

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.000
There's some nice sales on RPG Maker on the Humble Bundle and Steam this week.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:12.000
I forgot to mention, the Steam weekend sale was RPG Maker 4, so they kind of got in on this, too.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Between that and Loki's talk about game building and my stories about the love of ZZT, an early game maker game,

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
this question is all about creation.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Have you ever created a game, be it big or small?

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
What was it about and what inspired you to do it?

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:33.000
So, when we talk about game making, we sadly don't have a lot of answers, but we'll read what we got.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Now, Jonko, one of our buddies from Koopa Club, answered the question.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.000
I don't know if this is a game he actually made, or if he thought this question was,

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.000
what is a game you'd like to see made, but we'll roll with it.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
We'll just pretend Jonko made this game in his head.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.000
He said, well, we already have first person shooters and third person shooters,

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
but what about a second person shooter?

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.000
You play as a blind assassin who has the power to possess the eyesight of others.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Your objective is to possess the eyesight of your enemy,

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.000
and then hunt down and kill that person while seeing from their perspective.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Or would a second person shooter just be a game about shooting yourself in the head?

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Damn, Atlus already beat me to that one with Persona 3.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
I feel like that is a game.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:20.000
There was a game that consisted of, you had sight into zombie creatures or something of the sort,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
and you could look into their eyes and figure out where the safe path is,

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.000
what they can and can't see based off your route.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I don't suppose it sounds familiar to anyone.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.000
It was on the PlayStation 2, I remember, but for the life of me, I can't think of the other game.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
I'm sure the chat will jump. That's why I love having a live chat room,

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
because they think of that stuff when we don't.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Japanese, 1400s, classic Japanese kind of game.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
It was in that sort of mythos.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Kaijuta says, call it Eye of the Beholder.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Already exists.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Does it? Wow.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Yeah.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
It's a D&D license.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Oh, yeah. It was also a movie, I think, with Ashley Judd,

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
which I'm sure the two have nothing in common.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
But they should. Ashley Judd's kind of awesome.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
What was the PS3? Eye of Judgment, never mind.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
MXC says Siren.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Joosten says Geist.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Bonds006 says Geist.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Geist sounds familiar.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Yeah, it does.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
It does.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
I think that's it.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
I know of Siren, but I don't think that's it.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Oh, look it up.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Look it up, look it up.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.000
To the wiki.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Meanwhile, while he looks that up,

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
going to our buddy Rene from Koopa Club,

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000
who says, yes, I have, but it was a vampire LARP,

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.000
or live action roleplay,

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
which has the additional factor of players doing the weirdest

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
and most random shit you could think of,

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
but when people told you how much they enjoyed the game

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
and chasing down a zombie gorilla,

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
it makes it all worthwhile.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
So your game involved zombie gorillas. Tell me more.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
I LARPed.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Yeah. I never did LARP, but I did D&D.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.000
I did vampire LARP, which is the nerdiest of LARPing ever.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.000
All those games, roleplaying, be it table, live action, whatever,

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
involved imagination and creating.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Dude, I'm still playing D&D on Saturdays.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Nice.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
I had to order more dice.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
All right. Moving on.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Andy R. says, I made some small games in high school.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Took a web design course that ended up being pretty much

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
just flash in our biweekly projects.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
I made a couple of games.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Most of them were terrible clones.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Sly Red Panda says,

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000
I made a Flappy Bird clone with Ornacia from RuPaul's Drag Race.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I saw that game on Twitter.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Did RuPaul's Drag Race or Vivacious ever see that?

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
You need to do a small update and send it out again, if not.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
You need to call the game. Mother has arrived.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Anyway.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I've made some Unreal 3 mods with UDK.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Starting to experiment with UE4.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Working with RPG Maker VX Ace right now.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Twine and Construct 2 are great for beginners.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Hitstun says, making games is fun.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
I come up with game ideas much faster than I build them.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.000
I got my start with some crappy TI-83 basic games in high school

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:55.000
before moving on to Game Maker 6, HTML5, and Unity 2D.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
We used Torque Game Builder to make The Adventures of Thong Girl,

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:02.000
a 2D platforming beat-em-up with a scantily clad superhero

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
that shoots lasers out of her butt.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
That's awesome.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
That's a bit like powdered toast man's premise.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Check out that game and my Ludum Dare games at bakamostudios.com.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000
That's baka as in stupid and mo as in moron.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000
We're three stupid morons from Columbus making games.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
That's awesome.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Bravo.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Yes, I will check those out.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000
You know what?

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
It's not often I just let people come on this show

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
and hawk whatever it is they're selling,

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.000
but if you're selling me girls shooting lasers out of their butt

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000
from your game studio called Stupid Moron Games,

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
you know what?

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Props to you mama.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
All right.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Going over to Google Plus where we have a couple answers.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000
I'm sorry.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Nothing's going to top that, you guys.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
All right, DarkTetsuya.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Can't wait until I play the game.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:02.000
DarkTetsuya says,

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I really wanted to get into Unity but ran into hang-ups

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
trying to get the programming code to work.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Frowned.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Prior to that, I wrote a few games in the games factory.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Search on the VoG forums.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.000
I made a post about them.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Nice plug.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Lastly, AJ Twist says,

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000
I tried making a fighting game on Flash nearly a decade ago.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Hit boxes and life bars are hard,

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
but I did make a card game.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Cutting perfectly shaped cards is hard.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Inspirations, anime, Tekken, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh,

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
and the love of creating.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
There you go.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:34.000
That game's getting linked in our chat room right now.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
You're going to see a spike in downloads this week.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Check that out.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.000
That's awesome.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000
It looks like MXC was correct.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Of the two, Geist was a GameCube name.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000
It didn't sound any bit familiar,

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
but Sirens seems like it matches up.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I don't remember playing more than 20 minutes of it,

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
but definitely something I want to revisit.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Not game production, but production on a game system.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
When I was in high school,

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.000
a friend of mine had a MTV music generator for the PS2,

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:04.000
and he actually put together some very interesting songs

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.000
just kind of mixing the samples and instruments available to you

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.000
in the game itself.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
He didn't have...

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
There was some peripheral.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
I think it was just like a karaoke revolution microphone

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.000
that you could use to record new stuff and put it in.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
But he actually did something with it,

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.000
and I still have the exported songs on my computer

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:26.000
in my library to this day, I think.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.000
All right, well...

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
I was going to say real quick,

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:33.000
I made a couple games back when click and play was a thing.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
In Windows 3.1, yes.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000
I made a game called Shoot First, Ask Questions Later,

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.000
and it was basically a game where it was...

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Like, a shooting game where you shot, like, hedgehogs.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Like, there was evil hedgehogs, and it was so stupid.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000
You should have made Shoot First, Ask Questions Later 2

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.000
as one of your projects.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Nah, it's too dumb.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Somebody needs to remake Boom.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Jamie, have you ever made a game?

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I guess you did talk about the roleplay.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Yeah, I did make an environment in D&D.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I mean, that's about it.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:08.000
And I've, you know, created my own written languages.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
That's about as close as I've gotten.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Very cool.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
I used to make little things in ZZT,

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
but nothing really cool, yeah.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:18.000
All right, well, joining us here, walking into the studio,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:22.000
taking a break from Mario Kart 8 to bless us with his presence.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Say hello to Shane.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Hi.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
And Shane wanted to answer the question.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Make sure you talk loud.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
I made DDR, bye.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Wait a minute.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Wait a minute, Shane.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000
You didn't make DDR.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000
You did not create DDR.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Oh, he wanted to rub it in that he helped to make DDR.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Yeah, well, where's DDR now?

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Do you still work for them, Shane?

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
I'm just saying, I could remake DDR, you know,

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:47.000
but I have a thought.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:48.000
I don't know.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000
I don't know.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
I don't know.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
I don't know.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
I don't know.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
I don't know.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
I don't know.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.000
I don't know.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:56.000
I don't know.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.000
I don't know.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.000
I couldn't remake DDR, you know, but I have the concept.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:01.000
It's up in my head.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
It's just, you know, getting it out on program.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Some day.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Some day I will.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Or make something that's like it.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:10.000
One of these, one of these days.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
One of these days, Shane, one of these days.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Because I know you still talk to all of them.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I want you to get all your buddies from the Konami days

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:22.000
and get them all over here, and we're just going to dish,

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.000
because I know that's an episode people want to hear.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Alright, anyway, moving on.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Let's get into some more news here, because again, we're running a little long.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.000
I have a follow-up.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Uh-oh, Shane has a follow-up.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Hurry up, Shane.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
It's a five-hour show tonight.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Just get Flaco Jones over here and we'll talk about how we got drunk at work all the time.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
That would explain why some of the steps you made were so bad.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:49.000
He wasn't drunk then.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
He wasn't very good at making steps.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.000
I'd have been better if he was drunk.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Just kidding.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I never played him, so I don't know.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says,

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:00.000
A Shane appears, wielding the power of DDR.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Alright.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.000
UltraMix isn't even backwards compatible.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
He just yelled from the other room,

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
You're not backwards compatible.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Nice retort, nice retort.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Alright, let's get into some other news.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Loki.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
And we had to announce it officially news because it leaked out everywhere news.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Battlefield Hardline was announced this week.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
It's going to have its official reveal on June 9th,

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000
when it was originally going to have its official reveal,

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
and not previously when all the different assets and shit started leaking out.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Or in, hey, internal gameplay video that they had from six months ago.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:41.000
That's fantastic, when it was codename Omaha.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:50.000
But Battlefield Hardline is going to be a cops versus criminals Battlefield type game.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:56.000
And kind of think a little bit along the lines of like a Grand Theft Auto 5 meets Pay Day,

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.000
in like the Battlefield type gameplay.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
So you're going to be doing heists,

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.000
you're going to be fighting off against criminals, police, and whatnot.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
So it looks pretty cool.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
And of course, it's supposed to be coming out later this year,

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
and they're going to show it off at E3.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.000
I'm actually kind of excited about it.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.000
It looks pretty sweet.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:19.000
It's kind of like all the excitement they were saying they were going to have with the heists in Grand Theft Auto 5,

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:23.000
which are kind of lame for the most part.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:27.000
And I know with online they were doing these heists, and it's just still not very exciting.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:32.000
But all the Battlefield gameplay has always looked exciting, so I kind of want to check it out.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Alright, I'm sure there will be more to come at E3.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Alright, moving on to some other quick updates here.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:45.000
This is still more fallout from the whole closure of GameSpy and all that.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:51.000
But the good news is Epic is serving up a patch to help Unreal Tournament 3 get off those servers.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:55.000
That patch is now out, and it will send players to new servers,

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.000
meaning Unreal Tournament 3 no longer tied to GameSpy.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:03.000
You can check out that patch, which will work with the Steam version of Unreal Tournament 3.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.000
You can check that all out at EpicGames.com if you want to do that,

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
because of course there is no more GameSpy.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Speaking of games getting off cancelled services,

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Games for Windows Live is going to be shutting its doors in August,

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.000
so Capcom is getting Super Street Fighter IV the hell off of the service.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000
So Super Street Fighter IV is now available on Steam.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.000
That's the new platform of choice, and you can get that on Steam at 75% off.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:33.000
It's only $8 on Steam before June 1st. That's not so bad at all.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Now, here's the problem, is that because of the shift from Games for Windows Live,

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.000
you may lose some of your DLC costumes.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:45.000
DLC costumes that were issued to the retail Games for Windows Live version of the game

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.000
are tied to the game's physical disk and are not able to jump to Steam

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
along with the rest of the components.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:57.000
So, again, one of the downsides of this DLC, it's always only ever temporary.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Anyway, at least those games will continue in one way or another.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Rob, all things are temporary.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I guess that's true.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Everything ends.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000
That's true.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Even us.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
That's right, we're slowly dying right now.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Right now.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
All we are is dust in the wind.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Dust.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Wind.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Dude.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.000
What a nice positive show we're having tonight.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Hey, I quoted Bill & Ted.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Hey, have a great E3, everybody. You're gonna die.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Hey, I was just quoting Bill & Ted in that last bit.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:33.000
I know, I know.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.000
You're gonna die soon, you're gonna die soon.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
It's not cold in here, you're just dying.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Thank you, Sarah Silverman.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Alright, moving on.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Dark Soccer.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Hopefully you have some more positive news for us.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Nope.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:46.000
It's all shit.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Uh-oh.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Representative Bob Latta, who is a Republican from Ohio, filed legislation that would prevent

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:04.000
the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, from attempting to regulate broadband internet.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.000
So, yeah, this is more net neutrality bullshit.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Turns out, this guy, he was funded by a telecommunications campaign group.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Of course.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Of course.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:25.000
He received $51,000 from cable company interests for about two years, ending December 2013.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.000
And there is a group called Open Secrets.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
It's a campaign finance watchdog group.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:40.000
He was one of 28 House members who lobbied to drop net neutrality after they got kind of paid off.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:49.000
So he got part of his money, it looks like, money from AT&T, money from a national cable

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:56.000
and telecommunications association, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, American Cable Association,

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:59.000
CenturyLink, and Comcast.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.000
And his bill is to, quote, amend the Communications Act of 1934 to limit the authority of the

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Federal Communications Commission over providers of broadband internet access service.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
He wants to keep the internet open and accessible.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.000
No.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:19.000
He wants to keep the internet monetized for the people who are paying him off.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:26.000
I just still find it so weird how we are trying to alter a global service.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:32.000
I mean, when you start to create that some sites work differently than other sites, isn't

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.000
that how the internet works in, like, China?

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:40.000
I mean, granted, I might be being a little bit extreme and shocking, but this is shocking.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
It's not that they slow it down.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
They just plain block them.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
I know that's what they do in China.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.000
But my point is, like, what's really the difference at the end of the day?

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Okay, maybe.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
All right.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Some people might have very impassioned answers to that.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000
But my point is, is that, you know, this whole net neutrality thing, this is going

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000
a little too far, especially when she's talking about things like this.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:08.000
So I'm just going to say, y'all, let your congressperson know that you do not support

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000
candidates who, you know, are supporting.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Vote the bastards out and they can eat a bowl of dicks.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Well, if they don't do anything about it, if you keep telling your congressman to do

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.000
something and you have a bunch of people doing that and they just still just kind of sit

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
there with their thumbs up their ass and yes, vote them out.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:35.000
You know, I realize it's a worldwide show, but, you know, participate in your government,

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
you know, however you're able to.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
And here in America, we vote.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
So please vote.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Thankfully.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:46.000
He has no co-sponsors, so it really is just him.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:51.000
The bill has gone to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:56.000
So, yeah, vote the bastards out, send them a bowl of dicks.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Hopefully they're candy dicks, but instead of actually tasting like candy, they taste

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
like, I don't know, pee.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.000
They taste like E.T. cartridges that have been buried in the ground.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:13.000
They taste like the tears of children, which is probably what I would say some conservatives

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:14.000
feed on.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Is that a Jelly Belly?

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:20.000
You just take, you take the cartridges from, you know, the buried E.T.s, you grind them

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:25.000
up into a fine powder, you take the tears of crying children, you make it into a paste,

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.000
form the molds into little penises and then mail those off to, you know.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Here, a bag of dicks.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Now, you know, you know, I just want you guys have really active imaginations right now,

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.000
and it's a little bit alarming.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Like, I'm just saying.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Anyway, so one, there's something really, really wrong with this article, and I think

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000
I just saw it explained at the end of it.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Bob Latta, the legislation that he's filing would prevent the FCC from attempting to regulate

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:03.000
broadband internet service as a public utility under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:11.000
That is what people that are fighting for net neutrality want to have happen.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.000
That's not what the FCC said they were going to do.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:20.000
They were going to allow fast lanes, breaking net neutrality.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.000
So, like, first of all, both of these are steps in the wrong direction.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Bob Latta is fucking it over, period, but the FCC was going to anyway.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.000
So there's, there's like a whole second layer of this article.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
He doesn't know what the fuck is going on in the first place.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:37.000
We want it to, I want it to be filed to be, to be classified as a public utility.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I want it to be.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.000
And I believe that as well.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Yes.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
But, and, and he's preventing that.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.000
So the problem is still there.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:49.000
The problem is he's doing it by preventing the FCC from doing it, which is irrelevant.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:54.000
So file this one under left hand, not doing, not knowing what the right hand's doing.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Well, he's just making sure that they can't do that.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Sure.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Because they could change their mind later.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
He's protecting his little side paycheck.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:06.000
It's a preemptive strike because we know the FCC is under a lot of pressure to change there.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:07.000
That's, that's what's happening.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Sure.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
And, and, and he's getting calls from other Congress people.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.000
I believe, don't quote me on this because I'm going off of like what I think I read

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000
a couple of weeks ago.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:20.000
I believe Al Franken has been trying to get internet put as a utility.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:23.000
So I think this is a preemptive strike against that.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
So, yeah, not any better.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:28.000
It's just, there's, there's, yeah, like I said, a whole second layer of just fucked

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.000
up-ness here.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Yeah.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.000
So, all right.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Uh, anyhow, let's, I'm still off from moving to Finland.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Let's let's go to AKA Ripper's house in Sweden.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
We can stay with AKA Ripper.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I don't know that-

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Does he still listen to this show?

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I don't know.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:45.000
But this, okay.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:49.000
I, right, I, I would say that we should move to Australia, but right now Tony Abbott is

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:53.000
a big, um, well, he, um, he can eat shit.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
We don't need to move anywhere.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
We need to fix this country we've got.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.000
That's what we need to do.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:03.000
We need, we need to divide this country into four smaller, more easily, uh,

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Administrated countries.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
And mine's going to be called Awesome.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
All right.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Because-

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Let's move, let's move on.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Where people will be fed on dreams and rainbows.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:16.000
We could talk about Jamie's plans to take over the world all night, but, uh, we do have

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:17.000
to keep moving on.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:18.000
I don't want to take over the world.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Too much fucking work.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Loki.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Well, we can talk about world domination.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
It's kind of fun.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Um, Steam, you may remember they have their Linux machines that are supposed to be coming

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.000
out at some point.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Well, they probably aren't.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Apparently the Steam controller, uh, which is supposed to be coming out, um, sometime

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:43.000
in 2014 is now, um, getting a release window of some time in 2015.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:48.000
So, you know, people are thinking it's implied that the Steam machines won't be coming out

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:49.000
until 2015.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Which, honestly, at this point, I don't know.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:56.000
It doesn't really, it does, to me, the Steam machines don't really sound that interesting

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:57.000
yet.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:01.000
You haven't really sold me yet on why I need one.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:05.000
That's pretty much where I'm at right now.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000
So.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Maybe this delay is to kind of help make that argument?

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Or maybe add some features to SteamOS, because I don't know where they're at with, you know,

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:17.000
integration with, like, certain apps and stuff like that.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Because, you know, they were doing, like, some basic, like, music app, but they don't

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.000
really have a whole ton of features yet.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Alright.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Uh, let's move on, just for time's sake.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Jason.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Contin- ow.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Way to bite your tongue, Jason.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:40.000
In, uh, in further, everybody hears about Kickstarter news, uh, Reading Rainbow, uh,

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:45.000
fronted, quite obviously by LeVar Burton, landed only, what, four or five days ago at

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:46.000
this point?

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
And in the first day, already beat its million dollar goal.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Uh, it is on pace to be the first double-digit, double-digit, double-digit funded, double-digit

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:59.000
in the millions funded Kickstarter that I know of, at any rate.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Maybe-

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Why can't we elect LeVar Burton to Congress?

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.000
That's what I want to-

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Clearly, America loves LeVar Burton, which, and rightfully so.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
There is some very interesting backlash against this Kickstarter, but I'm not well informed

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:10.000
enough to comment-

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
There's always some goddamn back-

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Just saying.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Which, isn't that ironic that I'm the one saying this?

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:20.000
But there's always, there's always some goddamn backlash, you know what I mean?

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.000
But here's, here's the difference.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:25.000
I like to think my opinions were well thought out and reasonable.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.000
This other stuff, just stop.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Stop.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I'm right.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
You're not.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Exactly.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.000
I thought about it.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Exactly.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
You just came up with it.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Wait.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Uh, Reading Rainbow obviously has already had a successful Kickstarter and they are

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:42.000
laying down the stretch goals.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:47.000
The next goal that I don't think they've hit yet, but I'm going to look, is five million.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:52.000
And when they do that, their intention is to bring the media created by Reading Rainbow

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
to, well, pretty much fucking everything.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Phones, Android, game consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation, set-top boxes, a la Apple

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.000
TV, Roku, and I guess Fire TV as well.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
I could have Reading Rainbow on the PlayStation.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000
That's fun.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:09.000
You could have it on literally everything you own in this house.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:10.000
That's-

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.000
And not just PBS and the anarchy that that is.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:16.000
So it's like, reading Linux, basically.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.000
And Windows and ARM and-

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Rama says $3.2 million is the current tally.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
With 30 days to go.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Oh my God.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Is this stat have the potential to make more money than any other Kickstarter ever?

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.000
That I know of.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:32.000
How much do you make?

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Six million?

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:39.000
You mean like, I don't know, too much money for what they did with it.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
Let's put it that way.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000
All right.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.000
I saw an update the other day that certain titles are coming to Ouya.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.000
I'm like, Ouya's still around?

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Just a hair shy of 8.6 is what Ouya landed on.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Okay.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
So, okay, there's still a long ways to go before Reading Rainbow.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:55.000
You still have 30 days.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:01.000
I was just shocked at the supermarket today when I looked at the counter of the DVDs they're

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.000
trying to hawk it and I was like, Veronica Mars?

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000
The movie?

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Oh yeah.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Yeah, that was a thing.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Oh yeah.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
All right.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.000
All right.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Well, I'd be excited to see a Reading Rainbow app on console.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Why don't they do this for other PBS programs?

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Because, didn't Sesame Street get enough funding for PBS?

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Sesame Street had a Kinect thing, didn't they?

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
That was one of the big things they were touting with the Kinect for so much.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Yeah, they had that thing for Sesame Street, but they only did two seasons of it and that

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.000
was it.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:30.000
I don't know.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Maybe it's just my older age, but PBS isn't what I remember.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:40.000
You know, they don't have Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood or 321 Contact or...

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:41.000
The Electric Company.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Yeah, the Electric Company or Square One Television.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:44.000
The Electric Company.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
That was coming back, though.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Is it?

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I thought it was.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Weren't they rebooting it?

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
What does PBS educate the kids with now, besides Sesame Street?

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000
PBS is...

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
They're not young enough to be able to answer that question.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
They've got the Cat in the Hat.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Wasn't PBS also fucking Barney?

02:37:58.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Barney is on PBS.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000
And Lamb Chops.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Oh, but Lamb Chops.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Lamb Chops.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Play along.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.000
She died, though.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Oh, yeah.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Well, those socks only last so long.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Wow.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:15.000
You're going to special, hell.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Well done.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Anyways, so they've got that.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:22.000
They have Caillou, which teaches the kids about whining.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:28.000
They've got Dinosaur Train and...

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:31.000
What other crap does my son watch?

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000
All right.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Rama says the most funded Kickstarter was the Pebble Watch.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.000
10.2 million.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:43.000
So I guess I lied about the tens of millions backing, but they are on track to shatter

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
this very quickly.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Interesting.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Three, two, one, contact came back.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Get out.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
I miss Mr. Rogers, though.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
And you can't recreate Mr. Rogers.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
You know what else I miss from PBS?

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.000
I'm sorry.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.000
I'm just making this show longer.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:03.000
But God dammit, for people like Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross, I'm going to take a moment to

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.000
remember, because Bob Ross was the best.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.000
The best.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Fluffy white clouds.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
This old house was awesome.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:15.000
And as much as I like Norm, though, I do miss Bob Vila doing it.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
You know what PBS does have, though?

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Downton Abbey.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
There is that.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:21.000
And you know what?

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:22.000
In the Bay Area...

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
It's a BBC show, but PBS has it here.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000
And the Bay Area?

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
They had Yen Can Cook.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Alright.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Anyway.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000
That's fucking awesome.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Let's move on.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Rama in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Square One TV is my jam.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Oh my God.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Like, I know we've had our Square...

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:37.000
And, and, and!

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Yes.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.000
And Ghostwriter.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000
And...

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:43.000
I don't know.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Square One TV brought us MathNet.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Oh my God.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000
MathMan.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.000
MathMan.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000
MathMan.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:51.000
MathMan.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000
MathNet was way better.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.000
MathNet was way better.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Anyway.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:55.000
Alright.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Let's move on.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000
We gotta get to the mailbag.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:04.600
So, thanks to shows like Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and 321 Contact, you can read and you can

02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:05.600
write.

02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:08.000
And so you've sent us emails.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Elite Most...

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Two story?

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.000
Most of you can.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Two story, Rob?

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Yes.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:14.000
I've been able to read since I was two.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Yeah.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
I was two and a half.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Yeah.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Crazy, huh?

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
My first book that I read?

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Like I would probably say actual novel length book was Little House in the Big Woods.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000
I always...

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.000
When I was four.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.000
I always look back at like what a smart kid I was and I go, what happened?

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Video games.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
And on that note, let's get to the mailbag.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Participate at Orangelauntrady.com if you want to participate at the show.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000
We got a few emails.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000
We have to catch up from a week off.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
So, I know Dr. Sakai has a few emails tonight.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
So, let's get to it.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.000
We do.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.000
We have a few.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:56.000
The first one is from EA Skizie.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Wiggity, wiggity, what's up, Orangelauntrady.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Smile.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Yep, I'm a huge dork.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.000
Your Christopher 10 segment was great and I downloaded Baba Yetu as soon as the show

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:06.000
was over.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:09.000
The segment prompted me to send some of the music I've been working on to you.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.000
One song is attached.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:14.000
It's free for anybody to listen to use or listen to.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
So, no worries on the right to whatever.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:19.000
FYI, I am currently searching for the vocal artists.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Think back to high school or early college.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000
What was your first drinking party experience and what was it like?

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Tell us some funny stories of the first time you were inebriated.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
You know they're usually funny.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Okay, I'll tell you right now.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
The first time I was drunk I was two years old.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Wait, wait, wait.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Hold on.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Hold on.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Wait, which email is this?

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Is this the Skizie one?

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Yeah, Skizie.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Okay.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Because I have to play the song while we tell our drunk stories.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.000
So, this is the song that he attached to the email.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:49.000
And I can't.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
How do I change the volume?

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Where did it go?

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Ah.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Ah.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Fail.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Live radio is really hard.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Hold on.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.000
We've got to start.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Hold on.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:03.000
Live radio is really, really hard, you guys.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:04.000
All right.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Jamie will tell her story and then I'll get the song.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.000
All right.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Okay.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:08.000
So, yeah.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.000
I was two years old and my mom's boyfriend got me drunk on a couple of beers.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Anyway, that's where the source of my superpowers came from.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:21.000
This is how I found out, though, that I can't get hangovers.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Is I was at my friend Michelle's house and this is, we were in Mississippi.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Some kind of dumb party.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000
We were just drinking the whole time.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:35.000
I had to have been like 19, 20, something like that.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:40.000
And we were, this is also how I found out that I like to mix really weird things because

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.000
I want to start tasting the alcohol after a certain point.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
And you've had my concoctions, Rob.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
You know how far I'll take it.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Some of them are really good.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.000
So I was just drinking everything.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
I mean, they put it in front of me.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.000
That's also how I found out that I hate Jaeger because I didn't realize it was licorice and

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
I hate licorice like a lot.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:04.000
But I drank some of everything and then I realized I found orange juice in the fridge

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.000
so I mixed tequila in it.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:09.000
What I didn't know is that the orange juice was screwdrivers.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:17.000
So I took screwdrivers already and added tequila to it and drank two whole pint glasses

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:22.000
full of it along with Everclear shots.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:27.000
And, um, God, I don't remember what else the fuck I had that night.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.000
And I woke up the next morning hungry.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
That's how I found out that I don't get hangovers.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Slow jams starting on this song.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.000
I'm going to take Skeezy's song down here a little bit so I can tell you my story real quick.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:40.000
I'll make this quick.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.000
First time I ever drank.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
One thing, Brad, I'm sorry.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:46.000
It is physically impossible for me to have a hangover.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:47.000
You have no idea.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
I cannot get a hangover.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:50.000
And I've tried.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.000
That sounds like a challenge, though.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:52.000
You've seen me.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Yeah, no, I know.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:54.000
I know.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:58.000
But I also remember you passed out on the bed demanding waffles or something like that.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Anyway, that was an early OLR episode.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Anyway, first time I ever drank was in college, which is where I think a lot of people start

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.000
it, although it was shots of Bacardi 151, although I only had a few, so I didn't really

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:09.000
get drunk.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:13.000
The first time I ever got like super rip roaring drunk was actually I was kind of a late bloomer

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:14.000
in this regard.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:17.000
The first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience of the 25th anniversary

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Rocky Horror Convention.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:25.000
I was with Jessica from under station live and I we had a warp core breach.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
We quote unquote shared a warp core breach.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:31.000
But that means Jessica had like two sips and I had the rest of the fishbowl.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
And yeah, I got really, really drunk.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:38.000
And there's a voicemail I left to Travis because under station live was going at the

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:39.000
time.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:44.000
And Travis still plays that goddamn voicemail on that show to this day.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
So there you go.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
And no, I'm not playing it for you here.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:51.000
You can go check out under station live, although they're on hiatus right now.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:52.000
We can check out their old episodes.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:57.000
And now with that, there's actually a follow up to this, you know, when Jessica and I went

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:02.000
to the Star Trek experience and we had two warp core breaches.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:06.000
And these people left their warp core breach and we finished it.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Wow.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Drinking other people's booze.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:09.000
That's awful.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:10.000
No, they're like, we can't finish it.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Like alcohol is fucking sterile.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:13.000
We'll drink it.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Do you guys want the rest of our drink?

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Yeah, sure.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:17.000
Drink.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:24.000
So that's where we developed the pattern of going on the ride sober, drinking a lot, then

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.000
going on the ride drunk, then going on the ride while you're sobering.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.000
And I think we called you at that time.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:32.000
And then we called Travis.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Yep.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:37.000
And that was, and we also played DDR on that machine.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.000
All right.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Easy song has a minute left.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:43.000
So Jason or Loki, you have an inebriation story to share.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:48.000
If you're a late bloomer, I'm still gestating because I don't have such stories.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Really?

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
I have a dream.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.000
E3 is coming up.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:53.000
All right.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.000
And I am going to be surrounded by a hell of a lot of people that I do trust my life

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:58.000
with.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Loki, anything quickly you want to share?

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Um, I don't know.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:05.000
I've gotten sick on the show before because I got drunk drinking screwdrivers.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Actually, I think skeezy, you want to go back in the night.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
I was making the screwdrivers.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:10.000
What episode was it?

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:11.000
No, I was making the screwdrivers.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:14.000
I just kept using the double shot shot glasses.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.000
It's shot.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:21.000
So I kept putting too much, um, that I probably shouldn't have had that much minestrone before,

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
you know, coming into the show.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:24.000
It's very acidic.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Well, we, all right, we have more of the email.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:28.000
You know how I talk about, sorry.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Oh, LR was a very, very different show in the earlier days.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Maybe dark tissue.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:35.000
You can tell you what episode number it was because Lord knows I forgot, but there's an

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.000
episode where we got so, or I got so drunk on air.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:45.000
We're on air and I'm lying on the ground with the microphone and I'm kicking the wall.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
I'm kicking the wall going, I'm in the matrix.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
I'm in the matrix.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.000
And this was somehow a radio show that we did now.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Was that episode 69 granted?

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
We haven't improved that much.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:59.000
No, we didn't, we didn't drink on episode 69.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Some people did.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:01.000
It was like one of our anniversary shows.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:08.000
I remember a party over at that apartment where Shane and I were drinking and watching

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:13.000
all you guys play spin the bottle and we decided to replace the word drunk with dunk because

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:14.000
it was funny.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Yeah.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Shane.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Aim red.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:18.000
All right.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Back when I used to make super bacon.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Rest of the email.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Rest of the email.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:23.000
Okay.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Rest of the email.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Uh, Oh yeah.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Once again, love you guys.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Keep gaming.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Keep podcasting.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Keep caring.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:32.440
Uh, that's from EA skeezy from Wisconsin.

02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:34.000
We have a few listeners in Wisconsin.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.000
There you go.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
He just filled like six or seven minutes of the show.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
We got to get high.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Hi.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:41.000
It's, it's a Swede.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
We have another Swede.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Sweet.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:48.400
I'm going to say, because there's not a name on this, I'm going to say inkblot.

02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:52.000
We need, we need a, we need more places to crash in Sweden.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Hi.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Here's some technical reasons for why the Wii U doesn't have GameCube games.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000
As far as I see it now, this is an older email.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Okay.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:04.000
It was, uh, came in the week we were off, but this is what I was referencing earlier.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Jason was this email.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Maybe it will interest you and I don't have a question, but I think the situation is pretty

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.000
interesting.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Just a cool thing about the Wii U home brewers have made GameCube ISOs available on Wii U's

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Wii section via devolution on the home brew channel.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Since Wii and GameCube have the same architecture, the hacker explained it as just showing the

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:27.000
GameCube games the hardware that the GameCube had.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Uh, just like devoting a portion of the Wii RAM so the memory addresses, uh, addresses

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.000
map the same way as it did on the GameCube.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:36.000
It's not emulation.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Really cool stuff.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:43.000
It's the same technique Nintendo used for the 3DS's ambassador program, GBA games.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:48.000
But Nintendo never went forward with this on the 3DS for GBA on Virtual Console since

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.000
it runs off the 3DS's DS hardware.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:57.000
While it's in DS mode, the actual 3DS hardware is shut off.

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
No street pass, internet browsing, etc.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:05.000
It's not ideal and Nintendo wants ideal so they would want it to run on the 3DS mode

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.000
hardware which would require emulation.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:14.000
They've had that problem developing such an emulator ergo no GBA 3DS VC games.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Yeah.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Um, it's the same situation on Wii U so Nintendo probably won't use the Wii U's capability

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
to run GameCube games almost natively.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:28.000
If GameCube comes to Wii U, it will probably be an HD rendering emulator from a Swede

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
who listens every week love the show.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:31.000
Thank you Swede.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:35.000
I, I am okay with them, um, doing that HD upres and stuff.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:36.000
They're not.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:37.000
They won't.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Yeah, I know.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:39.000
You know why?

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Why?

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Because the Wii doesn't upres.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:42.000
So they're not gonna fuckin' do it.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Well, if they develop that and they start upresing Wii games, that'd be pretty cool.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:49.000
But they're not.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Why doesn't Nintendo just one up the homebrew community and take some of these things that

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
they do and sell it?

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Oh my god.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:56.000
I don't know.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Alright.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Anyway.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Thank you for the email.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Three words.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Japanese corporate culture.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Okay.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:07.260
Dark Tetsuya says, by the way just so you know, first Drunk Show was number 29, after

02:50:07.260 --> 02:50:14.060
that was 33, and after that was number 148, the three year anniversary where Loki's story

02:50:14.060 --> 02:50:15.060
took place.

02:50:15.060 --> 02:50:18.740
So I'm guessing episode 148 was that show I'm thinking of.

02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:21.100
Which is probably in the OL archive somewhere.

02:50:21.100 --> 02:50:23.660
You'll have to, you'll have to come ask Dark Tetsuya for it.

02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:24.660
Now one of these days.

02:50:24.660 --> 02:50:25.660
Lord knows I'm not making that shit.

02:50:25.660 --> 02:50:30.460
One of these days we need to have like a Drunk Show marathon like block where we just have

02:50:30.460 --> 02:50:32.700
all the Drunk Shows playing back to back.

02:50:32.700 --> 02:50:34.140
That'd be funny.

02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:35.140
Love it.

02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:36.140
Alright.

02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:37.140
Next email.

02:50:37.140 --> 02:50:38.140
Oh yeah.

02:50:38.140 --> 02:50:39.140
Okay.

02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:40.140
Um.

02:50:40.140 --> 02:50:41.140
Hello.

02:50:41.140 --> 02:50:42.620
My name is Matt and I am a new listener to OLR.

02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:43.620
Hi Matt.

02:50:43.620 --> 02:50:44.620
Hi Matt.

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:48.660
A friend and I started a gaming podcast about two months ago and I have been listening to

02:50:48.660 --> 02:50:50.540
other gaming pods for inspiration.

02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:56.780
I have to say by a mile OLR is the best in terms of content I've heard thus far.

02:50:56.780 --> 02:50:59.100
Keep producing great content and I'll keep listening.

02:50:59.100 --> 02:51:00.100
A new listener.

02:51:00.100 --> 02:51:01.100
Matt.

02:51:01.100 --> 02:51:02.100
Thank you Matt.

02:51:02.100 --> 02:51:03.100
Get out.

02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:04.100
That's it?

02:51:04.100 --> 02:51:05.100
There's no plug for the show?

02:51:05.100 --> 02:51:06.100
No.

02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:09.900
Let us know your information and we will give you a plug-o-rama.

02:51:09.900 --> 02:51:10.900
You know what though?

02:51:10.900 --> 02:51:14.640
That's I mean I'm all for plugging other indie shows like that that's not a problem or whatever

02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:20.860
but like the fact that he didn't do that like really makes those words genuine in a way

02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:24.520
like it's not just hey I'm gonna kiss your ass you'll promote my show like it's like

02:51:24.520 --> 02:51:26.820
super genuine so thank you.

02:51:26.820 --> 02:51:32.580
That's positive words like that go so far in motivating what we do week after week after

02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:34.300
week so thank you so much.

02:51:34.300 --> 02:51:35.300
You rule.

02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:36.300
Yes.

02:51:36.300 --> 02:51:42.980
You rule like a lot but but yeah yeah you rule a lot but send us the stuff like I said.

02:51:42.980 --> 02:51:45.620
Good luck with your show but you could do a better job promoting it.

02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:46.620
We'll push.

02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:50.300
That's Orange On Radio tip number one.

02:51:50.300 --> 02:51:51.300
Rab stop.

02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:52.300
Stop it.

02:51:52.300 --> 02:51:54.300
I'm giving him a hard time.

02:51:54.300 --> 02:51:55.300
All right.

02:51:55.300 --> 02:52:04.260
All right so hey guys I'm not a guy found this show during the early years of podcasting

02:52:04.260 --> 02:52:09.620
tuned into the latest episode at the time episode 57 one day and have been laughing

02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:11.780
ever since you guys are great.

02:52:11.780 --> 02:52:14.660
Is there a P.O. box where I can send you a gift?

02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:19.100
I recently replaced my old microphone and instead of selling it I thought of O.L.R.

02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:21.940
It's a blue snowball microphone and it needs a home.

02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:22.940
Wow.

02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:26.620
I figured what better way to give back to the show that's been with me through the years.

02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:30.340
If not then that's cool too I just wanted to let you guys know to keep up the good work

02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:32.020
that comes from Randy.

02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:36.220
I will have to contact this person off air so don't delete that email and give that address.

02:52:36.220 --> 02:52:37.860
I don't ever delete the emails anymore.

02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:38.860
Yeah.

02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:39.860
OK.

02:52:39.860 --> 02:52:42.060
Except for the ones that come from marketers that we don't get anymore.

02:52:42.060 --> 02:52:43.060
Yeah.

02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:44.740
So that's awesome.

02:52:44.740 --> 02:52:48.700
I laughed a little bit there because I know another friend of ours Cody said he was going

02:52:48.700 --> 02:52:50.100
to send some mics.

02:52:50.100 --> 02:52:55.060
These mics we use right now were donated by Pod Culture and they work great.

02:52:55.060 --> 02:52:56.260
But here's my deal.

02:52:56.260 --> 02:52:59.660
If we get more mics than we can use which I somehow doubt that will happen because I

02:52:59.660 --> 02:53:04.180
know one of these mics is already going bad because they just go through a lot of abuse.

02:53:04.180 --> 02:53:08.380
So I know we can replace but I promise that we'll pay it forward.

02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:11.900
So because I know a lot of podcasters in the Bay Area I don't know a lot but I know enough

02:53:11.900 --> 02:53:16.280
in the Bay Area and they would happily take other mics and things like that.

02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:19.700
So I'm all for like paying it forward and all that.

02:53:19.700 --> 02:53:22.980
So yeah I'm curious to see what mic this might be.

02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:24.460
I'll contact this person off air.

02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:26.580
Thank you very much for the offer.

02:53:26.580 --> 02:53:29.820
I own one of those microphones as a matter of fact.

02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:30.820
Do you?

02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:31.820
What are they?

02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:32.820
Are they more hand mics or is that?

02:53:32.820 --> 02:53:37.740
No it's actually it's actually by no means a hand mic because it's literally just a ball.

02:53:37.740 --> 02:53:39.820
It's a it's it's a desktop stand mic.

02:53:39.820 --> 02:53:45.660
It's intended to kind of like be the play setting and it's it's not it is cardioid because

02:53:45.660 --> 02:53:46.660
these are dynamic.

02:53:46.660 --> 02:53:47.660
Yeah.

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:50.780
Or I always get it backwards but it's intended to just be a desk mic that you have there

02:53:50.780 --> 02:53:54.140
and it picks up enough of the room that you can just talk and yeah it's not a hand mic

02:53:54.140 --> 02:53:55.140
at all.

02:53:55.140 --> 02:53:57.620
I'd love to have on the kitchen counter for when people come in here screaming things

02:53:57.620 --> 02:53:58.940
like Shane tried to do earlier.

02:53:58.940 --> 02:54:00.220
It would be very good for ambient noise.

02:54:00.220 --> 02:54:01.580
Yeah it would be good for that.

02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:02.580
Ambient pickups rather.

02:54:02.580 --> 02:54:03.580
That'd be great.

02:54:03.580 --> 02:54:04.580
You guys rule.

02:54:04.580 --> 02:54:05.580
You guys don't have to give us anything.

02:54:05.580 --> 02:54:06.580
Just as we say at the end of every show.

02:54:06.580 --> 02:54:07.580
Tacos.

02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:09.040
Tell a listener or two about the show.

02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:11.740
You know somebody contacted me on Twitter going how can I send Jamie tacos.

02:54:11.740 --> 02:54:13.940
You know that I got that mail.

02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:21.380
You know actually I really tacos I can't really have them too often because I am eating ketogenic

02:54:21.380 --> 02:54:22.620
because I'm going back to the gym.

02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:23.620
Right.

02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:24.620
I thought you said adopt a kitten instead.

02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:29.900
Adopt a kitten do that adopt a kitten in my name and take care of this kitten and raise

02:54:29.900 --> 02:54:36.460
her or him with all the love in your heart and get it also contribute to having strays

02:54:36.460 --> 02:54:37.460
spayed and neutered.

02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:40.240
And it might love you back when it feels like it.

02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:46.320
You might see love in the shape of claws to your face or mid this thing lately is crawling

02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:51.160
up on this on my side like when I'm at my computer chair and like she'll attach with

02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:54.560
her claws on the side of my chair and then pat me on my shoulder.

02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:58.200
But sometimes she'll miss and get my armpit like mom.

02:54:58.200 --> 02:54:59.200
Mom love me.

02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:00.200
Pet pet.

02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:01.200
OK.

02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:02.200
I'm done.

02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:03.200
Bye.

02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:04.200
She fucks off.

02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:06.160
Brad from Pod Culture says that MXL nine ninety I sent will pick up a cat fart from three

02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:07.360
blocks away.

02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:08.360
That is true.

02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:11.720
I tried to use that mic and I was like OK this thing is way too sensitive.

02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:12.720
Like I can't.

02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:16.520
It's it's in one of the other boxes in the back room just because I was like I can't

02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:19.800
use this because we are all loud ass bitches.

02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:21.800
And this thing is going to.

02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:27.360
But I thought I actually was hanging on to it because there is a project in my mind right

02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:32.520
now where that other room is going to get turned into my little twitch lounge.

02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:33.720
So we'll see.

02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:34.720
Anyway.

02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:35.720
Dot dot.

02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:36.720
Moving on.

02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:37.720
All right.

02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:39.840
Well we have one last email.

02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:41.160
Dear OLR.

02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:43.560
You've made a fuck show.

02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:45.200
You've had a marathon episode.

02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:47.920
You've definitely had a few drunk shows as well.

02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:52.440
My question to the host is what will be the next theme or for lack of a better term gimmick

02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:55.240
of the next special episode of OLR.

02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:58.400
Whenever that happens Jason is all the hosts.

02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:01.620
Sky only allowed to speak with his Kermit the Frog voice.

02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:05.860
Randomly censoring yourself as we log OK.

02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:09.160
Randomly censoring yourself with real and or fake fart noises.

02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:11.400
Your audience demands clarity.

02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:14.960
Signed the nasty canasta.

02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:18.120
Did he say I am all the hosts.

02:56:18.120 --> 02:56:22.280
Yes you take over all of our positions.

02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:24.680
Whoo boy that's.

02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:28.800
I don't even know like I have the power.

02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:29.800
I don't.

02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:32.160
I kind of think that I sound kind of dumb.

02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:36.440
So I don't know how you would imitate me.

02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:39.040
I would say my voice.

02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:45.360
I would say that for a special theme show.

02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:51.840
I would say the very last show of OLR will be the next theme show.

02:56:57.720 --> 02:56:59.840
We do the pot brownie show.

02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:01.920
No no no no.

02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:02.920
I'm just kidding.

02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:03.920
By the way.

02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:04.920
Don't panic.

02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:05.920
That's my smart ass answer.

02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:06.920
The last OLR.

02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:07.920
Don't panic.

02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:10.000
That's our hitchhiker's guide theme show.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:11.240
We all have towels and toothbrushes.

02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:13.280
Theme shows are what we do with Rocky Horror.

02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:14.280
All right.

02:57:14.280 --> 02:57:16.280
We'll do the Rocky Horror OLR show.

02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:20.040
It was great when it all began.

02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:24.280
I was a regular vog fan.

02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:26.640
Only if Loki agrees to play Frank N Furter.

02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:29.320
No no no no no no no.

02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:33.320
I veto that because Rob I have seen you in a corset and you were fabulous.

02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:34.320
How do you do I.

02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:46.400
See you've met my fabulous unity game.

02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:49.840
I just don't have that much enthusiasm.

02:57:49.840 --> 02:57:51.680
I think you'd make a great meatloaf.

02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:54.120
I mean you're going to die halfway through the show.

02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:55.120
Yes.

02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:56.520
You're using an axe.

02:57:56.520 --> 02:57:57.520
That would be Jason.

02:57:57.520 --> 02:58:00.840
I mean no offense Jason but it would be really funny because he's only here for half of it

02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:03.160
and then he comes back as somebody else.

02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:04.160
That would be it.

02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:07.640
No I was Dr. Scott once.

02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:10.120
I flipped off an entire room because I was Dr. Scott.

02:58:10.120 --> 02:58:11.120
There you go.

02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:12.360
That was great.

02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:13.680
The Rocky Horror OLR show.

02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:14.680
That's my answer.

02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:15.680
OK.

02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:16.680
The Rocky Horror OLR show.

02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:17.680
That's it.

02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:18.680
That's it.

02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:19.680
At least it's not shock treatment.

02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:20.680
All right.

02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:21.680
If you want to.

02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:22.680
Oh my God.

02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:23.680
Shock treatment.

02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:24.680
Watching that.

02:58:24.680 --> 02:58:25.680
OK.

02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:29.840
Evan when Evan lived with Jessica and he made those hacker cookies that like had no doughs

02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:32.080
cooked into the cookies.

02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:33.080
Oh.

02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:35.280
The OLR baking show.

02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:36.280
Yes.

02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:37.840
I can't bake for shit but yes.

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:39.480
The kitchen is right there.

02:58:39.480 --> 02:58:41.520
Oh Alan hates this idea already.

02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:44.520
Well I remember when I made lobster on the show.

02:58:44.520 --> 02:58:45.520
I do.

02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:46.520
I do.

02:58:46.520 --> 02:58:47.520
Rock lobster.

02:58:47.520 --> 02:58:48.520
All right.

02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:49.680
9 20 and we're not even at calls yet.

02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:52.880
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:58:52.880 --> 02:58:54.600
Every week we do some FUs of the week.

02:58:54.600 --> 02:58:55.600
Why?

02:58:55.600 --> 02:58:56.600
Because we're mad.

02:58:56.600 --> 02:59:16.680
Bless you.

02:59:16.680 --> 02:59:26.560
I don't know FU too too much stuff too many things that I don't have a name for.

02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:33.480
And apple pie moonshine that I drank a lot of last night and then I started playing

02:59:33.480 --> 02:59:38.720
Final Fantasy 14 because I forgot that I had to go to bed.

02:59:38.720 --> 02:59:39.720
All right.

02:59:39.720 --> 02:59:41.060
That it.

02:59:41.060 --> 02:59:47.160
Also FU to how they did the very very very very end thing after X-Men Days of Future

02:59:47.160 --> 02:59:51.200
Past which I'm not going to spoil it for people who haven't seen it but fuck how they did

02:59:51.200 --> 02:59:54.600
that because he doesn't look a damn thing like that.

02:59:54.600 --> 02:59:55.600
All right.

02:59:55.640 --> 02:59:56.640
Lowkey.

02:59:56.640 --> 03:00:08.120
I guess FU to trying to call these objects without having Unity Pro or as Unity Pro I

03:00:08.120 --> 03:00:10.120
just say call these objects.

03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:16.120
Unity free I have to come up with some creative solutions and it's a pain in the ass.

03:00:16.120 --> 03:00:17.120
All right.

03:00:17.120 --> 03:00:20.520
My FU of the week just goes to the fact that I am like really really busy this upcoming

03:00:20.520 --> 03:00:25.760
month between E3 and Disney 3 and Rocky Horror at the end of the month and my birthday and

03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:31.160
NSF pride and work where where I have a lot going on at work right now.

03:00:31.160 --> 03:00:33.000
Yeah I'm really busy this month.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:39.880
So if my gaming weeks start to dry up over the next few weeks just stop and also a big

03:00:39.880 --> 03:00:44.920
FU to the fact that I was trying to be a good boy and I went to the gym first time in forever

03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:46.480
over Memorial Day holiday.

03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:48.960
I was sore for five days.

03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:52.240
I was walking like a rubber band and I know that's a good thing like it's your body making

03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:57.200
the muscle or whatever but me not being able to walk at work is not a good thing.

03:00:57.200 --> 03:00:59.960
So FU to the fact that I'm so fat and out of shape.

03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:00.960
Jason.

03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:05.240
Yeah that makes three out of the four of us FU to time.

03:01:05.240 --> 03:01:08.560
Hey time not out of shape you know that's technically true for me too.

03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:11.040
But I'm really good about that and I am losing weight for Amy.

03:01:11.040 --> 03:01:12.320
That's not what this segment is for.

03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:13.960
Yeah FU to time.

03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:20.040
I was I felt strapped for time getting set for this latest trip because I had what five

03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:24.640
things to plan for and four of them have finished at this point.

03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:31.080
And so the last thing is B3 and then getting home and then coming back for a week later.

03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:32.080
Wish I were doing it.

03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:33.080
Sort of.

03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:36.680
All right there it is your FUs of the week although I do want to mention this from our

03:01:36.680 --> 03:01:40.120
chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because it didn't come up in the show elsewhere.

03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:43.560
Blender says FU'd and B Davis dying.

03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:44.880
That is true.

03:01:44.880 --> 03:01:51.840
Alice from the Brady Bunch their homemaker or whatever was died today.

03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:55.280
Although I'm going to admit like I don't want to sound crass or rude but it was one of those

03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:58.800
things where when they announced it I said she wasn't already dead.

03:01:58.800 --> 03:01:59.800
You know I just.

03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:00.800
Oh she was still alive.

03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:02.840
But unfortunately people disappear like that.

03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:03.840
You know.

03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:04.840
Anyway.

03:02:04.840 --> 03:02:06.440
But rest in peace.

03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:09.840
I grew up on the Brady Bunch reruns as I'm sure a lot of other people did.

03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:11.120
All right.

03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:15.160
Just a couple quick stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1 8 7 7 game OLR it's

03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:18.320
going to be a quick Skype line tonight because we're running way over it's almost 930 on

03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:19.320
the West Coast.

03:02:19.320 --> 03:02:20.320
So Loki.

03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:21.320
All right.

03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:30.040
So EA has basically come to a settlement agreement with the whole NCAA football and basketball

03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:34.720
thing where they were basically having the college students in the game but not actually

03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:38.200
paying for them to be in the game.

03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:42.800
So it's in the game except you're not getting paid for it.

03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:43.800
Yeah.

03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:49.480
So now they have to pay almost a thousand dollars per college athlete in the game.

03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:54.780
So that's not really much compensation considering that they've made a lot of money in that.

03:02:54.780 --> 03:02:58.280
But well.

03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:02.280
Thousand dollars per student I guess is still a bit of money.

03:03:02.280 --> 03:03:05.080
It's quite quite another.

03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:06.240
All right.

03:03:06.280 --> 03:03:12.160
Lastly there was a little bit of excitement over and not an announcement but basically

03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:16.040
a revealed rating so to speak on Germany's rating board.

03:03:16.040 --> 03:03:21.720
It was a rating for a game called Gianna sisters versus Super Meat Boy which instantly brought

03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:24.720
all those thoughts to people's heads like oh there could be a game where like the two

03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:28.040
of them kind of because you know they're both platforming games they're both indie they're

03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:32.760
both fun and the thought was that oh they maybe you're going to do like a mashup type

03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:33.760
of game.

03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:34.760
That would be a lot of fun.

03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:38.880
I know people are running rampant about oh is this like an E3 thing or what but no no

03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:39.960
it actually isn't.

03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:45.280
A press release from Head Up Games confirms that what this is it's just a bundle of Gianna

03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:47.880
Sisters Twisted Dreams and Super Meat Boy.

03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:52.060
It's only available in Germany at least right now on June 26th.

03:03:52.060 --> 03:03:54.520
My birthday is when this is coming out.

03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:58.560
So it is a repackaging of two other great I mean they are good games that are worth

03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:03.840
your time if you somehow haven't already played them but maybe they were out a little later

03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:05.240
in Germany I don't know.

03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:07.560
So there you go.

03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:08.560
That does it.

03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:11.460
So we're going to open up the Skype line to take your calls.

03:04:11.460 --> 03:04:16.880
It's that time 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio if you wish to

03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:19.320
give us a call we will set that up.

03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:23.720
I got to make sure that the calls can actually come through tonight so we'll set that up.

03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:27.640
Okay so 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us

03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:29.160
a call.

03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:31.480
Meanwhile last minute stories if we have any.

03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:32.480
Loki?

03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:33.480
Nope.

03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:36.400
I do have one that flew under the radar last week.

03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:40.940
There was an announcement that Samsung and Oculus VR are entering a partnership.

03:04:40.940 --> 03:04:46.160
The quick version is that Oculus gives Samsung early access to its mobile software development

03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:50.540
kit and helps develop user interface software while Samsung gives Oculus early access to

03:04:50.540 --> 03:04:55.160
its next-gen OLED screens because Samsung is joining the race without having to do the

03:04:55.160 --> 03:04:56.160
hard work.

03:04:56.160 --> 03:04:58.920
Let's go to the phones.

03:04:58.920 --> 03:04:59.920
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:04:59.920 --> 03:05:00.920
Who's this?

03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:02.360
Hey it's Ron.

03:05:02.360 --> 03:05:03.360
How's everyone doing tonight?

03:05:03.360 --> 03:05:04.360
Of course it is.

03:05:04.360 --> 03:05:05.360
Rama.

03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:06.360
How you doing Rama?

03:05:06.360 --> 03:05:07.360
We're good.

03:05:07.360 --> 03:05:10.840
And sorry we weren't here last week for you to call first.

03:05:10.840 --> 03:05:11.840
It's quite alright.

03:05:11.840 --> 03:05:15.440
I found myself doing other things like you know catching up with stuff on the DVR.

03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:18.600
I've been sitting on my DVR since summer of 2013.

03:05:18.600 --> 03:05:22.840
I figured that's what a lot of people were making out of the holidays so what's up?

03:05:22.840 --> 03:05:23.840
Not much.

03:05:23.840 --> 03:05:26.920
I want to talk about something slightly different and I'll be on my merry little way.

03:05:26.920 --> 03:05:27.920
Okay.

03:05:28.920 --> 03:05:29.920
Um.

03:05:29.920 --> 03:05:30.920
Rhythm games.

03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:32.920
Let's talk about that.

03:05:32.920 --> 03:05:34.920
Of course.

03:05:34.920 --> 03:05:40.800
I recently stumbled upon a game for Android which is also available for iOS called Love

03:05:40.800 --> 03:05:42.960
Live School Idol Project.

03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:43.960
Okay.

03:05:43.960 --> 03:05:48.080
Also you can get it in the US on the download stores as Idol Project.

03:05:48.080 --> 03:05:54.600
Pretty much you are a manager of an idol group and people ask to join and you train with

03:05:54.600 --> 03:05:55.600
them.

03:05:55.600 --> 03:06:00.880
You train with them with the music and what it is is all of the members of the band which

03:06:00.880 --> 03:06:05.480
I believe is about nine of them and these circles come down from the center and you

03:06:05.480 --> 03:06:09.800
just tap the screen you know for perfect timing.

03:06:09.800 --> 03:06:17.040
It's sort of like the timing plays sort of similar to the Sega musical games like K-On!

03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:18.040
and Project Diva.

03:06:18.040 --> 03:06:19.040
Right.

03:06:19.040 --> 03:06:20.040
Hatsune Miku.

03:06:20.040 --> 03:06:21.040
Sure.

03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:24.040
It's pretty fun and as you play the songs you go back into the story mode.

03:06:24.040 --> 03:06:27.560
You discover more characters, more people that want to join and then you go back into

03:06:27.560 --> 03:06:34.320
the game mode and you play the songs again to increase your combination, earn points

03:06:34.320 --> 03:06:36.720
and raise the idols levels.

03:06:36.720 --> 03:06:42.080
And you can do special practices where as you collect members of your team they're like

03:06:42.080 --> 03:06:43.080
trading cards.

03:06:43.080 --> 03:06:47.240
You can merge the cards together and get a better character and train off of that.

03:06:47.240 --> 03:06:48.240
It's kind of fun.

03:06:48.240 --> 03:06:52.400
Now AkumaJP in chat says Idol Master and yeah that does kind of sound like what you're describing

03:06:52.400 --> 03:06:58.040
here is kind of like a IOS version of that probably like a knockoff in a way.

03:06:58.040 --> 03:07:02.600
Something like that but it is actually based off the anime Love Live school idol project.

03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:03.600
Got it.

03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:08.120
It's kind of might be from the same people but I do know what's kind of interesting is

03:07:08.120 --> 03:07:11.720
that one of the companies that's behind this is ASCII media.

03:07:11.720 --> 03:07:16.320
The same company that had ASCIIware, same company made those awesome ASCII sticks back

03:07:16.320 --> 03:07:18.320
in the day.

03:07:18.320 --> 03:07:19.320
Wow.

03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:20.560
Interesting how far these companies have come.

03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:23.960
It's so interesting to see like who all's gone mobile because the answer is like everybody

03:07:23.960 --> 03:07:28.480
except like Nintendo and even Nintendo is finally going to do what Miiverse or something.

03:07:28.480 --> 03:07:31.960
So I wonder if that'll happen during E3.

03:07:31.960 --> 03:07:32.960
Anyway.

03:07:32.960 --> 03:07:33.960
OK.

03:07:33.960 --> 03:07:34.960
Well that's cool.

03:07:34.960 --> 03:07:35.960
So so you enjoy the game.

03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:36.960
Is it worth it.

03:07:36.960 --> 03:07:37.960
How much is it.

03:07:37.960 --> 03:07:38.960
It's free.

03:07:38.960 --> 03:07:39.960
Really.

03:07:39.960 --> 03:07:41.720
Oh so they must make the money off some of the cards and these other enhancements right.

03:07:41.720 --> 03:07:44.960
It's like buying gems and other items to raise your characters.

03:07:44.960 --> 03:07:48.960
But to be perfectly honest you really don't need to do any in-app purchases.

03:07:48.960 --> 03:07:50.200
Just play the game through.

03:07:50.200 --> 03:07:52.180
How's the music in it though.

03:07:52.180 --> 03:07:53.280
It's very cute.

03:07:53.280 --> 03:07:56.600
It's very anime J-Poppy which is kind of a given.

03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:57.600
Of course.

03:07:57.600 --> 03:07:58.600
Of course.

03:07:58.600 --> 03:07:59.600
All right.

03:07:59.600 --> 03:08:01.600
Well thank you for the review and introducing some of our listeners to that.

03:08:01.600 --> 03:08:04.180
I might have to check that out myself.

03:08:04.180 --> 03:08:07.200
You should because there's like three four of us on Facebook that are playing.

03:08:07.200 --> 03:08:09.200
We've already traded our friend IDs.

03:08:09.200 --> 03:08:12.520
So we're trying to help each other out as we're playing through the game so you should

03:08:12.520 --> 03:08:13.520
join us.

03:08:13.520 --> 03:08:14.520
All right.

03:08:14.520 --> 03:08:15.520
One more time the name.

03:08:15.520 --> 03:08:18.500
The name of the anime is called Love Life School Idol Project.

03:08:18.500 --> 03:08:24.580
You can find it on iTunes Store and Google Play as Idol Project or School Project.

03:08:24.580 --> 03:08:25.580
All right.

03:08:25.580 --> 03:08:26.580
Idol Project.

03:08:26.580 --> 03:08:27.580
I'll look for that.

03:08:27.580 --> 03:08:28.580
You got it.

03:08:28.580 --> 03:08:29.580
If not just find a school project.

03:08:29.580 --> 03:08:34.260
If I have to I will post a link to where you can get it from whatever version of the mobile

03:08:34.260 --> 03:08:36.680
system that you have.

03:08:36.680 --> 03:08:37.680
I'm trying to look at it.

03:08:37.680 --> 03:08:40.340
I have my handy dandy little iPhone.

03:08:40.340 --> 03:08:45.740
See it might be under School Project.

03:08:45.740 --> 03:08:46.740
I'm looking right now.

03:08:46.740 --> 03:08:51.740
I'm going to search for school project and it's not the end look up school.

03:08:51.740 --> 03:08:52.740
I know.

03:08:52.740 --> 03:08:53.740
Shit.

03:08:53.740 --> 03:08:54.740
I was in the music store.

03:08:54.740 --> 03:09:00.180
I hate how there's the two separate stores I mean I get why they do it but OK so school

03:09:00.180 --> 03:09:03.000
Idol Festival Jax.

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:11.300
This is great radio but hey free game y'all schools of chaos school Idol Festival that's

03:09:11.300 --> 03:09:12.300
not it right.

03:09:12.300 --> 03:09:13.300
Oh that's it.

03:09:13.300 --> 03:09:14.300
Mm hmm.

03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:15.300
OK.

03:09:15.300 --> 03:09:16.300
School Idol Festival.

03:09:16.860 --> 03:09:20.500
Yeah they had to change the name because the actual anime series has not been licensed

03:09:20.500 --> 03:09:21.500
here just yet.

03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:22.500
All the way.

03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:24.500
So you know.

03:09:24.500 --> 03:09:25.500
Sounds good.

03:09:25.500 --> 03:09:28.260
I imagine you guys talked a lot about this on anime jam session.

03:09:28.260 --> 03:09:29.260
Actually no.

03:09:29.260 --> 03:09:32.540
I started playing this like a few days ago on occasion but I may have to bring it up

03:09:32.540 --> 03:09:37.340
because it is fun and I've noticed a few of my friends one of the reason why they're upgrading

03:09:37.340 --> 03:09:41.620
their Android is just so they can have something powerful enough so they can play this game.

03:09:41.620 --> 03:09:42.620
Love it.

03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:43.620
All right.

03:09:43.620 --> 03:09:44.620
All right.

03:09:44.620 --> 03:09:45.620
Rama.

03:09:45.620 --> 03:09:46.620
Here are the thoughts before I let you go.

03:09:46.620 --> 03:09:47.620
No that's it.

03:09:47.620 --> 03:09:51.900
But I left you a message because I have a I have some stuff to send you.

03:09:51.900 --> 03:09:52.900
Oh OK.

03:09:52.900 --> 03:09:53.900
I'm a little behind.

03:09:53.900 --> 03:09:54.900
Oh I just see my little red.

03:09:54.900 --> 03:09:55.900
OK.

03:09:55.900 --> 03:09:56.900
You got it.

03:09:56.900 --> 03:09:57.900
I will send that right away.

03:09:57.900 --> 03:09:58.900
Awesome.

03:09:58.900 --> 03:09:59.900
Thanks a lot bro.

03:09:59.900 --> 03:10:00.900
Bye.

03:10:00.900 --> 03:10:01.900
I love how people use the Skype line.

03:10:01.900 --> 03:10:04.820
Hey check your private messages.

03:10:04.820 --> 03:10:07.740
Sorry I'm trying to do a show live radio is kind of hard.

03:10:07.740 --> 03:10:09.140
You know it's a little bit difficult.

03:10:09.140 --> 03:10:10.420
You said it was hard.

03:10:10.420 --> 03:10:11.420
Shush.

03:10:11.420 --> 03:10:12.420
Shush.

03:10:12.420 --> 03:10:18.100
1 8 7 7 game OLR username on Skype orange lounge radio.

03:10:18.100 --> 03:10:21.020
Many other last minute stories Jason.

03:10:21.020 --> 03:10:24.380
All right.

03:10:24.380 --> 03:10:31.260
Who is going to use a VR headset for a mobile phone.

03:10:31.260 --> 03:10:33.300
I just.

03:10:33.300 --> 03:10:38.700
The same people who buy the 3DS version of Skylanders.

03:10:38.700 --> 03:10:41.220
Like why would you haul around that big portal and things everywhere.

03:10:41.260 --> 03:10:43.140
I don't understand.

03:10:43.140 --> 03:10:44.860
You don't.

03:10:44.860 --> 03:10:45.860
You don't.

03:10:45.860 --> 03:10:46.860
No you don't.

03:10:46.860 --> 03:10:47.860
I thought you had to.

03:10:47.860 --> 03:10:48.860
You load your character.

03:10:48.860 --> 03:10:52.100
It has like so many slots of characters you can store so you put a few characters in there

03:10:52.100 --> 03:10:53.100
you swap between them.

03:10:53.100 --> 03:10:54.100
All right.

03:10:54.100 --> 03:10:55.100
That makes a little more sense.

03:10:55.100 --> 03:11:00.040
The Oculus thing with the phone is it's for stuff we haven't thought of yet or stuff they

03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:02.420
haven't thought of yet as far as using Oculus Rift.

03:11:02.420 --> 03:11:06.940
But when you can't see the phone like there's no you need another sensor to know where the

03:11:06.940 --> 03:11:07.940
hell you're.

03:11:07.940 --> 03:11:11.740
But if you're able to interact with it like you can with like Google Glass or something

03:11:11.740 --> 03:11:16.780
like that there is currently no input mechanism in the in the Oculus currently and that's

03:11:16.780 --> 03:11:17.780
your whole point.

03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:18.780
OK.

03:11:18.780 --> 03:11:19.780
One more.

03:11:19.780 --> 03:11:21.860
I'm going to put one more call out for the Skype line 1 8 7 7 game OLR username on Skype

03:11:21.860 --> 03:11:22.860
orange launch radio.

03:11:22.860 --> 03:11:26.380
I know I know dark soccer is leaving the studio because we're all running a little long she's

03:11:26.380 --> 03:11:27.660
got other things she's got to get to.

03:11:27.660 --> 03:11:29.860
But final thoughts for our listeners tonight.

03:11:29.860 --> 03:11:30.860
Al.

03:11:30.860 --> 03:11:31.860
Al.

03:11:31.860 --> 03:11:32.860
Yeah.

03:11:32.860 --> 03:11:35.220
I'm going to take.

03:11:35.220 --> 03:11:37.180
Take medication when I get home.

03:11:37.220 --> 03:11:38.220
All right.

03:11:38.220 --> 03:11:39.220
If you need a band aid I have those two.

03:11:39.220 --> 03:11:40.220
All right.

03:11:40.220 --> 03:11:41.220
I don't know if you can put a band aid on my brain.

03:11:41.220 --> 03:11:42.220
Oh no.

03:11:42.220 --> 03:11:43.220
Feel better.

03:11:43.220 --> 03:11:45.220
Tomorrow's a work day.

03:11:45.220 --> 03:11:46.220
Alas.

03:11:46.220 --> 03:11:47.220
Yeah.

03:11:47.220 --> 03:11:48.220
No.

03:11:48.220 --> 03:11:49.220
No more three day weekends.

03:11:49.220 --> 03:11:50.220
I miss those.

03:11:50.220 --> 03:11:51.220
All right.

03:11:51.220 --> 03:11:52.220
It looks like we do have at least one more call coming in.

03:11:52.220 --> 03:11:53.220
So let's get to it.

03:11:53.220 --> 03:11:54.220
Have a great night.

03:11:54.220 --> 03:11:55.220
Dark soccer soccer.

03:11:55.220 --> 03:11:56.220
We'll see you next week for our preval E3 special.

03:11:56.220 --> 03:11:57.220
The preval show.

03:11:57.220 --> 03:11:58.220
All right.

03:11:58.220 --> 03:11:59.220
Let's get to it.

03:11:59.220 --> 03:12:00.220
Hi.

03:12:00.220 --> 03:12:01.220
You're on orange lounge radio.

03:12:01.220 --> 03:12:02.220
Who's this.

03:12:02.220 --> 03:12:03.220
Hey it's blender.

03:12:03.220 --> 03:12:04.220
Hey blender.

03:12:04.220 --> 03:12:05.220
Long time no talk.

03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:06.220
How you doing.

03:12:06.260 --> 03:12:09.260
I actually moved out to Nashville Tennessee.

03:12:09.260 --> 03:12:12.260
Not in California anymore.

03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:16.260
I was in Nashville when I was 17 years old for one whole day.

03:12:16.260 --> 03:12:18.260
Oh really.

03:12:18.260 --> 03:12:19.260
Yeah.

03:12:19.260 --> 03:12:20.260
I imagine it's changed a lot.

03:12:20.260 --> 03:12:22.260
We went to Graceland and signed.

03:12:22.260 --> 03:12:24.260
I remember writing something on the wall.

03:12:24.260 --> 03:12:26.260
Where all those messages were to Elvis.

03:12:26.260 --> 03:12:28.260
And that's all I remember.

03:12:28.260 --> 03:12:29.260
And show no's.

03:12:29.260 --> 03:12:30.260
Yeah.

03:12:30.260 --> 03:12:31.260
That's cool.

03:12:31.260 --> 03:12:32.260
Yeah.

03:12:32.260 --> 03:12:34.260
So what's up buddy.

03:12:34.300 --> 03:12:35.300
No.

03:12:35.300 --> 03:12:37.300
I was telling you.

03:12:37.300 --> 03:12:38.300
Well.

03:12:38.300 --> 03:12:39.300
You know the situation.

03:12:39.300 --> 03:12:40.300
You know I've talked about it.

03:12:40.300 --> 03:12:41.300
You guys.

03:12:41.300 --> 03:12:45.300
I was a home caregiver for my grandparents for 12 years.

03:12:45.300 --> 03:12:46.300
Right.

03:12:46.300 --> 03:12:48.300
And unfortunately they passed away last month.

03:12:48.300 --> 03:12:54.300
And I actually passed through Salt Lake City.

03:12:54.300 --> 03:12:56.300
A couple days before I left.

03:12:56.300 --> 03:12:57.300
Right.

03:12:57.300 --> 03:12:59.300
And they had the Salt Lake City Comic Con.

03:12:59.300 --> 03:13:00.300
And I went through there.

03:13:00.300 --> 03:13:03.300
Oh how was that.

03:13:03.340 --> 03:13:05.340
That was freaking awesome man.

03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:07.340
They had everybody there.

03:13:07.340 --> 03:13:08.340
Yeah.

03:13:08.340 --> 03:13:13.340
I had a couple friends that actually were running the thing.

03:13:13.340 --> 03:13:17.340
And they had over 100,000 people shut up for that weekend.

03:13:17.340 --> 03:13:18.340
Holy moly.

03:13:18.340 --> 03:13:19.340
But.

03:13:19.340 --> 03:13:20.340
Yeah.

03:13:20.340 --> 03:13:23.340
It's the third biggest Comic Con in the country right now.

03:13:23.340 --> 03:13:24.340
Is it really.

03:13:24.340 --> 03:13:25.340
You know.

03:13:25.340 --> 03:13:27.340
I am and I'm not surprised to hear that.

03:13:27.340 --> 03:13:29.340
Because there's a part of you that kind of goes.

03:13:29.340 --> 03:13:30.340
Or of me anyway.

03:13:30.340 --> 03:13:31.340
That kind of goes.

03:13:31.380 --> 03:13:33.380
Well what the hell is there in Salt Lake City.

03:13:33.380 --> 03:13:34.380
Like who knew there were that many people.

03:13:34.380 --> 03:13:35.380
But at the same time.

03:13:35.380 --> 03:13:36.380
Yeah.

03:13:36.380 --> 03:13:41.380
Like you know there's a lot of very small remote areas just for hundreds of miles.

03:13:41.380 --> 03:13:45.380
Like Salt Lake City really is the biggest city for hundreds of miles in any direction.

03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:46.380
I mean it really is.

03:13:46.380 --> 03:13:47.380
Yeah.

03:13:47.380 --> 03:13:48.380
Salt Lake City is huge.

03:13:48.380 --> 03:13:49.380
Like when I think about.

03:13:49.380 --> 03:13:50.380
Yeah.

03:13:50.380 --> 03:13:51.380
I went in there on a whim.

03:13:51.380 --> 03:13:52.380
I was just like well.

03:13:52.380 --> 03:13:53.380
Because I knew the guys.

03:13:53.380 --> 03:13:54.380
Because I listened to you guys.

03:13:54.380 --> 03:13:58.380
And I listened to the guys who used to podcast back in 2010.

03:13:58.380 --> 03:13:59.380
Right.

03:13:59.420 --> 03:14:03.420
Their first year was like 10,000 people shut up.

03:14:03.420 --> 03:14:05.420
And then boom.

03:14:05.420 --> 03:14:08.420
2014 they had 100,000 people shut up.

03:14:08.420 --> 03:14:09.420
Wow.

03:14:09.420 --> 03:14:11.420
And I walked in the front door and there's like a line.

03:14:11.420 --> 03:14:13.420
And I'm like who's this?

03:14:13.420 --> 03:14:15.420
Line for it.

03:14:15.420 --> 03:14:17.420
Nathan fill in right there.

03:14:17.420 --> 03:14:19.420
Just walked in.

03:14:19.420 --> 03:14:20.420
That's awesome.

03:14:20.420 --> 03:14:21.420
Yeah.

03:14:21.420 --> 03:14:23.420
I mean it was a huge turnout.

03:14:23.420 --> 03:14:25.420
I mean they're having another one in September.

03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:26.420
I'm not plugging anything.

03:14:26.460 --> 03:14:27.460
But I'm just saying.

03:14:27.460 --> 03:14:32.460
The thing that I found about it was it's like the middle of the country.

03:14:32.460 --> 03:14:33.460
So you don't have to go.

03:14:33.460 --> 03:14:34.460
Yeah.

03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:35.460
Well not middle.

03:14:35.460 --> 03:14:41.460
But you know if you're on the east coast and you want to go.

03:14:41.460 --> 03:14:43.460
You know for the right convention.

03:14:43.460 --> 03:14:45.460
You don't have to travel all the way to Anaheim.

03:14:45.460 --> 03:14:47.460
For the right convention there's always time for travel.

03:14:47.460 --> 03:14:50.460
Because I go to Atlanta for Dragon Con.

03:14:50.460 --> 03:14:53.460
I had a blast last year and already got my ticket for this year.

03:14:53.460 --> 03:14:57.460
So it's awesome to hear that you had a good time at the convention.

03:14:57.460 --> 03:15:01.460
I'm sorry to hear about the circumstance that kind of had you moving from one coast to the other.

03:15:01.460 --> 03:15:02.460
But you know.

03:15:02.460 --> 03:15:04.460
But now that you're back in.

03:15:04.460 --> 03:15:07.460
Or now that you're in Nashville have you been doing any gaming?

03:15:07.460 --> 03:15:09.460
Is there any games that you're into?

03:15:09.460 --> 03:15:12.460
You know I'm getting at a lot of board gaming man.

03:15:12.460 --> 03:15:14.460
I got a six year old nephew.

03:15:14.460 --> 03:15:18.460
And so I'm getting at all these little board gaming.

03:15:18.460 --> 03:15:20.460
You know just because he's into baseball.

03:15:20.460 --> 03:15:24.460
And you know I'm trying to teach him a little bit more about strategic stuff.

03:15:24.460 --> 03:15:27.460
You know so he's learning a lot more about.

03:15:27.460 --> 03:15:29.460
You know and just sitting down on the table.

03:15:29.460 --> 03:15:32.460
And just let's think about what we're doing here.

03:15:32.460 --> 03:15:36.460
I don't think we give board games enough credit here on OLR.

03:15:36.460 --> 03:15:38.460
And that you know we don't talk about that enough.

03:15:38.460 --> 03:15:41.460
And board games are awesome.

03:15:41.460 --> 03:15:43.460
Like who doesn't enjoy a good board game night.

03:15:43.460 --> 03:15:45.460
Like what a fun way to hang out with friends.

03:15:45.460 --> 03:15:48.460
And I've been introduced to a lot of like fun ones lately.

03:15:48.460 --> 03:15:50.460
Like I like well this isn't really a board game.

03:15:50.460 --> 03:15:53.460
But a Dominion was one that Xtover's partner introduced me to.

03:15:53.460 --> 03:15:55.460
That I had a lot of fun with that.

03:15:55.460 --> 03:15:56.460
It's more of a card game I suppose.

03:15:56.460 --> 03:15:57.460
But that's a lot of fun.

03:15:57.460 --> 03:15:59.460
And yeah yeah.

03:15:59.460 --> 03:16:03.460
What's one board game we here at OLR ought to check out?

03:16:03.460 --> 03:16:05.460
I'll tell you what.

03:16:05.460 --> 03:16:08.460
You know the best thing and it's something you guys can sit down and play.

03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:10.460
While you're doing a show.

03:16:10.460 --> 03:16:12.460
It's called Zombie Dice.

03:16:12.460 --> 03:16:15.460
And you can buy it at Target for like ten bucks.

03:16:15.460 --> 03:16:17.460
I've heard of this.

03:16:17.460 --> 03:16:19.460
Somebody showed this to me once.

03:16:19.460 --> 03:16:22.460
Tell it quickly because I got to wrap up here soon for time.

03:16:22.460 --> 03:16:24.460
But quickly what is Zombie Dice?

03:16:24.460 --> 03:16:29.460
Well it's just like a bar dice game.

03:16:29.460 --> 03:16:31.460
Like liar's dice or whatever.

03:16:31.460 --> 03:16:33.460
But you know you just roll your dice.

03:16:33.460 --> 03:16:35.460
And you're apparently the zombie.

03:16:35.460 --> 03:16:40.460
And you either roll a brain, a shotgun, or feet.

03:16:40.460 --> 03:16:44.460
And whoever gets scored a 13 wins the game.

03:16:44.460 --> 03:16:51.460
And the cool thing about it is like my sister had to do some laundry at the laundromat the other day.

03:16:51.460 --> 03:16:57.460
And me and my nephew sat at the laundromat and rolled out the Zombie Dice and started playing right there.

03:16:57.460 --> 03:17:00.460
And everybody else is like what the heck are these people doing?

03:17:00.460 --> 03:17:02.460
But we're just having fun down at the laundromat.

03:17:02.460 --> 03:17:04.460
That's great.

03:17:04.460 --> 03:17:05.460
That's great.

03:17:05.460 --> 03:17:06.460
Alright.

03:17:06.460 --> 03:17:08.460
Well Blender Buddy it's so good to hear from you.

03:17:08.460 --> 03:17:11.460
I always love to hear you know listeners that would call in a lot a few years ago.

03:17:11.460 --> 03:17:15.460
And then have kind of moved on to whatever and then come on back to the show.

03:17:15.460 --> 03:17:18.460
So I'm so glad to hear from you.

03:17:18.460 --> 03:17:20.460
But I hope everything is tricky in Nashville.

03:17:20.460 --> 03:17:24.460
And thank you for reminding us how amazing board games are.

03:17:24.460 --> 03:17:25.460
Alright take care buddy.

03:17:25.460 --> 03:17:27.460
Alright take care buddy.

03:17:27.460 --> 03:17:28.460
Bye bye.

03:17:28.460 --> 03:17:29.460
Some folks in chat.

03:17:29.460 --> 03:17:31.460
We see a few people in our chat room here.

03:17:31.460 --> 03:17:34.460
Like we have Kaijudo saying board games for the win.

03:17:34.460 --> 03:17:38.460
Akuma JP says board game is fun if you have friends to play with.

03:17:38.460 --> 03:17:41.460
Justin says a big fan of Love Letter.

03:17:41.460 --> 03:17:44.460
It's a super quick card game based on bluffing.

03:17:44.460 --> 03:17:48.460
Also in that vein, Coup is another great card.

03:17:48.460 --> 03:17:50.460
Is another great bluffing card game.

03:17:50.460 --> 03:17:53.460
And Black Wolf says King of Tokyo is awesome.

03:17:53.460 --> 03:17:57.460
So it sounds like a lot of these games I'm going to have to play over at Dragon Con and so forth.

03:17:57.460 --> 03:17:59.460
So anyway.

03:17:59.460 --> 03:18:01.460
That is going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

03:18:01.460 --> 03:18:05.460
I'm sadly going to close things up because we're really long tonight.

03:18:05.460 --> 03:18:06.460
And we got to wrap up.

03:18:06.460 --> 03:18:08.460
We already had a host bail on us.

03:18:08.460 --> 03:18:10.460
But you know we had to make up for lost time a little bit.

03:18:10.460 --> 03:18:13.460
So thank you guys for staying up late with us.

03:18:13.460 --> 03:18:17.460
And thank you guys for supporting the show and listening.

03:18:17.460 --> 03:18:19.460
And glad you're back after a week off.

03:18:19.460 --> 03:18:24.460
And let's get ready because it's going to be a heck of a month between E3 and our 12th birthday.

03:18:24.460 --> 03:18:25.460
And have a lot of fun.

03:18:25.460 --> 03:18:26.460
You ready Jason?

03:18:26.460 --> 03:18:27.460
Yeah.

03:18:27.460 --> 03:18:28.460
It'll be fun.

03:18:28.460 --> 03:18:33.460
Alright for now let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as we wrap things up.

03:18:33.460 --> 03:18:34.460
I do want to say really quick though.

03:18:34.460 --> 03:18:36.460
Of course if you do like what you've heard here at OLR.

03:18:36.460 --> 03:18:37.460
Don't forget.

03:18:37.460 --> 03:18:39.460
Support the show by just telling a friend or two.

03:18:39.460 --> 03:18:41.460
I mean the offers of gifts and things are really nice.

03:18:41.460 --> 03:18:44.460
But I don't want your money.

03:18:44.460 --> 03:18:46.460
I know it seems like a weird thing to say.

03:18:46.460 --> 03:18:49.460
But I want your love.

03:18:49.460 --> 03:18:51.460
Tell a friend or two about the show.

03:18:51.460 --> 03:18:54.460
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

03:18:54.460 --> 03:18:56.460
And yeah.

03:18:56.460 --> 03:18:59.460
That's all we really ask here at OLR.

03:18:59.460 --> 03:19:02.460
Just help our family grow a little bit with like minded individuals.

03:19:02.460 --> 03:19:04.460
That are not jerks when it comes to video games.

03:19:04.460 --> 03:19:06.460
That are there for the fun.

03:19:06.460 --> 03:19:08.460
Leave a nice word on iTunes.

03:19:08.460 --> 03:19:10.460
Stitcher Radio really helps too.

03:19:10.460 --> 03:19:11.460
And anywhere.

03:19:11.460 --> 03:19:12.460
Wherever you heard about this podcast.

03:19:12.460 --> 03:19:15.460
There's probably a bunch of other people waiting to hear about some new podcasts.

03:19:15.460 --> 03:19:17.460
And we'll hope they'll check us out.

03:19:17.460 --> 03:19:18.460
Jason.

03:19:18.460 --> 03:19:19.460
Thank you for being here.

03:19:19.460 --> 03:19:21.460
As you have been for the past few weeks.

03:19:21.460 --> 03:19:22.460
We'll see you again next week.

03:19:22.460 --> 03:19:23.460
As always.

03:19:23.460 --> 03:19:24.460
You absolutely will because.

03:19:24.460 --> 03:19:25.460
That's right.

03:19:25.460 --> 03:19:28.460
Our fun starts 12 hours after the show finishes.

03:19:28.460 --> 03:19:30.460
And we gotta get in the car early too.

03:19:30.460 --> 03:19:32.460
Because we gotta be in LA by like.

03:19:32.460 --> 03:19:33.460
No later.

03:19:33.460 --> 03:19:34.460
Like 3 or 4.

03:19:34.460 --> 03:19:35.460
So.

03:19:35.460 --> 03:19:36.460
Because the Sony thing is like.

03:19:36.460 --> 03:19:38.460
I think it's like 6 o'clock or something.

03:19:38.460 --> 03:19:39.460
So.

03:19:39.460 --> 03:19:40.460
Lots of stuff going on that day.

03:19:40.460 --> 03:19:41.460
So.

03:19:41.460 --> 03:19:42.460
We're gonna have a busy busy week next week.

03:19:42.460 --> 03:19:43.460
Final thoughts for our listeners.

03:19:43.460 --> 03:19:45.460
I really need to start writing things down.

03:19:45.460 --> 03:19:49.460
Because I remember having a thought either today or yesterday about a perfect ending.

03:19:49.460 --> 03:19:50.460
Yep.

03:19:50.460 --> 03:19:51.460
Don't remember it.

03:19:51.460 --> 03:19:52.460
Write shit down.

03:19:52.460 --> 03:19:53.460
Helps you remember.

03:19:53.460 --> 03:19:54.460
Like get a voice recorder.

03:19:54.460 --> 03:19:55.460
Just record yourself.

03:19:55.460 --> 03:19:56.460
Like come on.

03:19:56.460 --> 03:19:57.460
Alright.

03:19:57.460 --> 03:20:00.460
My final thought for the night is.

03:20:00.460 --> 03:20:01.460
It's almost 10 o'clock.

03:20:01.460 --> 03:20:02.460
Do I still go to the gym?

03:20:02.460 --> 03:20:03.460
Yes or no?

03:20:03.460 --> 03:20:04.460
Shane's nodding yes.

03:20:04.460 --> 03:20:05.460
We'll see.

03:20:05.460 --> 03:20:06.460
I gotta get up at 630 in the morning.

03:20:06.460 --> 03:20:07.460
We'll see.

03:20:07.460 --> 03:20:08.460
Alright.

03:20:08.460 --> 03:20:09.460
Last but not least.

03:20:09.460 --> 03:20:10.460
Loki your final thought tonight.

03:20:10.460 --> 03:20:11.460
I have to go to work tomorrow.

03:20:11.460 --> 03:20:12.460
Oh my gosh.

03:20:12.460 --> 03:20:14.460
You gotta work like the rest of us again.

03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:16.460
Well you've been working from home though.

03:20:16.460 --> 03:20:17.460
Any full time dad.

03:20:17.460 --> 03:20:18.460
That's a job.

03:20:18.460 --> 03:20:19.460
Yeah.

03:20:19.460 --> 03:20:20.460
It's actually a little.

03:20:20.460 --> 03:20:21.460
It's easier now.

03:20:21.460 --> 03:20:22.460
Well except Thursday I have to watch him again.

03:20:22.460 --> 03:20:23.460
Because.

03:20:23.460 --> 03:20:24.460
You know our babysitter.

03:20:24.460 --> 03:20:25.460
She's going to the doctor.

03:20:25.460 --> 03:20:26.460
In San Jose.

03:20:26.460 --> 03:20:27.460
It's like three hours fucking away.

03:20:27.460 --> 03:20:28.460
I hope she's okay.

03:20:28.460 --> 03:20:31.460
It's usually a specialist of some sort.

03:20:31.460 --> 03:20:32.460
Anyways.

03:20:32.460 --> 03:20:34.460
It's just whatever.

03:20:34.460 --> 03:20:35.460
So.

03:20:35.460 --> 03:20:36.460
Yeah.

03:20:36.460 --> 03:20:42.460
Everybody I'm sure will be glad that I'm back including all my annoying customers.

03:20:42.460 --> 03:20:44.460
And now I have to talk to you on the phone.

03:20:44.460 --> 03:20:46.460
Before I could just email them.

03:20:46.460 --> 03:20:47.460
Sorry I can't call you.

03:20:47.460 --> 03:20:48.460
I'm on a cell phone.

03:20:48.460 --> 03:20:49.460
I have limited minutes.

03:20:49.460 --> 03:20:50.460
I can't talk to you.

03:20:50.460 --> 03:20:52.460
And I gotta talk to them.

03:20:52.460 --> 03:20:54.460
No escaping work now.

03:20:54.460 --> 03:20:55.460
Alright.

03:20:55.460 --> 03:20:58.460
