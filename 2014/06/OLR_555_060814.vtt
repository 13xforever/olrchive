Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
The next year of gaming and electronic entertainment is about to be revealed as we are less than 24 hours from the keynotes by all our favorite gaming companies.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
All about impending AAA titles, new accessories, and future Steam sale fodder.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
All this, listless, and more coming up on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with our 555th episode.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
That's right, episode 555.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
For this June the 8th of 2014 on the eve of Video Game Christmas, as a lot of people refer to it.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
That's right, the Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 kicks off.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Technically the expo starts Tuesday, but all the conferences and some of the early meetings are starting tomorrow.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Microsoft kicking things off at 9am, but we're kicking off E3 in our own way tonight.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
My name is Rob Robertson, joining me in the studio as always.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Hi.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
How are you Jamie Summers?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm okay.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
What's new with you? Anything new and exciting in the world of Jamie?

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
She's been working a lot at the, I always want to say Lolcat, but it's LoCat.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I'll tell you why I didn't go with Lolcat.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Because Lolcat already exists in Homestuck, it's the land of little cups and tea.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I work at the land, hey.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
Jason in a mic or we can't hear it.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, the Homestucks get it anyways, so that's why I went with LoCat, the land of cubes and tech.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
That works, that works. It's a good way to kind of, you know, have the anonymity so people don't necessarily know your employer and all that good stuff.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
Except that now I know more people, more and more people that work there, and apparently people I work with know friends of mine.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Like one of my co-workers games with Becky's husband.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
That's random.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
And another of my co-workers who I play D&D with knows Travis.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah, I was going to say I have co-workers that know people that I used to do Rocky Horror with back at the Birdcage, so that's always something.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
He knows Travis from a cast before the one that you were in.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Oh, that's old school.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Isn't that right?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, that's old school.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Wasn't that like the one right before Understandation?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
It was, yep. Absent Friends, 95 or so in Sacramento.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
So yeah. And I was just like going, the moment he mentions names, because he mentioned names of people I don't know all the time, he's like, I know him.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
You do? Yeah?

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
So lots and lots of networking, IRL, and of course at the E3 Expo this week, lots of networking there.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
We are going to miss you, Dark Soccer. I understand that, you know, work takes precedence because you did just start that job not that long ago, so you can't exactly take a week off.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
But you'll be missed.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Well, you know, I'm actually kind of glad I'm not going.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah, why's that? Just?

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
Just because with as busy as I've been and a little tired and on edge, it means I don't have to be around massive groups of people and double my medication.

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, I actually can understand that because I was talking about this at the end of Bobby's show, but I've been just really exhausted too, and I know some people see E3 as a vacation.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
Don't get me wrong, I'm very fortunate to go, I'm very happy to go, I realize I'm lucky a lot of people would give a lot to be able to go to the show.

03:15.000 --> 03:29.000
But it's just one of those things where I'm like, it's not just like, teehee, fun, cosplay, play games, all that, it's some serious, like, you know, you gotta run from place to place, you do these meetings, you have all these kind of serious things going on.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
It is work. It's fun work. I know, I managed to cute my way into tons of the press kits we weren't supposed to have the few years I did.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah, you were so good at that.

03:37.000 --> 03:47.000
And then hanging out with my buddy Krista, who worked for LucasArts at the time, and going into the Q&As with her, because she was like, oh, she's with me. Bye, bye.

03:47.000 --> 03:59.000
That's the shit, that's how I got to play Popula Cross at first. And they were like, you know what the hell this game is? I was like, yeah, and thanks to Loki here, I now have the game and have to play through it.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
There you go.

04:01.000 --> 04:11.000
But I don't know, as long as one of us, or a few of us are going, I don't feel bad about not going. Honestly, it's a little too much for me.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
That's a good way to look at it. Are you gonna try and play the at-home game?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
No, I'm actually not.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
You're just gonna kinda come absorb everything next week at the show, or bits and pieces here and there?

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
I may watch a thing here and there, but my plan for the week is work.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
I have a hard time believing if they pop out a new Mass Effect trailer, you won't be doing 90 miles an hour on the way home to go watch it.

04:34.000 --> 04:46.000
At that point I say, bitch, please. This is me we're talking about. I mean, of course I'm gonna see stuff I'm gonna get excited about, but honestly, I've decided that the week is actually gonna be spent on myself.

04:46.000 --> 04:57.000
Because with my new schedule, I'm working in closing shift, so I work 1130 to 830 now, that means I can actually get up in the morning and go back to the gym instead of doing it after work when I'm dead tired.

04:57.000 --> 05:09.000
You know, that's what I did last year. I did kinda the home game, and I'm using my quote-y fingers, covered E3 from home, but that just basically means I supported Bobby and all that with what he was doing.

05:09.000 --> 05:18.000
I did end up driving down there later in the week, and we did the Disney 3 thing, but earlier in the week, you know, I just kinda hung out and it was a great kinda charge the batteries, so I think you'll have a good week.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, bye.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
You get all the good stuff on next week's show.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
But hey, you got to play an Ouya.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Alright, Techmaster Loki always has something to say. I did get to play Ouya last year when I-

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Yes, because it is disappointing as owning an Ouya.

05:31.000 --> 05:42.000
I didn't walk away from the Ouya experience last year with the heap amount of negativity that you have for it now. Granted, it wasn't out yet. I was seeing demos of some games that were probably the better games that were on the system.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
Well, and also to be fair, there are a lot of games now I think are more polished than they were when I had it, but no.

05:48.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah, and there's still stuff that they're cranking out as well, so you know, they're still trucking along, doing their thing, and it's still a very low-cost alternative to get some of this other stuff, so it'll be interesting.

05:59.000 --> 06:11.000
But yeah, the experience last year was kinda funny in that regard that I actually picked Bobby up at the Expo, because you can- I don't know if they like people knowing this, but you can go in the- like, the LA Convention Center is practically a public place.

06:11.000 --> 06:23.000
You can walk in, it's very easy, you just can't get past the line to go to the hall. You can't actually get in the hall, but you can look through the window and see everything that's going on, do all that, and there's some stuff that's on the outside, like the Ouya was in the parking lot last year.

06:23.000 --> 06:34.000
Not that I'm saying you should all go down to the Convention Center and make it more crowded than it already is, but the fact of the matter is, it is in the heart of downtown LA. It's next door to the Staples Center. There's a lot of activity down there.

06:35.000 --> 06:46.000
I'm gonna finish all these puzzles this week, and that's one of the most exciting things about E3, honestly, is finishing these fucking puzzles on my DS, because a new one pops up every other day, it feels like. So, I'm excited.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm gonna be totally watching everything. I've been watching everything.

06:50.000 --> 07:04.000
All right, I'm going to our chat room before I introduce our fourth in-studio co-host tonight. I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because of course we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.

07:04.000 --> 07:14.000
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern is the time to be here. And, let's see, I'm looking at Brad from Pod Culture, starting us off, saying, Ouya isn't that bad, they just had bad timing.

07:14.000 --> 07:24.000
It is actually a neat little bit of kit. And then, let's see, Dungeon Buster says, All the Mass Effects in our chat room. I'm sure there's a lot of people hyped for that.

07:24.000 --> 07:36.000
If there is a new Mass Effect trailer, Dark Soccer, it's gonna hit tomorrow. You could possibly be 24 hours less than away from Garrus on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, possibly.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
If they hear it while I'm at work, I'm just gonna have to watch it during my break.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
You're gonna have to take a personal, like, I have severe diarrhea, I need to go to the restroom right now.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
Why are you going to the bathroom with your headphones? Because I'm going to be shitting loudly. I don't want to hear it.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Sorry, I was-

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I'm gonna bring a change of underwear with me to work.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
I was watching an episode of Orange is the New Black last night, maybe- alright, anyway, I'm just- anyway, I'm not gonna go there.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Alright, say hello. He was watching this with me last night. Say hello to VX JasonXV.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
I'm melting! I'm melting! God, it's fucking hot up here.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
It is hot. Welcome to Satan's Butthole, California.

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
And it's funny, because it wasn't terribly different, you know, I was here just a week ago, and things haven't changed that dramatically.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
And I grew up in the desert, and God, the Bay Area has spoiled me. And I don't even live there. What the hell is this?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Well, here's the good news. I checked the weather for LA next week. 70s and 80s.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Nice. I'm very happy to hear that.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Especially if we're doing the Disney thing later in the week and being outdoors all day, it's very nice news to hear.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Because Disney in 100 degrees, not as fun. So, very good to hear it.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
In fact, I believe if I caught this correctly, this is not your first E3.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
It is not my first E3. This is my second in a decade exactly.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Your last one, we were at together for DDR Freak.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
2004, absolutely.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
That was also my first E3, and I remember we went to the Dear Friends concert together. That was one of the first times you and I ever hung out.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
That was the year of the thumping floor.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
That was the year of the thumping floor.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Thumping floor.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
We went to some presentation, and it was on this big diagonal, and people were sitting on the floor, and they put subwoofers on the floor.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
I'm sure that made for the interesting experience for the attendees.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
So, a decade later, I'm going to tell you, the show's changed a lot. An awful lot.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
No more Kensha Hall, rest in peace. Which is really sad.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
You'll be able to see down there, and it's a bunch of parked cars. You're like, what the hell?

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
Of course, I don't know if the layout of the convention center's changed at all because of the construction for the farmer's field football.

09:43.000 --> 09:53.000
It doesn't seem like it based on the booth maps and things I'm seeing Bobby's posted on VOG Network under our interactive coverage, E3.vognetwork.com, which I'll come back to later.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
But you can actually see the booth maps, and it doesn't look like it's changed, so I guess they didn't really start that construction yet.

09:59.000 --> 10:12.000
I remember watching E3 coverage, people that were livecasting throughout the whole week, and when I was there in 2004, everything was very open, like booths.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
There wasn't really these dividing lines. There were decorated walls and everything that was being showed off.

10:18.000 --> 10:29.000
The biggest walls that I can think of are either supporting beams or squares ramp up to their back wall in their inner enclave showing off Final Fantasy XI.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Ah yes, the theater.

10:31.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, that's exactly what it was. But then when I watched it a year or two ago, everybody had these big enclosing, draping curtains everywhere, which seems to be really terrible to accommodate that many masses of people.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
But we'll see.

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
We'll see. We'll see. Also, very important question that's going to be burning on everybody's mind. It's your first trip to Disneyland, if I'm not mistaken, right?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
It is not.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Oh, I thought it was.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It is my first as an adult or anything close to it.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Okay.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
I haven't been to Disneyland since I was seven or something.

11:02.000 --> 11:10.000
Okay, your first time truly at Disneyland as an adult, so what are you looking for? I know you're not a coaster guy, but what are you truly looking forward to most at Disneyland?

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
I actually am looking forward to going back on Star Wars The Experience.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
There you go.

11:16.000 --> 11:25.000
Because that was a... I've never been a rollercoaster guy. I cried the first time I went on it because the motion and the experience just overwhelmed me.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
It's very different.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, they redid it two years ago.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
It's completely different.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Is it still shuttles and mass rows sitting?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yes, but it's still...

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
High definition, 3D.

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
Sure, sure. And I'm looking forward to that, but it'll just be funny to be in that line, look and see those little triggers that I'll be able to remember.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Sing Star Trek while you're in line for me.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Are you going to cry again? Do I have to hold your hand or something?

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Maybe in happiness and not in sensory overwhelming fear.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Alright, sounds good.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm sure... I haven't thought about Disneyland for a long time because I've never made plans to go there.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
I don't know if Zen still listens to the show, but Zen is a buddy of ours that is sometimes at the Star Wars gift shop at Disneyland.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
So Zen, if you happen to be working Friday, have some tissues ready for me, please. As a personal favor, I would really appreciate that.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
It'll be really interesting. I've been on a whole recollection kick for the last year or two.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
And it'll be fun to just kind of be around and see what I personally specifically remember from being there before.

12:22.000 --> 12:30.000
But it'll be fun. I'll be around great people. I assume a lot of other E3 attendees will be there as well, so fun networking potentials to be made there.

12:30.000 --> 12:38.000
And yeah, this is going to be an insane week for many, many reasons, but I am completely looking forward to it.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Alright, sounds good. Alright, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
Actually, I do have a few things I want to mention from the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Vidpower talking about the Movie Theater Sony Conference experience.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Vidpower says they sold out of tickets here eight hours after the announcement.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I don't think any of us are doing that.

12:56.000 --> 13:05.000
No, they sold out of everywhere, but I think a lot of people started buying... or not buying, ordering tickets to get a certain beta code.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
Oh, I think that's what's going to be giving away there? The PlayStation Now or whatever?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It's for Battlefield Hardline.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Oh, okay.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Apparently. The rumor is for PlayStation 4, the beta for that.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
Interesting, interesting. So, well, Jason and I are fortunate enough, we're going to the Sony Conference, the real deal in LA.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
But yeah, I'm curious. Those of you guys that go to the movie theaters, I really want to hear kind of what that is, because that's a really new thing.

13:29.000 --> 13:37.000
And to get all these common Sony fans in one place to watch it is a really fascinating idea, so I'm really curious to hear how that goes.

13:37.000 --> 13:44.000
I want some Vidpower, I don't know if you're going, but anybody who is going, I definitely want to hear your thoughts on that for next week's show.

13:44.000 --> 13:54.000
Let's see. I read this name as Village Idiot is Matt, and I was like, oh, that's kind of a rude thing to say to Loki, but it's actually Village Idiot's Matt.

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
Which I'm guessing is another Matt. It says, is it true that the Ouya controller sucks? One of the only things keeping me from trying it out.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Yes, it's not good.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Is it better now, though, than when you had it?

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
No, because they did have another controller that was a redesign, and I ended up getting a replacement because mine was broken.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
It had a really terrible dead zone in it. The new one worked, it wasn't that great, though.

14:19.000 --> 14:28.000
I think they have yet another one, but the thing is, you don't give a shit because you can sync your DualShock 3s to them, and most games support them.

14:28.000 --> 14:37.000
In fact, I think most games support them because the original controllers suck, and you can even use an Xbox 360 controller hooked up via USB and stuff.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
There was a lot of options, but I only played with the DualShock.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
I didn't think the Ouya controller was that terrible, but it is certainly no DualShock, I'll say that for sure.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Alright, let's get into kickoff topics. We've got a couple things tonight.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I want to talk E3, but I want to talk about one of the big, big stories that's going around right now.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
I'm sure a lot of you guys have caught wind of the rumor, rumor has it, that's been going around.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
IGN ran a report last night that says, The Last Guardian has been cancelled.

15:03.000 --> 15:11.000
That they had, on good authority, I think their Russian side or whatever, had something that said that The Last Guardian was cancelled.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Well, one of the producers over at Sony said, we had a good laugh about that story this morning.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
So, then they had to go back and modify the headline to say, The Last Guardian may be cancelled.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
And now it's coming out like, conflicting reports that The Last Guardian is cancelled.

15:26.000 --> 15:34.000
And this caused one of my good friends, Captain Spike from Game Buoy, to say on my Facebook, the old classic line,

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
you can't spell ignorant without IGN. Which, you know, not to dog pile on IGN, but it's always fun to kind of poke fun.

15:40.000 --> 15:47.000
Obviously, they ran on some information they thought was legit and Sony's coming out and flat out denying it.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
What do you guys think is going on? What do you guys think is the status of The Last Guardian?

15:50.000 --> 15:57.000
Which, may I remind you, was first talked about in 2007. It's the new Duke Nukem Forever.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Hopefully, it'll end up a better game if it's not cancelled.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I think it's IGN being full of shit.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
I really, honestly, whenever I see anything like that, I wait until I get an official word.

16:09.000 --> 16:16.000
If I remember correctly, it was, I think, because I didn't even read the article, I think I glanced at something on NeoGaf or something,

16:16.000 --> 16:27.000
but I thought it was due to a mistranslation or something, or they took something one way and then took it another way.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Honestly, here's what it comes down to.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
They ran it because of page hits.

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
So, now they had a good chance, and it seemed like it's something that makes sense to run that,

16:42.000 --> 16:50.000
and if they could be first with the story, then they get lots of page hits, and it just happened that it ended up not being true.

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
Nonetheless, they still got tons of page hits. People were talking about it, and most people forget about this mistake in a few weeks.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
So, it's just page hits.

17:03.000 --> 17:11.000
Alright. Anyway, just a note, we're still recording right now for the podcast, but wouldn't you know it, our live feed just went down,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
so right now our live listeners can't hear us.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
E3 has taken another service down.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Oh my gosh.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
The rush is too much.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
It's very frustrating, very frustrating, especially on a big show such as tonight,

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
which is, you know, the weird thing about an E3 prediction show for a show like us who tapes on Sunday night,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
literally we're going to have like three quarters of the answers tomorrow.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
I mean, and Tuesday is when the rest of it with Nintendo and, you know, the show floor opening up.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
So, to do the predictions now is like really for the live audience.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
I realize there's two distinct groups that listen to our show, right?

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
There's the live folks, and then there's the folks that listen to the podcast, most of them Monday morning.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
So, you know, hi to you guys that listen on the podcast feed, but I bet some of this is going to be hilarious to listen to in retrospect,

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
because for all we know, Sony rolls out that last Guardian Trail tomorrow, and, you know, all of this is for naught.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Hey, we weren't the ones that said it was canceled.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
That's true. We were not the ones that said it was canceled, so.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
And this is when I sit back in judgment.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
If this show comes last after the day's coverage, then answers, answers, answers, answers, answers, predictions.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Well, at least we can gauge ourselves.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
I think it does put Sony in an interesting pickle where they kind of need to say something on it.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
They need to give an update on the game.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't think that'll necessarily happen at the press conference.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
I mean, well, maybe it was always planned. We don't know.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
You can bet that the script for tomorrow's press conference is iron tight.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
They are not going to change it, with the exception of if they may have some counter moves planned for Microsoft.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Like there could be like a script A, script B, script C kind of thing.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
We have cracked down three.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Well, who knows? Anything is possible depending on what Microsoft does.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
They throw the first pitch, so, you know, Sony gets to respond to that in the position they're in.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
But you can bet that thing is scripted.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
They're not going to just suddenly say, oh, now we have to talk about The Last Guardian because IGN's got a big mouth.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
But I do kind of think it puts them in a position where they're going to have to say something.

19:03.000 --> 19:14.000
If it's not part of their planned press conference, then they're going to have to put out a press release or something that says the status or drop a quote to GameSpot, the biggest competitor for IGN or something.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Pull a Nintendo, show the logo on the screen, say, coming 2015.

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
Well, Sony's also in a unique position where they have that app, too, that they're doing on the PlayStation 4.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
So they could always drop something into that, too, if they wanted to. I don't know.

19:28.000 --> 19:35.000
You know, again, there's a lot of questions about this game, so I think many of us would like an update. So, we'll see.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Anyhow, speaking of wanting an update, let's talk about the other half of the kickoff topic I wanted to do tonight.

19:40.000 --> 19:49.000
And that is your own personal thing you want to get out of this year's E3. Like, what's the one thing you're, like, really curious?

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
I'm not talking prediction because that'll be later, but I'm talking, like, what are you genuinely curious about?

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
What is the thing you want to see more information about at the show?

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
I'll start with Jamie because I have a pretty good guess what she might say, but sometimes she surprises me.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Well, apart from Mass Effect stuff.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Okay, that was my guess.

20:03.000 --> 20:13.000
I actually want to know if any of the previous characters played in Dragon Age or Dragon Age 2 will have any real bearing or appearance in Dragon Age Inquisition.

20:13.000 --> 20:23.000
Gotcha. So, Dragon Age Inquisition isn't that far out from release, so you want, like, those final details. Like, who am I going to be able to play? Who am I not? What's going on?

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
Also, I'm super happy about it, though.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
What?

20:29.000 --> 20:38.000
Like, Vivienne looks amazing. Some of the characters just look really nice. I'm trying to be hopeful about it and hope that they don't pull, you know, what they did with Mass Effect 3.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
Different script writers! It's done! It's over! No.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
Let's see. Going to our chat room because the live listeners did come back, thank heavens, over at live.vognetwork.com.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
WhatupG says, Kevin Butler comes on stage. Last Guardian this.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
I don't know if Kevin, I think the Kevin Butler thing's kind of dead. I don't know. I don't know.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
Loki, what about the thing you most personally want to see at E3 this year?

21:02.000 --> 21:11.000
I just want to see a reason to buy any of these new systems, to be honest. I mean, because, I don't know. I just, I want to see new stuff. I want to see, like, the stuff that hasn't been announced yet.

21:11.000 --> 21:18.000
I don't give a shit about fucking Fable Anniversary or Halo Anniversary. I want to see some new shit. That's what I want to see.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
So it's games specifically, not peripherals. It's like, where are the freaking games?

21:22.000 --> 21:33.000
I don't even know if there would be anything peripheral-wise that I'd be even interested in. I mean, I don't know. I guess Project Morpheus might be neat to see if they had any information like when that's actually coming out or something.

21:33.000 --> 21:51.000
But I don't think that they're going to have any of that so early. Honestly, I'd be interested to see a little bit more on Sunset Overdrive. Anything from Sony because I don't even know what the hell they have coming out for the rest of the year. Nothing new, at least.

21:52.000 --> 22:02.000
And then Nintendo. Shit, give me a fucking reason to buy the Wii U. I mean, because Mario Kart's cool, but I need something. I'm not going to invest $300 to play one game.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
Or, I guess, two because you get a free game. But I'm not going to invest $300 to buy a handful of games.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Funny enough, though, a lot of people did.

22:11.000 --> 22:28.000
That's cool, but see, I did that with the Wii, and the Wii has collected dust for several years now, so I'm just not going to do that. I need a reason. Because eventually, Mario Kart will get burnt out, and then it's going to be like, okay, what now?

22:28.000 --> 22:39.000
So, I just need to see why I need one of these consoles. I mean, I want a new console. It'd be kind of cool to have one, but I need a game that I'm really excited about.

22:39.000 --> 22:54.000
Like, it would be totally awesome to see a new Saints Row game. I would be down with that. As long as they just don't go fucking crazy. I would just reboot the shit. I mean, seriously, it's beyond ridiculous right now.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
I hope they go back, they tone it down a bit. It'd be nice.

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
Now, some of you guys out there might be kind of a little surprised that Loki doesn't own a new console, but there's plenty of people that haven't made that plunge yet. Plenty of plenty of people.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
In fact, I'm looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, and SHA100Matt says,

23:13.000 --> 23:22.000
Actually, this E3, more than last year's, will weigh a lot more in my decision making in buying a console. And Dungeon Buster says, I'm still not buying a system yet either.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Three of the four of us in this room right now have not taken the plunge yet.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
Oh, I thought Dark Soccer, you guys had a PS4 at home. I guess I'm home.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
No.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh, why did I think that?

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Dan just spent $500 on a new driving rig.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
No, then I'm the big consumer whore in the room.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
And how?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
But I don't have a one.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Shocking.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
And to address Bobby, Saints Row 4 is so successful they need to go back and boot it when it wasn't selling that well.

23:45.000 --> 23:54.000
Do remember that there is quite a bit of difference in time from the game that came out last year versus the original game that came out in 2006.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
Quite a few more people have bought the consoles since then.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
I think they could also do it. The very first game that came out was a little more serious. I was trying to be a competitor.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
Saints Row 2. Saints Row 2 had a perfect balance between crazy and kind of toned down, and the story was fantastic.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
And you know what? Just building off of that and just going a little bit crazy like they did with Saints Row 3, I think that was fine.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
It's just when you get to, like, they're fucking in space in, like, you know, the Matrix and shit.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
It's not even fucking original. It's so ripped off of everything, and it doesn't make any sense anymore.

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
That's the thing. It's cool that they have a superhero game now, but it doesn't make any fucking sense.

24:32.000 --> 24:39.000
And yeah, okay, that might be the point, but it's just, it's not Saints Row anymore. It's another fucking game that they have the Saints Row title on.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
It's fucking Lords of Shadows, okay? That's what it is.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
S2100mattinchat says, Loki has a new console. It's called a baby.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I already had a baby.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Does it have a power switch? Alright. I'll talk about mine.

24:51.000 --> 24:58.000
The thing I am most curious about at this year's E3, I want to see if Nintendo makes a Hail Mary play.

24:58.000 --> 25:07.000
That is, you know, and I realize they may not. I realize we may know most everything that's happening with Nintendo between Smash Brothers and Bayonetta.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Like, we have a pretty good idea what their holiday lineup looks like.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
But, you know, out there in the media, the Wii U has been getting dogpiled a little bit.

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
Yes, there is a little sparkle, a little glimmer of hope with what's going on with Mario Kart 8.

25:19.000 --> 25:27.000
But whatever Nintendo's plan is for this E3 was thought up long before the sales figures for games that came out just last week came in.

25:27.000 --> 25:33.000
So, I'm very curious to see what Nintendo's Hail Mary plan will be, if there is one.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
I mean, I fully realize it may be par for the course, but there's that part of me that goes,

25:38.000 --> 25:46.000
okay, for all the crap we've given Nintendo over the years about they don't get online, they don't get online, Mario Kart 8, it didn't go down.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
The YouTube thing actually works out pretty well. It's become a meme.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
It's so, the level of detail in the game is so well done, it's down to that level.

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
You kind of go, could there be more of this coming from Nintendo that we just don't know about yet?

26:00.000 --> 26:07.000
And could it really make us go, wow, like, I never thought Nintendo was going to do that and they finally freaking did it.

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
Like, I'm talking like, if they came out and said Pokemon MMO and just put it all out on the table.

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
You know, that's the type of like Hail Mary thing I'm talking about, where it's like they finally do something we never thought they would do.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
And it's in a fit of desperation, in a sense, to win back the public.

26:24.000 --> 26:32.000
Because Nintendo, I mean, I have a lot of friends, especially, that will loyally support Nintendo through a lot and will defend Nintendo through a lot.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
You know, Nintendo is a very big brand that a lot of people really kind of, you know, tie to and connect with.

26:37.000 --> 26:44.000
And I think they're always going to have that little group, but I'm really curious, what are they going to do to really push the envelope and open it up to everybody?

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
Will they finally make the Pokemon console game that they've always refused to make?

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
I'm not talking stadium, I'm not talking, I'm talking like the RPG adventure or the MMO.

26:54.000 --> 27:00.000
I'm talking, are they going to do, are they going to do a Metroid that looks like a freaking Halo game?

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
That's online and, you know, shoot them up, player thing, because, I don't know, they think that's what people want.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
I really want to see, like, what is that thing where Nintendo really breaks the mold we've all come to expect from them.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
So, we'll see. That's what I'm looking forward to see, but we'll see.

27:15.000 --> 27:23.000
And vidpower in our chatroom kind of backs that up. Good guy Nintendo, free servers, didn't go down when Mario Kart 8 came out.

27:23.000 --> 27:30.000
So, but, to be fair, it's one game. It's one game. Alright, you cracked the seal.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
Now let's, you know, let's see the waterfall of games that you're going to have next.

27:35.000 --> 27:41.000
Alright, Jason, how about you? Lastly, you. What is the thing you personally want to see more of at E3?

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
E3 is at a really, really strange time in, like, the course of video game development right now.

27:47.000 --> 27:55.000
And I say that because Nintendo has been around since, the Wii U has been around since 2012 and everything else since the end of 2013.

27:55.000 --> 28:04.000
The point I was going to make was that I'm looking forward to seeing games that are going to have that not release window polish on them.

28:04.000 --> 28:12.000
And I think that's still going to hold true, but I think that they're not nearly developed far enough yet that it will be as meaningful as I want it to be.

28:12.000 --> 28:20.000
But that's really what I'm looking forward to this year is just that, like, this year to me is going to be future outlook.

28:20.000 --> 28:27.000
Like, maybe holiday season, but probably getting us to next E3 when everything new is actually going to be on the show floor.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
You know, there's a lot of talk about all these games that are being delayed to 2015.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
There's so many of them, we don't even have them all in our show world tonight. In fact, one I know that's not on the show world, it was big news.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
The next Batman game pushed to 2015, which is huge news, right?

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
Yeah, I kind of knew about that a few weeks ago.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Why didn't you say something?

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
Well, because it's financial year 2015, and I thought that was sometime in October.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Oh, okay, gotcha.

28:50.000 --> 29:00.000
I didn't realize it was actually next year. If I had known when their fiscal started, I would have been able to drop that bombshell a few weeks ago.

29:00.000 --> 29:07.000
Yeah, it's just... I don't know. I'm not surprised, because that's a pretty ambitious game. Sorry.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Go ahead.

29:08.000 --> 29:15.000
I was just going to say, so Jason, what I think I'm hearing from you is that you want to see even beyond all these games getting pushed back to 2015.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
You're like, what is the life vision for these consoles? What does the life expect to see? Is that kind of what I'm hearing?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
To an extent.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Like, you want to see the five year plan.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
It's more than just consoles, too, because it's also things like the new Unreal Engine that just came out a couple of months ago.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
There are an Oculus continuing its theme, Project Morpheus, coming up and actually doing something.

29:33.000 --> 29:40.000
Like, right now, all of these technologies that have hit in the last six months or so, they are a thing now.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
So we're going to get a tiny, tiny little glimpse about what that's going to mean for gaming.

29:45.000 --> 29:53.000
Probably not in the next year, because this shit takes forever to develop, but it's going to be the seeds, the inklings for the next one or two years.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
You should go to the Game Developers Conference next year. I think you might get more there, but...

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Don't need to spend more time in the Bay Area, but I probably will.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
I understand.

30:02.000 --> 30:12.000
Yeah, there are coworkers. Me and a couple of coworkers are trying to drum up support and we're trying to make a bigger deal about gaming within our company and going to these kinds of events.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
Co-workers of mine have been at GDC, and if timing works out, I would absolutely love to do that.

30:17.000 --> 30:32.000
Yeah, as I've said on the show, I'm not exactly a full-time gamer, I'm also not a developer, but I'm kind of gravitating towards engine production development and interest in that thing on a technical level.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
And so, my answer falls right in line with that.

30:37.000 --> 30:46.000
Now, next week's kickoff topic, I'm going to actually give you seven days notice on the kickoff topic. Next week's kickoff topic will be, were you satisfied with what you saw?

30:46.000 --> 30:52.000
So I'm going to follow up and see if Dark Soccer got the Dragon Age and Mass Effect info she wanted. I'm going to see if Loki found a reason to buy a console.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
No, my answer is no.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
You don't know yet. Sit down.

30:55.000 --> 31:05.000
I do know, because here is the fucking Nintendo E3, whatever you want, live from the treehouse, because it's like a fucking kid's meal at Burger King or something.

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
It's going to be too much fucking 3DS, not enough Wii U, and it's just going to be yay. That's about it.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
If it's a treehouse, does that mean there's going to be a new Donkey Kong Country?

31:14.000 --> 31:21.000
No, I don't know what the fuck the treehouse is supposed to be, but that's what they call their fucking event.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
But that's what it's going to be. It's mostly 3DS, because that's where the money is right now.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
I hope Iwata didn't go to E3, because he's coming over to kick your ass.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
Bring it on. That guy can't be that tall. I'm sure I can take him.

31:35.000 --> 31:46.000
Oh, anyways, last bit. You know what I'd love to see? I know this is such a long shot. I think Half-Life 3 being revealed would be more likely.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I'd love to see a new console DDR.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah, that'd be nice.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
That's just never going to happen.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
That'd be nice.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
Alright, Jason, I know you're not going to be, or will you be here for the next show? Are you back to Colorado?

31:57.000 --> 32:06.000
I haven't decided. I think, you know, we're driving back on Saturday. I think I should get home, which means driving all day Sunday and most of Monday.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Gotcha.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
But I haven't actually decided yet, so perhaps see you folks next week.

32:10.000 --> 32:17.000
Perhaps. We'll Skype you if nothing else, just to figure out if you got to see your long-term vision or whatever, and I'll let you know if Nintendo...

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
I think mine will probably be pretty easy, because I think you're all going to be feeling it if I feel it.

32:22.000 --> 32:32.000
So, anyway, I want to do housekeeping first, and then do our gaming week, which I know is a little out of order, but I'm going to use housekeeping, of course, to promote what we're working on at VoG Network.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
E3.vognetwork.com. It is our live, interactive coverage at the Voice of the Geeks network of the E3 Expo.

32:38.000 --> 32:47.000
Myself, Bobby, Jason will be like half us and half his day job, so two and a half times the coverage we had last year when it was just one person.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
What happens is that we are the second place to go for all the information.

32:52.000 --> 33:06.000
Look, we're not delusional. We know y'all go to Twitch or IGN or GameSpot, whatever, one of those sites, to go figure out what's breaking at E3 and see everything for the first time and see all those press releases turned into articles and all that stuff.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
That's great. Go to those sites. Absorb the information. Get everything you can on the games.

33:11.000 --> 33:21.000
But then, when you're kind of sick of reading the same thing over and over and over again, and you've got this burning question that isn't being answered anywhere else, come on over to E3.vognetwork.com and ask it.

33:21.000 --> 33:30.000
We are your voice out there on the show floor. We can't guarantee everybody's going to talk. We can't guarantee everybody's going to answer your question. We're not going to get the runaround, but we're going to try.

33:30.000 --> 33:37.000
And usually we found, I'm just kind of warning you guys from years past, the bigger the developer, the less willing they are to go off script.

33:37.000 --> 33:45.000
So if you want Square Enix to talk about Final Fantasy XV when they flat out said it's not the show this year, you can try, but the answer's probably going to be Fat Chance.

33:45.000 --> 34:02.000
However, some of these other developers that are pretty open and want to talk to their people, like I'm sure the folks, if there is a Saints Row 5 or a Saints Row reboot of that type of thing announced, I'm sure they'll be more than happy to talk about those games and answer those types of questions.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Still buy it, whatever it is.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Of course you will. You know you will.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
I know.

34:07.000 --> 34:17.000
You know, the folks that make The Witcher are pretty good. Those games that aren't necessarily the AAA titles, but are kind of like just below that are usually pretty good about talking up their stuff at E3.

34:17.000 --> 34:27.000
So ask away, we'll try, if nothing else. Funny enough, and I just said that, but probably the biggest break we got last year was we got a Disney scoop.

34:27.000 --> 34:36.000
Thanks to the interactive coverage, you know, they announced Disney Infinity last year and they talked about all these figurines and somebody went under our site and said, you know, I've seen all this talk about the figurines.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Nobody said about how much are they going to cost.

34:38.000 --> 34:44.000
So Rob and Bobby, I want you to find, well actually it was just Bobby last year, Bobby find out how much those figurines are.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
And he did.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Wasn't my main question.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
It might have been, was it your question? I don't know, somebody.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
No, my answer.

34:49.000 --> 34:54.000
No. Bobby got word on the show floor, you confirmed it, basically.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I already know how much they are.

34:56.000 --> 35:04.000
Anyway, so yeah, that's the kind of good stuff that's going to come out of the coverage. E3.vognetwork.com. Check it out.

35:04.000 --> 35:11.000
Alright, and that's all I have for Housekeeping. We will be back here next Sunday. There will be sadly no special shows during the show.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
What we're going to try to do is use that time to book interviews for future episodes.

35:16.000 --> 35:21.000
I may try to record some stuff there to play during future shows, but that's that.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
We are looking at having a live interview on the show on the 22nd, actually.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
But I will talk more about that next week because I don't have everything signed and dotted and all that.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And I don't want to promote something I don't know for sure.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
So something, I'll tell you this, it's kind of a neat game that a lot of people are talking about right now.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
So we'll hopefully have more info for you next week on that.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
Alright, meantime, let's go into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
We'll go through this pretty quick.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Dark Sakura.

35:48.000 --> 35:58.000
So far just Animal Crossing, although I did actually manage to get a little bit of time this afternoon to play through some Final Fantasy XIV and just hit the level I've been trying to get.

35:58.000 --> 36:06.000
So now I get to do like five quests and then grind for another two levels until I can get the next bit of my story quest.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
So no one will still do that dungeon with me. The D-whatever, DD.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I'm just never on when you are.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
I never remember the name.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Dazmiel, Darkhold, whatever.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Yeah, whatever it's called.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
That's an interesting one.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
If I wasn't gone all next week, I'd help you.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
It's okay.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
You'll get it.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
Yeah, so I've really had a very minimalist week.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Alright.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
I only played Goat Simulator version 1.1.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
I only played a little bit of it because they have a lot of stuff that they added.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
They added a whole new section of the maps.

36:38.000 --> 36:46.000
If you go into the tunnel now, it'll allow you to travel to some coastal town thing that they made.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
It's got all sorts of crazy stuff.

36:48.000 --> 36:54.000
It has its own theme park and you can stick your tongue to the rollercoaster and do some stuff with there.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
Plus they have goat parkour in there now and you can ride a skateboard and ride a bike.

36:59.000 --> 37:08.000
The only thing I didn't like about it is that the goat, they seem to have increased the speed of the goat really really really fast now for some reason.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm not sure why that is.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
So it's kind of hard to control sometimes because it doesn't run like it used to.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
But it's still silly.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
It's still a fun game.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
So definitely check it out.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
If you bought it earlier, check out the new patch because it was free.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
Lots of stuff in there.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
Including Minecraft, which I haven't found yet, but there's a ton of stuff in the game.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
That's it. That's all I played.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Alright.

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, map.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Jason, how about you? How was your gaming week?

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
I did finally get a chance to play Mario Kart.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
It did come in on Monday and I've played a couple of multiplayer and a couple of solo rounds.

37:53.000 --> 37:58.000
I don't think I have anything else particularly interesting to add on top of what you did, but it is a great game.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
It runs so well.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
I have clips from my personal favorite races up on YouTube.

38:06.000 --> 38:14.000
That replay feature, I completely agree with the point that you made in that these are going to get really old really fast.

38:14.000 --> 38:21.000
And by the time that everybody else figures them out and starts posting every single one because they can, we're going to be like, yeah, we saw that.

38:21.000 --> 38:29.000
But the actual mechanics for not just 100% defaults of how it makes the replays, but also the little tweaks.

38:30.000 --> 38:38.000
If anybody out there listening has Mario Kart 8 and has not hit edit replay highlights or something like that, you can choose the racers to feature.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
You can bump it up to 60 seconds, 30, 45, or 60.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
You can also do all, but it's worthless unless you're going to watch it because you can only post up to 60 seconds to YouTube.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Right.

38:48.000 --> 38:58.000
But you can actually tweak these tiny little things about the race and it makes it a lot better because we're not just seeing one person zoom around racers at opportunistic times and all that kind of stuff.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
But the replay feature is grand.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
For as being hands off as it is, they did a wonderful job.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
I'm enjoying that game thoroughly and unfortunately it's at a place I'm not going to be full time.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Anyways, whatever, no big deal.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
I played that while I was killing time before coming up to Sacramento yesterday, more Titanfall.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
And I think there was something, but I'm totally 100% drawing a blank.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I went to Scandi again and that was fun.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
I actually got to use the headphone ports for all three, Technica, Popn, and 2DX.

39:31.000 --> 39:40.000
And it makes a difference because I have big over the ear headphones and you kill all of the other arcade noise, mostly, and just hear game sounds.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
And it's very, it makes the experience quite a bit better.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Yeah. Oh, oh, that's what I was going to say.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
Does anybody in this room know what the term yak shaving means?

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Well, it certainly conjures a particular image to mind.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
In the quick summary of it is that you need to go check the mail.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
It's a sub-zero blizzard outside.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
So you need a coat.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
You don't have a coat.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
You need to go shave your yak to get the fur to make a coat.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
It's a series of steps that you fumble over in order to actually accomplish one thing.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
That was my week in a nutshell.

40:15.000 --> 40:23.000
I bought a recorder for E3 and systematically failed to be able to put micro SD cards that I had and ordered to use.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
And to top it all off, I was putting them in backwards.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I discovered that today.

40:32.000 --> 40:43.000
Sony's instructions are terrible because the words tell you when you put a Vita or M2, whatever their brand is, when you put a Vita card in, the contacts face you.

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
When you put a micro SD card in, you put a label towards you.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
The two of them are opposite.

40:52.000 --> 40:59.000
I didn't notice in the diagram that facing you is the back of the recorder.

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
So despite the fact that I could just pop it and put it right in while looking at the face of the unit, no, it's backwards!

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Fuck you, Sony.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Thank you.

41:11.000 --> 41:22.000
But it's working, and I have more battery capacity and SD cards than there is time in the week, literally 24 hours times 7 days a week.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
So I'm ready, I hope.

41:25.000 --> 41:34.000
Alright. My gaming week, I also played more Mario Kart, which I talked extensively about last week, so I won't repeat myself, except to say that I finally played some 4-player matches.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Still disappointed you can't get one of those people on the gamepad by themselves.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
I do notice a little bit of a framerate dip in those matches, but it's not the end of the world.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
I'm getting really nitpicky at that point when I get into that. Still a lot of fun, and that's the most important thing of all.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
Also on the Wii U, I finally got to play the Wario. It's not WarioWare, it's like Game & Wario, it's just another mini-game collection.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
Yeah, okay, it's a mini-game collection, party games, you know, I had five people over here last night.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
It was fun for that, and that's, you know, it was cute.

42:03.000 --> 42:12.000
You play this game where you launch people onto platforms, and then like, as you land, you might knock other people off, and the platforms move. It's silly. Silly stuff.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
I played Rob's NES Remix and NES Remix 2. It reminded me of Dance Master Mode from DDR. I completely forgot that.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Super fun.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
You unlocked Clu Clu Land for me.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
I unlocked the first stage of Clu Clu Land.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
Yay!

42:26.000 --> 42:53.000
Okay, also, a game I've been spending a little more time with this week, I bought, it came out, and some of you might be surprised to hear I bought this, but I picked up on the 3DS since I had some credit on the Nintendo store from buying all this other stuff, and I had the Nintendo Wii U Deluxe, so I get all that 10% back or whatever, and now that store is across both the Wii U and the 3DS, so I was able to get Tomodachi Life at a discounted price.

42:54.000 --> 43:11.000
Now, yes, there was a lot of controversy around this game, which we got into a couple weeks ago on the show, and I said my piece, but I think it's important to realize that Nintendo did apologize for that, and I think the gaming community as a whole, for the most part, accepted Nintendo's second apology. Unfortunately, it took them two times to get it right.

43:11.000 --> 43:31.000
But I decided, you know what, I like these type of sim games anyway, I was a fan of Animal Crossing, I'm gonna check the game out. I realize some of my GLBT family does not feel the same way, and there's some people out there that feel very strongly that Nintendo screwed up, and we should not be buying Tomodachi Life.

43:31.000 --> 43:43.000
However, if people continue to hold grudges against me for my entire life, for things that I've had to apologize for in the past, and with 555 episodes of this program, I've said some stupid shit I've had to apologize for in the past.

43:43.000 --> 43:51.000
If people held grudges against me for the rest of my life, I wouldn't like that very much, and that would be really sad and depressing that there would be literally nothing I could do to make things right.

43:51.000 --> 44:00.000
My point is, they apologized, let's move on. That being said, I want to put that whole controversy behind us and kind of evaluate the game as a game.

44:00.000 --> 44:10.000
Well, alright, I guess I should get this out there. It's really, really easy to kind of get what I want in that sort of like romance department, so here's what I did.

44:10.000 --> 44:31.000
You can't change the gender of a Mii that you import from your own, like Mii Plaza or the Miis that are saved on your system and so forth, but what you can do is you can make a new Mii, and you can make it a male or female, and all the same facial features, beards, lipstick, mole, beauty marks, whatever, are the same same, male or female.

44:31.000 --> 44:39.000
You can do whatever you want. You want to make Conchita worst? You can. So what I did is I created Alan in the game as a female, and he knows that I did this.

44:39.000 --> 44:48.000
And so, his character and my character, funny enough, are getting into a relationship right now. They're doing that whole courting each other, having long walks on the beach thing. It's really adorable.

44:49.000 --> 45:06.000
So it really wasn't that hard to work around. So I say that both as a pro and a con, in that the pro is that if you really want to set up a same-sex relationship, as long as you're willing to overlook a few things such as misgendering, but I just kind of giggle it off.

45:06.000 --> 45:16.000
You know, it'll keep referring to Alan as a she, but I just think of it as like an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race. You know, like, how is she, though? How is she a girl?

45:16.000 --> 45:27.000
And I just kind of picture it like that in my mind, and it's fine. If you're willing to kind of overlook that little bit of silliness, it works just fine, and it's really easy to set up.

45:27.000 --> 45:38.000
But the con that I also say to that is that it was really easy to set up, and I'm buying a little less and less that it would have taken a lot for Nintendo to fix this.

45:38.000 --> 45:46.000
I'm not a programmer, so I'm not really going to try to get into it, but I just kind of think if Nintendo had really wanted to do it, they could have.

45:46.000 --> 45:58.000
But I do think at the end of the day, they were a bit lazy and probably ignorant, which, you know, okay, they've apologized, you know, I've done some lazy and ignorant things in my life, you know, whatever.

45:58.000 --> 46:06.000
We'll move on and see what happens in the future. Anyway, now I'm really done with that topic, but I felt like I had to tell you the whole story on what's going on there.

46:06.000 --> 46:13.000
Let's talk about the game itself, and kind of just trying to look at it from that neutral standpoint.

46:13.000 --> 46:21.000
The game is really nothing like Animal Crossing, in my opinion. I know we kind of keep comparing it to that, but it really isn't like that at all.

46:21.000 --> 46:32.000
It's a little more like a, honestly, it plays like a Facebook game, and I realize that can be seen as like a negative, but that's really what I think it is.

46:32.000 --> 46:40.000
You check in on it once in a while and, oh, somebody wants to be fed, or oh, somebody wants new clothes, and oh, they want to feed me, feed me, burp me, burp me.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
So, it's Nintendmes instead of Nintendogs.

46:44.000 --> 46:52.000
Actually, that's not a bad way to look at it. It's almost like Nintendogs with people is almost a better way to look at it than Animal Crossing.

46:52.000 --> 47:00.000
Ironically, there was also the Sony game that came out this week that was Nintendogs, but they talked like people, and that was weird.

47:00.000 --> 47:14.000
So, anyway, but what are you rewarded with for, you know, feed me, feed me, change my clothes, do whatever, tell me about if this person and I would make a good match or whatever.

47:14.000 --> 47:26.000
You get rewarded with story, and it's very much a fishbowl game. You're looking at these little virtual pets, which is why I think maybe Nintendogs is kind of a great comparison, because you're rewarded with the story.

47:26.000 --> 47:40.000
And when you have like 30 or something villagers in your little town that are all based off me's that you made, either me's made off celebrities, me's from people you know with these QR codes and so forth, you kind of get these little stories.

47:40.000 --> 47:55.000
And so, this causes you to be able to go to other people and to go, Loki, he'll never guess what you did in my town. Oh, my God, you were acting so stupid, and you would not believe that you're in a relationship with Lady Gaga, who I imported a me that looks like Lady Gaga to my town.

47:55.000 --> 48:07.000
And it's like those little silly story sharings. It's very quirky. There's a lot of like, you know, let's sing karaoke. You don't actually sing karaoke, but you watch your characters sing pop songs and make these silly music videos.

48:07.000 --> 48:16.000
And there's this nightly news element in it where you hear about the crazy antics that your me's are getting into and me's on the street will be interviewed, which are the me's there.

48:16.000 --> 48:28.000
So, I mean, that's what it is. Essentially, it's this big, you'll never guess what the people in my sim are doing, which is, again, kind of goes back to The Sims. The Sims, you know, was a big thing like that.

48:28.000 --> 48:39.000
He'll never guess what I did in my house. Okay, so I built a pool, and I had everybody go in the pool, and then I got rid of the ladder, and you'll never guess what happened, right? Those are the kinds of stories that we create out of these types of games.

48:39.000 --> 48:48.000
And that's what you do get in Tomodachi Life is those stories and that aspect of it, but the game aspect, you guys, is really, really weak.

48:48.000 --> 49:04.000
There's no fishing like in Animoid. There's no bug catching. There's really none of that. Sometimes you get into a, pick a card out of my hand and let's see who gets a pair first, or here's a picture zoomed in three times the regular amount.

49:04.000 --> 49:12.000
What could it be? There's really crappy throwaway minigames like that that you can play that sometimes they'll want to play, but it's nothing.

49:12.000 --> 49:23.000
It would be hilarious if it's just so, like, disturbed. What is it? It's my penis. It's my penis. Whoa, that was unexpected.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
No, no, nothing like that.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Lady Gaga.

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
Sometimes there's, they have a lot of weird items and things in the game, but that's really it.

49:31.000 --> 49:44.000
So, here's the thing, the bottom line on this game. I do think it serves a cute purpose, and for people that want a nice little distraction, it's a polished game that allows you to kind of interact with the people.

49:44.000 --> 49:55.000
It's like a Facebook game. If you're the type of person that doesn't mind checking in with a Facebook game every, you know, day or so for a good 15 minutes to just kind of check on people and so forth, Tomodachi Life is a very polished version of that game.

49:55.000 --> 50:06.000
But if you're looking for a game, you're not going to find it here. And I, for that reason, kind of give it, I'm tepidly positive on this game.

50:06.000 --> 50:15.000
I'm not, like, super enthusiastic positive. I kind of think it does what it needs to do. I'm not sure it's worth $35 at the end of the day.

50:15.000 --> 50:22.000
I think this is a $20 game, not a $35 game. Or this is a game that Nintendo will give away a year from now to get you to buy something else.

50:22.000 --> 50:29.000
I kind of don't think $35 is worth it for this game. And that's what I have to say on Tomodachi Life.

50:29.000 --> 50:39.000
If you disagree with me, you can always email us in your thoughts on the game. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send something.

50:39.000 --> 50:47.000
I'm looking at her chat to see if anything has come up on that, what I was just talking about. Dark Tetsuya says at Live.vognetwork.com.

50:47.000 --> 50:54.000
So it's sort of like a soap opera or not quite that deep? Well, is a soap opera really that deep, Dark Tetsuya?

50:54.000 --> 51:02.000
It's a telenovela, let's put it that way. It's a telenovela. It's a little bit like that. So, yeah, there you go.

51:02.000 --> 51:11.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news now that we've all gone with our gaming weeks and talk about what really is going on in the gaming world this week. Loki.

51:11.000 --> 51:27.000
Alright, so this kind of leaked out based off of people being at the convention center early and taking some photographs from the inside, kind of looking at booths being constructed and stuff.

51:27.000 --> 51:34.000
And one of the things that was spotted at Nintendo's booth was this big old banner for something called Mario Maker.

51:34.000 --> 51:47.000
And it kind of shows a picture of the Super Mario Brothers 1 style graphics with someone placing a piranha plant with a stylus.

51:47.000 --> 51:57.000
So what is it? You know, is it something for 3DS? Is it something for Wii U? No idea, but it looks like a game that revolves around making your own 2D Mario levels.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
Is it a game for both, wiggling eyebrows?

52:02.000 --> 52:14.000
It could be. I mean, shit, if the Wii U can't handle 2D Mario, which it should be able to since it runs on Virtual Console, and it's also an NES Remix, I think that they could probably handle this.

52:14.000 --> 52:21.000
Hey, maybe it's based off of the engine that runs NES Remix since they kind of remix the games there anyways.

52:21.000 --> 52:29.000
Maybe you could be absolutely right, actually, on that. Thoughts? You and I were joking before the show. You kind of said this on an earlier show.

52:29.000 --> 52:39.000
Yeah, I only said this like, I don't even know how long ago, but yeah, it makes sense. I think it was back when I was saying how Nintendo doesn't really want to put effort into some of these games at the release.

52:39.000 --> 52:46.000
Like, for example, Virtual Console and stuff like that. They'll re-release a game and they won't really add that many features into it.

52:46.000 --> 52:54.000
Well, just add a game that people like, like Mario Brothers or something. Add a level creator and have a way where you can share levels and stuff like that. There you go.

52:54.000 --> 53:01.000
All your community creates the content for you. You have to do no work other than building that editor, which you probably have anyways.

53:01.000 --> 53:08.000
Although I don't know if I want to believe the rumor or not. I mean, we're going to find out in two days anyway.

53:08.000 --> 53:23.000
You know, I feel like this is a very logical step for Nintendo. It makes a lot of sense. So if it's a made-up thing, it's a really good and convincing made-up thing because this is something where I could see Nintendo going in this direction.

53:23.000 --> 53:31.000
It's essentially Little Big Planet starring Mario in a way. And I think that's a really good thing for Nintendo right now.

53:31.000 --> 53:39.000
Because if you think about it, they don't really have a lot like it. I mean, back in the day, you could edit Excitebike tracks, but what could you really do with that?

53:39.000 --> 53:47.000
Even here in the States, we didn't have the Famicom Disk System, so you couldn't even save what you did. It was like, come over and I'm going to design a track while you do something else and you can play my track.

53:48.000 --> 53:55.000
And there's been like little editing in that way. I think maybe some Super Nintendo games had like three slots. You could save things. Like little things like that.

53:55.000 --> 54:05.000
But nothing that I can think of that's really incorporated the internet. Like I'm really trying to think on something that kind of does that create and share that really Little Big Planet is based on the Nintendo universe. I'm drawing a blank.

54:05.000 --> 54:13.000
Smash Brothers Brawl. Which also had a limit of what, like four or five stages I think. If I remember correctly.

54:14.000 --> 54:26.000
Still, I would argue there's a pretty significant difference between something of that caliber and taking a game like a 2D platformer like Mario and opening that up to everybody to kind of do their own thing.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.000
Look how many ROM hacks there are for Mario. We're going to have asshole Mario officially.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
And I think a lot of people have been wondering, why doesn't Nintendo just embrace this? Everybody wants to hack the game.

54:37.000 --> 54:44.000
When I talk about Nintendo making a Hail Mary play and doing something that none of us expect, this is kind of in line with that.

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
I have an answer to that question. Swap, note, spot, pass. That's why.

54:50.000 --> 55:01.000
So do you think there is a concern that people will make levels that are giant blocks that say fuck, shit, cunt as you run through the level and Nintendo's worried about having to police that?

55:01.000 --> 55:12.000
It may be community created, but it's still moderator curated. Like yes, they will have to enforce that kind of thing if it is publicly accessible for everybody. Even if it's not, they probably have to.

55:12.000 --> 55:22.000
Like this is the Nintendo Network and Miiverse and all of this stuff where people drive the content. Yes, that's true, but Nintendo has very, very, very, very strict social guidelines.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
So they can't have everything doing this. They have just enough that they have manpower.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
I wish they'd do this with the original Mario Kart and make their own track editor would be awesome.

55:31.000 --> 55:40.000
Well, you never know. I mean, I just see with Nintendo getting more and more into the online thing, again, this makes, because I could see you could share your levels on Miiverse quite easily.

55:40.000 --> 55:48.000
And Nintendo does have that moderator thing in place. So maybe like little big planet, there'll be a way to report offensive levels and they'll be able to look at it.

55:48.000 --> 55:55.000
Like there's probably a way they can look at the file on their screen and just see the level all at once and see if anything offensive is in it and take action that way.

55:55.000 --> 56:03.000
So I don't know. So maybe Nintendo is going to start to embrace this and logically it makes a lot of sense. I hope it's true.

56:03.000 --> 56:09.000
It seems like it also seems like a stupidly easy thing for Nintendo to make. Doesn't it?

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
And also like something that they could do for one, two, three world. I mean.

56:15.000 --> 56:26.000
Yeah. Like one of the best parts of NES Remix 2 was that whole, I'm playing as the princess in Super Mario 3. That's so trippy, but awesome.

56:26.000 --> 56:36.000
Like that was, that was like one of the highlights for me. So yeah, you're right. If they could kind of fuse all that together, if Mario Maker is not just Mario one, or maybe it's Mario one to start.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
But if you want the DLC for Mario two and three, you got to buy the virtual console game and now it'll come with it.

56:43.000 --> 56:50.000
Who knows? Who knows? It'll be interesting to see what Nintendo gets into with that.

56:50.000 --> 57:00.000
If Mario Maker comes out, let's hypothesize you owned a Wii U. Let's say Mario Maker comes out. It's a $30 game. Would you buy it?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
For 30 bucks? No.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
30 bucks? Still too much, huh?

57:05.000 --> 57:13.000
There'd have to be some significant stuff in there. And I just, honestly, if I want to play ROM hacked Mario games, there's plenty of them out there.

57:13.000 --> 57:24.000
There's plenty of them out there that do even like trippier stuff than just rearranging the levels. You know it'd be, well, Metroid would be cool too, because I've seen a lot of ROM hacked Metroid stuff.

57:24.000 --> 57:32.000
But anything ROM hacked sometimes is pretty, you know, interesting, especially when you're, you know, redesigning levels and there's some pretty cool levels out there.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
There's even custom storylines for Earthbound Mother 2 and Mother 3.

57:36.000 --> 57:46.000
I'm curious for Jamie and Jason's thoughts on this real quick, but going to the chatroom at live.voggetnetwork.com, Blender says LittleBigPlanet has a strict policy and will remove levels.

57:46.000 --> 57:54.000
So, you know, it's not like this format of having levels and moderating them and so forth doesn't already exist somewhere else.

57:54.000 --> 58:03.000
And if I remember correctly, they even outright, well, no, I've played custom levels that have eye taken, camera taken photos. Never mind.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
But they probably moderate those much more strictly because the real world and a camera and part of your level.

58:08.000 --> 58:14.000
Yep. Time to penis. Although I did play a level once that was all pictures of Parker Posey, it was great. That was my favorite.

58:14.000 --> 58:20.000
Because then you could take the stickers and put them in your own levels. It was this really creepy, like, Parker Posey stalking thing. It was hilarious.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
But while you have the mic, your personal thoughts on Mario Maker and if it's something that would interest you.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Ask me on Tuesday.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Cop out.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
I'm going to see it on Tuesday.

58:33.000 --> 58:40.000
I just want, ideally, I just want, and this is probably selling me a Wii U, I just want Excite Truck Maker.

58:40.000 --> 58:46.000
That's what I want. I just want Excite Truck Maker because the game was perfect. You just need more levels. That's all you needed was more levels.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Jamie, quickly, your thoughts?

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I don't think it's enough to make me want a Wii U.

58:50.000 --> 58:56.000
Not enough to make you want a Wii U, but let's, let's hypothesize you already had a Wii U. Would the game itself be something of interest to you?

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Maybe.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Maybe.

58:58.000 --> 59:04.000
I mean, I spend most of my time in the Sims building houses, so I'd be, probably just do nothing but build shit all day.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
To never be used.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
The design side of you, I think, would twitch a little bit, like, getting to do this.

59:09.000 --> 59:15.000
Here's another interesting thing. What if it was not just making Mario levels? What if it was like Mario Paint?

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Hmm.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I pay enough for Photoshop.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
That was actually the initial reaction I had when I first heard about this news.

59:22.000 --> 59:29.000
You know, there has been a lot of clamoring for a return of Mario Paint. You know, we haven't seen that in a very long time, and the Wii U seems like an obvious play.

59:29.000 --> 59:36.000
I mean, we have games that are very similar, like Art Academy on the 3DS and so forth, like, it's not out of the question that we would get some type of return of Mario Paint.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
As long as it has the Flyswatter game, that's all I want.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Alright.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
ActDeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Mario Paint. I would like that.

59:45.000 --> 59:51.000
Alright. Let us go to our next story, which has to do with Xbox.

59:51.000 --> 01:00:00.000
The Xbox One controller. I remember this. Jason, you brought an Xbox One controller and a PlayStation 4 controller to the studio once, and I was like, why did you buy these controllers?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
You were like, yeah, I wanted them, and someday I'll be able to use them on the PC.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Yep.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Well, guess what? That day has come, Jason.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
It's actually sitting eight feet away from you right now.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Is it really?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Yeah.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
They're in my little black bag over there.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Microsoft has released the official drivers for Xbox One for the PC, so it will support 32-bit and 64-bit Windows PCs.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Any game that currently supports the Xbox 360 controller will support the One controller, and as soon as you install the drivers, you can start using that controller and connect it via a micro USB cable.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Native controller support will come in a Windows update that is to come in the future, but they wanted to get the drivers out there ASAP so that people can use it on the PC.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And I'm going to be honest, the Xbox 360 controller makes a great PC controller. I use it all the time.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So I kind of want an Xbox One controller just to – because, you know, again, the D-pad on the 360 drives me nuts, so I imagine it's a lot better on the One.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I'd also like to see some of those PC games support those rumble triggers. I'd be interested to see how that is like.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Yeah. It would be cool.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Well, one game that you could use that controller on as well when it comes out is Dead Rising 3.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Of course, Dead Rising is already out on the Xbox One, but if you don't own a One but somehow have a controller like Jason, the game is coming to Steam.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Capcom announced earlier this week that it will be on PC, and it's part of their E3 2014 lineup.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:39.000
We don't know when, but it seems like it wouldn't take too long to put together, so I would think this holiday season, if not maybe something more like August, just in time for all these new drivers.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You could play Dead Rising 3.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I have some stuff, but it's not happy stuff.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Aww.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
But we knew this was coming one day.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
The PSP?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Mm-hmm.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Womp womp.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Oh, do I have to get the sound effect board again?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
No. I did all the sound effects we need.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Okay, fine.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It is going to be ending later this month. Bye-bye. At least in Japan.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000
It also is discontinuing it in North America. Of course, the shipment's already discontinued up here.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It's going to continue on in Europe for a little while, and it's going to be continuing in Latin America, some of the other Asian countries, but it's officially...

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000
But I bet Fry's will still sell the UMD's movies, trying to get rid of that last stock that they have.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
They'll eke any penny they can out of that, and then maybe I'll buy some.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
There you go.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
But I mean, it's almost ten years old. I guess that's...

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It seemed like the PSP was still kicking in Japan, though, so it was kind of a surprise to hear this.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Buy the Vita! We'll force you to buy the Vita.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Maybe that's part of what it is.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
That's kind of what I think it is.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yeah. But the only bummer about the PSP is that anytime I think of the PSP, I'm going to inevitably think of the PSP Go, which in retrospect was probably just a little bit ahead of its time.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I mean, a digital-only platform. It's really funny. The PSP Go, in a way, was doing some of the things the Xbox One wanted to do with the digital-only.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And it didn't work out so well.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
People bought them, though. I mean, some people did.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I kind of think if the PSP Go were to come out today, it might actually have done a little better.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
PSP Go or PSP No?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
No.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Yeah, there is a much better network that could have actually supplanted it with games and with a lot more games nowadays, especially with the addition of PlayStation Plus.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I was going to say, PlayStation Plus alone would give that thing a lot of value.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
God knows I have, like, six purchases for a system that I don't own.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Yeah, right? So...

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And also, they added, was it the Xbox Live Gold stuff already?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Mm-hmm.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So, since now, fucking Sony won't let me register those PlayStation 4 games anymore since I don't own a PlayStation 4.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But on Microsoft now, you can do the Xbox One games, and I can do it even though I don't have an Xbox One, so...

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
All right.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Get in on that shit.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
All right, Loki, why don't you continue on?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
All right. So, moving on here, let's see.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
This is kind of neat.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:27.000
You know, good old games, they've kind of had a pretty decent service going along with all their older games that are DRM-free.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Now, if you want a kind of similar integration with stuff, as Steam does, they have their own client that they announced called Galaxy.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And now, Galaxy is going to have cross-platform support, as well as for those playing online, and it's also totally optional.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So, if you want to have that in there, you'll be able to earn achievements, access your library, also the multiplayer stuff.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And it's kind of a neat little front-end for all these games you may have through GOG.com.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
But, you know, if you don't want that and you want things the way they are now, you don't need it.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So, that's kind of cool.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I didn't actually watch the livestream, but I guess that was part of their Witcher announcement, I think, as well, when they were talking about that stuff.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I'm curious to check this out, because I have a very small library on good old games.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Yeah, all the free stuff that they've given out.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I actually have bought things on good old games.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I bought when they released Sid Meier's Covert Action.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Those of you that have listened to the show for a long time know I have this really awkward boner for Covert Action.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Which, you know, was a game from my childhood I just loved, even though the critics weren't really into it.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Even kind of looking back in retrospect, I'm like, this game was kind of stupid.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
But it was Carmen Sandiego, but with guns and killing people. It was awesome.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So, I will always have a soft spot for Covert Action.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Battle chest, Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Space Quest, Descent...

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I think those are the things that I actively bought from there, because they make cross-platform DOSBox emulation for all those old games.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
You got a little library growing there.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I'm downloading Galaxy right now.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I think it is a good service overall.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I think some of the games are sometimes a little pricey, but usually it's for a reason.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
They're the games we really, really, really enjoy.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
But, you know, it's just hard.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I mean, what is the value of a game like that?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
But then again, I also pay five bucks for things on Virtual Console that some would say,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
What the hell are you spending that money on?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I'm a liar. I'm not downloading it right now.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
It's not out just yet. I will download it when it's actually out.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
We're not downloading it on this bandwidth. We're having a hard time keeping the show up tonight.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Hey, hey, that outage wasn't our fault. Nobody knows what I'm talking about right now.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Well, the live listeners sure do.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
All right. Let's move on to you, Jason.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Continue the conversation.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So, Valve has officially embraced the fickle nature of game and game development by updating their early access fact,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:12.000
warning that users may be playing games that will never actually be released, or worse, could be scrapped outright.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
The statement updated to read,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
It's up to the developer to determine when they are ready to release,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
and some developers have a concrete deadline in mind,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
while others get a better sense as the development of the game progresses.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Doug Lombardi, who's the director of marketing at Valve, said along with this,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
that the changes to the fact are intended to help set customer expectations

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
of what may or may not happen over the course of development of an early access game.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
We frequently iterate on Steam features as we gather feedback and find areas for improvement.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
In this case, it became apparent that further clarifications would help customers

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
evaluate their potential purchase of early access titles.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
We think of Steam, early access, and game development as services that grow and evolve best

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
with the involvement of customers and community.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
And this is really super surprising to me because don't some early access games

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
cost like full price for what you would buy for a new game?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Yes, they do.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I've seen a good number of like $10 or $15, but I have definitely also seen like $50 early access games.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Like Arma 3, Arma 3 was early access and I think it was like $40.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I bought AudioSurf on early access, I think there was another one I bought too,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
but I mean those were more indie titles, they were like $10, $15.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Yeah, and they were also early, like,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Wasn't that actually even before early access was officially a thing?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I think AudioSurf in particular is one of the early,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I mean it was released as an early, early game and it's still really being developed, so.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It's a very interesting feature, don't get me wrong,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000
and we have a lot of the same arguments that we do with Kickstarter that these things may not pan out.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
The difference is that because it's an early access game, you are playing something,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
so you get something out of it.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
But, like any game, if it requires server components especially,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.000
if the source disappears, then well, your game may eventually disappear as well.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Steam had to do legal cover your ass, so, you know, that went into the fact.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Well, we'll see how people keep to early access in light of this news.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And this is actually new to me, I haven't followed a lot of early access stuff,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I've heard, I saw Arma when it came out most recently, DayZ was a big thing,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I've seen a couple of others, but I've never bought them, I've never jumped into it first hand.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:40.000
But apparently, a game has already been halted and not cancelled,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
but Towns was halted and it's going in via Steam Greenlight,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000
and then Earth Year 2066 was outright removed last month,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
apparently due to dishonest marketing, which I didn't hear anything about.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
That's very interesting, but apparently these are,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I don't want to say reactive changes, but they're certainly happening after the fact,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
there's already precedent for this kind of a problem,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
and now it's in Steam's official information, so take that as you will.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Hi, GameGuru in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000
paying for a broken game, sigh, but if that's what people want, dot dot dot.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
It's your money spending on what you want, right?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Yep.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Alright, so hopefully you're getting an accurate portrayal of what your money is going to buy,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I think that's a very important thing to know.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Anyhow, DarkSakura.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000
One other point about what money controls is money controls things like layoffs,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
which Nintendo has decided to consolidate their European operations,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
and they're laying off 130 employees.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Now, keep in mind, for some people, that's a small town,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:51.000
so they said that they're closing the headquarters in Gossa's time,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I guess I pronounced that right, because I know what the little B sign is,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
it's a sss, it's an extra sss.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Anyway, that's in Germany, and is moving their operations to Frankfurt,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
so they're losing 130 employees.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Not so permanent.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Huh, Nintendo has more offices in Europe than just Germany, though, right?

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Yeah, this is just one office, but I mean, it almost seems to me like it's the start of something else, so.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Take it as you will.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It's unfortunate, but with some of these sales we're seeing and so forth,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
it's not surprising that something's happening somewhere,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
but yeah, I mean, again, this is a very important year for Nintendo,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
they've got to really start making some of that money back on Wii U,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
so it really should have been last year, but you know, Nintendo has tons of cash on hand,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000
let's not forget that, they've got tons and tons of cash on hand, so.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
What happened to It Prints Money?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
That's why they have cash in hand.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
That's why they have cash on hand.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
But the 3DS, you know, it's probably not doing,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I think the reason why some people think the 3DS is disappointing

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000
is because A, you know, you have the ever-growing mobile market and so forth,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
but B, it's not meeting expectations,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
but I think the expectations were set really, really high to try to offset what's going on with the Wii U,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
but for all practical purposes, it seems like the 3DS is still doing very well,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
a lot of people own them, and the game is still making a lot of games for them.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Seems to be in a better spot right now than the Vita,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
and I'm not really dogging on the Vita, I realize there's a lot of great games out on the Vita and so forth,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
but it's not exactly nearly as rampant as the 3DS adoption is, so.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Anyhow.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
All right, let's travel around the world and check out release dates.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Let's see what is coming out soon from a company you love,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
although with the three-week, probably most of it isn't really announced,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
but we'll see what is on deck anyway. Loki.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Not a whole ton of stuff coming out this week.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I've got Enemy Front on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and How to Train Your Dragon 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and 3DS.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
That is it.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
All right, let's go to Japan and check out what is coming out there in the Japanese release dates.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:05.000
On June 12th on the PlayStation 4, Thief gets its Japanese release from Square Enix on June 12th.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Fighting Commander 4 also coming out on the PlayStation 4 on June 12th.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Nothing for Xbox One, because remember, that isn't out in Japan yet.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Very interesting to see. I'm very curious. That was almost like a runner-up for me.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
How is Microsoft going to get into the Japanese market there at E3?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
All right, Shane walked into the studio and is dying to say something here. What?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I have breaking news.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Okay, what?

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Can I borrow your phone charger?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Couldn't you, like, text me that or something?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Yes, she can borrow my phone charger. Oh my god, was that really worth interrupting the show for?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
You jerk. Get out of here. All right.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
It's in my room. You want to brave that?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Or give me a minute and I'll come get it.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:06.000
All right, on the PlayStation 3, it's probably over by where Alan's underwear is, but I'll let him figure that out on his own.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:18.000
All right, on the PlayStation 3, Fighting Commander 4 on June 12th, One Piece Unlimited World R, as well as Ratchet & Clank Giga Saikyo TriStar Pack.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
It looks like a compilation there on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And Thief, also making its way to the PlayStation 3 all this week on the 12th.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
On the Xbox 360, Thief gets its release there in Japan.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:44.000
And on the PlayStation Vita, One Piece Unlimited World R from Bandai Namco, as well as Iyu Densetsu Anno Kisuke Evolution from Falcom comes out as well.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000
And last but not least, I'm going to check the Wii U to see if anything is out this week on the Wii U.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
One Piece Unlimited World R is there as well.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And I can't forget the Nintendo 3DS, except they are not actually having any releases this week.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
But Pack World is slated for June 19th, so there's that.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And Pokemon Art Academy, speaking of those Art Academy games, that's all on the 19th.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
All right, moving on. To Europe, DarkSakura.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000
There's some stuff coming out in Europe, and for a moment my system has been slow, so you ready?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
On the 13th of June we have Inazuma 11 GO Shadow & Light.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Spread tires, I guess, on PC.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Enemy friends on Xbox 360, PS3, and on PC.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
That looks to be about it.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
A general lack of stuff.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And since Rob and Shane are now braving the depths of the scary, scary bedroom, I will just go ahead and say that Loki has the new story.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Yeah, of course.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
So this is kind of disappointing, especially when it turns into lawsuits.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:00.000
But apparently the composer for the Halo series and now the upcoming Destiny game, Martin O'Donnell, is suing Bungie.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Because apparently he was fired without cause, according to his claim.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And due to that, he was not paid his, I guess, accrued time off.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
The unused vacation, paid time off, sabbatical time, and other benefits that they had promised to pay him.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And now, because of this, I guess he is seeking twice the amount of withheld wages along with compensation to cover legal fees.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And I guess also filing another grievance against both the CEO Harold Ryan and Bungie.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
But I guess they haven't really said what that is over.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And I don't know, it doesn't really say.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
So he has another grievance, but it doesn't really say what it's for.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I guess separate from the whole paid time off thing.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Well, when you leave a company, you are supposed to get all that time off.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And apparently he says, like most companies, they have a policy based on that they are supposed to be paying that stuff out.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Well, we'll see what develops in court.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
But like most things, it will probably be settled out of court with a gag order.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
So we'll never hear about it again.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Alright, one thing you're still going to hear about, and you're going to hear plenty about it next week, I'm sure, is Mortal Kombat X was officially announced.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Now I want to point out, unlike when we had Final Fantasy X-2, which a lot of people mistakenly called Final Fantasy X-2, this is Mortal Kombat X, not X.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And that's per the Twitter of, I believe it was Ed Boon that came out and actually said that.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
But isn't it the tenth game still?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
It is.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000
So calling it Mortal Kombat X is not necessarily wrong, but they are going to be marketing the game as Mortal Kombat X.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:54.000
But you see, with a game like Mortal Kombat, you think extreme or extreme violence or whatever, so it makes sense.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:07.000
But anyway, Mortal Kombat X was officially announced this week to no one's surprise, because you remember on last week's show we were talking about that the posters were spotted and we knew this was coming, there was a countdown to a countdown.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Well, the official trailer hit, and it was Sub-Zero and Scorpion fighting with some little rap music.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
What, they're going to be in the game?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Yeah, I know, right?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
That's so shocking.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
That was playing in the background.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And while I'm watching this trailer, all I can hear is my mom in the back of my head, that is so, Rob, that is gross.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
That is a gross game.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Because, like, you know, it's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
So we're watching, and it looks like the x-ray attacks are back, but it doesn't, like, fade to black now.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
You kind of see that in real time.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And that whole little thing where, like, he frickin' decapitated Sub-Zero at the end or something and put the spear through his head, like, it was very, very explicit.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And I was like, even I was like, that is, that is gross, Ed, Ed Boon, that is gross.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Well, the whole thing was like CG, but I did, if it's assuming, I'm assuming that it's going to be based off of what the actual gameplay is like.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000
So, if that's the case, it looks like they have the environment attacks that they had in Injustice, which is kind of cool.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:13.000
And then, what was I going to say, I don't know, I don't like the whole CG trailer thing, and I really didn't like the music choice for that trailer.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
It was just very off-putting.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
What did you want, techno? You want the old mortal combat?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Yes! Yes, that's exactly what I wanted.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Come on, I mean, dude, you had a perfectly good theme song, you don't need to change it up.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Just, I mean, if you want to go cliche with it, you can have a little bit of, you know, a little bit of bass, you know, have a drop in there or something like that.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:43.000
But have it be the fucking original, well, the original movie theme. Was it the movie or the game theme? It wasn't the game theme.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
No, it was like made for the movie.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Anyhow, yeah, and Act F says, I don't think the trailer music should be any indication of the music in the game. I agree with that, it never is.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:01.000
But no, no, it is, because it says, you know, that's the artist, and it was a special song by that artist in the game. So that song is in the game.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Wow, really? Interesting. I wonder if they're going like EA soundtrack style with it or something. Warner Brothers does have a record label.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I suppose.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Be interesting.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
But they really need the original one. Or just mix it up, you know?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Tigerclaw agrees with you in our chatroom, saying they could have done something like a dubstep of the original MK Techno song.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Mortal Kombat!

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Yeah, I would like that. I would admire that.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.000
WhatupG says that Ed Boon says, waiting to see Scorpion's second fatality. Oh god, I can only imagine.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Alan Alchemy in our chatroom says, I wouldn't mind a proper sequel to the reboot from two years ago. It was really good in the story narrative from there.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:58.000
The story only covered Mortal Kombat 3 and a little bit of 4. I'm not sure, but Mortal Kombat 4 is kind of where I think a lot of people felt the series started to kind of decline a little bit.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So I'm kind of curious as to how they'd want to retell some of that. Although, I would like Tanya to come back. I like playing as her in Mortal Kombat 4.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Rumor that's brewing right now is that you're going to have variations of the same character. So you'll have three Scorpions.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And it's not talking like Cyber Skorpion and Scorpion. It's just like you'll have these distinctive little changes within the characters.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
They just have to rip off Mario Kart, don't they?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Custom Karts that your Mortal Kombat characters ride in.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Village Idiot's Matt in our chat says, are we really going to panic about the music? The video is fucking sweet.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I like music in a video game, don't get me wrong, but I don't think that's the only song that's going to be in the game.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And even if I maybe didn't like it personally, at the end of the day, I could always mute it and play my own thing.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Do the consoles let you do custom soundtracks anymore? Actually, come to think of it, I don't remember if the new ones let you do that.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000
They're just like, hey, hey you guys, I know you like the on off switch, we just added that in.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Well I guess it shows you how often I actually use that feature, so maybe I shouldn't be complaining about it.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Alright, anyhow, let us take a trip back. We're going to go back in time a little bit.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:20.000
We're going to go back in time to when you couldn't have a full CD soundtrack in your video games, you couldn't do that.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Yes you could.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
You had bleeps and bloops and you liked it.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Oh, is this game a little newer where you could have a CD?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.000
No it's not, but back in the day, even, you know, 20 years ago we had CDs.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I suppose with your 10 year rule we did have the whole Symphony of the Nights over 10 years old, right?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Well, even 20 years ago we still had CD music.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Fair enough, but I know, see I get prepped on what game you've picked and I know this is a bleep bloop game.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I was six years old, Rob. Six.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Six years old, alright.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
You probably couldn't see over the edge of the cabinet.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Which sadly means most of our listeners probably weren't born.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Well, dammit, they need to play it.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Alright.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Because, fuck your age limitations.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
What is the game of the week already, DarkSakura?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Pango!

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I did this one just for you, Rob.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I love Pango, it's one of my favorites.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Dan suggested it too.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Oh yeah?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Yeah.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Pango is a red penguin.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Why he's a fucking red penguin in the Arctic, I have no idea. Antarctic, I mean.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
So anyway, you play on an overhead maze and you have ice blocks.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
And Pango has to fight the snow bees.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
These green blobby things.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Not the bees, not the bees!

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Snow bees, Rob, snow bees.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And you have to basically eliminate all the snow bees.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000
And steal bonuses and three different diamonds that are dispersed throughout the maze.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
So it's a joystick button game, you know.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.000
You can actually shake the walls to paralyze snow bees and then run over them and get points.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.000
You have 16 levels and they repeat once you reach the 17th.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Basically, when you kill different snow bees on the way, new ones will hatch from eggs that are within some of the ice blocks.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Some of the blocks that have the eggs will flash at the start of the level, but you have to have really good memory to remember that.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
You can get rid of the eggs by crushing the blocks that they're in.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And then like I said, Pango can push a side wall that can vibrate and stun a snow bee and then they get 100 points for walking over them.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
When all the snow bees are gone, you go on to the next level.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
You have diamond blocks that are unbreakable.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And if they are collected in a horizontal or vertical line, then you get an extra 10,000 points if they are aligned without being next to a wall.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And 5,000 if they are against a wall.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
They also, by aligning them, will temporarily stun all snow bees.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
After 60 seconds, go by without any deaths.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:11.000
The game goes into sudden death, where the music tempo and the snow bees get faster and basically the snow bee gets to live and you have to start over.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Lather, rinse, repeat.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Yeah.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:26.000
There is an easter egg that in the attract mode, if you push two joysticks up and press two action buttons and one button of start game, it will show the credits for the game.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And then the game will reset.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
You can actually stop the waiting by pressing the start one button.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
So yeah, you get different points for killing different things.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And it has intermissions.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000
It has six intermissions every even numbered round.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:50.000
They have six penguins that are doing dancing or marching around or shaking their booty in one of them.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
The third one, the penguins stop and salute.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
The fourth one, the penguins face the player and then exit the screen in a line, kind of like the aliens in Space Invaders.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
The fifth one, Pango is revealed to be playing a cocktail table by himself.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And in the sixth version, Pango appears from behind the cocktail table playing peekaboo.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And then it repeats.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:18.000
So, there were different versions of Pango and some of them had different music.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Now, this very first one here used popcorn as the theme music.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And it took a little while to draw the maze at the start of the game.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
The second one had original music and faster maze drawing.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
So, of course, the second version was also harder.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000
So you had Pango, which is Pango's set one revision seed that played popcorn.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000
And then Pango 2, Pango 2U, Pango 3U, and Pango 4.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Pango 4 being the fastest and hardest.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
It was fast and hard.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
So there's been many, many versions.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
We've had versions on the Atari 2600, 5200, which I have a 5200 version,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, and the Game Gear.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Then Bondi Electronics did two Sega license handhelds of Pango.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
One was an LCD pocket game, the other one was a tabletop version.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
There was Peppenga Pango that came out on the Sega Master Drive in Japan,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
which I need to have this now.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And then there were some clones.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
There was Penge for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And Capcom did one called Don't Pool, which was part of Three Wonders,

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
which I think I've reviewed Three Wonders before, that was a Pango clone.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Hijimaru is really similar to this, too.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Hijimaru.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Sorry, Hijimaru is really similar to this.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Yeah.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
There were other remakes that came out.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
There was an 8-player version, too, in 2010.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:55.000
It was on location test at a Sega Shinjuku Nishiguchi that was there in 2012.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
May 2012.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Then Club Sega Akihabara Shinkan did another one in July

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
that was a four-game compilation that was called Gensin Love Plus Pango.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And so then there were just all kinds of different other versions.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:17.000
And then that compilation one came out on the Xbox 360 as Gensin Love Plus Pango.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:25.000
As far as the highest Pango score, according to Twin Galaxies, which whoop-de-shit,

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Rodney Day of Canberra, Australia, has the world record of Pango

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:38.000
with 1,110,370 points since August 13, 1983, and no one has broken it since.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Also, Pango makes a cameo appearance in Up and Down.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
If a player manages to pass the first four rounds in less than a minute each,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:53.000
he will appear in the water of round five riding a surfboard that Pango will.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
You know, I played a game back when I was super young

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000
that was an awful lot like this but had slightly different mechanics.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
It was an old, old, old DOS game, predominantly black and white.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It was called Pango, P-A-N-G-O.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Its theme was also popcorn.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.000
You had a shooting mechanic and it also had a gravity mechanic,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
so if you built up to a boulder it would come down and squash the enemy,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
which, hell, if I can even remember what the enemies were.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But this is striking a lot of familiar feelings for a game

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
that I haven't played in literally two decades.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Oh, my God, Rob, if you still have it, you totally need to play the raver's choice.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Volume four from DDR.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
That's actually one of the many reasons why we all learn about popcorn in our youth

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
because it was just everywhere.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
It was, you know, the traditional...

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Which I believe was my first eight.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I don't even remember how hard that game was.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000
You heard Dark Sakura talking there about how many freaking clones and stuff there were,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
so it doesn't surprise me at all that whatever computer you were playing on

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
probably had this, you know?

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
It was an old-school straight-up PC.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I'll call it a bootleg because it wasn't a direct copy.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Like I said, the character was a car, not a penguin.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I don't remember what the enemies were, but I'm pretty sure they weren't living things,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
traditionally living things.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
But, yeah, it was a great game.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I'm not entirely sure how I missed Pingo.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
All right. Is that it then?

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Your classic game of the week, courtesy of Sega.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Pingo pen.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Although I think that the name Pupunga Pen is actually pretty funny.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Watching the guy play that game kind of hurt me a little bit

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
because he wasn't crushing the ice blocks that had the eggs in them.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
No, I had one that was better than this guy.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
It was really good.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000
But at the second round, the music was replaced with a remake,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
with like an OC remix and then another one.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I was like, nah, I want the music.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
We need authenticity here.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.000
If you look up Pango playthrough or something, you'll find the really good one first.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Surprising that with all the Sega circle jerk we see,

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
we don't usually see this game show up with all their remakes.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Although I want to say it did show up in that Sonic collection.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Did it show you the version that the one they had at Pasquale's finally died?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I think we beat it into submission.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
That was the only place that I knew of in town that still had a working Pango.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Rest in peace.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
All right, we're going to take a break, guys.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come on this, the eve of E3 2014,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
including in our next segment, List List.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
We haven't done a List List since last year.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
We did one at the end of the year for our 2014 predictions.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
It's about time.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So yeah, it's high time we bring some OLR games back.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
The prequel show is perfect for that.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.000
If you have started listening to OLR this year, you've never heard an OLR game.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I'm sorry.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I know, I'm sorry.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I'm very sorry if you just started listening to this game.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
You got 500 episodes to catch up on.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Get to it.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
All right, we're going to take a break.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
When we come back, plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Don't go anywhere.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
We will be right back.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, June the 8th on the eve of E3.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Now, I imagine there's got to be some of you guys that are going to be listening to this at work,

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
you know, later in the week or whatever.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I don't know if our Monday crowd will still be listening because, you know,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
the press conference is going on, but it'll be really funny that there'll be all this news out there

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
and you'll get to see what was right and what was wrong.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
It's always funny to kind of take a look back.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.000
One of those being wrong, of course, that, you know, The Last Guardian's not canceled.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Well, actually, it just came in.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Somebody had sent me this.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I'm sorry.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I forgot who sent me this tweet about this.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Oh, actually, I think this went to the Twitter.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Oh, for OLR, Redertainment just sent this.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000
IGN actually issued an official apology for that article in the first place.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Steve Butts, who is, I guess, that's his name, who I guess is the editor-in-chief over at IGN,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
basically said, I made the call to post this.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I had credible information.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Obviously, the Twitter post makes that.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
It was an error.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And basically, we retract the story and kind of went into this whole no one care about how it happened.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
So there it is.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
So IGN did officially apologize for that.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
So we'll see.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I guess if it was Polygon making that mistake,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
they would be filming a documentary about how they made that mistake.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And then they would be engaging in Twitter spats with people about how they're right.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
We'll talk about a little bit of that later.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
and quickly talk about a few other things going on in the game industry before E3.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Although I have to ask, Dark Sakura, before the show tonight,

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
you brought me like a big bag of, it was British candy, right?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
From our friend Robert in England.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
All right.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Well, thanks, Robert, for the candy.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
You're getting me on a sugar high here before our list list.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
He's done a bunch of stuff.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
A lot of it I've been trying to share the wealth,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
and I had it ready to bring the week we didn't do a show.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And then I forgot it last week.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
You know what I'm hooked on that I need to get me some of is HP sauce.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
You can get it easily.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
They sell it at Safeway.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I know.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
But I need to get me some of that.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
You know what's better than HP sauce?

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
How's the Safeway today?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Daddy's sauce.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
It actually is the brand is Daddy's, not Daddy's sauce.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I'll get both.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
All right.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
There it is.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Go get it at Touch of Britain in North Highlands.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Trust me.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And then have food there.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
SSG100Matt says,

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Hoard House always gets me into trouble whenever I listen via podcast.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
You're welcome.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
SSG100Matt also says they're apologizing, IGN,

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
because they don't want to get kicked out of Nintendo's after party at E3.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Wouldn't that be Sony's, though?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
God, you're so mature.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Alan Alchemy says,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Steve Butts of IGN went on record as saying,

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Grow up.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I read that differently, Rob.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Or that is,

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Grow the F up.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Oh, my God.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I was just trying to stick with the syllables you put in there.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Let's move on with some rapid fire news.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Now what we need now is some sort of, you know,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
mashed up song with a girl's butts about their whole mistake.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
You know, called Steve Butts.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Witcher 3, the Wild Hunt, finally got its reveal this week.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Or at least an extended reveal, which they announced the release date.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
February 24, 2015.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
It'll be coming out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
In both retail and digital formats.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Of course, on GOG Games.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Or GOG.com, obviously.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I'll be there.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And then, this is kind of exciting.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Crytek announced, or I should say Deep Silver announced,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
that Crytek's going to be doing the sequel to Homefront.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000
So, Homefront The Revolution, that's going to be coming out sometime in 2015.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Also on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And I'm pretty excited about that.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Because the original game looked pretty cool.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And be curious to check out the new one when it comes out, eventually.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
So I'm sure that's going to be something we'll see at probably E3.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Probably. Probably.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Jason?

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Alright.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000
The news we have all been waiting for.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Harmonix has finally given a release date to...

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Disney Fantasia Music Evolved.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Some people are looking forward to it.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
It looks like it...

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Harmonix's touch on things is very much in line with mine.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
They have officially dated Disney Fantasia Music Evolved for October 21st

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
to be released on the Xbox One and Xbox 360.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Disney Fantasia explores the vivid imagery and music of Disney's symphonic film,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
but with a modern spin and a conductor-like wave of the arm in front of Kinect.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
So the much...

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
And they've actually...

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I remember...

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I don't know if we've reported on it every time,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
but I think it's been a long time.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
And they've actually...

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I remember...

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I don't know if we've reported on it every single time,

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
but every single time that Harmonix has a reveal for this game,

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
more and more of the soundtrack is revealed.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And it's always seemed a little weird to me because they're always very modern,

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
and I wouldn't even call them poppy songs in most cases,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
but at any rate, they have good songs going into it.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And the reveal that accompanied this announcement on this turn was a new level,

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
the neighborhood, a new world, rather, the neighborhood,

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
a surreal glimpse of 1980s New York,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000
with a pastel sky bursting behind skyscrapers.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:34.000
And the songs announced are M.I.A.'s Galang and the Who's the Real Me.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
For all of you importing fans out there, Retro Game Challenge 2,

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
the fan translation of Game Center CX2, has arrived.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Done by Aaron in Japan, as everybody knows him as.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Well, not everybody, but people who maybe started with Bomani and stuff

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
probably remember that name, yeah.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
The DDR crew, as it were, knows Aaron,

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
the last name that I have never been able to pronounce successfully,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
as Aaron in Japan.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And not just text, but graphics as well,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.000
so that any Japanese symbols, symbology that isn't just straight-up words

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
have been translated into English.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Go forth and enjoy it, because these games are quite fun.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
This is great that the community went to get this game translated,

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000
a real missed opportunity to not put this game out.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I mean, I understand maybe the first one didn't do so hot,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
but it was such a cute little game,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
and people, I think, really missed out by not checking it out,

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
so I'm glad people get to...

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I wish people could have got to do this the legal way,

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
but desperate times.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Like everything else, well, they brought it, they did bring it here,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
so I'm pretty sure that licensing has a huge amount to do with this,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000
because I would imagine that the TV station that airs Game Center CX

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
has large claims to it, and probably has high licensing, likeness,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
something-something rights to it.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Yeah, but...

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
The legalities, whatever.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000
But it's here, and everybody can import and hack their legitimate copy

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
to play it in English.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Sure.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
All right, lastly, Dark Soccer for Rapid Fire News.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Well, there is some news about an actual TV series, kind of TV series,

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000
more like a short interactive TV show that's going to be on Xbox One,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Xbox 360, and PS4 in November.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
It's called Rabbids Invasion, the interactive TV show,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000
so it's a CG animated show that's based off of the Rabbids,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
and it will require a Kinect or PlayStation camera,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.000
and lets you do little mini-games like matching poses or egg fights

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000
or stuff like that, and it's up to four players at a time,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
so that's kind of neat.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000
And there is something I'm kind of excited about.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
It's Marathon Gamers, if anyone hasn't heard of them.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
It's a group of friends who have a small charity organization

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
who will be doing the summer marathon of friendship to raise money

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
The group actually is from Huntsville, Alabama,

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
so that's why I kind of have a big interest in them.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:10.000
It's a 48-hour marathon gaming session on June 20th on Stitch.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
So they're going to be playing Left 4 Dead, Mario Party,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
all kinds of games, and you can contribute.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It will start June 20th at 2 p.m. Central Time,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:29.000
and you can join it on twitch.tv forward slash marathon underscore gamers,

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
or you can go to marathongamers.org and check them out.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Please, please, please, please, please help them out

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
because they're doing a great thing.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
All right, excellent.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
I like giving shout-outs to the charity streams,

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
lots of good stuff out there.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And they're from my home state.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
All right, let's get into, we've been hyping this up all night.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:56.000
It is time for us to bring back the segment known as Listless.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
All right, here is the way that Listless works.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
It's been a little while since we've played this game,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
but I'm going to explain the rules one more time here, okay?

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000
We are going to put together as a highly scientific method

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
for us to determine the definitive list.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Once we have put this together, there is no arguing with it.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
It's done. It's definitive.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
We've compiled it. You voted on it. It's done.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
And yes, you will have a chance to vote on the list

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
and help make this a possibility.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Head on over to live.vognetwork.com if you wish to play.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Those of you that listen on the podcast feed, I'm sorry.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
You can't play for now, but we are looking at in the next year

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
expanding this segment so that you can actually vote during the week as well,

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
but that will be later on.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
So for tonight, just the live chatters getting to participate in Listless,

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000
not Piss Piss, Kajuno, List, List, L-I-S-T-L-E-S-S.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Okay, here's how it works.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Tonight we're going to have five people in studio,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
and we are all going to compile the first list,

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
and we do that by naming our top three.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000
So we'll have five, and we'll take that down to, or we'll take that up to 15.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Then comes round two where we all vote something off the list.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Now remember in the upgraded Listless rules that we did last year for 2.0,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.000
if a host has two answers removed from the list,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
the third one gets immunity.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
That way nobody's list gets completely decimated.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
So we will each eliminate one answer.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And also in case of a tie.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
It wasn't there in case of a tie.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
The host's choice that wasn't picked gets the break of time.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Oh, you're right. I am breaking the engagement.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
You're throwing it way back. That's all right.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
It's been a little while. It's been a little while. All right.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000
So anyway, so with, and they're talking in chat that it sounds like List List,

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
like a like like or something in Zelda.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
No, that's the joke.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
That's the joke, you guys. That's the joke.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
All right. Anyway, Crystal Waters, I love you,

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
but I'm going to take your volume down there in a minute.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Let's see. What else do I need to say about this?

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000
So we're up to 10, and then you guys over at live.vognetwork.com

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
are going to get to vote for your top two answers.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
You're just going to click them.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
It's going to pop up right there on the screen.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
You click your number one, you click your number two,

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
and then you submit, and there it is.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
We compile the votes and read the answers here a little later on the show.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
So let's get to it.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
All right, Crystal, you can come back now that we're ready to actually start making this list.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
So let's put it up on the board.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.000
The question tonight, what are we most looking forward to at E3 2014?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
We're going to put that up on the board,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000
and those of you over at live.vognetwork.com will be able to see that pop up on your screen.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000
While we wait for that to pop up, we're going to introduce who's playing along tonight.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Of course, Techmaster Loki.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And Loki, celebrities on game shows always are promoting something.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
So what are you promoting tonight?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I'm promoting... I don't know.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Promoting apathy.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
All right. Apathy, people of America.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Loki's promoting apathy. All right, fair enough.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Dark Sakura, of course, is here tonight participating as well.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Dark Sakura, what are you promoting tonight?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Flatulence.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Flatulence.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
All right, there it is. All right.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Dark Sakura's here as well.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I am here as well, and in good Rob Roberts fashion, I'm promoting myself.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E if you wish to follow me on the Twittersies.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Also joining us tonight in studio is Jason.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I'm promoting the Melancholy Awareness Association of America.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Oh, are you a sad panda?

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
For their sake, I am.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
All right. And last but not least, joining us in studio, speaking of apathy.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Oh my God. All right, say hello, everybody, to Shane.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Hello.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Hi, Shane.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Hi.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
This is why I have you take Jamie's mic. I can actually hear you on that one. How are you?

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I'm fine.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
And what will you be promoting tonight?

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I'm going to promote the charity Pediatric AIDS. We give babies AIDS.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
What? That's not even funny.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I thought it was.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
No, it's not.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Look at these people in here. They're laughing.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
It's awkward laughter because you're weird.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
He means AIDS and, you know, assistance.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Yeah.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Butlers.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Duh. We give them puppies and walkers.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
What were you thinking?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
A 70s diet drug, clearly.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
All right.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
What?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Let's get into building the list. We're going to create the definitive list with the top answers.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Let's start with Jason. What is your first answer for the board?

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Of course you had to start with me. I've been wrenching this last five minutes trying to figure out what the hell I'm going to say.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Well, I need at least another.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Oh, hopefully we steal all five of those. So you have this agony.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:42.000
You all can give your answers along in chat as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.000
If you want to help out the hosts by putting some answers up on the board, live.vognetwork.com.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Because we have to pay this one forward, I will go with, despite the fact that they have no official show floor present, Val will bust through the arena, interrupting somebody else's keynote, Kanye style, and Half-Life 3. Go get it.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Sorry for the awkward silence. I'm writing it down. Hold on.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000
All right. There it is. So, Val, will Kanye interrupt a keynote with Half-Life 3?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000
So you are basically just totally swiping Bobby's winning answer from last year.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Ah, that's not cool, man.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Is what you're doing.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Yeah, well, like I said, I'm paying it forward. I'm paying it forward, dammit.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
We're going to start that way.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Paying it forward, plagiarizing, saving.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Fine.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
That's what I'm going to say from now on. Oh, I can't plagiarize that. I've been paid forward.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:40.000
We'll put it up on the board and see how that goes. Shane, your number three answer.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Okay, so I totally wrote down five things, so I thought it was five for some reason, so I will say my number three is,

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Microsoft realizes we need a new Alan Wake fix and puts a show in production for their dumb Xbox One TV show initiative.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Kind of like Twin Peaks, because that's what that game really is.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
So an Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One, essentially.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000
All right, let's put that up on the board. That's a nice, non-offensive good answer from you. I like that.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
All right, Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
All right, let's go now over to Dark Sakura.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Dark Sakura, the lovely Dark Sakura, with her number three answer.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I'll get a Mass Effect sticker. I'll bring it back for you.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Is your mic off, Dark Sakura? I don't know why.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Yeah, Shane turned my mic off. Thank you, Shane.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.000
All right, so Dark Sakura's answer was Mass Effect anything.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000
But you know what I would really like? An HD remix of the first three.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
There's those rumors going on up there.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Without having to use mods like I've already done. I pretty much already play Mass Effect HD remix, just saying.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Fair enough. All right, Mass Effect anything is up there on the board. There it is.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Let's go over to me and my number three answer.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.000
My number three answer tonight is the Microsoft Game Shows Return.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I'm talking one versus a hundred and that stuff. Come on.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
And you say mine was a gimme. Come on, Rob.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Whatever. This is something you obviously quite want to see. You bring up a lot.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I think every list list I talk about how I want to frickin' that thing to happen there.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
What's that every episode?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000
All right, Microsoft's Game Shows Return. Putting that up on the board.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000
All right, Loki, last but not least with your number three answer tonight.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Well, you know, I could say something serious, but what fun would that be?

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:44.000
So like I came up with the chatroom earlier, it's going to be Red Dead Redemption Cross Midnight Club.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
It's drift horses with neons.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Hey, I'd play that a couple rounds at least.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Red Dead Redemption Cross Midnight Club. So drift racing with horses.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Old west drift racing.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Sort of like Wendy Okupa and that little carousel cart or whatever that is.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Except these horses are going to have thumpin' bass and undercarriage lights and all that fun stuff.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000
All right, fine. There it is. It's up on the board there. Red Dead Redemption Cross.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Vin Diesel's going to have a cameo because why not?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Why not? Why not? All right, let's go to the number two answers.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Jason. Yeah, everybody do it. Where have you been, Shane?

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I started with all the agonizing. Fair answer.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Jason.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
No, there is actually one legitimate one.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
All right.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
At least one. I still have to think of a good number one.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Google's acquisition of Twitch confirmed with bonuses.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000
With unforeseen things that were not announced in the deal.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.000
The reason why all this is taking place and not just, hey Twitch, move into our data centers.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Yes, Google, the acquisition as was rumored, what, two weeks ago and then just disappeared.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Finalizes with new features to come as a part of it.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000
All right, so I'm going to throw that up on the board as Google Twitch acquisition confirmed with perks.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Exactly correct.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
All right, there it is. You talk about safe answers. All right.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I actually don't think, in reality, I actually don't think that's a very safe answer.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
All right, well, we'll see. All right.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Going to Shane's number two answer. Shane, what is your number two answer?

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:26.000
My number two answer is giving the fans what they want. Konami announces they're done ruining Silent Hill.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And that's it. That's it. There's no new game. There's no actual game. It's just an apology.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
You know what? We're done.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Yeah, they're not going to make any more.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
All right, they're going to take it out back and shoot it.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Yes.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000
All right, sounds good. They're just going to let Pyramid Head cut it up. Here it is.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.000
But we are proud to announce Silent Hill Lords of Sirens, the spinoff game.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Straight up action.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Konami announces they are done ruining Silent Hill. There it is, Shane's number two answer.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Dark Sakura, your number two answer, please.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
X Tango returns.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Oh, I was in one of the Tango halls.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Ah, that's amazing. X Tango, one of the games we saw many years ago that never happened. Nothing ever happened with it.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
It was fun.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
It was a music game where you would put in commands in the characters of Tango.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
It was great.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:25.000
It was great, yeah. Whatever happened to it? The internet. You know what? If that game was around today, it would have had a Kickstarter.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Let's kickstart X Tango.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
All right.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I will do this shit. You watch.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
And then it will sell a million copies.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Time for my number two answer. My number two answer. Okay, I'm going to go like really crazy talk with this.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
This is fanboy wank. Everybody get your splash zone.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
F zero and just finish it raw.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Nope, nope, nope, nope. Worse.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Get your plastic tarp over your head for the splash zone wank that's about to happen. You ready?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
All right, so here's the thing.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
The Wii U is going to go online in a big way.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000
And I'm not just talking about like the Dragon Quest X game we've been waiting for.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:09.000
The reason why Phantasy Star Online 2 has been delayed? Wii U exclusive.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Oh, the people in the room seem receptive to that. I thought you'd all boomy for that answer.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Boo.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I mean, why are you boomy?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
It's wank, but let's not say that's a bad idea.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.000
That'll never happen. Although, I mean, I guess if they have any chance of an MMO coming to them, you know, coming from Sega.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Because for some reason Sega loves Nintendo, ironically.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Why not? Sega and Nintendo are kind of in bed together. It would make a lot of sense.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
If Nintendo really wants to come all out there and be like, bam, we're online, that would do it.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:49.000
And then Microsoft would be like, bam, we're online with motherfucking Destiny, which is way better than that fucking game.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Not for everybody, though. Is Anna Banana-Chan in Destiny? I don't think so.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Nobody's going to understand that joke.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
It could be, if you name your character.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Shane understood it. Alright. Loki, last but not least, your number two answer.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Okay. Sticking with my completely serious answers here.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I would love to see just an unusual announcement, coming from any of the big three, I guess, of President Cat 2, Prepare for Kittenfall.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Oh, that's good. President Cat 2, Prepare for Kittenfall.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:34.000
What's the general synopsis of President Cat 2?

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:41.000
It's just, you know, mech suits and kittens and everything that the internet loves.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000
All wrapped in the one nice package. It's got the casual angle, it's got the hardcore angle.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
It's got cats.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Alright. Here is the board so far.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Valve, will Kanye interrupt a keynote with Half-Life 3?

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One, Mass Effect anything, Microsoft's game shows return, Red Dead Redemption cross Midnight Club,

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Google's Twitch acquisition confirmed with perks, Konami announces they are done ruining Silent Hill,

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:13.000
X-Tango returns, Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive, and President Cat 2, Prepare for Kittenfall.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Man, the elimination round tonight is going to suck.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.000
These are all really good answers, but we still have one more set of answers to put up on the board.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Jason, what is your number one answer?

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:30.000
So far as I know, I don't recall if this developer has a booth and I don't know that I've heard any specific news about it.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 on the show floor.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 in a tiny tent.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 in a tiny tent next to the Capcom booth.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
And that's Jason's list.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Shane, what is your number one answer?

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.000
It's a little long. You can condense it easily though, I'm sure.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Sony and Take-Two announce a partnership to bring the PS4 version of BioShock Infinite to Project Morpheus for amazingly fun virtual rail swinging.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Sony plus Take-Two, 3D BioShock Infinite.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
BioShockulous.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
BioShockulous.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
But it's not Oculus.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
BioMorphius.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Alright, Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite. That's probably the best way I can condense that.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Any particular reason you went that route, Shane?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:35.000
I really liked that game and I didn't want to be too predictable tonight.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:40.000
So I did not talk about Elite Beat Agents, Pokemon, Mass Effect. I did talk about Silent Hill, but I killed it.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Alright, Dark Sakura. That is Shane's list. There it is. Dark Sakura, what is your number one answer?

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
A game that features an all-female cast not written with any misogynistic tendencies in mind.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
As in, no hyper-sexualization, they're written intelligently, and don't need no man.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
How the fuck am I supposed to condense that?

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Let's see, I'm going to put all female cast and credit developed video games.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.000
No, because I have seen men that write women well. Brian Michael Bendis writes a very good woman, for example.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Murphy Brown the video game.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
No. That's bullshit.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Non-sexist all-woman game. There we go.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:24.000
What was that Fox sitcom back in the late 90s?

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.000
I don't know. I don't watch that damn show.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000
That's... I would not call that non-misogyny.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Alright, all-female game with zero misogyny. That was the best way I could condense that there.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Yes.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
So I'm going to put that up on Dark Sakura's board.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And if anyone wants a good example, look at Claymore.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Alright.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000
All women, no romantic subplot. None of that shit.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Alright.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
It's not a chick flick show.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
There it is, that's Dark Sakura's list.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:04.000
My number one answer is that... what will happen is that finally, after all these years, it will be a Half-Life 3 teaser shown at E3.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
But then halfway through the teaser, GLaDOS interrupts it and says,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Oh, were you getting your hopes up? And the 3 shifts into a Portal 3 logo.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000
So GLaDOS...

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Oh, that would piss everybody off.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:24.000
GLaDOS, Valve trolls Valve is my answer, basically. Valve trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
How in the hell are you going to summarize that?

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000
GLaDOS turns Half-Life 3 into Portal 3, I guess.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
That would be fantastic.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I just put Valve trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer, and you guys already heard the rest of the answer there.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Alright, let's go to Loki, and dare I ask it, the last one on the list, your number one answer.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:52.000
My number one answer, I mean, I don't know, I can't think of anything really great and just cheesy, so I guess I will be somewhat serious.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Even though they haven't made the movies in a long-ass time, and the games weren't that great, I would love to see Rockstar do a new Matrix game.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Because the version of, was it, their game, The Warriors, was one of the best movie adaptation games I've ever seen.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:22.000
And The Warriors, I mean, that game came out way after the movie, obviously, so I would love to see him go back and take over that franchise.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000
So turn a mediocre franchise into a really good one through a video game?

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Yeah.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Alright, awesome.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I got it.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
What?

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Goonies.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Oh, wait.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Too late, too late.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Alright, there we go, Rockstar does a new Matrix game, so there it is, here are the 15 answers up on the board.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Valve, will Kanye interrupt a keynote with Half-Life 3?

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Google Twitch acquisition confirmed with perks.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Alan Wake TV show on Xbox One.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Konami announces they are done ruining Silent Hill.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Mass Effect anything.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Extango returns.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
All female game with zero misogyny.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Microsoft's game shows returns.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Valve trolls Valve with Portal 3 trailer.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Red Dead Redemption cross Midnight Club.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.000
President Cat 2 prepare for Kittenfall and Rockstar does a new Matrix game.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
This is an awfully big list.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
It's time to trim it up a little bit.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000
This is going to be a very tough round tonight, but it is all part of the process, folks.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:25.000
And if you want to egg on the host, you should be shouting in chat right now which of these is not worthy of the list.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Jason, you get the lovely distinction of going first, but that means you can take any one of these out that you want.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Jason, which of these is not worthy of the list?

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Oh, man.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:41.000
You know, the jokes don't quite reach that bar as obvious dumb to get rid of.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
And all the serious ones are really, really good.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
This is a really hard decision.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:52.000
But I'm going to say just for plausibility and obvious and gimme, Mass Effect anything.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Oh, alright.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Only because it's not a stretch. It's the only reason.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Alright. You want to keep us living in Wackyville.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Alright, fair enough.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:09.000
So in Jason's quest to keep us living in Wackyville, sorry DarkSakura, but you know you're going to get Mass Effect anything anyway.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Alright, it is stricken from the list.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Shane, which of these answers is not worthy of the list?

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I'm sorry, Jason, but it's just past its reference time.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
The Kanye one with the valve thing.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
That's years old.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Are you only distributed because of the Kanye reference?

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Yes.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
No, it wasn't his edition.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Never mind. Okay.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Well, plus we're not going to repeat last year, Jason.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
It's time for a new year, so I understand.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
If he didn't eliminate that one-

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
It's not over until it happens.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Alright, so there it is. It's not worthy of the list.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
It has been stricken from the list.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
So DarkSakura has the distinction of going next.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
I'm actually going to take off the Alan Wake TV show.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Oh, an Alan Wake TV show. Why that?

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Because I don't really like Alan Wake.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Alright, it is stricken from the list.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Sorry, Shane, but it wasn't going to happen anyway.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Alright, it is stricken from the list.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I like how these have been all tier three.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Yeah, it's been all tier-

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Well, let's see what happens because I'm going next.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
It's my turn to eliminate an answer.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Oh, God, this is hard.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I'm going to break the trend here and I'm going to make-

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I'm unfortunately going to take a second answer off of somebody's list.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
And Jason, it's going to be you.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
I'm going to take Google's Twitch acquisition off the list.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
How? I'm offended.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I just-

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000
It's not really game news.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
You're completely safe.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
It's a little safe.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
It's kind of the same reason you took the Mass Effect thing off.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
It's a little safe and I just-

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I don't know, it's a little bit like-

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
With bonuses.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
They're going to say something that's just really fantastic.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
I know, I know.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Oh, they're not an independent company.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000
But we're all running off the assumption it's already happening.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
That's my problem with it.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000
So I'm sorry, Jason.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
I'm not supposed to have predicted that it won't come to pass.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000
All right.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:08.000
But the good news, Jason, this means Mighty No. 9 playable at E3 has immunity.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000
So there it is.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:14.000
So Loki, that out of the picture, which of the rest of these is not worthy?

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Loki's whole list is going to survive.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.000
I can't believe this.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Well, just because I don't know what else they possibly could show at E3 because they only have what-

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:31.000
I mean, granted, it is a pretty decent game, Metal Gear Solid 5 and Pro Evo, I guess, 2015.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
But I don't think that Konami is done ruining Silent Hill.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Considering that there's all these popular horror games coming out, especially in the indie scene,

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000
they're going to ruin that game until it stops making them any money.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Hasn't they already done that?

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Oh, I think that there's going to be a next-gen Silent Hill game.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
I bet there will be.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000
So there will be.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Look at how-

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
I feel like there'll be a third movie.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I want to point out, look at how we treat our guests on this show.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Look at Shane's list, also down to one answer with Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Dark Soccer gets through with PAR with only one of our answers getting eliminated.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Myself and Loki unscathed.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Imagine that.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000
How the hell did that happen?

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Well, it's like they said, orange is the new black.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
You guys take care of yourselves.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Of your own.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I will say this.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
I was very tempted to go with the Red Dead Redemption cross midnight club,

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
but it seemed like too many chatters were really excited about that answer,

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
so I didn't eliminate that.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Pure pressure.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
All right, fine.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
All right, pure pressure.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
All right, so here it is.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000
With those five eliminated from the list, we are left with the following.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
X-Tango returns.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Morpheus version of BioShock Infinite.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.000
All-female game with zero misogyny.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I almost took that off the list too,

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000
only because I'm sorry, Dark Soccer.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
It's not going to happen this year.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000
It's sad, but it's one of those things that's like it's a sad state of affairs,

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000
but let me put it this way.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I'm looking on Twitter.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Some people are at E3 and hanging out and all this stuff, and it's going on,

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
and somebody has already overheard the phrase fucking F-A-G-G-O-T

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
already out on the show floor walking around there,

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
and I'm kind of like and these are the same people

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
that then go post on the comment section of the websites.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Why do we need a gamer X, or why do we need a safe space,

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
or why do we need this social movement, or what?

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000
But it's not that I disagree with that answer.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
It's that sadly, I just don't think it's going to happen.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Or as I like to say, not all men, but too damn many.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
All right, but it is still on the list, so we'll see.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Also, Microsoft's game shows return.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Phantasy Star Online 2 Wii U exclusive.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Valve Trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Red Dead Redemption cross Midnight Club.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000
President Cat 2 prepare for Kittenfall.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
And Rockstar does a new Matrix game.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.000
So this is now in your hands, folks that are participating

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:55.000
over at the Voice Geeks Network, live.vaganetwork.com.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I'm updating the list right now, and in just a couple seconds here,

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
you will be able to answer.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000
So you're going to click on your number one and your number two choices there

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.000
as soon as the message pops up at the bottom of the screen, and there it is.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000
You can click your number one and your number two and click the answer button.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:16.000
We will compile the list and read the answers a little later on in the show.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Looking at our chat room over at live.vaganetwork.com.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Some other answers that didn't make it.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000
VidPower says, funny slash serious answer.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Rare working on some non-banjo-kazooie 3 game.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Let's see.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Kaijudo, though it does say Grand Theft Auto 6 with a female lead.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Could be interesting.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
So there you go.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Your turn to vote over at live.vaganetwork.com.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
We will see what the definitive list ends up being tonight.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
You know, to be fair, Kaijudo, they actually did have, it wasn't a lead,

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.000
but they had a pretty decent secondary character in Grand Theft Auto 4

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
that was a female.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
She was kind of like a drug boss, so that was kind of cool.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
All right, and Kaijudo in chat also says,

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
can I take them all off the list and start a new one?

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Sure, all you have to do is create your own blog.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
There you go.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
But as far as OLR list goes, nope, you're stuck with that.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
That's part of the scientific process.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
We don't always agree with science, Kaijudo, but we're stuck with it.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
So there you go.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Let's now take this opportunity to go over to the FUGL question of the week.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.000
You take Facebook, you take Google, you slam it together, you get FUGL.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:35.000
We're going to ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities,

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
and we're going to read some of our favorite answers right now on the show.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.000
And tonight's FUGL question of the week is, of course, about E3

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
and in line with what we just did.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Give us one prediction for one of the big press conferences,

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Microsoft EA, Ubi, Sony, or Nintendo.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Try to be a little risky in your prediction,

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:58.000
saying, I think Microsoft will talk about Halo isn't exactly going to impress everyone with your predicting ability.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
This is your last chance to make your big prediction,

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
so you can be the guy or gal, of course, who says,

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I called it, as people love to do on the internet later this week.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Because, you know, they're going to talk about Halo 5,

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
and somebody's going to be like, totally called that.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Totally called Halo 5, because there's always that guy that's like, no shit.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
All right.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Guys, guys, guys.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
It's going to be a new call of duty.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Totally called it.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
All right.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Going to some of the answers over there on Facebook and Google,

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.000
starting with Facebook.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Tiger Claw says, my prediction for Nintendo is going to be,

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000
they reveal a brand new Star Fox for the Wii U,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
fully utilizing the gamepad touch screen, reminiscent of Star Fox Command on the DS.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:42.000
So either that or a new Metroid game on Wii U that's a 2D side scroller.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000
So there you go.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.000
And then likes to insert that same answer about Gabe Newell and Half Life 3

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
that already got eliminated from the list earlier.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
All right.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Let's go to the next answer, which is from Rob H., who says,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000
fingers crossed Rare comes back with a good perfect dark

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000
and an HD remake of Blastcore, free with Blastcore 2 on both 360 and Xbox One.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Oh, God.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.000
He is my new best friend.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Oh, if there was a new Blastcore,

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I would buy whatever system it's on in a heartbeat,

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
which I guess would be the one in this case.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Renee, our friend from Killer Queens from Outer Space,

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
was on episode 13 of that show, so check it out.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Renee says Square Enix announces more updates on Kingdom Hearts 3,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
revealing new worlds from forgotten animated features,

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
such as the Black Cauldron, Song of the South,

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
you're right, Song of the South,

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
and the unforgettable Donald Duck's World War II propaganda cartoon.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Wow.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000
That's a pretty bold answer.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Well, the Black Cauldron is, they at least have Disney pins for that.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Fabrice A. replies on Facebook.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
No, wait, wait, wait.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
It's not something we're saying.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
You know what would be hilarious?

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Is if they had, oh, God, what the hell was that movie?

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Of course, now that I think it,

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I can't remember the name of the franchise,

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
but the Nicolas Cage movie,

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
where he's going and searching for the artifacts and stuff like that.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
National Treasure.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
National Treasure.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Wasn't that a Disney movie?

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Wouldn't that be hilarious to have that as like a world that they go to?

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
A world of Nicolas Cage, absolutely.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Exactly.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
All right, Fabrice A. replies and says,

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Microsoft announces another price drop for Xbox One and Xbox 360.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Sony announces Shenmue 3.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Wait a minute, that's quite flipping the script.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
I always thought it was supposed to be Microsoft that was supposed to have that.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Burr replies and says,

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Sony announces Home 2.0 for PlayStation 4.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I'd be curious to see if they would continue Home.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
You know, it certainly has its fans over on PlayStation 3.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
There's quite a vocal community over there.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
I'm kind of surprised they haven't done something on PlayStation 4 yet.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000
So, curious to see what happens with that.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Fifth Dream replies and says,

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
My predictions are Nintendo announces the long-awaited Pokemon MMO.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Sony gives a release date for Project Morpheus, which arrives with the new VR Home.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Microsoft announces Kinect 3.0, which looks suspiciously like a Power Glove.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000
And Final Fantasy XV gets a surprise release at the end of the week.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Well, that's a little bit of a stretch, but wouldn't it be fun?

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Andy R. replies and says,

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Sega breaks back into the console biz with a new system available next Tuesday.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Would be a very Sega thing to do.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Dark Charger replies,

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Nintendo will finally adopt a subscription model for their classic games.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Thank you, I like that answer.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Rageinator says,

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Gabe Newell will walk on stage with a one last thing line,

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.000
rips open a jacket to reveal a t-shirt with a 3 on it,

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.000
then spikes the microphone, not simply drops it.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Awesome Unicorn says,

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
I really don't care what the announcement is, but I just want someone to pull a Beyonce,

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
and Nintendo has shown a willingness to do that with their lesser titles,

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000
such as the surprise Inazuma 11 release.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Can you imagine the insanity and sheer excitement of an announcement

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000
that Super Smash Bros. for the 3DS will be available on the eShop,

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
following their digital event?

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Again, that's really wishful thinking,

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.000
but I think you hit the nail on the head with the whole surprise,

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.000
under the radar title, anything's possible.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Something like Mario Maker is a prime candidate.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
It's not going to be on the eShop during the event.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000
If anything, I'm guessing at this point since we got a July announcement already

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.000
of the Wii Sports Club thing, it's going to be August.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
And Hitstun lastly on Facebook says,

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Nintendo responds to fan feedback by bringing back Mario Kart 64's Block Fort

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
in Smash Bros. Trolls.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
I like that answer.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And going over to Google Plus and reading some of the answers over there.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Why don't I see the answers over here?

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Hello, Google. Come in, Google.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Where are my answers?

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Oh, there they are. Way down there. Hi.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Let's get to the comments on this one.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Colin M. replies and says,

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Nintendo announces a new minigame collection for the Wii U.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Possible Mario Party U.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Well, Colin, with all due respect, that's a safe answer.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
A minigame collection on the Wii U? You don't say.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
All right, at least he throws a possible title out there.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
We'll see. More Mario possibly.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
ActDeft replies and says,

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Nintendo adds streaming to the Wii U.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Probably not happening, but wouldn't it be awesome?

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
And when Nintendo's new revenue sharing thing for YouTube,

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
it just might happen.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I don't think that box is powerful enough,

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
but you never know. You never know.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.000
It may not do HD, but maybe a virtual console,

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.000
like a lounge where you can watch other people play virtual console games.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
They could do their own thing with it.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
They wouldn't necessarily have to adopt Twitch. Why not?

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.000
They could backport replays, highlights into every other game.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000
If Xbox 360's Game Room technology allowed for the recording

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
of playthroughs of classic video games,

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
they could do it with Nintendo.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:38.000
It would take a clever work around for the lower technology.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Even the 360 was more powerful than the Wii U.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:44.000
It would take the bad letter E for Nintendo.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000
That E word being effort, and they don't do it.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.000
All right, sorry, redertainment last but not least,

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.000
with The Question Knight saying,

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.000
With the recent moves by Microsoft to make a previously premium app available to all

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
without needing a gold subscription,

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Microsoft will need to announce something to make being a paid subscriber to Xbox Live worthwhile.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
That something is what I think Microsoft will announce.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
I don't quite know what that will be,

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.000
but my gut is telling me something involving Comcast, Time Warner, and or DirecTV.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Could you possibly be meaning their own channel?

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Because it seems to be the direction we're heading in right now, but we'll see.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000
All right, that does it for the Google Question of the Week.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio,

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.000
or on Google Plus, google.com slash plus, orange launch radio, all one word.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000
We still have some more gaming news for you all, so let's get to it. Loki.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.000
All right, so let's see, Mario Kart did pretty well.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.000
At launch, it sold over 1 million units, 1.2 million during its debut week,

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:44.000
and making that the fastest selling Wii U game to date.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.000
So, of course, you know, Reggie's pretty excited about that.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:53.000
They said, you know, the early response of Mario Kart 8 demonstrates that the best days for Wii U are still ahead.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:58.000
This year's E3 is just days away, and it will be all about future games for Nintendo platforms.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000
No shit! It's going to be about future games for Nintendo platforms?

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
I thought they were going to be talking about the Xbox!

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.000
That's the dumbest fucking statement he could make, but whatever.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Hooray for Mario Kart 8.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:19.000
By the way, this was the article that may have gotten me into a little bit of trouble on Twitter this week.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:27.000
I might have had a big ass sassy mouth, and I might have written a tweet that my buddy Godfrey over at Gamertag Radio retweeted,

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:33.000
and somebody over at Polygon might have seen it and had an issue with something my sassy ass mouth had to say.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:41.000
And I basically said something to the effect of, you know, well, Mario Kart 8 sells 1.2 million in its first weekend,

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.000
which is what Polygon predicted it would sell in its entire lifespan.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Way to go, games analyst! Thumbs up emoji.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:52.000
And I got a little reply from a guy that works at Polygon.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.000
In fact, I think he's kind of a high-up mucky-mup over there, Ben Kucera.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:00.000
And he basically replied saying, should I bring up the conversation here?

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Well, like I say, my policy on analysts and why I don't really like to talk about analysts on the show,

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
you can't spell analysts without anal.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.000
I just, I'm the, if I'm going to be analyzing stuff, I'm going to do it my own way.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.000
I'm not going to, you know, quote some dude that's got, you know, well, see,

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000
at least this guy has a little bit of experience in the industry,

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.000
not necessarily someone that just crunches numbers all day long.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
So, all right, I'm trying to bring up the conversation I had.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
So here's the tweet that started off.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I put, so, Mario Kart 8 sold in a weekend what Polygon predicted it would sell in a lifetime, right?

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Got to love games analyst, thumbs up.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000
And that got, by the way, seven retweets and ten favorites.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.000
So Ben Kucera replies and says, it still needs to sell over four million more units

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000
or nearly a one-to-one ratio with a tiny Wii U install base to prove the point.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Everyone is happy the game is a hit,

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.000
but it's a long ways from beating the second worst selling title in the series.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:05.000
At least try to understand what you're criticizing before you start the smack talk colon P.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000
And I'm like, oh, it's going to be like, oh, you're going to come at me like that?

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Back rolls? Okay.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000
I'm going to start calling you crazy eyes, I hope you know.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
My sassy mouth might have replied,

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
because I was like, well, he was kind enough to let me know his thoughts,

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
so maybe I should reply in kind.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:28.000
So I wrote back and I said, assuming Wii U install base doesn't grow significantly this holiday.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Admittedly, it's an uphill climb,

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.000
but I think what was overlooked in the original analysis was Wii U adopter makeup.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.000
It's small, yes, but fiercely Nintendo loyal.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000
To say 20% here means 20% here didn't turn out to be accurate,

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
but we will see when and if the install base grows.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.000
And that's when he wrote that tweet that said at least know what you're criticizing.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.000
And I wrote back and I said, here is what I'm criticizing.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
I realized the article's main point was lowest selling,

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.000
but, and I put a little screen cap there of where they showed,

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Mario Kart 8 Wii was going to sell 1.2 million units overall.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:07.000
And I said, in this internet ADD reading age, these pictures can truly wield many words.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000
And then I said, for what it's worth, I think your site overall is typically better balanced.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
There's other sites that sensationalize way worse.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I'd never give them attention by calling them out on Twitter, which is true.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.000
But, okay, Shane's desperate to say something on this.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
What'd you want to say on this, Shane?

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.000
All right. Yes, Shane, what?

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.000
I wanted to say first, I think Polygon has always been bad ever since they launched

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.000
and gave themselves all that media hype about, look at the behind the scenes crap that we're doing.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Yeah, it was a little silly, but it was years ago, to be fair.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
And Bobby can't ban me from talking right now,

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.000
so I would say Polygon is more sensationalist than Kotaku lately.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:50.000
And Kotaku's a lot more readable than Polygon has been in a while.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Interesting. All right.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I don't know. I don't visit that website.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.000
And I don't know how much longer I'll visit the other if that continues to be the trend.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I did not get a reply to my little retort, just saying.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Little thing there.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.000
All right. Anyway, did you get all of your stories out, Loki?

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
No. I was also going to mention that Watchdog sold 4 million copies.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:20.000
So that did pretty well, considering that it was slightly delayed from when they originally thought it would be out.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:25.000
It's interesting, because going back to the conversation we were having about exactly those same two games last weekend,

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:31.000
you made the point that you see a lot more Mario Kart media than you've been seeing Watchdog's media.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Call it selective bias, and that may be the case, but like...

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Yeah, I think that's the case.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.000
In the week and a half that we are now in for both of those games' release,

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:45.000
I've seen a fair amount of trailers, a lot of online coordination,

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.000
a lot of Twitter and other coordination to play games online, and a lot of stuff for Mario Kart.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I have seen three Watchdog spoofs, one by Mega64, another...

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.000
No, I've seen one. I'm actually... I think I'm confusing it for like a picture.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Oh no, there was somebody that I follow that has a game deconstruction talking channel on Blip.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
He might still be on YouTube.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:24.000
He was deconstructing that apparently one of the Watchdog missions is you have to kill someone in prison that knows who you are by avoiding the guards.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Except for the fact that the prisoner was scheduled to be executed anyways. Why not just let things run its course?

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:34.000
So I was seeing a lot of deconstructions and spoofs about the content of Watchdogs,

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:39.000
and there may be a third example in there, I don't remember what it is, but those two chiefly I can remember right now,

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:45.000
and I see a lot of fun, hey this game is fun, let's fucking play it, coming out of Mario Kart.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Yeah, it's gaining a lot of steam, and look, I totally get the idea that the game,

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:58.000
if the Wii U doesn't get a bigger install base, then that game isn't going to sell more copies.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.000
I totally get that, because there isn't much of an install base for the Wii U,

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:05.000
but I don't think it was fair to say because it sold 20% here, it's going to sell 20% here,

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:11.000
because that's assuming that those people that bought the system are exact same proportional make-up of the people that bought the system over here.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
So that was my issue with that whole thing. Anyway.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Moving on, let's talk about, speaking of Nintendo, I kind of referenced this briefly earlier in the show,

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:26.000
but I'm sure a lot of you guys heard that Satoru Iwata is actually not going to be at E3 this next week.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:31.000
He will not be making the show, which, you know, usually he'd be in behind closed doors meetings anyway, doing interviews.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:35.000
It would be very hard to catch him out on the show floor, very rare.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:39.000
But his physician has actually advised him to not travel overseas.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Now, this won't really have a big impact anyway, because again, he was really only there for meetings and interviews anyway,

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:53.000
and he can tape appearances in Japan for this Nintendo Direct thing that they're doing anyway, so it just kind of works out.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:21:00.000
But regardless, there's certainly that area of mystique of, oh, he's sick enough to not be traveling overseas.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Hopefully this is just one of those abundance of caution sort of things, and there isn't something really wrong,

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:08.000
because that would be a real bummer to hear that Iwata's sick or something.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Sick enough to not be a sardine for 14 hours is not necessarily very sick.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:17.000
You could have an ear infection, the flight would be fucking miserable, and you would skip it.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Yeah. So, you know, again, hopefully this is just a move out of an abundance of caution.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:25.000
E3 can be really, I mean, it can really wear down your immune system and stuff, too.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Just, you know, the constant on-the-go stuff, so, you know.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Con plague.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Yeah, exactly. So, I can see why he'd want to stay home if the doctor, you know, tells him to.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I'll probably get sick from the damn thing, I always do, but I'll take my vitamin C supplements just in case.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:49.000
I have some stuff. Actually, what I have is a system that doesn't want to help me today.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000
But this is something really good, and this is something that affects us.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Because we're going to be there, Rob.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:56.000
We are.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.000
We're going to GamerX.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Woohoo!

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:02.000
And it looks like that there will be major game publishers who are showing some support.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Well, Major is kind of like, oh yeah, okay, I guess you're kind of major.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:14.000
But they are giving support to the convention, so is Ubisoft and NIS America.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:19.000
So they will be there for the second and last GamerX.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:27.000
So I think that that's going to be good that we're seeing, you know, I wish that we would have enough more support.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:32.000
I mean, because we have BioWare there, IndieCade, Cards Against Humanity, a bunch of others.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:36.000
I wish that we had enough to see enough support to go for another con.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Yeah, I hope they'll be convinced to do a third year.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.000
But, you know, we're going to go, we're going to have fun, and we'll party like it is the last one.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I had a great time last year, we're going to have a good time this year.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000
There's going to be a panel.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000
The panel's going to be happening Saturday at 2 o'clock.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Podcast Cross Zone Returns for its second panel.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.000
We're going to do it a little differently this time.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:58.000
And DarkSakura, you are offered a spot up on the panel if you'd like to speak on it.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.000
I said yes.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Okay, I couldn't remember if you said yes or not, so I didn't want to push you.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:06.000
No, I'm just totally not going to go, and I'm just going to sit in the back and heckle and throw shit.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Well good, the good news is we made room for you on the panel, so you're going to be up there.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I'll be there.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000
I'll be good, and we're going to have a lot of other guest speakers up there too, so this will be fun.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
And then folks in the audience as well.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
We need to discuss cosplay, Rob.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Oh boy, I need to discuss losing 25 pounds, but yes.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000
No, no, no, no, no.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Oh come on, Rob, if a guy who is a foot shorter than you and probably three times your weight can cosplay Sailor Moon, you can cosplay anything.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
That's right.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.000
If we can have Manfay, you can cosplay anything.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Well that makes me feel better.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Alright, let's go over to Loki.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Alright, so this is kind of goofy, but Devolver Digital is on, let's see, they're actually planning on localizing Pigeon Dating Sim.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Hataful Boyfriend?

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Yes they are.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Oh my god, that game is the best.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.000
They are localizing Hataful Boyfriend.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Even though it's already been done.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:11.000
They have a fantastic press release to go along with that, you know, talking about, you know, Love is for the Birds, you know, the NEST hardcore pigeon dating sim for fans everywhere.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Basically, you know, they were talking about how there's, what was it, a lot of games based on first person shooters and stuff and they thought that the demographic of semi-realistic pigeon dating simulations are the next great frontier in video games.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.000
I love their humor.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
But yeah, they're going to be working on that.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000
So it's going to be available, playable at E3 by appointment only.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:43.000
And it's going to launch during the summer on PC, Mac, via Steam, Good Old Games, Humble and other digital storefronts.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Shit, we need to hit Devolver Digital as soon as we get into the LACC.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Continuing on, games that will appear in America, will appear in general, despite the fact that the dating sim had been done previously but is getting localized.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Shovel Knight was kickstarted last year, a couple months, a few more months than just last year.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:13.000
It was originally slated for just a $75,000, it originally wanted $75,000, it wound up with $300,000.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:27.000
The Yacht Club Games has confirmed by Backer News Release, which is public so everybody sees it anyways, that the 8-bit inspired adventure game Shovel Knight will be here on June 26th.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Get ready for the greatest 8-bit inspired adventure game to sweep you off your feet and deliver pure fun directly to your soul with shovels.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I'm looking forward to checking it out, it looks so cute.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Did you back it? I backed it.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000
I did not back it.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I actually still have yet to back a kickstarter.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.000
You know what, I actually have another kickstarter game I just got and I haven't played it yet, that Mung to Sleep.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:54.000
That's that one that's the horror game that's done from the perspective of a two year old.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Alright, well, let's take this opportunity to get some listener feedback in a segment we do every week here where you guys can participate with the show by emailing us to our mailbag.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is our email bag.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Yeah, do it.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.000
And Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag head first and find an email or four or five.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000
I dipped a toe in.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.000
You dipped a toe in?

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
There were only two so I dipped a toe in.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Just two? Alright.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
And my toe has been freshly washed today.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Then two emails to read tonight on the show.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us your e3 thoughts.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.000
My toe smell of lemongrass.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Hello again, OLR gang.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.000
I very much agree that Mario Kart 8 could be a tipping point for gamers to jump in on the Wii U.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I have not purchased any of the next gen consoles, mainly because of the we'll fuck you over less than the other guy mentality that Sony and Microsoft assumed initially.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:51.000
However, Nintendo is starting to build game steam with their newer releases and they may be the winner of my next paycheck.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
That's funny.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
The specifics about the pod mentioned last week.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Our show is called The Village Idiots.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000
It can be found on iTunes, Stitcher or at villagepodcast.bestpro.com.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Well, hello Village Idiot Matt.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Nice to make the connection.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:06.000
There's the connection.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000
That's the guy I felt bad last week because I'm all like, you could have given yourself a promotion.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
So he did email it back and give a promotion.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000
That's great.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:19.000
We also host a show on the same RSS feed called Popcorn and Profanity, which is a film pod.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:27.000
All updates on our show can be found on our homepage villageidiotspodcast.blogspot.com or twitter at villagepodcast.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.000
We should be getting more content up soon, but I am in the process of beginning a new job.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Nursing!

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Good.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
So forgive us if it takes a little time.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000
You know what?

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Nursing is a little bit more important than podcasting.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
So, um...

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Slightly. Only a slight bit though.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Nurse away.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Gamers unite.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Thanks again and keep up the good work.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Matt, Raging Janitor.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:53.000
I like that name Popcorn and Profanity because that's definitely my living room when watching a movie.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:58.000
And, um, I'm actually going to go ahead and list locations since it's an email.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Fargo, North Dakota.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Oh, okay.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I think you were the first person from North Dakota I've ever conversed with in any form in my life.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.000
There you go.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000
I'm serious.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Alright.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Which is kind of sad.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000
I want to go there someday.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Worldwide show.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Yeah.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000
There's listeners everywhere at Orange Lawns Radio, even North Dakota.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:20.000
It proves that there are, you know, when we get Delaware that'll be different.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Or Iowa.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
We've had Iowa, haven't we?

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000
We've had Iowa.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Hi, Iowa people.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Heart.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Shout out.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Iowa in the house.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
I would like to find fellow people that live in Alabama and not, you know...

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
You've already met some of those though.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:37.000
No, I was in Louisiana and in Florida, but I've only met like one person in Alabama and I think he moved.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Oh.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
One of the Florida people now is a coworker.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Okay.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.000
How funny.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000
At Locat.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Only is an at-home locatter.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Gotcha.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000
So funny.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.000
What's up, Orange Lounge guys and gal?

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Thank you.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Black Wolf reminding us the Rob D was in Iowa.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000
I met him at Anime Central years ago.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000
I love the Rob D.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000
He's a nice boy.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Where is he these days?

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Go on.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
He was a nice boy.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:06.000
I do believe it was the Rob D who delivered...

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Is that who I got?

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000
No.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
I'm going to have to go back and recheck this.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Okay.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000
But I will say this.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
He had the bomb radio voice.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
He had a great, like Jason does, he has a great radio voice.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
And he used to do that show on all games about the history.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000
It was like this day in gaming.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000
T-dig.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.000
That was it.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000
It was a fun little show.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Well, may I continue with the last and second and only other email?

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
All right.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
What's up, Orange Lounge guys and gal?

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Thank you for recognizing me.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.000
I feel like you guys are my Monday morning saviors.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.000
So much work to do on Mondays and your gaming nonsense and news keep me smiling all day.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Aw, shucks.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
We're a big oxymoron.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:49.000
One, I would love an explanation on Jamie's crazy love of tacos.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Never caught the history on that one.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Plus I have some recipes to share if she's interested.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Okay.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
My taco thing is actually burrito love.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Okay.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000
I've been lying to me all these years.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Fuck yeah.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Okay.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Wait, wait, wait.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:04.000
I really, really love tacos because when I finally got...

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
After being in California for years and years,

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I finally got introduced to real tacos going to a little taqueria across the street from where I worked.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
And I'm like, they're not folded.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:14.000
These are fucking good.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
They're loaded with yummies.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Taco Tuesday.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
And that's where Taco Tuesday was born.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Which I still don't understand how we're supposed to answer the question.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Like, what's so great about a taco?

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Have you had one?

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Like, it's a taco.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:36.000
It's a slightly sweet corn tortilla with delicious meats of any variety you could think of.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
And the place that I would go to even had tongue tacos.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Ew.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Rob tongue is meat muscle.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:43.000
It's muscle.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
You shave the bumpy bits off it, it tastes like meat.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
I don't know when that happened.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.000
I was about to say something and out came a burp.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:55.000
I'm sorry.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
I'm sorry, listeners.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
That's what happens when you have too many tacos.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:02.000
No, that comes out the other end.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
But my true love...

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
What?

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
You nasty.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
So? You got it wrong.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
This show. This show.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:15.000
No, seriously. I just was about to open my mouth to retort something.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Which I forgot what my retort was.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
My retort was Choco Taco. That was my retort.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Choco Tacos are pretty damn good.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.000
But never ever ever put marshmallows on anything ever.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Anyway, my true love is burritos.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Because burritos are like...

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Especially carne asada with potato and cheese.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Just like that. Or fish or fish burrito.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
I love fish tacos too.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Because I go that way.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I love tacos, really.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Tacos, you can hold them in.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
I discovered a new love and I hate fast food.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000
But oh my god, I love the crispy shrimp things from Del Taco.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I hope our emailer is happy with this turn of events here.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Because I literally can't even right now.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Tacos are...

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Tacos are life.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
How can you deal with the four of us in this room then?

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:09.000
It's a job.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Because you literally can't even...

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Weren't you going somewhere?

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:16.000
See, Agdeft agrees with me.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:19.000
And SSJ100Matt agrees that carnitas are good too.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:23.000
I like it that I bring up shrimp.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
And SSJ100Matt brings up carnitas.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
We're like the trafiest Jews that ever traffed.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Taco Lounge Radio. Live at VOG Network.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Every Sunday night at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I just...

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
I can't.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Two, I'm a huge...

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Well, if you can't, I already done can't.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
So, get a new contraction.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Bitch, no.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Hearts.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Two, I'm a huge comic books collecting nerd and I've taken plenty of crap for it.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:55.000
What were the things that you did or still do that people called you nerd for besides gaming?

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Comics.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:04.000
I had the entire run of like the 80s through 90s Wolverine all up until before I moved out here.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Like, from the mid 80s up through the late 90s.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:12.000
And then I gave them to some guy because I knew he'd like them and I couldn't take them with me.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
This show?

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
I needed Brockie.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
You think I'm kidding?

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000
We've had this show for like 12 years.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:24.000
This show has been on a long time even before I was seeing Alan.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.000
And so I would go out on dates with guys and, you know, so what do you do for fun?

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Well, I have a long running podcast on the internet about video games.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Oh, cool.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
I don't play games.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
And then turns out...

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
I'm gonna walk this way.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Turns out they do play games, just not video games.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
If you know what I mean.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I also larped in college the first time.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:57.000
My friend Ashley and I used to sit in study hall and create our own tabletop RPG.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Drawing maps and everything.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
It was fantastic.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Loki, is there something nerdy you still do that you get made fun for?

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:07.000
I mean, your wife kind of teases you about everything, doesn't she?

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Yeah, pretty much everything.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
I had one other.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:15.000
My friend Courtney and I would sit and quote the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Verbatim.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Ever since... We did this all the way through middle school.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:21.000
That's pretty nerdy.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:24.000
And then she went to a different high school than I did, but we did them for part of the sole reason,

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.000
because this other girl named Catherine, who lived around the corner from my house,

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000
and her mom and my mom were friends.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:37.000
She used to talk with her mouth full of food and it was gross, so we just started quoting turtle movies.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.000
It was awesome. I still have those movies memorized, I swear.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Alright, rest of the email.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Fuck.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.000
I was going to see if you could remember any of the movie, but then I realized it's really a road I don't want to go down.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Question.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Do you like penicillin on your pizza?

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Read the rest of the email.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.000
You guys are freaking sweet. Keep the show coming.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:05.000
P.S. Thanks for playing my demo track last week while answering the question.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.000
I know you didn't have to. Muchas gracias.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:11.000
And I'm not doing it for other people, because I don't want to open the floodgates.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
You play my song, play my song. No.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000
DJ, play my song now.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.000
You heard that song?

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
He gets to do it because he thought of it first.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Alright, unless you want to do a new intro.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:28.000
I'm not doing a redub of the turtle movies in my voice, because I can't do the New York-y accent.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Unless I did it like an old Jewish man.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
You could be Splinter.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Imagine Splinter instead of having his fake Kevin-class Japanese accent.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.000
You know? Sound like an old Hasidic man from prom heights.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Mel Brooks, basically.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
No. No, no, no. Of course.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Alright. Is that it for emails?

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Chevy Nova?

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Alright, there it is. That's it for the email.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:58.000
You get it!

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Participate at orangelaungerator.com is the place to send your emails.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Alright, I am closing up the listless votes right after this segment, so if you haven't voted,

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:13.000
log into the site right now and vote listless, or you are screwed and you don't get to participate.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:19.000
So here it is. The FUs of the week time. Why? Because tradition?

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Because fuck.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Fuck you to act deft for sending me a picture of a chibi Deadpool riding a pig screaming tacos.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Oh my god, that sounds amazing.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
I want this shirt now.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.000
What?

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.000
I want this shirt with every fiber of my being, because he also kind of looks like Gur.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:37:00.000
That's exactly Gur. The whole thing is it's a parody of Gur writing, because he did the thing where he yelled tacos.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
I love tacos.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:08.000
But, but, but, I will, I'm going to correct the entire Deadpool fandom.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
These are two fuck yous.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Number one, Deadpool's not a mutant. In the comics, Deadpool's not a mutant.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Number two, Deadpool actually does not like chimichangas. He just likes the word.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:23.000
That had been proven in an issue of Cable and Deadpool.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Well, it's important.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:27.000
When he comes by, he's saying chimichanga, chimichanga, and she's like, what would you like for dinner?

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Enchiladas.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Because he doesn't actually like chimichangas, so.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
I know way too much about comics.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
There were Deadpool cosplayers at Phantom Man. They were really good.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:44.000
They should totally have a 90's sitcom show called Cable and Deadpool.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Well, they were sort of like an old married couple, kinda, you know, in the comic.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
They even made jokes about it.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:58.000
However, what I might do, I'm thinking about doing this, Rob, for the convention if I can't make another cosplay.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I'm thinking about making a head pool.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Do you know what head pool is?

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:03.000
No.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
The undead head of Deadpool from another dimension.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
This is a long FU segment.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.000
FU to people who get their comic facts wrong.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Alright, Jason, you're FU of the week.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.000
FU to California for having the bump strips on the inside of your lane and not on the line or over.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.000
It's just fucking annoying.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
There's a lot of weird shit in this state, isn't there?

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
65 mile an hour speed limit on the highway.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
I think some of them are also wake up bumps.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Yeah, but they're not supposed to be inside the lane.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
You'll get to see 70 on the way to LA tomorrow.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:38.000
I have already driven that once before. Twice before. Possibly thrice before.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Oh fine.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Tigerclaw, I am going to correct you then. A mutate is not someone who has been experimented on by using mutant DNA.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.000
A mutate is a person who has just been mutated post birth.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Nine o'clock, people. Nine o'clock.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Marvel universe, go catch up.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
And FU to 100 degree weather.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Lowkey.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Yeah, just FU to the weather. It's too fucking hot.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
I don't want to go outside.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.000
My FU of the week goes to the migraine I had last night that was killer.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Oh my god, it was so awful.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.000
I was watching Orange is the New Black because that show was amazing.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.000
And like halfway through the second episode, I started getting this massive headache.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:14.000
And I think I might have just OD'd on meat.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.000
And the reason why I say that, get your minds out of the gutter.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:21.000
The reason why I say that, we went to this, Flaco Jones had a little birthday thing over the weekend.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:24.000
And we went to this Korean barbecue place. It's not far from where I live.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:28.000
And it's really good, but I ate a lot of meat, you guys.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.000
A lot. Because it's all you can eat and you just put it on the grill.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.000
You grill it yourself because I guess that's how it's cheap.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
And I ate a lot of meat.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:39.000
I think I gave myself a meat migraine.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.000
FU to Rob. We're talking about a lot of food because I have had no appetite for the last week.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Is it a meat grain?

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
A meat grain, yes it was.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.000
I've never been to Korean barbecue.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
You should go somewhere. It was fun.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000
I've never been.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.000
You guys will have an OLR date.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Alright. It's time to figure out who won List List, you guys.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.000
It's over. It's done. We're wrapping it up here.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:10.000
List List tonight is time to figure out what is the thing you are most looking forward to at E3 2014.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:13.000
It's time to reveal the definitive list.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Here it is, your top three answers.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:21.000
In a tie for third place. We have a tie for third place tonight.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:25.000
A tie for third place, Mighty No. 9 playable at E3.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:31.000
And an all female game with zero misogyny.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Go you.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Go feminism.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Alright. In second, Well Feminism got third place tonight. Let's see.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Hey, this is better than what we normally get.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:46.000
I feel bad laughing at that. That was actually a really good singer, actually.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
It's fucking true.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
It's sad, but alright.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Alright, here it is. Your number two answer.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:58.000
The definitive list. So again, number three, Mighty No. 9 playable and all female game with zero misogyny ties.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Number two, Phantasy Star Online 2 is a Wii U exclusive.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Dun, dun, dun. Even though it's already on PC.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Loki's rolling his eyes really far back in his head. What?

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Whatever, I just don't think it's going to happen.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:23.000
And the number one answer tonight, Valve Trolls Valve with a Portal 3 trailer.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:24.000
That would be fantastic.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Number one and number two. What, what, what, what?

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:32.000
You listening, Bobby? I got number one and number two this year.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.000
That would piss off so many people. It would be fantastic.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:41.000
I think it would be hilarious and I would actually rather another Portal than another Half-Life, but that's me.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Because I actually liked Portal better than Half-Life.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:46.000
If you guys don't believe me, it's not making it up, guys. It's right there. There it is.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:49.000
I personally like Portal better than the rest of Half-Life.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:54.000
It announced third sequels for all their other franchises except for Half-Life.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Everything else gets a third game. Fuck Half-Life.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.000
I would have thought that President Cat 2 Prepare for Kittenfall would have topped the list for sure, to be fair, Loki.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
It just, fourth place. It just missed it.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.000
That's all right.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.000
I was a little surprised there. All right.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Technically fifth because there was a tie for third.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Oh yeah.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.000
If you to myself are signing myself up to putting listless in the video because god damn it, it's time consuming.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Sorry.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Oh god, this is the worst week for that too.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.000
We have 15 answers.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Oh shit.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Have fun. Good luck.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000
All right.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Oh no.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Masochist much?

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Maybe I'll just skip it this week. All right, there it is.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Let's do a couple more stories then we're going to open up the phone lines quickly.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:34.000
We don't have a whole lot of time for calls because we're running a little long.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
We're past 9 o'clock already so let's get to it. Loki.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.000
All right, lots of apps are coming to the Xbox One and Xbox 360.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Some of the new stuff that's going to be happening.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Comedy Central is getting an app on Xbox One.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Crunchyroll is coming to Xbox One in several territories.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:55.000
FX Now is that like an FX thing? That'd be pretty cool.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:04.000
MTV, K-Drama, Max Dome, MLG, Movieplex, iHeartRadio, HBO Go, which is pretty big.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
GoPro.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000
I know Twitter is one of them.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:18.000
You'd think that they would have had it by now but Twitter is coming to Xbox One as well.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
Tune in.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Sci-fi Now.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Sky Online.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Sky News.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Yeah.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.000
FX Now should be live TV or on-demand TV for the FX network, right?

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Like what Archer is on and what not?

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:36.000
I'm thinking that would be pretty cool because I do need to catch up on some Archer so that would be nice.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:39.000
The only show I actually know that's on that network.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.000
So yeah, lots of apps coming later this year.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:49.000
And if you haven't been heard yet, the apps that did require the paywall, I believe that paywall is now gone.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:52.000
So they are available now if you have Xbox Live Silver.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.000
So you can watch Netflix without having to pay an extra fee.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Alright.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:05.000
And last but not least tonight I have a story about a particular franchise of interest to many of you and that is the Metal Gear franchise.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Note that I'm not talking about Metal Gear Solid.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.000
I'm talking old school Metal Gear.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Now this is pretty cool.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Shane may have joked earlier in the show that Konami is going to formally announce that they're killing off Silent Hill at E3.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:30.000
But in real news, Konami actually gave the blessing to a team called the Outer Heaven team to do a full remake of Metal Gear.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.000
The 1987 action adventure stealth game Metal Gear for release on Steam.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:40.000
And they're saying it's going to be a full remake of the original game, new script, new models, the works.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.000
The theme compositions will be revamped with orchestral arrangements and the Metal Gear Solid 2 style electronic beats.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
This is from developer Ian Ratcliff.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:52.000
This is really cool that Konami has kind of given this the blessing.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:55.000
They do say it's going to be based off the MSX version of Metal Gear.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
So for those of you guys...

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.000
You mean the good ones?

02:44:58.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Yeah, the good one basically.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Well the NES one, you know what, I still have a lot of respect for it because that's what we kind of grew up on.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.000
So anyway.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:10.000
More information to come soon.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:17.000
They are still looking for volunteers, including a cutscene animator, a cutscene artist in the style of Yoji Shinkawa or Ashley Wood.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:21.000
Storyboard artist, sound effect artist, composer, and voice over talent.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.000
So maybe I should audition to be the new voice of Snake. What do you guys think?

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:29.000
How well can you do MMMM Metal Gear?

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
MMMM Metal Gear!

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Was that good?

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Wow.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
I don't know why I expected anything different from him.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Nailed it.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Nailed it.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
I'll send him my tape right away.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Alright, there it is.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
So good luck to those guys. Love it.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Alright, that is going to do it for the news tonight.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:53.000
But now it's your turn.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:56.000
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:01.000
If you'd like to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Maybe your own E3, what you're looking forward to in the future.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Or whatever.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Whatever it is.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.000
All one word.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, Rob Roberts is fabulous Snake.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:22.000
I feel like there should be sparkles that come out when that's said.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Alright, oh we do have some calls coming in.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Oh no, the truck have started to move.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Oh no, the truck have started to move.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Oh no.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Oh no, the truck have started to move!

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Gasp!

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Gasp!

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Let's get to the phones and take some calls.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Hey guys, it's Nemesis 47. How y'all doing today?

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Nemesis 47. I haven't heard you in a while. How you doing?

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:48.000
I've been good. I've been good.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:51.000
I've just been busy just moving out and stuff like that.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:56.000
I've also been working on my new job too over at the local King Soopers and stuff.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:59.000
I'm pretty sure that moving is punishment for shoplifting in some countries.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:02.000
So I'm sorry to hear that. It's never a fun process.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Well that's okay. I just moved with a buddy of mine, so yeah.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:10.000
That'll be fun. Well what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Nothing much. I just want to get my two cents about everything that's going on with E3 this week.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:24.000
I'm actually gonna... I am hoping they also announce a new Hitman game.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Ah, a new Hitman game, possibly.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Because from what I've seen, some months ago that a picture that...

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:37.000
They're actually in the process of filming the new Hitman movie.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:42.000
So a Hitman game is probably a shoo-in or something for E3.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:49.000
And I also heard a rumor that tomorrow the new WW2K15 game is gonna be revealed.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Does EA have the license to that? Because that would make sense.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
No, 2K15 if you take two.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Oh, 2K15. Sorry about that.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:03.000
WW2K15. Yeah, that's from the people who make 2K sports and all that.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Well, yeah. It's coming out for sure.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Shows you how well I watch the sports titles. Sorry about that.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
But you're looking forward to it, huh?

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Oh yeah. The one thing I'm hoping is that it's actually more fresh and more...

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:23.000
I'm hoping it's a little bit more fresher than having the previous game where they pretty much borrowed everything

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:27.000
that they did for THQ and everything.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:33.000
I see. I was gonna ask you what would hopefully be on your wish list of how would it be different this year.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Because, you know, a lot of these games get slammed for being roster updates and so forth, so...

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Well, obviously they are gonna have roster updates.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.000
What I'm hearing is there's rumors going on that Goldberg and Sting is gonna be in the game.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:52.000
And the things I'm hoping is I'm hoping they actually make the weapon animations more realistic.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Like, instead of the chairs I'm actually disappearing or having three or four hits and they pretty much break

02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:04.000
or have very unrealistic tables. Like, they actually slide all over the goddamn place.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
All over the damn place.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:11.000
And I'm hoping they pretty much update the weapon systems and everything like that.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Just pretty much make a better wrestling game experience and all that is all.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com talking about the new Hitman game saying

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:26.000
the new Hitman game is supposed to be more sandbox-y and fix the problems from the previous one.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.000
I thought the last one was pretty sandbox-y from the looks of it.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:38.000
I actually like the new Hitman game. I was actually fambling when I first played the game

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.000
and also I heard the old voice of 47 because originally they were gonna go with a different voice

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:47.000
but they decided to bring back the old 47 voice so I was happy with that.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
And I actually love the game.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Yeah, even I watched it. It's not usually my type of thing but I watched a friend play it and it looked pretty cool.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:55.000
So I was like, oh wow.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:56.000
It is. It is.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:00.000
It was all next gen at that time, although now we're in a whole other generation.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:03.000
So it would look amazing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I'm sure.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Oh yeah, and let's see, what else was I gonna say?

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Oh, did you guys see the new Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD remix trailer?

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:18.000
I did, if for nothing else than the last 20 seconds of basically nothing but subtitles saying

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Kingdom Hearts 3, don't forget.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Like literally, what was it, three frames or something.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:28.000
Like three still pictures that rotate super fast. You can't see it at all.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Just talk about a tease.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:35.000
All I did was pretty much pause during the scenes.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:43.000
They're pretty much scenes from Kingdom Hearts Triple D, the 3DS.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:50.000
But we'll probably see more about Kingdom Hearts 3 and everything, so yeah.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:55.000
I definitely think it's still a little early.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:58.000
I don't think the game is gonna be playable on the show floor or anything like that.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
I really don't think it's that far along.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:06.000
But I would love to see a better trailer, like a new little tease would be great.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
That and 15, but I don't know.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Square has come out and said don't expect to see either one at E3, so we'll see.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:14.000
I'm gonna probably say Tokyo Game Show more than likely.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Yeah, that's a very good thought, is that these could be things that are being saved for Tokyo Game Show.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Because they kinda did say, without saying, they're holding onto it for another expo.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Tokyo Game Show would be the highly likely candidate for that.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:33.000
And lastly, there's another big convention that's gonna happen this weekend, besides E3 obviously.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:34.000
What's that?

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Denver Comic Con.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Ah.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.000
Over here in Denver. It's the fifth largest convention in the United States.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Which I have tickets for, which I am officially missing because it's next weekend.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
I was gonna say, that's in your backyard and you're gonna have to visit.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:51.000
You're going now, man! I want to meet ya!

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:57.000
I bought tickets in March or something like that earlier this year before E3.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Before the E3 plan at work had even really come up.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:05.000
I hate to say it, but for me, E3 is trumping Denver Comic Con in a heartbeat.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Yeah, yeah, it's understandable. E3 is frickin' amazing.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:18.000
I mean, how? I mean, for me, if I was invited to go between DCC and E3, I'd go with E3 too.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Because, come on. That's a big show.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Yeah, you're gonna have a lot of fun at Denver Comic Con, though. I mean, come on.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Oh, totally, man. Totally. We have, like, Peter Davison. We have Sylvester McCoy, the pimp and the seventh doctor.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Oh, you mean David Tennant's father-in-law.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:35.000
Yes, yes.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
And the guy with pigeon shit all over him.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Sorry, I love both of them, but I love making the parallels.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Originally, Karen Gellan Amy Pond was gonna be at the con this year, but she had to back out because of a movie commitment and stuff.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:55.000
So, she's, they didn't mention, sorry about that, I tend to stutter a lot, guys.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:56.000
That's okay.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.000
They did mention that she might be coming next year, though.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:04.000
Oh, that'd be cool. She owes you guys a make-up. And then that way, Jason can be there.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Unless he goes to E3 next year, which, you know, we'll see.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:13.000
All right. Well, Nemesis, I enjoyed the call, enjoyed your predictions. Thanks so much for giving us a call, and have a lot of fun at the Denver Comic-Con.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:16.000
And since we can't be there, say hey to everybody for us.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Okay. Okay, guys. I'm happy I'm at E3 this week, all right?

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:22.000
We will do. See you on E3.vognetwork.com.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.000
All right, man. Big peace.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Later.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:30.000
All right. I like hearing from callers who don't always hear from a lot, but I like the regulars, too, don't get me wrong.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:36.000
But it's always nice to hear from a not-so-familiar tone, just to know that, oh, I'm still listening.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I've had my tickets on the table right in my front door.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:41.000
You didn't try to give them to somebody?

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:45.000
Right inside of my front door. I, you know, I was thinking about that towards the end. I really should have.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:46.000
Yeah.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:52.000
But I was looking at them before this trip started, because I've been out here. I've been away from home for pretty much the entire month of May.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:57.000
I was just looking at it, and I was like, damn, I could do it if I didn't have to drive all weekend and then some.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:01.000
All right. Well, I don't even have to give out the number again, because it's lighting up. Let's go to the phones.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:06.000
It's your local residential cosplay whore, Rama.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:09.000
Rama, it just wouldn't be a show without you. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.000
Sailor Moon.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
Oh, besides that.

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:16.000
So did you find me the little thing that I asked if you could find for me?

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:19.000
I could not find any in the dealer's room.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Ahhhh. No, Sanketsu.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Hey, don't upset her during OLR. What's up, buddy? What's on your mind?

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:30.000
I can't help it if I fail the side mission. What am I supposed to do?

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Make one. Out of life fibers.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Do over.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:36.000
And then he can talk to me. When I'm bored at work.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:45.000
Not too much. I kind of missed half the show because we were planning stuff out for our podcast this week and some other stuff.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
Well, how dare you?

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:48.000
What?

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
How dare you? How very dare you? I'm just-

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:55.000
I'm sorry. People call me. I gotta take calls. Evidently, I'm an important person.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:02.000
I was just gonna say I kind of felt sorry. I said this earlier in the show. I felt sorry for some of the VoG- I think I might have said this on Bobby's show.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:08.000
I feel sorry for some of the VoG programming on tomorrow and Tuesday because gaming really is gonna dominate the conversation.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:11.000
And I know Voice Geeks Network is really about all things geek.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:19.000
But I was like, well, Rama might get out of it because he's a live show so he can kind of adjust to whatever's going on with E3 and all that.

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:26.000
That and I have a game filter set up for the chat so it's all anime all day every day so we're good.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
There you go.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Few things. Went to Anime Nexus this past week. It was pretty fun. I met up with Critical Myth so there is a picture of us crossing paths.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
Oh, that's amazing.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Let's see. I did not make it over to the gaming room because it's over in another hotel and it was too hot to walk across to the other side of the location.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:56.000
But I did hear there was some pretty good gaming over there so we'll definitely uncover that.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:59.000
But here's something that was some interesting things though.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:11.000
Most popular cosplay there was from the game Danganronpa which is becoming the game which is actually putting life into the Vita because as we all know the Vita doesn't sell.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:21.000
No, sadly. I'm curious to see what Sony kind of does with that if they do anything with that at E3. We'll find out in 24 hours.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Hopefully. And evidently it seems in my areas ever since the Luigi death stairs came about it's been kind of hard to find a Wii U.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Really? You know I think I was seeing some sales numbers today and it does look like Wii U outsold Xbox One for the past week.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:48.000
But I mean again it still didn't outsell PlayStation 4 so it's not where it needs to be.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:57:00.000
I don't expect that to happen but you know I just find all that pretty interesting and pretty cool because now I'm like you know I may just have to get myself a Wii U just for that.

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:07.000
And what's interesting is that as I'm running around as Dr. Luigi people are asking me for my death stair which was pretty cool.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:21.000
I was gonna say you know now I don't want to sound like that guy Rama but you do cosplay as a black man as Luigi so you know people are wondering where's my angry black man Luigi?

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
You went there.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:28.000
I live there. I bought a house there. Rama?

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
That's because I gave him permission so it's okay.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:31.000
That's right.

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
And before I get out of here.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Wait wait you didn't answer my question. It was a serious question. What am I gonna get my angry Luigi? Are you gonna do an angry Luigi cosplay at some point or no?

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:51.000
It'll happen when I end up doing the mushroom doctor which is Luigi cross tenth doctor. I've been asked to do that too.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:52.000
That'll be fun.

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:53.000
Green pinstripes?

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Maybe. The suspenders are sitting on my floor.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
I remember that dapper hat you had.

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Alright you said one more thing.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:17.000
I was taking pictures and I came across Death Stair Luigi and I'm posting the picture in the chat room and it's also on my Facebook page. Facebook.com slash I M D G Ron M S. You'll find it there.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:28.000
And it's interesting that Luigi is giving my friend the death stair and the best part is that's my friend Mario. So as you can see Luigi is giving the death stair to Mario.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:38.000
I have a really bad feeling that this angry Luigi meme is gonna get played out at cons real fast. You know I take back my question. You probably shouldn't do angry Luigi.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:51.000
I know but the best part is it was a Waluigi and Wario with go karts running around playing riding dirty all over the convention area throwing stuff at each other. People ate it up.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Alright that's fun though. Looks like you guys had fun there at the con.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:59:02.000
Alright well Rama best of luck with your show on Tuesday. I'm sorry I won't be here to hear it but that's what podcasts are for.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:05.000
Alright take care buddy. We'll see you soon.

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:06.000
You too. Take care bro.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:07.000
Alright bye.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:08.000
Alright.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:15.000
Squeeze in one more call if anybody wants to get in. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:22.000
I did see just a couple tweets come in here so I want to get to those. I read one of them earlier in the show but I saw a couple stories.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:27.000
I'll also go ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories he wants to squeeze in here.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:35.000
Yeah there's some funny stuff. Notch has released a game called Cliff Horse. It's a game about riding horses on cliffs.

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:41.000
It's kind of like playing Skyrim because the horses just kind of defy gravity and they ride on a cliff.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:49.000
For anybody that doesn't get it from the outside if you know the meme and seen the image. Physics? I'm a horse bitch.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:58.000
Just a couple tweets that were sent to us here. There was a correction to last week's show from Pika Uno.

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:05.000
I don't even remember why Downton Abbey came up on last week's show but it did and we said that it was on the BBC and Pika Uno corrected.

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:06.000
PBS you said.

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
It is on, well in overseas.

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
BBC. It was on, was it television 4?

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:11.000
It's on ITV.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:12.000
ITV that was it.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:20.000
Pika Uno issuing the correction there which I did retweet and say well sorry but we're kind of busy on Sunday nights when it usually airs.

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:25.000
Except for the fact that it airs Sunday morning.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:28.000
Yeah I don't know when it airs over there.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:33.000
But it has my spirit grandmother.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.000
Maggie Smith.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:35.000
Heck yeah.

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
It airs on PBS Sunday nights.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Yes.

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Sassy.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:45.000
Satcho and Hunter Matt tweeting us the story about Xbox One controllers are now supported on PC.

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:50.000
You must have missed that part of the show Satcho and Hunter Matt but yes you can now use those on PC.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:53.000
And Act Deft sending us to an infamous meme.

03:00:53.000 --> 03:01:01.000
Speaking of leaks and announcements before E3 here's a preview of Valve's surprise conference and its characters singing on stage in Tomodachi Life.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
One can only dream.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
Any other last minute stories Loki?

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.000
The rumor is that the Nintendo digital event is going to be 30 minutes long.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
That's it?

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:12.000
Wow.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
It's Nintendo isn't that all they need?

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.000
It's according to I guess the timetable that they have on Niko Video or whatever.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:23.000
It says 1 to about 130 is the...

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
That could be a placeholder we don't really know.

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
That seems short but then again I mean...

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:30.000
And it says Smash Brothers Invitational 8 to 1030.

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:38.000
So I guess last year was pretty short too but they could also pull a stupid like...

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:42.000
Hey! Yeah here's our digital thing.

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
But we're gonna have 3 more during the week!

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:47.000
Well they could. They could.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
But 30 minutes doesn't seem like enough.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:50.000
Remember they had 3 last year?

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:51.000
That's right they did.

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:56.000
If they only have one in 30 minutes long that's not a good sign.

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:57.000
I think it's a little early though.

03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:00.000
I mean this isn't an official source.

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:04.000
It's probably a placeholder on somebody's schedule just because they had to put something.

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
And that is for Tuesday?

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
Yeah.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:11.000
8 o'clock in the evening for the Invitational.

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:12.000
Wow.

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Well it's Japan time.

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:15.000
Alright.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
I cannot do the type of translation right now.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
Maybe it's Japanese specific stuff.

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
It's only like 30 minutes.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:22.000
Maybe.

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Alright I don't know.

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:24.000
It's a shot. It's a shot.

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Alright that's it.

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
We're gonna close up the Skype line because ain't nobody else calling in.

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
So we are gonna wrap up because you know what?

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:30.000
I got an early day tomorrow.

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
And it's gonna be a big day for a lot of you guys.

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:33.000
You and me both!

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:34.000
Road trip buddies!

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:35.000
Yay!

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
We also have this cool game I just saw here.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:38.000
What's that?

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
It's called Rollers of the Realm.

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
It's a pinball RPG.

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:43.000
Ooh fun!

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:44.000
Yeah.

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:45.000
I've gotta check that out.

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:46.000
Is that on Steam?

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:47.000
PS4, Vita, and PC.

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:48.000
Oh get out.

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:49.000
That sounds awesome.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:50.000
This winter.

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:51.000
Nice.

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:52.000
It sounds like...

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:53.000
What was that game?

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
Kind of like a pinball quest type game.

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:56.000
Yeah.

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:57.000
Alright.

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:58.000
That is it.

03:02:58.000 --> 03:02:59.000
We are on our way out of here.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
We're gonna close up shop.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Have a great night everybody.

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Let's thank you for your support first off.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:09.000
Thank you very much for downloading our show and checking us out.

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:12.000
And supporting us every week as you always do.

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:13.000
555 episodes long.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
That's 5s across the board.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:20.000
We'll be back to do it again next week with episode number 556 after E3.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:24.000
It's gonna be very interesting to see how we all react to the news.

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:28.000
And I want to know how you guys react to all the news going into E3.

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:29.000
But have a great show.

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
Those of you guys that are actually gonna be there in person,

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
I hope to see you around the show floor.

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
Those of you guys that are playing the home game and watching at home,

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
please participate with the site.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
We're there to help you out.

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:42.000
So let's get the answers to your questions as best we can.

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:45.000
Jason, I want to thank you as always for being here.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Of course.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:47.000
Hope you had fun tonight.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:48.000
Do you have a final thought for us?

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
I don't want to wake up tomorrow,

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:55.000
but I must because the week starts in pretty much about five hours.

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:59.000
You can sleep through like Stockton and Bakersfield,

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
the really unremarkable places.

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:02.000
While I'm driving, that sounds scary.

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:03.000
No, no, no, no.

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:04.000
Take the 99.

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:05.000
Sleep through Fresno.

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
Stop at the Bravo Cheese Farm.

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:08.000
Well, we don't really want to stop.

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
Yeah, tell that to the lactose intolerant one.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:11.000
No, no, no, no, no.

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:14.000
You can find good low lactosey cheeses.

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
Stopping is probably more for the way back.

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:20.000
No, you have to stop by the Bravo Cheese Farm and bring me sage cheese.

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:23.000
You know they're building a Bravo farm on five as well.

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:24.000
No way.

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
In Kettleman City or whatever that is.

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
You know that's still not going to make me take the five and smell the cow shit.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:29.000
All right.

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:33.000
Dar Sockers, since you have the mic, your final thought tonight?

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
I really didn't mean to take from Jason's time.

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:39.000
Just Bravo Cheese Farm.

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:43.000
Everyone look for the deer kitten commercial for Friskies on YouTube.

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:44.000
All right.

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:45.000
It's the cutest thing.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:52.000
My final thought is OMG, busy week ahead, but I can't wait to do some networking and introduce more people to VOG.

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Speaking of kittens, my son hung up.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:01.000
He had a cat calendar because he was really excited about having a calendar and he had a cat calendar.

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:02.000
Then he didn't give a shit about the calendar.

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
He wanted the cat pictures all over his room.

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
So now his room is covered in cat pictures.

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:07.000
He's ready for the internet.

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
Your son's room is a meme.

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:15.000
And also, I would like to say that I finally finished my fucking calling script and I think it's all done.

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:18.000
And I had it working and I finished converting all the objects over.

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
So now I can start other things again.

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:21.000
Hooray.

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:22.000
Back to the game.

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:23.000
Back to the game.

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:24.000
All right, guys.

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
We're out of here because you know what?

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:27.000
I got to go pack.

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:28.000
See you next week.

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:32.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:36.000
