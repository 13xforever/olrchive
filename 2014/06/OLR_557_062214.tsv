0	17880	This week, the playful jobs at Ubisoft continue with Sunset Overdrive offering full customization
17880	19400	no matter the gender you select.
19400	22800	EA CEO has owned up to Battlefield 4's issues, but stopped short of promising that it will
22800	23800	never happen again.
23800	29920	We'll tell you more about all this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.
30000	34480	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34480	36040	where every gamer has a voice.
36040	38880	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
38880	46000	Live for this, our 557th episode, June the 22nd of 2014.
46000	49520	We're here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the
49520	52840	gamer lifestyle with me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts.
52840	57160	Unfortunately not here tonight, DarkSakura, she has the night off, but here in studio
57160	59560	with me, TechMasterLoki.
59600	60840	I get the comfier chair today.
60840	65920	Yes, you get the upgrade in DarkSakura's little fuzzy chair.
65920	66920	Yeah, throne.
66920	67920	Yeah.
67920	72480	It is appropriate that DarkSakura gets a throne here on the show, but sadly, you're a seat
72480	75800	warmer tonight with her being out, so.
75800	76800	That's fine.
76800	77960	Well, how you doing, Loki?
77960	78960	What's new with you?
78960	79960	Not much.
79960	80960	Yeah?
80960	89320	It's just, uh, I don't know, working on my game in free time and I did like house repairs
89320	90320	today.
90320	91320	Wow.
91320	94920	I repaired a drain in our bathtub.
94920	98360	I got some things that need repairing too, I'm just kidding.
98360	101760	We were talking a little bit before the show tonight about the steam sales, cause you know,
101760	106760	it is that time of year where, or actually it's several times, that biannual time of
106760	109960	year, cause there's two of them usually, the summer and the winter sale.
109960	112680	I know they do, do they normally do a spring sale too?
112680	113680	Do they?
113680	118560	They did, because I remember last year it was the winter and then spring sale.
118560	119560	Oh wow.
119560	120560	Maybe I'm thinking the winter sale, I don't know.
120560	123720	Maybe it's like mini sales or something, I don't know, maybe like a, I feel like there's
123720	126840	a sale around Black Friday, you know, usually, but anyway.
126840	130640	We all know there's a summer sale and a winter sale, right, so, and steam, there's a lot
130640	134160	of stuff always on sale, so there's the huge summer sale going on, but you said, unfortunately
134160	137240	you haven't really got to participate much this year, just cause, you know, you're trying
137240	138800	to look out for the monies, right?
138800	141200	Money and also just, I don't want to buy anything.
141200	148200	I mean, just, I have so much that I've bought before, I haven't played most of it, like
148240	152880	everybody, but you know, there's not really the point of a steam sale, but there's not
152880	156680	really anything that jumps out that like I need to buy it because like most of the things
156680	158920	like are on sale right now, I already own.
158920	163800	So your EP is directly judged by how big your steam library is.
163800	166120	It's 350 games in my library.
166120	167200	What was the last one you played?
167200	169200	I don't know.
169200	172560	Probably sieve four or no sieve.
172560	173560	Was it sieve five?
173560	176040	You don't even know what damn game you play.
176040	177040	No, no.
177040	178040	I'm saying which one you played.
178880	179880	Sieve five.
179880	180880	No, we'll get into that in my gaming.
180880	182560	We played one today.
182560	186440	But no, um, I mean I have, there's a lot of stuff out there, but there's not really anything
186440	193760	new that I'm getting aside from, you know, free games and um, like, uh, no, actually
193760	199800	I should give you, I have a steam code for a game that I have a DRM free copy of, um,
199800	200800	that kickstarted.
200800	205360	It was a rhythm shooter, like a space shooter, but it's a rhythm game sort of.
205360	207480	That'll be one extra inch on my collection.
207920	208920	There you go.
208920	213720	Um, so, but yeah, aside from like stuff that kickstarted that they have, like, you know,
213720	215600	steam codes for, I haven't really been buying any games.
215600	216600	Okay, we'll take that back.
216600	219920	I did buy that bundle at E3, but I only paid a dollar.
219920	223640	I didn't want any, like I said, I don't need the Mortal Kombat arcade collection cause
223640	227080	I just don't, I'm not a big fan of Mortal Kombat, you know, and they have like, now
227080	230240	I have a bunch of random DLC for shit I don't own.
230240	234400	Funny enough, that was the last game I bought before the steam, I bought on Epic on the
234400	237440	steam sale yesterday cause that was the game I had my eye on for a while anyway.
237440	240960	I haven't played it yet, but you know, I will four months from now when I get really
240960	241960	bored.
241960	242960	Right.
242960	243960	Uh, no, hopefully sooner than that.
243960	248600	But before that I bought Mortal Kombat, the, the, the reboot, Mortal Kombat nine or whatever.
248600	249920	No, I guess it really was eight.
249920	250920	I don't know.
250920	251920	Whatever.
251920	252920	You know what I'm talking about?
252920	255680	The reboot Mortal Kombat, uh, was the last thing I bought on steam, even though I already
255680	260120	owned it on PS3, but the steam one was so cheap and it's like, Oh, this one comes with
260120	266360	Freddy Krueger and, and all the other characters, Kenshi and, um, so whatever.
266360	268840	Yeah, they did re-release the Mortal Kombat game.
268840	272080	Uh, they did like a game of the year edition with, yeah, that's what I bought on steam
272080	276500	or whatever it was, but yeah, I mean they've got, you know, like dead rising three look
276500	281960	kind of cool, but I don't think my, I don't think my laptop would run it very well.
281960	284540	So yeah, I just dumped all that money into my new PC.
284540	287720	So I no longer have to worry about, will my computer play this game?
287720	291440	Because the answer is yes, it will, at least for the next year or two, well, I'll be fine.
291440	292440	You know?
292440	293440	Yeah.
293440	298800	I mean, it's just, I don't want to really right now, I'm trying to focus on finishing
298800	299800	my game.
299800	306080	So that's why I haven't been buying anything or playing anything because you know, I don't
306080	308000	want to be distracted from that.
308000	313620	Although I may force myself to actually play something just because I sometimes maybe need
313620	317500	a distraction just to kind of take a break from it, you know, for a little bit.
317500	319420	But I don't know.
319420	325180	I just, there's not really anything new out there that I'm like, Oh, I got to play that.
325180	328420	You know, it's like so brand new, like, Oh, I need to get a copy of that.
328420	332820	Um, well there's having come back off of the E3 episode last week, there were certainly
332820	335300	some games I saw there where I'm like, Ooh, I definitely want to get that one.
335300	340320	That's out, you know, uh, on the PC front, this will surprise nobody, but civilization
340320	343140	beyond earth, uh, looks, um, right up my alley.
343660	347020	Well, yeah, I mean, some of those games are cool, like No Man's Sky and stuff when that
347020	348020	comes out on PC.
348020	349820	Hell yeah, I'd want to pick that up.
349820	354140	But you know, right now there's not really anything like indie that's like super, I mean,
354140	357660	there's a couple like I've seen a Kickstarter stuff that looked kind of cool that maybe
357660	361020	I'll pick up when they come out, but there's not really anything that I like that's out
361020	364580	there right now that's on the marketplace of like, Ooh, I really, really need that.
364580	368540	You know, what I found has been extraordinarily useful for finding new games on steam that
368540	372420	are, you know, things that have not been on my radar, but they're usually indie because
372420	376340	you know, ever since Greenlight started, indies have really, really, really become
376340	377460	very prevalent on steam.
377460	378940	They're doing very well there.
378940	383180	And you know, a lot of them are, are, are really low value, you know, under $10.
383180	385660	Some of them go on sale, they're like $2.50, right?
385660	389820	So what's been really useful for finding a lot of those steam keywords have been like,
389820	393460	I got to say that was actually a really cool feature they implemented because like, you
393460	398340	know, I might be looking at a game's page and then I'll see that the, um, the keywords
398340	402180	on the game are like JRPG or something and I'll be like, Ooh, I wonder, I wonder what
402180	405220	the big selling JRPGs are because you can click on that keyword and then you sort like
405220	408980	what are the top sellers, what are the new or like roguelike or, you know, things like
408980	409980	that.
409980	415420	Like, like categories that the games aren't often sorted into, like, you know, action
415420	420220	adventure sports, you know, you get a little more specific than that, which has been really
420220	421300	good for targeting games.
421300	424380	I think they've got some like super hot, look pretty cool.
424380	426980	Like I'd want to kind of check that out.
427980	432820	There is one, it's a Devolver Digital's new game that they published.
432820	438100	It was, um, I figured it was a, it was a kind of a rogue-like first person shooter game.
438100	441380	I think it's called Bullets or Six Bullets or something like that.
441380	443700	It's a game where you're fighting these monsters.
443700	449140	It's kind of a retro arcade looking title, but, um, you have to go and pick up your bullets
449140	450420	because you only have six bullets.
450420	454640	So you shoot something and you have to go run and pick up your bullet, um, and before
454640	456600	you, more monsters attack you.
456600	460680	So, I don't know, I have to look at some of that stuff, but right now there's not really
460680	463360	anything that jumps up that like I really want to play.
463360	467440	Just mainly because, you know, if there is something like maybe like Arma 3 or something,
467440	472160	which I have Arma 2 and I still haven't fucking touched that game, so I don't know, but, uh,
472160	476400	it looks interesting, but that'd be something I'd want to sink, you know, several hours
476400	477400	into.
477400	481520	Like, I was like, oh, I could get South Park, but I already have it on 360, so I don't really
481520	486520	need to buy it on PC as well, but, ooh, I could get that game, but it wasn't really
486520	487520	marked down that much.
487520	491760	I just, I don't know, there's not really anything that's really jumping out at me.
491760	496000	All right, so I need to introduce our chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night
496000	498640	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
498640	501820	The time is six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern to catch our show.
501820	506120	That's right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and of course you can participate live along
506120	510360	with our show at the chat room, which is at live.vognetwork.com because we are the show
510360	515000	where every gamer has a voice, including actdeft, who's clarifying some information
515000	519920	about the sale, saying they used to do a spring sale, but this year they didn't, though the
519920	521700	big sales are summer and winter.
521700	525600	Now some other voices in chat rooms reminding us not to forget about other sites.
525600	529560	You know, we talk Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, but I see a lot of chatter about Humble Bundle,
529560	532080	although I don't think there's a main Humble Bundle going on right now.
532080	533680	There's always like the weekly as they do those, right?
533680	534680	They have one at the store.
534680	536380	No, they have one going on right now.
536380	539640	They have the games done quick, Humble Bundle, but it's not really a Humble Bundle.
539640	543880	It's like, you know, you have to pay 25 bucks as the minimum to get a bunch of stuff, but
543880	546360	it's like quite a few games.
546360	547360	They're all pretty good.
547360	552760	They have like the Gianna Sisters, Twisted Dreams in there, and there was a bunch of
552760	556080	other ones, and I think Stanley Parable and stuff was a part of that.
556080	557080	So those are pretty good.
557080	560680	There's also like the other non-Humble Bundle sites, like Indie Royale.
560680	565440	Well, I was gonna say, fifth dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says GOG,
565440	568740	or Good Old Games, is getting more money from me than Steam this weekend, and DungeonBuster
568740	569740	adding to that.
569740	573620	Good Old Games is having a summer sale, too, for classic titles and some not-so-classic
573620	574620	titles.
574620	575620	Yeah, that's good.
575620	581900	Also, like I said, the Indie Royale, Indie Gala, there's one other one that they have,
581900	583500	too, that's out there.
583500	588820	But those also have, usually it's a lot of like kind of secondary stuff, but you can
588820	590100	get stuff really cheap on there.
590100	595940	They have bundles for three bucks, four bucks, and it's usually like eight games in there.
595980	599820	And of course, there's always gotta be those people that do the anti-sale, right?
599820	603940	Remember Cards Against Humanity on Black Friday jacked the price of their game up by $5, and
603940	605380	people still paid it, right?
605380	610780	But I'm looking in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, our pal Bobby Blackwolf is in there sending
610780	616860	over a tweet from At Fork Parker, who said, all Devolver Digital games are double the
616860	621660	price in Portugal for the next 24 hours, which, if you don't catch the reference, appears
621660	626060	to be a direct response to the World Cup game that just took place, which resulted
626060	633220	in a tie, which I don't follow a lot of soccer if it's not preceded by Mega Man, which I
633220	637140	believe puts the U.S. in a not-so-great position where they have to go up against Germany,
637140	638140	which is really good, too.
638140	642900	I think, yeah, he was saying, though, if U.S. did win the World Cup, that he would give
642900	647660	away a thousand copies of Broforce, but he's like, I'm not actually gonna do that because
647660	651820	they know there's no way they're gonna win or something.
651820	652820	I love his humor.
652820	653820	It's hilarious.
653820	654820	Yeah.
654820	655820	Good times.
655820	656820	Good times.
656820	657820	Let's see here.
657820	658820	So, let's see if there's any other.
658820	661980	Oh, yes, I did have another kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight before we got
661980	665220	all on the tangent about steam sales.
665220	669060	You know, we talk about new games here on OLR, but we love classic games, too, right?
669060	672380	Dark Soccer, she always does the classic game of the week, although I'll do one tonight
672380	676780	since she's not here, but we, you know, we try to find the balance between the classics
676780	678260	and the new stuff, right?
678260	683620	So, I love stories like these, and this has been making its way around Facebook and Twitter
683620	684620	and all the social media.
684620	686940	This kind of went viral, so I bet a lot of you guys have seen this.
686940	688660	I don't know if you've seen this, Loki.
688660	696020	A brand new trick discovered in Super Mario Brothers, as in the NES launch title here
696020	700700	in the States, Super Mario Brothers, right, where now there's a new way to get unlimited
700700	705940	one-ups, and we all knew about, like, at the end of a level, you could bounce the Koopa
705940	707420	Troopa on the staircase over and over.
707420	709420	Yeah, it's like 3-1 or 3-1.
709420	711820	Yeah, that's a really hard trick to do, though.
711820	714060	I don't know if I've ever pulled that off successfully.
714060	717980	And you can also, in, you know, the Minus World was something that was discovered, you
717980	720300	know, not long after the game's release and all that stuff.
720300	725060	Well, somebody found a new trick that you can do in the game, and this was something
725060	728980	that I guess was discovered on, like, a YouTuber or whatever.
728980	735700	Keep in mind this game is 30 years old, and what happened is that they were kind of ping-ponging
735700	740980	against Mario and Luigi, and what they found is that, in order to do this, you have to
740980	744900	go through the game one whole time, because this is something you can only get on the
744900	747340	second quest, okay?
747340	752380	You take Player 1's Mario to the second level of the game and throw away your first life.
752380	758100	Then you have Luigi take over and get all the way to World 5-2, but if you're good at
758100	761740	Mario Brothers, you Super Mario Brothers, it shouldn't be too hard for you, right?
761780	765780	And you get to the hidden Beanstalk block that's halfway through the stage.
765780	772620	What you do is Luigi starts climbing the vine, but you wait and then get killed by the Hammer
772620	774540	Brother that's right there.
774540	779540	And what that does is that causes you to get killed while the vine is growing.
779540	782960	So when you switch back from Luigi to Mario, guess what?
782960	784720	The vine keeps growing.
784720	788900	And suddenly this vine appears in World 1-2 at the very beginning, and all you have to
788900	792660	do is you use that to bounce on one of those little beetles, because all the Goombas at
792660	797420	the beginning become beetles in the second quest, and there you go, unlimited 1-Ups.
797420	799540	Now, obviously that's not easy.
799540	800540	It's not an easy thing to do.
800540	806820	It's also very ridiculous considering that you're already to Level 5, or World 5 in the
806820	807820	game, so.
807820	808820	On the second quest.
808820	810660	On the second quest, it's like, I don't care, whatever.
810660	815220	But, you still got to admit, 30 years after the game comes out, finding new bugs and new
815220	819820	glitches and, you know, finding other things beneath the surface is pretty darn cool.
819820	824140	Because obviously with this really convoluted trick, nobody was going to find this right
824140	825140	away.
825140	826900	But it's, you know, still pretty cool.
826900	827900	So.
827900	828900	Yeah.
828900	829900	Yeah.
829900	832860	Any glitches in old games that you always enjoyed?
832860	835340	Like especially when you were younger as a gamer?
835340	837340	Hidden secrets and things?
837340	840540	I don't know.
840540	846140	I just remember, the only one I could think of, it was kind of stupid, but in, was it
846140	849620	GoGlo 13 on the NES, you can make a moonwalk.
849620	850620	Really?
850620	855180	Yeah, you can get it so that the anima- like he's stuck one way and you can move a different
855180	856660	direction so it looks like he's moonwalking.
856660	857660	Nice.
857660	858660	That's kind of fun.
858660	862660	I was always a fan of the custom passwords that were put in games, which I guess was
862660	864180	probably for debug or whatever.
864180	867600	But, you know, you could put like in Metroid, what, Justin Bailey and, you know, have it
867600	868600	underlined or whatever.
868680	875240	You could do the Kid Icarus, you could do what, the Terror, Danger, Horror, god damn
875240	877880	it, I don't remember the- oh I think it's just a bunch of exclamation points is the
877880	879200	last one you put.
879200	884240	So and then that is like, you start part way through the game with this weird configuration
884240	885480	of items and things like that.
885480	888120	So I don't know, I always kind of like that stuff.
888120	893280	Because you know, when those games didn't have save batteries here in the US, you know,
893280	896460	because they were disc system games in Japan, they came over here, they don't have batteries
896460	900060	or whatever, like that was really the only way you could be like, I just want to sit
900060	903020	down and beat the game real quick in one sitting.
903020	906900	You know, there's no warp whistles like there are in Mario Brothers or something like that.
906900	909420	If you just want to spend 30 minutes you want to beat through the game, you have to use
909420	911100	these, you know, crazy passwords.
911100	912100	So I kind of always like things like that.
912100	917580	I remember we used to mess with Game Genie codes, especially in like, was it Street Fighter
917580	922340	or yeah, Street Fighter 2 and stuff where you'd do the codes to get, play as, you know,
922340	925860	the boss characters in there, but it wasn't really the boss characters.
925860	931100	It was just kind of the boss character skins on like Ryu or something like that.
931100	937260	And so you'd have, you know, he could do that with like, okay, I want block on the Ryu skin.
937260	939460	So you do like, you know, a hurricane kick or whatever.
939460	944620	And he's just like in this shock, you know, a shock animation while he's flying across
944620	948500	the screen or, you know, if he did E Honda, he'd be doing the hundred hand slab as he
948500	949500	flies across the screen.
949500	950500	Oh yeah.
950500	954020	I never had a Game Genie, but I always, I think I've like borrowed one from a friend
954020	955020	or something.
955020	958580	Cause I, yeah, you could put in some crazy codes on those that, you know, which was,
958580	962340	which was probably the equivalent of like editing the registry on a game or something
962340	966260	on a PC, you know, like where you could, you know, really screw some things up by changing
966260	967260	values.
967260	972860	Um, but yeah, that was, that was some good times with the, uh, Game Genie.
972860	978940	And then, uh, our, my, my other favorite was watching, um, my friend's copy of Akari Warriors
978940	980700	that was just really glitchy.
980700	986340	Like, it was like dirty or something, but it would get glitchier as we'd play through
986340	987340	the game.
987340	992300	So like at one point, like, Hey, I'm stuck under the background now, uh, I can't really
992300	995300	attack anything, but I'm going to keep following you guys.
995300	1000860	And I don't know, it's just, it was really silly cause it would just be completely messed
1000860	1001860	up.
1001860	1005100	Uh, Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com is talking about all the, all the ones from
1005100	1007100	Street Fighter II, the World Warrior.
1007100	1011260	You could turn Dalzium invisible with the right button combo or Guile's various tricks
1011260	1012500	and you could even reboot the game.
1012500	1013500	Yeah.
1013500	1016740	Wasn't there the whole like quote unquote handcuffing, you know, Guile's handcuffs or
1016740	1020220	something that was like, that was like a, uh, arcade urban legend, but like you can
1020220	1023440	do it on the super Nintendo version, but it really was just that you like stun the other
1023440	1025620	character or something and it caused the game to reboot.
1025620	1026620	I don't know.
1026620	1027620	My memory is a little fuzzy on that.
1027620	1028620	Sorry guys.
1028620	1033180	But, uh, yeah, I also liked codes that would like really change the nature of the game
1033180	1035580	because you guys all know I love the guardian legend, right?
1035580	1038660	It's like one of those eight bit Nintendo classics that, you know, I think it was really
1038660	1042660	underrated at the time, but in retrospect it was like, so fricking phenomenal.
1042660	1044620	Well, there was a code in that game.
1044620	1048540	If you just put TGL as the password, you just put TGL.
1048540	1053980	What happens is that it removes all of these Zelda-esque stages, the overworld parts of
1053980	1056760	the game, and it just becomes a straight up shooter.
1056760	1058100	You just play the shooter stages.
1058100	1059100	That's all you do.
1059100	1061420	So it was like, it kind of like changes the nature of the game in a way.
1061420	1063820	I always thought that was kind of cool.
1063860	1067180	And you'd even get like, I think you'd get random power ups that you would get from the
1067180	1069140	overworld stages, like after each stage.
1069140	1073260	So it's like they built this mode of the game specifically for people to be able to play
1073260	1074780	like just a shooter.
1074780	1077140	That's kind of neat.
1077140	1079500	And Dr. Sui says the handcuffs was only in the arcade version.
1079500	1080500	All right.
1080500	1081500	My bad guys.
1081500	1082500	That was like 20 years ago.
1082500	1083660	All right.
1083660	1084660	So game glitches.
1084660	1085660	Good times.
1085660	1086660	Good times.
1086660	1089980	See if there's any other comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1090020	1095220	Dungeon Buster says turning the power on and off really quickly with the Atari VCS created
1095220	1096660	screwy game effects.
1096660	1097940	I don't remember that.
1097940	1101420	I seem to remember there was something though where we would sit there and we'd reset the
1101420	1103940	game like 30 times to get something to happen.
1103940	1106340	My memory is really fuzzy, but I remember something with that.
1106340	1109060	Cause you know, like the switches on that thing were really, there were like these little
1109060	1113060	nubs you'd push up and like the reset one, you could literally flick.
1113060	1116180	And like, I remember sitting there flicking it like 30 times to get something to happen.
1116180	1118300	I don't remember what.
1118300	1119580	That's a really horrible story.
1119580	1120580	Isn't it?
1120580	1122020	You guys, something really cool will happen.
1122020	1126100	I think, but I don't know, but I was like six at the time.
1126100	1131380	So just try it on all your games.
1131380	1134740	Tiger Claw asks, what does TGL stand for?
1134740	1139180	The guardian legend, Tiger Claw, the name of the game.
1139180	1141740	Perhaps you missed me saying that was the name of the game.
1141740	1143340	Uh, let's see.
1143340	1146900	Tiger Claw also says, I remember back in the days would play metal gear on the NES.
1146900	1150940	I used to try to enter random passwords into the game and sometimes get lucky when the
1150940	1155500	game loads with certain number of items I couldn't find before making the game easier
1155500	1156500	to play through.
1156500	1157500	Huh.
1157500	1158500	Interesting.
1158500	1163140	Uh, back in the day when they had gaming codes in the back of magazines, not anymore.
1163140	1164700	That's part of a DLC pack.
1164700	1165700	Yeah.
1165700	1166700	Or yeah.
1166700	1172460	I go to game facts.com if there are even codes in the game, which what, what recent games
1172460	1174080	have those types of codes in them?
1174080	1175080	Not a lot.
1175080	1177840	I thought a five did, and I'm sure there's other games out there.
1177840	1178840	Yeah.
1178840	1182120	Well sometimes also some companies kind of do it like intentionally, especially a lot
1182120	1186020	of the indie stuff that tries to invoke the retro vibe we'll, we'll do that.
1186020	1188520	So all right, nice.
1188520	1191200	Uh, and dungeon buster says it was really random.
1191200	1195940	We just kept going at it with the, uh, resetting on the Atari until it created a bizarro screen
1195940	1198200	that we try to play with whatever game we had.
1198200	1201200	It sounds like, like the kill screen on Pacman or something.
1201200	1202200	I don't know.
1202200	1203200	All right.
1203200	1204200	All right.
1204320	1207380	The talk is fine and we'll do more of it later with the classic game of the week, but let's
1207380	1211200	talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this
1211200	1213640	week, whether they be new or old.
1213640	1214640	Logie?
1214640	1218080	Uh, the only thing I played this week was modern warfare two because it had been several
1218080	1221120	weeks since our, our kind of group got together and played.
1221120	1225560	So I'm like, Hey, uh, you guys want to play modern warfare two because it's been several
1225560	1228000	weeks since we've played our game and they said yeah.
1228000	1232280	And then I kicked the crap out of them in a very vicious way.
1232280	1235880	Uh, I did notice a lot of places I can actually climb up on.
1235880	1236880	So that's, that's kind of fun.
1236880	1240280	I like, I kind of doing that kind of thing, but, um, yeah, it was fun.
1240280	1241280	I had fun.
1241280	1245980	Um, that was about it cause I didn't really play anything else.
1245980	1246980	Even programming a lot.
1246980	1248200	I've been looking at your Twitter.
1248200	1249200	Yeah.
1249200	1250200	Putting updates on your game.
1250200	1251200	Well, okay.
1251200	1257160	So like I decided to change up how, um, cause right when I originally had it, I had a, an
1257160	1260960	Atlas, which is basically just, it's a big texture file.
1260960	1265320	Instead of having several textures, you have one big texture with several textures inside
1265320	1269400	of it and you just kind of move where it looks for that texture.
1269400	1270400	So, okay.
1270400	1275760	Looks at, you know, 50% over on the top or, you know, 75%, et cetera, et cetera.
1275760	1276880	So that's how I had it.
1276880	1277880	The change colors.
1277880	1279080	I'm like, well, I don't really need to do that.
1279080	1281120	I want some additional like detail in there.
1281120	1285080	So I'm going to add a bump map to it so I can have a little bit of a texture and it
1285080	1286080	looks better.
1286080	1290000	And then I can just change the colors with the vertex colors cause in the actual like
1290040	1296920	3D mesh, you can save a color and some people use that for like blending between two textures
1296920	1298840	or actually change the color of something.
1298840	1301520	So in this case, I'm actually going to use it to change the color.
1301520	1302520	So I'm like, okay, fine.
1302520	1307740	That's, I'll just change it up and I'll create this texture and we'll go with that.
1307740	1313120	And then I was looking at the code for each mesh and I realized that the program they
1313160	1319400	had for the, I guess, add on they had for the Atlas thing was really fucking up all
1319400	1320560	my meshes.
1320560	1321880	It was like screwing up.
1321880	1327040	They have this thing called the UV, which basically says, okay, here's how I'm going
1327040	1330360	to draw this texture on this object.
1330360	1333060	So you set, okay, here's where this corner goes.
1333060	1335280	Here's where this corner goes.
1335280	1340880	And you just kind of lay it out so that it knows how to put the texture on that object.
1340880	1346200	And it, all it was doing was creating a single point where it was putting the texture.
1346200	1351040	So I didn't notice it on these objects because I was using a solid color and so it would
1351040	1352800	still be a solid color anyways.
1352800	1355940	But when I actually wanted to put texture on it, it was just all fucked up.
1355940	1359180	So I had to write something to manually fix everything.
1359180	1365240	And so I'm just kind of, I finished that last night and I'm just have to fix all my UVs
1365240	1369800	and then actually save new meshes off of that.
1369800	1373400	And I'm going to delete, it'll allow me to also go back and cause I have like several
1373400	1377840	copies of all these 3D objects I've made when I've made changes to them that I have to keep
1377840	1378920	referencing too.
1378920	1380640	So I'm just going to clean all that out.
1380640	1384840	And it's just kind of funny because all these things I end up either buying or finding,
1384840	1390840	I ended up writing my own version of it because it either doesn't work right or I just end
1390840	1392680	up using my own version instead.
1392680	1395720	It sounds like it's been an extraordinarily educational project.
1395720	1396720	Exactly.
1396720	1397720	Well, that's the whole reason.
1397720	1398720	I hope you get through it.
1398720	1401000	I really hope you get something playable out of this.
1401000	1402000	Yeah.
1402000	1404640	I mean, that's the whole thing is why I went with the Atlas program anyways because I didn't
1404640	1405840	want to mesh.
1405840	1409560	Like I thought all this like, oh, working with meshes and UVs.
1409560	1412880	I don't understand any of this is really confusing to me.
1412880	1416560	And then when I actually did, I'm like, wow, actually that's not that confusing now that
1416560	1418400	I've messed with this.
1418400	1423960	And so now I can do cool things like I can manually modify my object and stuff like,
1423960	1428560	okay, I want to move this point over and I type in a new coordinate for it.
1428560	1433200	And hit build and I can see my changes and allows me to have like full access all over
1433200	1436880	the stuff instead of relying on a 3D program.
1436880	1440040	Because I've rebuilt my, you know, objects several times.
1440040	1443400	So this is the last time I'm doing it.
1443400	1447880	But yeah, it's just, I'm learning a lot through and it's kind of exciting in that sense.
1447880	1451380	And so I'm just trying the whole point of getting, you know, because I started building
1451380	1452380	an object.
1452380	1453380	So I was like, okay, cool.
1453380	1456260	I'm going to get to the point where I can actually build some stuff and then start working
1456260	1459620	on the game part again instead of just the engine part.
1459620	1463000	And you know, that's when I was like, okay, well, I just want to change how it looks because
1463000	1464620	everything was really plain.
1464620	1467680	It just wasn't, it didn't look right to me.
1467680	1473340	And so now that I'm, now I have to go back and change all that stuff and then I'll go
1473340	1478580	back to building assets again and start working on the actual game part.
1478580	1479580	Nice.
1479580	1484460	Um, but yeah, I mean, give me something playable for Christmas.
1484460	1485460	I'm working on it.
1485460	1486460	It's taking time.
1486460	1487460	All right.
1487460	1491220	Uh, well, if there's nothing else for your gaming week, I'll talk briefly about my gaming
1491220	1492220	week.
1492220	1497300	Although admittedly, uh, after getting back from LA, I had a high priority this week to
1497300	1499700	finish orange is the new black season two.
1499700	1503900	Look, it's, I don't watch a lot of TV shows, but I watched that one.
1503900	1507720	And because of the way Netflix's model is where people can binge watch everything in
1507720	1513120	a weekend, I have so many friends that do that and then start spoiling everything.
1513120	1517680	So like I, I'm afraid to go to certain places on the internet, Tumblr being one of them
1517680	1520840	because I knew I would get spoiled on orange is the new black.
1520840	1526000	So I finally sat down, watched the whole thing and, uh, I'm not, I won't, don't worry.
1526000	1527280	I'm not going to spoil anything about it.
1527280	1529360	I will just say I finished it finally.
1529360	1532320	So I could finally use some of that time to play video games again.
1532320	1535200	Uh, so I did check out a few games.
1535200	1538440	I did check out at least one new game this week and then I went back and revisited one
1538440	1539440	too.
1539440	1542200	Uh, the new game I checked out this week is available on PlayStation four.
1542200	1544320	I believe it's on PC.
1544320	1545960	I saw it on Wii U as well.
1545960	1549000	Uh, it is called 1001 spikes.
1549000	1553200	And speaking of retro games, Xbox indie even, is it really, that's where I think it first
1553200	1554200	started with.
1554200	1555200	Oh, interesting.
1555200	1556200	Indie games.
1556200	1557200	Well now it's on a lot of other places too.
1557200	1559600	It's on a PlayStation four is where I checked it out myself.
1559600	1561880	Uh, it's very much a retro game.
1561880	1566620	Like this is like the, it's like eight bit nes straight up.
1566620	1571940	Like the sound, the way it plays, the controls, like all that stuff just really feel like
1571940	1575380	an old school eight bit nes game, but of course for widescreen.
1575380	1579700	So it's a little weird to be playing something like that on the PlayStation four, but hey,
1579700	1584260	you know, I realized the whole retro stuff is kind of in right now and it is, it is kind
1584260	1585660	of fun to play.
1585660	1591060	Um, so in a sense it's a bit of a puzzler game, but it's like a puzzler mixed with
1591060	1592300	like super meat boy.
1592300	1598300	It's one of those things where you're going to do this level over and over and over again
1598300	1602380	and you're going to go crazy doing it because these spikes will pop out of the ground that
1602380	1606020	you didn't realize were there before and boo, you're dead.
1606020	1608180	And uh, you know, all those sorts of things.
1608180	1613180	You have to kind of like memorize how the level is laid out in order to really get,
1613180	1614900	you know, through the level.
1614900	1618260	And the reason why it's called the thousand one spikes, I believe is because you have
1618260	1620140	1001 lives.
1620140	1622600	So every time you lose a life, you go down.
1622600	1627900	So I think, I think I only beat the first world and I'm super meat boy in a way.
1627900	1631620	Yeah, but you're still limited on the number of lives and super meat boy, you didn't, you
1631620	1633060	weren't really limited on it.
1633060	1636640	So it's, it's a little bit of that scare factor because like, Oh shit, I need to not die so
1636640	1641260	much because I just got through world one and I was down to like 980 lives.
1641260	1644140	I was like, I need to stop being so stupid on some of these things I'm doing.
1644140	1649100	I want to see is I want to see them bring, I want to be the guy to like steam and um,
1649100	1651380	you know, like Wii U or something like that.
1651380	1652860	I think that would be funny.
1652860	1653860	Yeah.
1653860	1660220	Cause I remember trying to play on, you know, I want to be the guy guide in and that's fucking
1660220	1661220	hard.
1661220	1662540	Even the original game is fucking hard.
1662540	1663540	Yeah.
1663540	1667420	Uh, dark to see you in chat says I've heard 1000 spikes was tough.
1667420	1668420	Yes.
1668420	1670740	Like when I compare it to super meat boy, there's a reason for that because it's that
1670740	1671740	whole infuriating.
1671740	1672740	Damn it.
1672740	1673740	I died.
1673740	1674740	Damn it.
1674740	1675740	I died again.
1675740	1676740	God damn it.
1676740	1682300	I was almost complete with that, but I had the DRM free version so that I don't think
1682300	1684140	that transferred over to my steam version.
1684140	1686460	I'm like, I don't want to play this again.
1686460	1690980	I only have like a, like one or two of those things left to get, you know?
1690980	1695100	Oh, and then here's the other thing too, because on PlayStation four, so every time you die,
1695100	1699900	the controller like flashes pink, like, so like you see, like I see it on my hands cause
1699900	1702840	like, you know, the way I'm holding a controller, especially if I'm playing in a dark room.
1702840	1705860	So when I die, it's like my room lights up slightly.
1705860	1709580	Like you're an idiot.
1709580	1713340	So it's interesting how that little controller light is really added a lot to so many different
1713340	1715700	games, especially to those who tend to play in like dark rooms.
1715700	1717820	So the TV lights, the thing.
1717820	1720820	So there you go.
1720820	1725580	Fifth dream says you can use the Konami code for 3 million and three lives.
1725580	1726580	Is that, is that real?
1726580	1729260	I didn't know that if that's a thing that's pretty funny.
1729260	1731220	So let's see.
1731220	1732220	So there you go.
1732220	1733220	Sorry.
1733220	1735380	I'm laughing at this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1735380	1739220	This is something you said, Loki orange, orange launch radio is the new black Wolf.
1739220	1740220	Yeah.
1740220	1741220	Cause someone said, yeah.
1741220	1742780	An active to the orange laundry is a new black.
1742780	1744260	So yeah, I like that.
1744260	1745260	That's funny.
1745260	1746260	That's funny.
1746260	1747260	All right.
1747260	1748260	Uh, okay.
1748260	1749820	So I did revisit a classic this week too.
1749820	1757680	So you guys know Shane, good Palomine friends, a very long time, and Shane has this really
1757680	1758680	good ability.
1758680	1763820	If you weren't aware to talk people into, to talk people into buying and playing games
1763820	1765620	that they probably wouldn't have done otherwise.
1765620	1766620	Right.
1766620	1768380	Like the man should sell video games for a living.
1768380	1772940	Like I realize it's kind of what you do, Loki, but like Shane's really, really, really good
1772940	1773940	at it.
1773940	1774940	Right.
1774940	1779500	So, um, the game he convinced me to give another go to so I could play with him and one of
1779500	1787700	his other friends he plays MMOs with is five has the 11, the classic and uh, you look your
1787700	1788900	needs to go free to play.
1788900	1792340	I mean, seriously, that, that would ruin my life though.
1792380	1796740	Well, and my God is the, there's the system to like get your character activated and all
1796740	1797740	stuff of that game.
1797740	1798740	It's a mess.
1798740	1802820	Like, because you know, the play online system is so old, like they've really had to kind
1802820	1810300	of backend all this new stuff, like the Square Enix global ID and all this stuff into the,
1810300	1812060	you know, the old play online thing.
1812060	1817060	So, um, but I did finally figure it out and I got it up and running and I'm being trolled
1817060	1822180	by Alan in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com who says, how many MMOs are you subscribed
1822180	1823180	to right now?
1823180	1824180	Just wondering.
1824180	1828260	I have three, three MMO subscriptions right now, but not on purpose.
1828260	1829260	Okay.
1829260	1830260	Here's what happened.
1830260	1833060	Finally I see 14 that one I'm like actively playing and I like a lot.
1833060	1839100	I did 11 for the lolz and you know, I'll talk more about that in a second, but my third
1839100	1844100	subscription, I accidentally got my world of Warcraft subscription renewed for another
1844100	1847700	month because I went back to that last month, just kind of on my own whim.
1847700	1849220	I was just like, Oh, I wonder what's changed.
1849220	1850220	What's different.
1850260	1852740	And the answer is nothing.
1852740	1857440	So I checked that out and I went to go like, Oh, I need to go cancel my game before it
1857440	1858940	recharges me for another month.
1858940	1863540	I log into the site and it had renewed the day before.
1863540	1864960	Yay.
1864960	1867380	So yeah, I ended up paying for that for another month.
1867380	1872620	So right now I have three subscriptions, but the world of Warcraft one will expire next
1872620	1876580	month and I'm not going back to that until the expansion is out.
1876580	1879180	And I don't think the final fantasy 11 one will last very long.
1879180	1881580	It's just kind of one of those, like for the lolz things.
1881580	1885140	But um, I will say this Loki, since I know you used to play the game for a long time
1885140	1889760	yet again, even though I just, I kinda flirted with this game about a year and a half ago
1889760	1893020	or so, you know, I was playing for a little bit and I talked about how like some of the
1893020	1896380	experiencing was different cause you use the books, you go out in the world and you find
1896380	1899500	the books and you, you can kill certain monsters that way.
1899500	1903660	Well, they added two new, like really, really major things into the game to make it a little
1903660	1907540	more less grindy and honestly more single player friendly.
1907540	1910300	And the hugest one is called the trust system.
1910300	1914180	And with the trust system, what happens is you get this quest and you'll go find certain
1914180	1921140	NPCs and they will allow you to basically clone them to make alter egos of them so that
1921140	1922920	they can join you in the world.
1922920	1924440	You summon them basically.
1924440	1927820	It's a new type of magic category called trust and you summon them.
1927820	1931800	And so it's like you have a party full of NPCs, but they're fully functioning party
1931800	1937140	members that will act like, you know, those class types should, for example, since I started
1937140	1942900	in one of the cities in 11 Bastok, um, you can talk to an NPC that is a warrior, Najee,
1942900	1944420	who's a warrior in Bastok.
1944420	1945420	And so he'll join your party.
1945420	1946460	So I have a tank.
1946460	1950460	So when I'm a red mage right now and I can cure myself, me and a tank make a pretty good
1950460	1951460	party.
1951460	1952460	Oh man.
1952460	1953460	Yeah.
1953460	1954460	And here's the thing.
1954460	1958900	You can have up to three of them at one time, man, a party of four anywhere you go.
1958900	1959900	Right.
1959900	1960900	Okay.
1960900	1961900	So that's one big thing.
1961900	1965980	And they, I guess just in the last update, they made it so that like if let's say Shane
1965980	1969760	and I are in a party, he can call two people.
1969760	1971540	I can call two more people.
1971540	1972540	We have a full party.
1972540	1974540	That'd be a party of six.
1974540	1975540	Yeah.
1975540	1976540	Is it a party?
1976540	1977540	Uh, final fantasy 11 parties for six people.
1977540	1978540	Really?
1978540	1979540	Yeah.
1979540	1980540	Wow.
1980540	1981540	Is five.
1981540	1982540	14 is four.
1982540	1983540	They all have to be different for some reason.
1983540	1984540	I don't remember.
1984540	1985540	It's been so long.
1985540	1986540	Yeah.
1986540	1987540	So, um, let's see.
1987540	1988540	So yeah, there's a that.
1988540	1991660	And then the other big, big thing they added to the game is something called the records
1991660	1994140	of eminence, I think is what it's called.
1994140	1995700	And it's, it's like achievements.
1995700	1996700	Okay.
1996700	2001100	It works like achievements, but they're achievements that get you rewards and it's rewards in the
2001100	2002940	form of XP.
2002940	2003940	Big one, right?
2003940	2008640	Gill and these like tabs or something that you can turn in for, um, armor and things
2008640	2010380	like that, uh, elsewhere.
2010380	2018760	Um, so it's like, you know, uh, kill 10 monsters in South Gustav Berg or, uh, do one, do a
2018760	2023500	move that does 11 to 20 damage 10 times or something like that.
2023500	2024500	That's cool.
2024500	2025500	Yeah.
2025500	2026500	When you do that, you get XP.
2026500	2027500	So it helps.
2027500	2028580	I wish this game would be a free to play.
2028580	2032580	So like in one night last night, I got to level 10 real quick or I'd be fine if they
2032580	2038220	just raised the price, let's just raise the price to like, you know, back to $50 again
2038220	2043100	and make it like buy to play, you know, like Guild Wars, uh, and fifth dream in our chat
2043100	2046300	over at live.vog network.com says, please do this in Final Fantasy 14.
2046300	2050660	Well, you know, it's interesting because, um, and the reason why I bring this up, cause
2050660	2053660	I'm sure some of you guys are getting put to sleep with the Final Fantasy 11 chatter.
2053660	2056460	If you're not laughing at the fact that I went back to a game that's like 12 years old
2056460	2057460	or whatever.
2057460	2058460	Who cares?
2058460	2062480	Well, I will be, I think it's interesting to go back to these aging MMOs and see how
2062480	2069420	they're keeping themselves playable when their user base is dwindling fast, because obviously
2069420	2074740	Final Fantasy 14 tore a big piece of 11's fan base out, you know, cause a lot of people
2074740	2078780	moved on to 14, even though the games are very, very different in how they play, you
2078780	2083020	know, because Final Fantasy 11 is more rooted in EverQuest and Final Fantasy 14 is more
2083020	2086740	rooted in this weird Warcraft Guild Wars 2 hybrid thing.
2086740	2087740	Okay.
2087740	2091820	So they play very different at its core, but, um, I still think 14 kind of took a lot of
2091820	2096460	11's players, but there's still, you know, uh, I did a slash C all so you can see all
2096460	2097460	the people on the server.
2097460	2101940	There were still like 1800 people logged into the server yesterday that I was playing on.
2101940	2104220	So kind of interesting.
2104220	2105740	Lots and lots of level 99's.
2105740	2106740	That's for sure.
2106740	2107740	Uh, let's see.
2107740	2108740	Let's see.
2108740	2109740	So let's see.
2109740	2116340	Um, over at, uh, live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says, Shane's should be VOG's official PR
2116340	2117340	person.
2117340	2118340	Not a bad idea.
2118340	2121060	If he'd be willing to do it, he could probably, uh, get us some more listeners maybe.
2121060	2125700	Uh, Alan, who of course is, is my boyfriend is in chat and talking about, uh, listening
2125700	2127680	to me play Final Fantasy 11.
2127680	2130900	And when you try to sell him a game, he's like, this is stupid forever and I'll never
2130900	2131900	play it forever.
2131900	2133380	And he stays true to his word.
2133380	2134560	He will never play it.
2134560	2138640	But this guy is like, Shane, stop it and look at what happens.
2138640	2142920	Uh, he's, that is all in response to Shane is the worst enabler.
2142920	2143920	So there you go.
2143920	2150640	So yeah, I went back to Final Fantasy 11, but I don't, I don't know how long it'll last.
2150640	2155760	I mean, it's still, I gotta say there's still things about 11 that hold up very well after
2155760	2156760	12 years.
2156760	2160240	The graphics are starting to show their age a little bit, but you know, especially on
2160240	2164440	the PC where you can kind of up the resolutions and everything through some registry edits,
2164440	2166680	it doesn't look bad.
2166680	2169680	You know, it's still, I mean, it was a game on the 360 and it probably looks about like
2169680	2170840	that on your PC.
2170840	2173780	So it's still, you know, has that the music is still great.
2173780	2176840	The class design is really fantastic.
2176840	2180680	There's so many classes in the game and the fact that you can have a main job and you
2180680	2186640	get a sub job where you get half the levels of whatever second job you want and that you
2186640	2188640	can switch those jobs on demand at any time.
2188640	2192520	You know, that whole system is really fantastic and I can't think of anything really like
2192520	2194560	it in other MMOs.
2194560	2199720	So cause even 14 doesn't have sub jobs, it has cross-classing, which is kind of a different
2199720	2200720	thing.
2200720	2201720	Oh man.
2201720	2205640	Final Fantasy 11 HD free to play.
2205640	2206640	Dream on.
2206640	2207640	Dream on.
2207640	2208640	It is.
2208640	2211080	Well, there was those rumors about a Vita version a long time ago, but then it's like,
2211080	2212600	how would you chat on the Vita version?
2212600	2213600	Who cares?
2213600	2214600	Voice chat.
2214600	2215600	Screw it.
2215600	2217800	Who cares?
2217800	2221080	Act Deft in chat says the only thing that's stopping Shane from conquering the world is
2221080	2222080	apathy.
2222080	2223080	Whatever.
2223080	2224080	All right.
2224080	2225080	So there you go.
2225080	2227120	I've been playing a little bit of that as well.
2227120	2232220	And then I've been continuing to play Final Fantasy 14 as well and some Mario Kart 8 today
2232220	2236360	as well, which moving into our housekeeping segment, I will talk about now.
2236360	2238840	So I plugged this last week on the show.
2238840	2244920	We were going to do today a tournament for podcast cross zone, which is the panel that
2244920	2252280	ourselves, uh, horde house, uh, video game, realness, game, buoy.org, game bar, Koopa
2252280	2258140	club, all these podcasts coming together to do this panel at gamer X, uh, which is only
2258140	2261200	like two weeks away at this point, which I can't believe, but, um, yeah, we're all coming
2261200	2262200	together to do this panel.
2262200	2264600	So we wanted to bring awareness, you know, just try to get it out there.
2264600	2268260	So we had this tournament today, uh, and that happened a couple hours before the show tonight.
2268260	2269260	We had pretty good participation.
2269260	2272460	Uh, I guess everybody couldn't fit in one room.
2272460	2274260	So there was like several rooms going on.
2274260	2279420	Uh, and you know, you played 12 games to get your score and, uh, the whole thing was won
2279420	2283820	by Jeremy over at Koopa club, who I think got first place in almost every single race
2283820	2284820	he did.
2284820	2286740	Cause, uh, he's, I guess, scary.
2286740	2287740	Good.
2287740	2288740	Yeah.
2288740	2289740	I was not in the same room as he was.
2289740	2293040	I was in a room with like act deft from like OLR and stuff.
2293040	2297260	And I was with the guys from video game realness, uh, were in my, uh, battle.
2297260	2301020	So it was unfortunate that because there's so many people, we couldn't all really race
2301020	2302020	against each other.
2302020	2306100	It was still, I mean, it was still a loads of fun, uh, just kind of knowing that like
2306100	2311020	when I use the golden mushroom to fly past Delvin from video game, Rena realness, right
2311020	2314380	at the last minute, it's like, I can hear him screaming in my ear, right?
2314380	2317720	Like, Oh no, you didn't that type of thing.
2317720	2318720	So it was a lot of fun.
2318720	2330180	Uh, now as far as how I did, I have like the fourth from worst score out of everybody.
2330220	2332460	I'm just not that good at Mario Kart eight.
2332460	2333460	It's okay.
2333460	2334460	It's okay.
2334460	2335460	I don't know.
2335460	2337180	Some of these guys, they figure out how to get to the front of the pack right away and
2337180	2339860	they never, they never fall back.
2339860	2344060	Whereas I have the problem where when everything gets chaotic, I fall back to like 10th place
2344060	2345660	and then I have to keep catching up.
2345660	2350080	And if I'm lucky, I'll get all the way up to like third, but usually I end up in like
2350080	2351420	seventh place.
2351420	2354180	So there it is.
2354180	2355180	So yeah.
2355180	2360460	Congrats to Jeremy from Koopa club for winning the podcast cross zone tournament.
2360460	2364780	You bastard, even though they gave the prize because they did, they wanted to give the
2364780	2366280	prize to like a listener.
2366280	2369180	They gave it to somebody else and I unfortunately don't, don't remember who that was off the
2369180	2370180	top of my head.
2370180	2373240	Uh, but I think it was one of the listeners of Koopa club that ended up winning that.
2373240	2374900	So grats to you guys.
2374900	2378260	Speaking of Koopa club, um, they had me on as a guest on Friday.
2378260	2383580	We taped the show and uh, it was myself and some of the guys from Koopa club and a slide
2383580	2386220	kick from game buoy.org all did the show.
2386220	2388740	And I got to say it was really funny.
2388740	2392140	And we played, uh, we played Nintendo password.
2392140	2393700	Like you know how we do game shows here on OLR.
2393700	2394700	They do some on Koopa club too.
2394700	2396240	They do password is one of their games.
2396240	2401620	So, uh, we did Nintendo password and there were some crazy words, uh, which I'm not going
2401620	2406500	to give away what happens, but, uh, one of the passwords was, uh, fire.
2406500	2409420	I think it was fireball, right?
2409420	2412020	And I said fire and that wasn't good enough.
2412060	2418340	So the clue John gives me to try to get it is just like, what are you doing right now?
2418340	2419340	So check that out.
2419340	2423060	I don't think they posted it just yet, but Jeremy said he'd get it up today or tomorrow.
2423060	2425860	So it's episode 52 you're going to be looking for.
2425860	2430180	So they, they really edit their podcast together and, you know, shift segments around and put
2430180	2431180	music in it.
2431180	2434500	So it's a little, it takes them a little bit to edit it, but check that out.
2434500	2437420	That's Koopa with a Q club with a K.
2437420	2438420	So they're Q K.
2438420	2439900	So, uh, check that out.
2439940	2443620	Uh, I will be on episode 52 whenever that is posted.
2443620	2447820	Um, and that is really all I can think of for housekeeping because of podcast cross
2447820	2453660	zone and gamer X, there will be no show on July 12th, uh, but we should be here.
2453660	2458780	There's two more shows until then, um, our 12th birthday here at orange launch radio
2458780	2460020	is tomorrow.
2460020	2463540	Our very first episode was June 23rd, 2002.
2463540	2466860	Um, so we will be turning 12 years old tomorrow.
2466900	2470740	So we'll, uh, we didn't want to have a bunch of celebration though without dark soccer
2470740	2471740	here.
2471740	2474980	So we'll talk a little more and, and have some retrospective and reflection on 12 years
2474980	2479380	of orange launch radio next week, uh, on the 29th of June.
2479380	2480380	All right.
2480380	2482020	That's all I have for housekeeping.
2482020	2486540	Plugs for Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge
2486540	2487540	radio.
2487540	2489180	Let's get into some gaming news.
2489180	2490180	Loki.
2490180	2491180	All right.
2491180	2496180	So, um, apparently insomniac games does what Ubisoft doesn't.
2496220	2500860	And that would be, uh, they had, it was funny, they had this nice little teaser video as
2500860	2503700	talking about sunset overdrive and the customization.
2503700	2509620	And of course they said, you can play as a male character or as a female character and
2509620	2513620	all the customizations are completely neutral, um, or gender neutral.
2513620	2519780	So if you want to have a guy in a dress or you want, you know, a woman in, I don't know,
2519780	2523940	guy clothes, I guess, regular clothes, you can do that.
2523940	2527980	And what's kind of funny, a little tongue in cheek, I guess with the video, they have
2527980	2533500	the character dressed up like one of the assassins from assassin's creed, you know?
2533500	2535820	So, uh, that's pretty cool.
2535820	2539280	Well, at least, uh, lots of customization there cause I know all the gameplay that they've
2539280	2544980	shown so far has been kind of the, um, you know, punk rock looking, um, guy from the
2544980	2545980	game.
2545980	2549460	So, uh, very cool that they have that and apparently not impossible to do.
2549460	2553420	Um, so yeah, um, that word.
2553420	2557820	That was some pretty epic shade throwing by those guys, the whole Ubisoft thing.
2557820	2561660	But it's, it's one of the things where you kind of look at it and go, wow, that was a,
2561660	2565700	that was, that was some shade, but you kind of go, but that needed to happen.
2565700	2571900	Like Ubisoft needed to be spanked like that, you know, for that really insert, you know,
2571900	2573340	open mouth, insert foot comments.
2573340	2574340	Pretty ridiculous.
2574340	2580020	I mean, they could, they could just keep the animations with the same guy animations in.
2580020	2584820	I get it that, you know, in co-op, you're really just playing clones of the main character.
2584820	2587380	So that's all they have is what they should have said.
2587380	2588380	That's what they should have said.
2588380	2592740	Well, you know, we're, we don't have any customization because you're just playing clones of the
2592740	2593740	main character.
2593740	2594740	Done.
2594740	2595740	The topic done.
2595740	2596740	That's all you have to say.
2596740	2600660	And then said, you know, we do have some strong, diverse characters in this game, not, not
2600660	2602940	historically or whatever this whole, like we have a diverse team.
2602940	2607300	We're going to like, here are some other examples of diverse characters in the game.
2607300	2614260	And then if they can't name any, uh, well, there's a bigger problem Ubisoft, but, and
2614260	2618420	then, then I think they said even like, uh, maybe they're talking to the next Watch Dogs
2618420	2619420	game or something.
2619420	2621220	They were saying that they wouldn't be doing a female character.
2621220	2624820	I don't know if they are, or they were talking about the original Watch Dogs game, but there's
2624820	2628020	another game that they mentioned that also female characters weren't going to be a part
2628020	2629020	of.
2629020	2633380	But I just like, I think if they just say, explain that, listen, you know, we didn't
2633380	2636760	design any other characters other than, you know, any other playable characters other
2636760	2638120	than this main character.
2638120	2640680	And so that's why they play as clones.
2640680	2643800	I mean, you know, we, we don't have any other guy characters.
2643800	2645480	We don't have any other women characters.
2645480	2650600	We just, that's why we designed all these things and to go ahead and add any, you know,
2650600	2654360	if it was guy or women, you know, playable characters, it would have taken a lot more
2654360	2655360	time.
2655360	2656360	Keep it at that.
2656360	2659480	Keep it not, don't make gender a, an issue in it.
2659480	2663760	But when you say, oh, well, it's too hard to render women, you just, you're just asking
2663760	2664760	for trouble.
2664760	2665760	Stop talking.
2665760	2669120	You're making it worse.
2669120	2673480	So it's just, I don't know, sunset overdrive looks awesome.
2673480	2675640	And I'm glad to see that there's a lot of customization there.
2675640	2677640	So, um, it'll be kind of cool when that comes out.
2677640	2682320	I'm still waiting to hear when we're going to hear about the next Assassin's Creed, what
2682320	2686760	the current gen or not current gen last gen version, I guess that would be games com.
2686760	2690320	Maybe it was when they're going to announce that, Oh, I mean this, are they going to put
2690320	2695720	unity on the, it's unity is only on PlayStation four and Xbox one and PC still doing an assassin
2695720	2701960	street for the, they're doing one for a, it's like a, I thought it was like cosmos
2701960	2706400	or something like Assassin's creed cosmos or something that had to do with like space.
2706400	2707760	I don't remember what it is.
2707760	2712320	It's not actually in space, but it's just like, um, I was like, that's when you know
2712320	2715880	this series is dark when it's Assassin's creed in space.
2715880	2721880	That's a bit much like, isn't that when Friday the 13th on all the scary, like call of duty
2721880	2722880	ghosts.
2722880	2723880	Sure.
2723880	2724880	Call of duty ghosts.
2724880	2725880	They had a mission.
2725880	2729960	I think it was in the trailer where it was people fighting with, you know, sub machine
2729960	2733160	guns in space.
2733160	2734680	It was really, really ridiculous.
2734680	2739680	Uh, go into our chat room for some comments on this over at live.vognetwork.com JV Mon
2739680	2743680	says, sunset overdrive is my most anticipated game of the year.
2743680	2745000	You know, I don't think you're alone in that.
2745000	2748960	I think some people are going to finally pony up for an Xbox one because of this game.
2749040	2753440	I may or may not be one of them, but I also may or may not be more motivated by Forza
2753440	2758720	horizon two, which yes, I realize is on the 360, but it's going to be prettier on the
2758720	2760560	one and pretty is important.
2760560	2762160	Uh, let's see.
2762160	2766200	SSG100 Matt says there are some fights you can't win.
2766200	2767200	This is one of them.
2767200	2771480	Well, you know, like I said last week though, this was just the damn waiting to burst because
2771480	2774960	obviously there are some major problems in the industry.
2774960	2779840	There's some problems with some of the thoughts that go in the rationales behind them and
2779840	2780840	so forth.
2780840	2787160	And I think honestly, Ubisoft's comment, I hate to say it, but it had to happen so that,
2787160	2791600	and hear me out here, it had to happen so that people would get pissed off.
2791600	2796640	And so that we really start demanding change and diversity.
2796640	2800680	And there are people, there are lots of people that would like to see more of themselves
2800680	2801680	reflected in games.
2801680	2806640	And as we got into last week, that doesn't necessarily mean down with the straight white
2806640	2807640	male.
2807640	2809640	No, that is absolutely not what anybody's saying.
2809640	2812080	It's saying, how about options?
2812080	2814080	Oh, sorry.
2814080	2816920	It's too expensive, too expensive for options.
2816920	2818880	That was just really bad.
2818880	2821280	It was a really bad excuse if really what it was.
2821280	2827400	And if they literally just stayed with, listen, we designed, you know, this, this main character
2827400	2831720	and you play as clones of him in multiplayer and we didn't design any other characters
2831720	2836160	to play as, male or female, left it at that, then that would have been okay.
2836160	2837160	They're just lazy.
2837160	2840880	Instead of, no, they're just too lazy to create women in the game.
2840880	2844400	I mean, it's, it would have been, no, they're just too lazy to create any other characters
2844400	2845400	in the game.
2845400	2848760	But I think, you know, like I said a minute ago, we've been waiting for the damn to burst
2848760	2853880	on this for a little bit and this is something that, you know, unfortunately has to happen,
2853880	2859520	you know, so that the, all these guys developing the games kind of wake up and say, oh shit,
2859520	2863400	you know, there are a lot of people out there that want this, you know, or if it's not too
2863400	2867120	late, put a female lead in the PS3, Xbox 360 one.
2867120	2871720	I mean, they had one for the Vita, so it might be too late at this point for that.
2871720	2877360	But you know, again, or how about give some examples again of some of the characters.
2877360	2881520	I mean, cause what they said is that they said, we look forward to introducing some
2881520	2886400	strong female characters in Assassin's Creed Unity soon, and I'm sorry, but that comment
2886400	2890520	comes to me like, oh fuck, we haven't designed any, we better hurry up and do it to shut
2890520	2892520	everybody up.
2892520	2894880	That's how that comment hears to me, unfortunately.
2894880	2900480	So for better or worse, all right, anyway, not to, not to repeat everything from last
2900480	2903660	week, so let's move on to something else.
2903660	2909840	Following E3, some interesting financial news about one company and that is Capcom and some
2909840	2912920	interesting news coming out about shareholders.
2912920	2919560	And there's a vote going on right now to end the company takeover defense at Capcom.
2919560	2924240	Capcom could be taken over by a company that will, that could purchase large amounts of
2924240	2925680	its stock.
2925680	2931680	Now this causes the internet to go into a tizzy because this causes everybody to go,
2931680	2934000	OMG, who should buy Capcom?
2934000	2935000	Who's going to buy Capcom?
2935000	2936080	Is it going to be Nintendo?
2936080	2940000	They get all the, oh my God, Mega Man on Wii U exclusive.
2940000	2945840	Can you imagine if it was Warner Brothers, then we could finally get Street Fighter versus
2945840	2949440	Mortal Kombat.
2949440	2952720	Very interesting prospect there, I like that.
2952720	2957000	But here's another thing is that I also see a lot of this as hype, hype, hype in the media
2957000	2962720	because, just because they're open for that doesn't mean they will.
2962720	2969160	And I don't believe Capcom is actively seeking a bidder in this or is actually actively seeking
2969160	2970160	this.
2970160	2973080	But I mean of course when the shareholders do make a move like this it does sort of send
2973080	2974800	a message that, you know.
2974800	2978320	I gotta be honest though, their portfolio is not as strong as it used to be.
2978320	2983040	I mean it's like kind of, they're going the way of like Konami right now where, I mean
2983040	2984940	let's look at what they've got coming out this year.
2984940	2993880	They've got another Street Fighter IV version and that's about it.
2993880	3002420	I mean they have a new Phoenix Wright trilogy like re-release thing.
3002420	3007460	That's pretty much it, I mean there's just nothing else coming and nothing, I don't think,
3007460	3013100	I think they've got that, what was it, Deep Down or something like that, that tech demo
3013100	3014100	that they showed.
3014260	3018100	That was supposed to be coming at some point, but there's not really anything big, I mean
3018100	3022740	I'm assuming Street Fighter V is being worked on at some point, but they don't have, Resident
3022740	3027220	Evil is not as strong as it used to be anymore, Monster Hunter IV I guess would be something
3027220	3034980	on 3DS, but they just don't have, they don't have like Mega Man anymore really, and Dead
3034980	3039920	Rising is not as great as it used to be, I don't know.
3039920	3043860	Interesting comments in our chat room, JV Mon says, people just want Capcom bought out
3043860	3050540	because they're bitter about Mega Man Legends 3, I'm kind of over that, I don't think that's
3050540	3057380	far off the mark though, no, but I'm looking forward to, you know, Mighty No. 9 Legends
3057380	3060120	at some point.
3060120	3064240	As far as likely buyers for Capcom, you know, I don't know if it would necessarily be one
3064240	3068760	of the big companies, I mean, Deep Silver, I think it would be, nah, I think it would
3068760	3073020	be hilarious if it was somebody like Nintendo and I think Nintendo would be a great fit
3073020	3079100	honestly, but I just, I don't know, you know, I just, there's something about that match
3079100	3084220	up that doesn't really make a lot of sense to me, I honestly think the likely candidate
3084220	3088940	would be Bandai Namco, I kind of think would be, I could see as the one that would snatch
3088940	3091180	him up, but I, I don't know.
3091180	3096300	I don't know if they're rewinding, but I would think Deep Silver's been buying, well I mean
3096300	3100520	they bought THQ's, most of THQ's assets.
3100520	3102380	But did Nordic Games get a lot of that too?
3102780	3104980	Nordic got a bunch of their catalog.
3104980	3107020	They got the name too, right?
3107020	3112300	I don't know why, but yeah, I mean, they got that, but yeah, they've got a lot of the catalog,
3112300	3119180	they have MX vs ATV, but like most of the main franchises that they had were purchased
3119180	3124300	by Deep Silver, so I could see them maybe doing that, because Deep Silver also had,
3124300	3130380	who else did they buy, they bought another, well they bought another company too, but
3130380	3133580	I don't know.
3133580	3137500	So I don't know, I could see them doing that maybe, but yeah, I don't know if it means
3137500	3143820	necessarily that anybody's gonna buy them out right away, I just, I don't know.
3143820	3147900	Konami could use some extra titles, it would be kind of cool to roll that together, because
3147900	3151420	shit, I'm surprised Konami's not being bought out by anybody, because-
3151420	3155780	That's, that, well and I said that last week, it's funny, because I said last week, I said,
3155780	3160340	you know if anybody's probably gonna get bought in the next few months, it's gonna
3160340	3164020	be Konami, and then the news comes out like the next day, oh it's Capcom's the one that's
3164020	3165020	on the block.
3165020	3168720	Yeah, don't get me wrong, Metal Gear Solid 5 looks awesome, but they're banking everything
3168720	3174340	on Metal Gear Solid 5, because if that shit doesn't work, then I don't, I guess they're
3174340	3180180	gonna be going straight slot machines, because they've got that in Pro Evo, and that's it,
3180180	3181180	that is their slate.
3181180	3184900	Pro Evo's the only thing coming out this year, so they're hurting.
3185460	3191460	Alright, speaking of Capcom, some interesting other news coming out of there that is around
3191460	3196900	Yoshinori Ono, and Yoshinori Ono, of course a lot of people know as the producer of Street
3196900	3202540	Fighter 4, which keeps going, it's the game that keeps on giving, well this week he announced
3202540	3205580	that he is leaving Capcom Vancouver.
3205580	3210420	I resigned from the director position about Capcom Vancouver, thanks good staff of Capcom
3210420	3212980	Vancouver and Dead Rising staff.
3212980	3216960	I had to take some time, I think over very carefully about next things, I'd like to watch
3216960	3219900	TV for Brazil World Cup before thinking it.
3219900	3226420	Now this caused a lot of people to go, oh fuck he left Konami, he left Capcom, but actually
3226420	3232940	he furthered, he did a little clarifying tweet, my position within Capcom has not changed,
3232940	3237920	I'm still involved in all the projects I'm currently working on, only my role for Capcom
3237920	3240920	Vancouver has ended.
3240920	3241920	So interesting.
3242360	3247480	So he's just like, instead of being whatever he was plus head of Vancouver, he's just...
3247480	3251720	I can understand that maybe you're stretched so thin, you've really got to focus on one
3251720	3257440	or two things, I understand that very well, so I can see why he resigned in that regard,
3257440	3261660	where it's like, if he's not able to handle it all because there's too much going on over
3261660	3266960	here or whatever, they've got to be looking at the future of Street Fighter in some ways,
3266960	3271240	somebody's got to be whispering Street Fighter 5 over their cap, somebody's got to be doing
3271240	3276360	it, because they keep cranking out these sequels to Street Fighter 4, and it's like, really,
3276360	3277480	how many more can they do?
3277480	3281000	So somebody over there's got to be begging for Street Fighter 5.
3281000	3286640	I think they're already working on it, it's probably next gen, but that would be cool
3286640	3289240	at Tokyo Game Show if they showed something like that.
3289240	3291740	You never know, you never know.
3291740	3299000	So there you go, a revised or reduced role for Yoshinori Ohno, but at his own choice
3299000	3300000	there.
3300000	3301000	Yeah.
3301000	3306560	Well, speaking of Capcom, can I jump in real quick with an interesting comment from our
3306560	3311000	chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Blueberry jumped in with a comment saying, Konami doesn't
3311000	3316160	really focus on games any longer, they have sports centers and everything in Japan.
3316160	3319920	You know, that is true, is that, you know, even though maybe at E3 we see kind of one
3319920	3324440	side of it, is that their presence over in Japan might be very different, and I think,
3324440	3327920	like you said a minute ago, they do have all those slot machines and things, you go into
3327920	3333960	any casino, like you're going to see Konami's logo everywhere, they make a lot of slot machines.
3333960	3337560	And also they do a lot of mobile stuff, so I think that's where they're moving.
3337560	3342000	But I mean, come on, I'm not talking like, I'm talking Konami as in, you know, a game
3342000	3345240	publisher like on console, a console and portable game publisher.
3345240	3349160	You want your Bemani and your Castlevania and your Silent Hill.
3349160	3355080	I'm not holding my breath on any sort of, you know, Bemani stuff, but I would expect,
3355080	3363600	you know, with like, you know, games kind of like, you know, Amnesia and, you know,
3363600	3367400	even what was it, The Evil Within, and that kind of stuff that's probably going to do
3367400	3368400	pretty well.
3368400	3372400	I could see a little bit more of the resurgence of, you know, the survivor horror genre, and
3372400	3377920	I could see them maybe trying to do a next gen version of Silent Hill.
3377920	3385040	I'd be down with that, but it's just, you know, I'm not, they've had a lot of flops
3385400	3388800	I'm just hoping that they, you know, hit a home run with one of these.
3388800	3394080	ActDeft in chat saying, Konami at E3 said, or sorry, I can't, I keep mixing those two
3394080	3395080	up tonight.
3395080	3399800	ActDeft says Capcom at E3 said they're working on Street Fighter 5 for the new consoles.
3399800	3405560	So, but I mean, that's, I mean, that's as a given as, you know, there's, the PlayStation
3405560	3409160	5 is currently being developed somewhere, absolutely, of course, and the success of
3409160	3411000	the Xbox One, absolutely.
3411000	3412800	Those things are planned out years and years in advance.
3412800	3413800	Hey, guess what?
3413800	3415800	There will be new Nintendo hardware.
3415800	3417680	It's being planned right now.
3417680	3420400	It's just nowhere near time to show it yet.
3420400	3427520	I think it needs to be brought up, but, um, where the fuck is Tekken Cross Street Fighter?
3427520	3430080	Oh yeah, good question.
3430080	3431720	Where is it?
3431720	3433200	It wasn't at E3 this year.
3433200	3434200	That's true.
3434200	3436200	That kind of disappeared, didn't it?
3436200	3437200	Yeah.
3437200	3438200	Huh.
3438200	3439200	Where is it?
3439200	3442360	Well, I'm assuming at this point it's going to be next gen for a hat.
3442360	3446440	Maybe I was wrong in my Bandai Namco idea.
3446440	3447800	Maybe there's some bad blood going on there.
3447800	3448800	I don't know.
3448800	3449800	I don't think it's bad blood.
3449800	3451920	I think they're probably just developing a new engine for a new Tekken game that they're
3451920	3456080	going to put out a straightforward Tekken game, maybe like a Tekken 7 or something.
3456080	3458040	And then they'll run off that engine.
3458040	3460760	And so they'll build, you know, two birds with one stone.
3460760	3461880	They held it for next gen.
3461880	3466240	They held it for next gen and they're building a new engine for Tekken 7 and that'll be
3466240	3467240	that.
3467240	3468240	Um, okay.
3468240	3471120	So anyway, speaking of Capcom, uh, this is kind of interesting.
3471120	3475400	I've never heard of a straight to Crackle movie, but apparently Dead Rising is going
3475400	3476400	to be a...
3476400	3478480	What the hell is Crackle?
3478480	3481040	I've seen it on PlayStation 4, but...
3481040	3487160	Crackle apparently is Sony's like a video streaming, um, app or whatever.
3487160	3489960	So it's like Netflix, but like Sony wants their own Netflix.
3489960	3493080	But it's not necessarily, it's free.
3493080	3497000	So all this, like they have like a bunch of old action movies on there and stuff and it's
3497000	3498000	free.
3498000	3499920	So you can get like a bunch of cool stuff on there.
3499920	3501080	Now you're talking.
3501080	3502080	I did not realize.
3502080	3506320	At least, at least when I perused it once, I'm like, shit, there's all this cool stuff
3506320	3509040	I don't want to watch and I completely forgot about it.
3509040	3516060	But anyways, so they're gonna, uh, put this movie on, um, that channel and apparently
3516060	3520960	it's being, uh, let's see here, who is producing it?
3520960	3524080	Uh, oh, um, Thomas Harlan.
3524080	3526640	Did you say what movie it was?
3526640	3527640	Yeah, Dead Rising.
3527640	3528640	Okay.
3528800	3534360	It's, um, Thomas Harlan is producing it and he did, uh, the Mortal Kombat Legacy digital
3534360	3543240	movie, or not movie, but I guess a web series, um, so they've got that and on top of, um,
3543240	3551760	having it on Crackle, it's gonna be also distributed on DVD, video on demand and also, uh, TV and
3551760	3556640	I'm assuming like Netflix and all those other places, but it'll be at Crackle first, um,
3556640	3557840	I think Crackle's free.
3557840	3558840	I don't know.
3558840	3562000	I've, like I said, I've only looked at it like a couple of times.
3562000	3566000	No idea what exactly the premise is going to be, um.
3566000	3570640	There's actually quite a few people, um, commenting on Crackle, um, let's see, Act F says it's
3570640	3576160	kind of like Netflix, Blender says all free movies and TV Sky, I watched Lords of Dogtown
3576160	3581200	last week, Fifth Dream says Crackle has anime as well, Bond Solo 6 says think Hulu, Netflix
3581200	3582480	and Amazon Instant Watch.
3582480	3586640	Well, yeah, but most of those that you name, you have to pay for, well, I guess Hulu has
3586640	3592080	a free, well, it's only free on PC for some limited limited thing, but yeah, so it is
3592080	3596600	free, I think, from what I remember, um, it's interesting though that they mentioned this
3596600	3603160	because I want to say that they had for Dead Rising 2, maybe it might have been 3, they
3603160	3607920	had like a little live action short thing that they did that was kind of like a Japanese
3607920	3613600	live action short that was, uh, following like Dead Rising 1 or something like that
3613600	3616440	and they had kind of some stuff with that, so I'm just kind of curious what the premise
3616440	3621320	would be or if this is going to be, you know, hopefully it's not like a sci-fi channel movie
3621320	3626360	quality or something like that, you know, I hope it's actually something pretty polished
3626360	3632080	and, um, you know, it says feature length film, but is it a feature length film that's
3632080	3635400	going to be CG or is it going to be a live action film?
3635400	3643000	I don't know, that'd be kind of curious, I don't know, I'm down, down with that.
3643000	3644000	Interesting.
3644560	3648720	Uh, yeah, I don't know what I would expect out of a movie like this either, but I guess,
3648720	3652000	you know, because it's based on a big zombie franchise, it'll just be like kind of like
3652000	3653000	a...
3653000	3656920	It's gonna be weird though, watching the main character go, hey, you know what, I think
3656920	3661200	I'm gonna put on this little kid's clothes and then I'm gonna stick this, I'm gonna stick
3661200	3667600	this Mega Man, uh, blaster on my arm and then, uh, I'm gonna totally like, um, I'm gonna
3667600	3671440	run around with this chainsaw now and, I don't know.
3671440	3675800	Alright, uh, let's move on to news about the Xbox One in Japan.
3675800	3680400	Yes, the Xbox One in Japan, it is happening, just in case you weren't aware, uh, they're
3680400	3685880	gonna try to make it work in Japan and it's launching in September, 29 games at launch.
3685880	3692160	Uh, some of the games that will be coming out include the launch window games we had,
3692160	3697400	things like Dead Rising 3, Crimson Dragon, uh, also included things like Strider and
3697400	3698400	Titanfall.
3698400	3704560	Uh, Konami will be out with Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes, so that'll be a pretty good,
3704560	3708120	you know, cause I was wondering last week, you know, what was gonna be the game that
3708120	3711200	really gets people on Xbox One, except the only problem is that Ground Zeroes is also
3711200	3712200	on PlayStation 4.
3712200	3715840	Well, here's the other thing, the problem is Ground Zeroes is the prequel to Metal Gear
3715840	3716840	Solid 5.
3716840	3717840	Oh yeah.
3717840	3719600	So, no one gives a shit about it.
3719600	3720600	Duh.
3720600	3723440	Uh, yeah, so everybody's already played that on PlayStation 4.
3723440	3728480	Uh, Tecmo Koei will have a port of Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate.
3728480	3732520	Um, Cyberstep will have their free-to-play MMORPG Onigiri.
3732520	3737320	Uh, that is a PlayStation 4 exclusive in North America, but it'll be available for the Japanese
3737320	3740240	Xbox One at launch, that's very interesting.
3740240	3746600	Um, so yeah, uh, some other titles that will be coming to the Xbox One in Japan in the
3746600	3753260	coming months, uh, Natsuki Chronicle, Shooting Love Trilogy, uh, Azito simulation game, so
3754200	3756900	some other stuff to look forward to there on the Xbox One.
3756900	3758940	And, and, a new Raiden game.
3758940	3759940	A Raiden game.
3759940	3761460	Oh yes, a new Raiden game.
3761460	3764940	Uh, hopefully it's a disc-based game, because you know what that means?
3764940	3765940	Import!
3765940	3766940	Because it's reader-free!
3766940	3767940	Nice.
3767940	3768940	Yeah.
3768940	3772940	I'd be down with that.
3772940	3773940	Alright.
3773940	3774940	Looking.
3774940	3780780	Um, so this is kind of disappointing, normally when we're talking, you know, Nintendo going
3780820	3785780	to court against, you know, uh, patent, you know, infringement cases and stuff, they're
3785780	3787260	pretty much victorious.
3787260	3789860	Well, not this time!
3789860	3797180	Unfortunately, um, they have, um, ruled against Nintendo, um, in the patent lawsuit against
3797180	3805540	Philips, and this, I guess, affects both the Wii and Wii Rem- uh, Wii U, and, um, the technology
3805540	3809220	that they were kind of, um, saying that they were infringing on had to do with the Wii
3809220	3811660	Remotes and the Wii U gamepad.
3811660	3818020	So, not sure yet, they haven't really said what this is going to mean, if it means, you
3818020	3823980	know, what kind of fines, damages, are they going to try to stop the sale of the system?
3823980	3827420	To which you can make the pun, do they really need to help them stop the sale of the system?
3827420	3831140	You know, so on and so on, but, no, are they going to, you know, try to bar that?
3831140	3835520	I don't think that, you know, looking at like, you know, I want to say the Xbox 360 kind
3835520	3841560	of had the same thing, um, they had like a patent lawsuit that involved that system,
3841560	3842560	and-
3842560	3843560	Controller, right?
3843560	3848960	I don't know if it was a controller, I think it was, it was the software, um, it was like
3848960	3855760	for decoding, like video and stuff like that, and they ended up settling, but they, or maybe
3855760	3859120	they had to pay fines or something like that, but they ended up not, it wasn't pulled from
3859120	3860120	the market.
3860120	3863040	So, it's still, they're still going to be probably selling the system, but I'm sure
3863040	3865040	they're going to have to pay some sort of fines or something.
3865040	3866040	Yeah.
3866040	3871400	Um, or I don't know if they can, you know, do some sort of appeal or something, but that's
3871400	3876800	unfortunate, I guess you can't win them all, but.
3876800	3881000	That law, and this is so complicated, and I thought I saw a story, um, you know, somewhere
3881000	3885640	like on Google News or something about how the Supreme Court was kind of starting to
3885640	3889720	come down on, and that, obviously we're talking US versus UK, but still, you know, this is,
3889720	3891720	this is a problem in a lot of places.
3891720	3895080	The US is kind of, the Supreme Court here is kind of starting to come out with a lot
3895080	3899160	of decisions that are really anti-patent troll sort of thing, and you sort of get the sense
3899160	3902600	that legally we're starting to kind of move towards a different system, and I believe
3902600	3904800	it had said something about, you know, don't quote me on this because I don't have the
3904800	3908120	article right in front of me, but it was something about like the whole like, you can't, you
3908120	3912760	can't patent a lot of this software, these ideas, and things that are in software.
3912760	3918320	Well like, yeah, what they're, the premise was is that they can't patent, say for example,
3918320	3924400	um, say there's a patent out there for like, you know, point of service or something like
3924400	3929240	that, where you're, you're purchasing something or doing something in the real world, you
3929240	3934240	can't have another patent that says, doing this thing, but on a computer, you know, like
3934240	3939520	you can't have a patent for playing music on a device and then saying, oh, but this
3939520	3944160	is playing music on a device on your computer, you can't have a patent for that if it's basically
3944160	3952160	the same thing, or you know, I don't know, it's kind of a step towards not being able
3952160	3955320	to patent software, which I think is a good idea, I don't think you should be able to
3955320	3962600	patent software, um, you know, maybe patent the code for your software, so like, and that's
3962600	3968440	really how it should be anyways, like, you know, so it just stops people from blatantly
3968440	3974480	decoding, you know, reverse engineering your software and just putting it into their software,
3974480	3978000	that's the whole point of the patent office is to stop stuff like that, stop you from
3978000	3984240	reverse engineering these things, but not necessarily like, oh well, this is a patent
3984240	3990080	for, you know, Wii remote type things, you know, infrared, wireless remotes, I have a
3990080	3995680	patent for it now, and now you can't make any sort of wireless remotes, it's kind of
3995680	3997680	backwards the way it works.
3997680	4002480	GameGuru in our chatroom says that Nintendo is appealing actually, well that's not a surprise
4002480	4008400	at all, that's what would happen on the US as well, appeal, appeal, appeal, so this will
4008400	4013560	not be resolved anytime soon unless they finally reach that magic settled out of court, so
4013560	4014560	there it is.
4014560	4020920	Alright, so, very interesting new game coming out, and I'm not sure if this infringes on
4020920	4025320	any patents, let's hope not, because it looks like it's going to be interesting, it is called
4025360	4030440	The Rhythm of Fighters, and The Rhythm of Fighters, it's going to be an iOS and Android
4030440	4037840	game, but it's like a, it's a rhythm game based in the King of Fighters universe, so
4037840	4042440	I guess there's tap on notes that are kind of in an ellipse style wireframe, and when
4042440	4046280	like a cursor goes over the notes, you tap them out, and depending on how well timed
4046280	4051080	it is, you either do damage or you take damage, we don't know a whole lot else about the game
4051120	4056760	besides, it's happening, so fans of King of the Fighters, especially if you're into that
4056760	4061280	and music games, which, this sounds like somebody made a game for Dark Sakura, it's a real bummer
4061280	4066240	she's not here tonight, I kind of see this and I go, hey, somebody made Dark Sakura's
4066240	4067240	video game.
4067240	4071400	Well they've got like a, they've spun off so much stuff for the King of Fighters, remember
4071400	4076480	they have the shooter game at one point, yeah, that was pretty funny, I like that, I'm not
4076480	4077480	surprised.
4077760	4079560	Not at all, but this will be fun.
4079560	4083280	So yeah, check that out, the rhythm of fighters, of course we don't know when, but I can't
4083280	4085400	imagine it's going to be too, too long.
4085400	4088080	Speaking of not having to wait too, too long, let's travel around the world and check out
4088080	4089200	some release dates.
4089200	4096400	Yes, this week actually you do have a few things coming out before pretty much the dead
4096400	4102540	time which is, what is it, July, when nothing comes out, you used to have NCAA.
4102540	4106600	This week though, if you happen to be a fan of Transformers and maybe you've seen the
4106600	4110160	movie, they have kind of the best of both worlds, whether you like the Transformer
4110160	4115800	movie games or not, it's Transformers Rise of the Dark Spark that's coming out on Playstation
4115800	4124620	3, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, Xbox One, Wii U, and 3DS.
4124620	4135200	Also this week we've got Grid Autosport, which is out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, which
4135200	4140920	is kind of cool, it's being published by Codemasters and they actually have, it's funny
4140920	4145440	how Codemasters kind of jumps between publishers and stuff, so now it's Namco Bandai publishing
4145440	4146440	it.
4146440	4157160	Outlier Rorona Plus, The Alchemists of Arland on Playstation 3, also, let's see here, oh,
4157160	4158160	actually that would be it.
4158160	4159160	That's it?
4159160	4160160	Yep.
4160160	4161160	Alright.
4161160	4162160	That is it.
4162160	4165180	You think there'd be more leading up to what, July 4th weekends next week, you think there'd
4165180	4168700	be a little more, but maybe they just figure a lot of people are away on break or whatever.
4168700	4172500	Well, spoiler, next week there's really only, there's two games coming out next week, Sniper
4172500	4179300	Elite 3 and the Far Cry collection on 360, which I was hoping that would come out here
4179300	4184600	because it's in the UK, but I don't think it includes the first Far Cry, because the
4184600	4189540	one in the UK included the first Far Cry on 360 but not on PS3, because they never did
4189540	4190540	one on PS3.
4190540	4191540	Right, right.
4191540	4192540	Interesting.
4192900	4196060	Alright, well, going over to Japan, looking at the rest of the world and the release dates
4196060	4201300	there, on the Playstation 4, Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate is out on June 26th, as well as
4201300	4205740	Watch Dogs gets its release on the Playstation 4 in Japan this week.
4205740	4211620	Over on the Playstation 3, an awful lot on June 26th, that's my birthday, it's all, they're
4211620	4215220	celebrating my birthday over there in Japan this week with all these game releases.
4215220	4222060	Cross Channel for all people, Date Alive, Arusu Install, there's a regular and limited
4222060	4226900	edition for that, there's the Devil May Cry HD collection getting a price reduction, Grand
4226900	4232580	Theft Auto 5 gets a price reduction as well, Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider Batride War 2 in
4232580	4237700	a regular and premium edition comes out from Bad9Amco, and Watch Dogs gets its Playstation
4237700	4244260	3 release as well, and also Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition goes into the Playstation
4244260	4248820	3 the best, which of course Biohazard means it's Resident Evil over there in Japan.
4248820	4253900	On the Xbox 360, just some price reductions as we look at F1 2013 and Grand Theft Auto
4253900	4259540	5 getting price reductions, but Watch Dogs also gets a 360 release in Japan this week.
4259540	4265980	On the Wii U this week, Kamen Rider Batride War 2 is out on the Wii U as well.
4265980	4270740	And lastly, looking at the Playstation Vita and the 3DS, on the Vita, Cross Channel for
4270740	4279180	all people, Freedom Wars, Girls and Panzer, Senshado Kiwa Meimasu comes out, there's a
4279180	4283740	whole accessory set coming out for that as well, so this is a pretty big one, Robotics
4283740	4291420	Notes Elite comes out as well, and lastly on the 3DS this week, if I can get to those
4291420	4296380	dates here, oh, much less on the 3DS, but for you music game fans, you'll recognize
4296380	4304780	the name Taiko no Tatujin Don Tokatsu no Jiku Daibuken comes out this week on the 3DS, so
4304780	4309580	if you like your taiko drum master, you can import that, but hopefully you have a Japanese
4309580	4312180	3DS to play it on, because it is region locked.
4312180	4314460	There's also a pen set coming out too, that matches.
4314460	4318940	That's completely stupid that the 3DS is region locked.
4318940	4322180	Releases over in the UK, Dark Soccer's not here tonight, but I have them up for you.
4322180	4326980	On June the 25th, the Another World 20th Anniversary Collection's out on PlayStation 4, Vita and
4326980	4331460	3, and the Swapper out on PlayStation 4, Vita and 3.
4331460	4336660	As far as some retail releases, you have Grid Autosport on PC, 360 and PS3 coming out on
4336660	4343780	June 27th, Sniper Elite on many platforms, that's PS3, 4, Xbox 360, 1 and PC, that's
4343780	4349380	Sniper Elite 3, and lastly, Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare makes its way to PC in Europe
4349380	4350380	on June 27th.
4350380	4356260	I did forget a couple real quick, BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma on Vita was this week, and
4356260	4357260	a Vita game!
4357260	4362780	Yeah, there you go, and I got another one, X-Blaze Code Embryo on PlayStation 3 and Vita
4362780	4363780	as well.
4363780	4368060	So, a couple more Japanese games there.
4368060	4373780	Alright, so this is kind of cool if you're into, you know, esports.
4373780	4380100	There is a college, actually, offering scholarships for League of Legends players.
4380100	4388980	It's the Robert Morris University in Chicago, and apparently they will be the first university
4388980	4394220	to offer a competitive team on the varsity level, and will offer scholarships for up
4394220	4398700	to 50% tuition and 50% room and board.
4398700	4404900	So, that's different, I guess, seeing esports actually being part of, you know, college
4404900	4405900	sports.
4406380	4411260	It's cool in a way, I mean, as somebody who's obviously a big gamer, it's nice to see that
4411260	4412260	happening.
4412260	4418660	It's, I go back to those days when, you know, we were focusing exclusively on music games
4418660	4422060	and we talked a lot about DDR and what was going on in that scene, and you remember when
4422060	4428080	DDR became a sport in, like, Norway or something, one of the Scandinavian countries, I remember
4428080	4431060	we talked about it here on the show a lot, you remember that when that happened?
4431060	4434220	DDR became, like, an officially recognized sport in one of those countries, and we talked
4434220	4437140	about, like, could it become a sport here and so on, and it was interesting because
4437140	4441980	you saw more and more DDR that would hit school classrooms and things like that, but one of
4441980	4446380	the interesting points that was brought up is about how, well, when you have a ball and
4446380	4451500	you go outside and you have those types of rules, you know, you can really play those
4451500	4457340	games with anything, I mean, as long as you have, like, a ball, you can play soccer.
4457340	4461900	Now, granted, you might, or I guess you have to have really goalposts, too, but you know
4461900	4465340	how people, you know, people will kind of modify these types of games, like, they'll
4465340	4468060	say, okay, well, that tree is the goal or something, you know, you know what I mean?
4468060	4470540	People, like, modify these things sometimes, right?
4470540	4477580	But when it comes to an e-game, there's a third party involved in making the play field,
4477580	4481780	and only they can do it, and only they control it, and it was, I don't know, I don't know
4481780	4485820	why, but that's what my mind kind of always goes to, is, like, a really interesting difference,
4485820	4489580	and I, and I get, you know, and I'm sure some people, chatters are gonna say, oh, but there's
4489580	4492460	regulation rules, especially when you're playing in college, and you can't use any
4492460	4495240	ball because there's regulations on the ball that you can use, and there's regulations
4495240	4497780	on, you know, what, what the sizes are and everything like that, yeah, I get that, I
4497780	4503140	get that, I get that, but those, I, I still feel like when we were talking about esports,
4503140	4506780	they're still a third party that's ultimately in control of all of that, they can kind of
4506780	4510700	change that on a whim, too, like, aren't they making changes to some, some pretty big changes,
4510700	4511700	some League of Legends maps?
4511700	4514260	Like, that seemed, that was in the news not that long ago, I think we talked about it
4514260	4518660	on Hoard House this week, so, you know, I, I don't know, it, it's weird when you have
4518660	4524340	a, it, I guess it feels way more commercialized when this third party's in control, and I
4524340	4528220	even realize, yes, there's the NBA in the, well, I guess, but they aren't involved with
4528220	4532180	college, either, but NCAA, if you will, or whatever, like, I, I still feel like there's
4532180	4533460	just, like, a difference here.
4533460	4537700	And it also seems really weird that it's this college doing it, I mean, I could see something
4537700	4543100	like, you know, a game design college or, like, some sort of tech, like, I could see,
4543100	4547300	you know, MIT or something doing something like this where they have, you know, a team
4547300	4554300	that's playing esports, maybe that's too cliche, but it just seems really odd that
4554300	4557820	this random university's doing this, but hey, whatever, that's cool.
4557820	4561700	It gets them a lot of press, and certainly, you know, if you're a college trying to recruit
4561700	4567660	some smart kids, you know, putting something out there, you know, anyway, let's see, Raman
4567660	4570660	in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, if they're giving out scholarships for
4570660	4575940	playing a fucking video game, I want to see scholarships for people building a computer.
4575940	4579700	Let's see, SHU100Matt says, DDR was going to be in the X Games a while back, but it
4579700	4582260	fell through due to music licensing issues.
4582260	4585500	That was, that was another big issue with the whole sport thing.
4585500	4587360	That's why you need DDR USA.
4587360	4591860	You can do DDR USA because it's all Konami originals, for the most part, I think.
4591860	4594020	Didn't they have, like, Smoke on the Water and some of that other stuff?
4594020	4597020	That was not in, uh, oh, the arcade version.
4597020	4598020	Arcade version.
4598020	4599020	Was the arcade version?
4599020	4600540	Oh, Stomp to My Beat was in the arcade version.
4600540	4601540	Ha!
4601540	4602540	No, it wasn't.
4602540	4603540	Yes, it was.
4603540	4605100	Stomp to My Beat was in DDR USA Arcade.
4605100	4606100	Was it?
4606100	4609460	Don't play with me on DDR trivia!
4609460	4610860	We used to play that song all the time!
4610860	4613020	Yeah, but we used to play it on 4th Mix.
4613020	4617820	No, I'm telling you, somebody look it up, threw Loki wrong for me.
4617820	4619540	I just don't remember that.
4619540	4626460	I thought it was, uh, I know End of the Century was in there, um, I don't remember that being
4626460	4627460	on there.
4627460	4628460	Maybe it was.
4628460	4629560	It's been so long!
4629560	4633980	How long has it been since I played a USA mix?
4633980	4637020	That's how we all met, so it was probably, what, like 12 years ago, right?
4637020	4640780	Yeah, I mean, seriously, so, I don't know.
4640780	4643980	Sorry that I don't remember.
4643980	4648780	I'm actually trying to look it up right now on Wikipedia, but there's, like, so many frickin'
4648780	4649980	articles on this.
4649980	4656860	You just need to look up, was it, uh, let's see, there's releases, list of DDR video games,
4656860	4662100	let's see, is this Dance Dance Revolution, where's USA?
4662100	4663100	There it is.
4663100	4668020	They can click it, and music, show soundtrack.
4668020	4672700	Right there, biatch, stomp to my beat, JS16 in the list.
4672700	4679060	Alright, well, I just didn't remember, I mean, sorree.
4679060	4682540	Dubby Dub would've been a licensed tune, there was Smile Decay, Boyz.
4682540	4686420	But still though, I mean, they could've, they could've done it, but they could've just, yeah,
4686420	4687420	just don't do those songs.
4687420	4688420	Can't do those songs.
4688420	4689820	Everybody's gotta do La Senorita.
4689940	4694340	Alright, uh, let's get to the classic game of the week.
4694340	4701980	Cuz back in the day, these weren't sports, they were just fun.
4701980	4705940	Every week, Dark Soccer dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,
4705940	4709900	you kids should be playing this video game this week, but guess what, she's not here,
4709900	4713340	ha ha ha, so I'm taking over tonight with my take on-
4713340	4718060	They should've made him play all solo, uh, Dance Dance Revolution solo bass.
4718060	4719060	Heck yeah.
4719300	4720300	That would've been awesome.
4720300	4721300	That was great.
4721300	4725860	Alright, anyway, quiet on the DDR talk, cuz this game even predates DDR, it's that old.
4725860	4729620	This is an old, old classic, and it's one that I have chosen, uh, tonight to bring to
4729620	4734100	the table, and that game I have chosen is Lode Runner.
4734100	4740420	Let's write Lode Runner, and the way Lode Runner, it's L-O-D-E Runner.
4740420	4746260	And I particularly remember this on the Commodore 64, but this game does exist on a variety
4746260	4747260	of platforms, actually.
4747460	4751620	Uh, so let's talk a little bit about Lode Runner, which is a puzzler game that was published
4751620	4757060	by Broderbund in 1983, but here's what's made Lode Runner unique.
4757060	4761380	Lode Runner was one of the first games out there that actually had a level editor inside
4761380	4766500	of it, so you could make your own levels for the game, and this caused it to be, like,
4766500	4767500	hugely popular.
4767500	4771000	Um, because, you know, why do people love things like Little Big Planet, or people are
4771000	4775020	excited about Mario Maker, cuz they get to make their own stuff and share it with friends,
4775020	4777020	and that's what Lode Runner was all about as well.
4777780	4783180	So, um, Lode Runner was developed by Douglas E. Smith, who lived in Washington at the time.
4783180	4786420	He was an architecture student at the University of Washington.
4786420	4791580	The prototype, which was originally called Kong, was written for a Prime Computer 550
4791580	4795760	minicomputer, and it was on the University of Washington campus.
4795760	4801980	It was ported after that to VAX, and then over a weekend in 1982, Douglas Smith built
4801980	4808300	a playable version in 6502 assembly language on an Apple II+, and he renamed the game Miner
4808300	4810060	at that point.
4810060	4815660	He kept refining that version, and then finally he submitted his rough version to Broderbund,
4815660	4820980	and he got a rejection letter that said, sorry, your game doesn't fit into our product line.
4820980	4824780	So he borrowed money to get a color monitor and a joystick, and he kept working on the
4824780	4827520	game, cuz the original version of the game was black and white only.
4827520	4832640	So Christmas of 1982, he submitted the game to four publishers, and he got offers from
4832640	4834280	all four.
4834280	4836560	So he took the deal with Broderbund, which is interesting.
4836560	4840880	They rejected him the first time, but he ended up going with them anyway.
4840880	4845200	So anyway, he was given a $10,000 advance to go ahead and design the game and to do
4845200	4848040	150 levels for the game.
4848040	4852920	Apparently, and I don't know if this is true or not, he paid neighborhood children to design
4852920	4855560	levels with the editor he coded.
4855560	4858360	Just an awesome way to outsource.
4858360	4860560	Molons are design levels for my computer game.
4860560	4862800	All right, so what was the game all about?
4862800	4866920	Okay, so you played in these levels where you had ladders, and you had, I always called
4866920	4872080	them monkey bars, but they were basically like wires that you could kind of climb across,
4872080	4874760	and there were bricks all over.
4874760	4879600	What you could do with the bricks, you could dig holes in the bricks, and that could allow
4879600	4880760	you to do several things.
4880760	4888800	It could allow you to go get through an area without having to use a ladder, because you're
4888800	4892260	constantly being chased by guards the whole time.
4892260	4896440	But if a guard falls into a pit, the gravity works a little different for them.
4896440	4898560	They will not fall all the way to the ground.
4898560	4901200	They will become trapped in that hole.
4901200	4908040	Now after about two seconds, they will make their way out of that hole and continue chasing
4908040	4909040	you.
4909040	4912260	The holes fill in after about five seconds.
4912260	4916280	So if you time it just right, or if you build a sequence of holes, like three back to back
4916280	4919900	that the guard keeps falling in back to back and climbing out of, eventually the guard
4919900	4922120	will get buried alive, essentially.
4922120	4925240	So he gets killed, and he restarts at the beginning of the level.
4925240	4927720	So it's a really great way to get the guards to start chasing you.
4927720	4930520	And the guards are really stupid.
4930520	4933120	They only chase you, you know the patterns.
4933120	4936720	They're always going to take the most direct route to you no matter what, but it was the
4936720	4940200	way you built the holes that could really change the level.
4940200	4942320	Now of course, you're not just running around dodging guards.
4942320	4945040	You're actually trying to collect gold throughout the level.
4945040	4948720	And once you get all the gold, you go to the top of the screen to get to the next level.
4948720	4952200	And the level designer, you actually have an exit ladder that you can design that would
4952200	4956720	show up once all the gold has been corrected.
4956720	4960080	So you can only dig a hole on the sides.
4960080	4963200	You cannot dig a hole underneath yourself.
4963200	4968840	So meaning if you fall in a hole and you get stuck, you will die unless you are smart enough
4968840	4973360	to build like a line of three, fall in a line of two, fall in a line of one.
4973360	4976880	You can do that really quick if you don't have a lot of guards chasing you.
4976880	4979880	So kind of neat there.
4979880	4983280	If you start with five lives, but every time you finish a level, you get an extra life.
4983280	4987440	And if a guard catches you, of course, the current level restarts.
4987440	4990880	You can fall as far as you want, but you can't jump.
4990880	4994520	So very, you know, kind of a simple game in that regard.
4994520	4998960	But it was the level editor and the fact that people kind of did their own crazy things
4998960	5003600	with it that really, you know, made this game, I think, influential on some of the stuff
5003600	5005960	we see today.
5005960	5008400	The game was pretty well received when it came out.
5008400	5015000	For instance, PC Magazine gave the game 16.25 out of 18 points.
5015000	5018980	It said that the game was a tour de force of American ingenuity and the first release
5018980	5023820	in a long time that can honestly bear the title Computer Game.
5023820	5030060	Zzap!64 in 1985 said that the Commodore 64 version was, quote, not one of the most recent
5030060	5034300	games, but certainly one of the best, a classic for a long time to come.
5034300	5038740	The Spectrum version voted number 37 in the official top 100 games of all time for the
5038740	5039740	Sinclair.
5039740	5043180	GameSpot named Lode Runner as one of the greatest games of all time.
5043180	5050140	Time rated Lode Runner the number one game in the greatest games for the Apple II list.
5050140	5056900	And Alexey Pajnetov, who designed Tetris, confirmed that it is his favorite puzzle game
5056900	5059420	for a long, long time.
5059420	5063740	Now there were other versions of Lode Runner that came out.
5063740	5067780	This game, of course, is successful in that it spawns a hell of a lot of sequels, including
5067780	5072780	Championship Lode Runner, which was a sequel with 50 levels, Lode Runner's Rescue, which
5072820	5078340	was a 3D sequel for Atari 8-bit computers, Hyper Lode Runner, which was on the original
5078340	5079860	Game Boy.
5079860	5082660	There was arcade versions of this as well.
5082660	5086700	And then in the 90s, Sierra brought, because they acquired a lot of this stuff, brought
5086700	5088340	back Lode Runner.
5088340	5093540	Sierra brought back Lode Runner The Legend Returns in 94, Lode Runner Online, Mad Monks
5093540	5099100	Revenge, which actually had online play, excuse me, Lode Runner 2 with isometric 3D gameplay,
5099140	5103980	and Lode Runner 3D for the Nintendo 64.
5103980	5108460	And lastly, to note, the Xbox Live Arcade.
5108460	5114140	In 2008, a remake of Lode Runner was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show, and it was
5114140	5117500	released in April of 2009.
5117500	5121980	The game has revamped 3D graphics, more game modes, cooperative and competitive multiplayer
5121980	5127460	support, six block types, and a level editor, as well as live leaderboards and a timeline
5127460	5129140	of the game's history.
5129140	5131180	So there you go, Lode Runner.
5131180	5135140	Now Lode Runner, I'll mention this as well real quick, Lode Runner was also available
5135140	5138940	on the Nintendo Entertainment System, so I see some of you guys probably remember it
5138940	5139940	from there.
5139940	5144940	Let me jump ahead to a little clip of this Lode Runner on the Nintendo Entertainment System,
5144940	5149580	because obviously it had a little bit, it made a little more music when he was walking
5149580	5150580	along.
5150580	5153500	And it was weird too, because the screen would scroll around.
5153500	5156940	I don't know if it's the way the game was designed or whatever, but the sprites were
5156940	5162500	so big that the screen actually panned around to fit it all.
5162500	5167260	And the other really, really interesting thing about the NES version, the enemies, the guards,
5167260	5168260	were all Bomberman.
5168260	5171260	I don't, like they look like Bomberman.
5171260	5175980	I don't know why they did that, but they did, I guess maybe to recycle some sprites or something
5175980	5177460	like that, I don't know.
5177460	5178540	So there you go.
5178540	5181300	There it is, your classic game of the week, Lode Runner.
5181300	5185060	I remember it fondly on the Commodore 64, but I think most people probably started on
5185060	5189580	the Apple IIe, or maybe even the Nintendo Entertainment System, but it's available a
5189580	5190580	lot of different places.
5190580	5192700	You ever played Lode Runner when you were a kid, Loki?
5192700	5194900	I think so, I just don't remember.
5194900	5199780	I'm trying to see, it doesn't look familiar, but maybe it did.
5199780	5202220	I played a lot of different games.
5202220	5205380	I would have thought the creation element of it would have really appealed to you.
5205380	5211300	But remember back then though, I didn't really, it was hard to be on top of everything that
5211300	5214340	came out, because you only had magazines.
5214340	5219340	So I don't know if that ever came up on my radar.
5219340	5222780	All right, well, you'll have to check it out at some point during the week.
5222780	5226780	There's lots and lots of different ways to play it, and one of its sequel forms is nothing
5226780	5227780	else.
5227780	5232460	I still say the original's the best, and there's all those websites of questionable legality,
5232460	5235300	but they allow you to play the old school computer games, right?
5235300	5236860	Like the Apple IIe games, you know?
5236860	5240220	So I'm sure if you Google it, you'll find a way to play Lode Runner, or remember that's
5240220	5241220	L-O-D-E.
5242100	5246980	Although I always kind of thought that was a tongue-in-cheek way of, you know, because
5246980	5248900	you would load your user levels.
5248900	5249900	I don't know.
5249900	5250900	Anyway.
5250900	5251900	All right, forget it.
5251900	5254780	All right, that's going to do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but guys,
5254780	5255780	don't go anywhere.
5255780	5259220	We have plenty more show coming up right after this quick break.
5259220	5260220	So don't go anywhere.
5260220	5261220	We'll be right back.
5261220	5273300	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June the 22nd of 2014
5273300	5276180	with the 557th episode of our show.
5276180	5278860	Just Loki and I here in studio tonight at our Sakura.
5278860	5282580	She is out tonight, and yeah, no, Jason's not in town.
5282580	5284500	He's back home in Colorado.
5284500	5286180	Shane's doing something else online.
5286180	5287180	Alan's at work.
5287180	5289180	So all the usual standby people not available.
5289180	5291900	So it's just Loki and I, just us.
5291900	5295900	But you guys with us in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and on the Skype line
5295900	5300340	in just a little while, you can add us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
5300340	5301380	That's all one word.
5301380	5304740	Or you can always use the telephone, too, even though I think everybody in this day
5304740	5306380	and age is really switching over to Skype.
5306380	5309180	But 1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number.
5309180	5313300	Speaking of Skype, if you do plan to call us that way, please do us all a courtesy.
5313300	5317460	Call Echo 123 first before you call into the show.
5317460	5320740	Just make sure that you're settings and you sound good and all that good stuff because
5320740	5325740	nothing's worse than getting a call on the show live that goes, hello, hello, hello,
5325740	5326740	hello, can you hear me?
5326740	5327740	Hello.
5327740	5328740	Hi.
5328740	5329740	Hello.
5329740	5330740	Hello.
5330740	5331740	Are we here in the background?
5331740	5332740	Are we here ourselves on repeat?
5332740	5335540	I mean, as lovely as our voices are, you know, we don't need to hear ourselves.
5335540	5340180	So Echo 123 is always a good protocol.
5340180	5343900	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
5343900	5345700	use the passphrase, beaver.
5345740	5351820	All right, going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, they're still debating the whole scholarship
5351820	5352820	thing that came up earlier.
5352820	5355500	So we're gonna get into that in the FUGL Question of the Week.
5355500	5358500	So if you weren't here live, you're missing some spirited debate tonight.
5358500	5361740	And I don't mind spirited debate as long as everybody stays respectful, which everybody
5361740	5362740	is.
5362740	5363740	So we're cool.
5363740	5364740	We're cool.
5364740	5365740	But here's some more things to debate.
5365740	5366740	It's rapid fire news.
5366740	5368740	Let's do some other quick gaming stories.
5368740	5369740	Loki.
5369780	5375860	This week, there was, right before the Steam sale, there was this Team Fortress 2 update
5375860	5376900	tease thing.
5376900	5382700	And they've been kind of doing that throughout the week beforehand, where people would see
5382700	5386300	randomly spawning bread when they would use a teleporter.
5386300	5391660	And they kind of had to do with this whole, I forget what they called the update, the
5391660	5393300	Love and War update.
5393300	5405580	They had this 15 minute long mini short film that they had made with the film editor.
5405580	5407780	And hilarious.
5407780	5412980	And it had to do with some of the bread stuff and teleporting and there's like a bread monster
5412980	5413980	now.
5413980	5415280	But on top of that, there's also some new actions.
5415280	5421520	They have a new head-butting action square dancing, conga dancing, extreme flips, rock
5421520	5423940	paper scissor.
5423940	5428120	They also had some new items that appeared in the game as well.
5428120	5430560	Like some more costumes, hats and that kind of stuff.
5430560	5433400	Dance mode icons are very important, you know?
5433400	5435120	So that's pretty cool.
5435120	5437480	And definitely check out the short film if you haven't yet.
5437480	5438480	It's pretty awesome.
5438480	5442480	It's amazing that they are still cranking out updates to this game.
5442480	5449800	And it kind of makes you want an actual film from Valve for Team Fortress 2.
5449800	5450800	That's kind of what you got.
5450800	5451800	It's just a short film.
5451800	5454000	Yeah, but I want a full length video.
5454000	5457640	I want a full one.
5457640	5458640	It's pretty awesome.
5458640	5460400	You know, Loki, we don't always get what we want.
5460400	5463280	I want a playable version of your game.
5463280	5465000	You will get that eventually.
5465000	5467160	I'm just getting the end of the stuff done.
5467160	5469640	He promised everybody episode 557.
5469640	5472320	Hey, I'm hurrying.
5472320	5477440	If you don't produce, I'm going to just start calling you Valve.
5477440	5480360	No, no, no, see, I have to start.
5480360	5484880	I'll have to do a Kickstarter first, you know, so they don't produce, yeah.
5484880	5486880	And then, yeah.
5486880	5487880	Alright.
5487880	5488880	What else you got?
5488880	5496500	Anyways, so on top of that, they've been, they started selling a text adventure game
5496500	5509160	actually on Steam, and this one is called Heroes Rise, and it's a text-only game.
5509160	5515180	It's pure text adventure without any sort of audio-visual elements to it, so talk about
5515180	5516180	old school.
5516180	5518220	But you can pick that up.
5518220	5521620	They've got, they're on sale right now for $1.99 each.
5521620	5528460	They have the Hero Project, the Prodigy, and I don't know if they had another one coming.
5528460	5532100	I realize these are newer text adventure games, but can't you buy some of the classics on
5532100	5534940	Steam like Zork and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?
5534940	5539220	Maybe, I don't know if they were on there, but I don't know.
5539220	5540220	It's newer.
5540220	5544460	I mean, it's definitely an interesting genre, I guess.
5544460	5549500	Well, you know, some people prefer reading a book because then you can make up the graphics
5549500	5551220	yourself.
5551220	5555020	I'm being serious with that comment, you know?
5555020	5560780	And your graphics in your head, always running at 60 frames per second or higher.
5560780	5566740	That's right, your mind is more powerful than current-gen systems.
5566740	5569020	Always one step closer to the holodeck.
5569020	5570020	Yeah.
5570020	5571020	So.
5571020	5573380	No Zork on Steam.
5573380	5576380	I thought that some of the old- Good old games probably has it, though.
5576380	5578900	Yeah, probably good old games.
5578900	5580820	I used to be on GameTap.
5580820	5581820	Remember GameTap?
5581820	5588380	I used to love GameTap, and then they kind of sold and went to crap.
5588380	5591260	But let's see, I'm looking right now to see if it's something that's available on good
5591260	5592260	old games.
5592260	5596540	Yes, the Zork Anthology is available for three bucks on good old games.
5596540	5603460	And speaking of Kickstarter, a game that actually was pretty interesting when I got to check
5603460	5606740	it out, the demo and stuff that they had, also built in Unity.
5606740	5612500	Cat Lateral Damage, the first person kitty simulator where you as a cat knock over shit
5612500	5616180	in your house and just generally piss off people.
5616180	5620100	But to be a full cat sim, they had to add a few things.
5620100	5626340	And with that, in this brand new video, they have the ability to take a nap, chase a mouse,
5626340	5627340	chase a laser pointer.
5627340	5629460	It is the pure cat sim.
5629460	5635820	And they are looking to raise $40,000 by July 11th.
5635820	5639580	And I believe, let's see where they're at here real quick, they were pretty far, yeah,
5639580	5640580	they're gonna make it.
5640580	5644100	They're at $36,218 and they've got 18 days to go.
5644100	5645700	So it is gonna happen.
5645700	5648660	People are loving what they're seeing in the cat simulator.
5648660	5650340	So it's pretty awesome.
5650340	5655500	I was gonna see real quick if they had any stretch goals that they are adding there.
5655500	5659300	But definitely if you haven't gotten a chance to play the game yet, oh, here you go.
5659300	5662540	New features and content that they've added since the demo.
5662540	5664260	You can chase or ignore mice.
5664260	5665780	You can play with them or catch them.
5665780	5670540	You can sit in a box, lie in a sunbeam or both at once, chase a laser pointer and completely
5670540	5676260	freak out, hack up a hairball, find lost cat toys under the couch and play with them, explore
5676260	5682140	or hide underneath the bed, trip out on catnip, stand at a doorway and be indecisive about
5682140	5689100	going in or out, meow using state of the art cutting edge meowing technology.
5689100	5690700	Where's ignore the dog?
5690700	5691700	Is that a-
5691700	5693860	I don't know if there's a dog in the game yet.
5693860	5694900	Maybe the sequel.
5695260	5696260	It's pretty awesome.
5696260	5701940	They're gonna try to get some procedurally generated houses and rooms that you can play.
5701940	5704260	Lots of fun stuff.
5704260	5705260	Go check it out.
5705260	5710580	If you haven't played the demo yet, I think you can check it out on their website, maybe
5710580	5712620	catlateraldamage.com or something.
5712620	5717260	But if you go to the actual Kickstarter page, they have the web demo actually embedded in
5717260	5718260	there.
5718260	5719260	So if you wanna check it out, you can play it.
5719260	5720900	Or they have a link to it, I guess.
5720900	5725340	catlateraldamage.com slash play if you wanna check out the demo.
5725340	5728660	Which I recommend you should if you haven't done it yet.
5728660	5732100	They really should make cat lateral damage like an MMO.
5732100	5738340	Where we could all coexist in the same cat person's apartment.
5738340	5744380	You know, the cat owner that has like 50 cats, we can all exist in that one place.
5744380	5748160	And here's something that maybe even Jamie, I don't know if she wants to pitch money towards
5748160	5754360	a Kickstarter, but you can for $60 right now, if you pledge $60, you can make your
5754360	5758200	cat famous and they will put a photo of your cat in the game as a frameboaster.
5758200	5759200	Aw.
5759200	5766720	In fact, they even had one if you pitched enough money, it was limited though, you can
5766720	5768840	play as your cat in the game.
5768840	5770400	So that's kinda cool.
5770400	5773240	Fifth Dream in chat says, my cat is gonna be in cat lateral damage.
5773240	5776680	So I guess Fifth Dream is to pony down that to get that in there.
5776680	5777680	But that's awesome.
5778200	5784160	You know, to give a shout out to an old Xbox indie arcade game that was made by our friend
5784160	5789200	YYR, you remember about two years ago, he made Bungie Ferret Tossing, which is one of
5789200	5791040	the OLR dream games we talked about.
5791040	5793120	He made Bungie Ferret Tossing into a game.
5793120	5797920	But the opening splash screen is a, you know, please don't actually harm animals because
5797920	5802180	the joke is that they're explosive ferrets, but he has his responsible disclaimer that
5802180	5806580	says this game is a joke and you don't actually want to harm animals.
5806580	5809280	And he put pictures of animals in games.
5809280	5814860	And so Alan's cats, Maruko, who is still alive at the time, and Sanrio, who is still around,
5814860	5818900	they actually appear in Bungie Ferret Tossing, which is great.
5818900	5823980	So even if my cats didn't get in cat lateral damage, they at least will forever be immortalized
5823980	5825100	in one video game.
5825100	5827420	So thank you to YYR for making that happen.
5827420	5834660	All right, um, anyhow, let's talk about some other stories, including free things, yay,
5834660	5835660	free things.
5835740	5839540	It will involve Origin, however, so however you feel about that, although I gotta say,
5839540	5844140	you know, as much as warmed up to it, as much as Origin has been the laughing stock of PC
5844140	5849040	storefronts and all this over the years, they've made a lot, a lot, a lot of strides in the
5849040	5850040	past couple of years.
5850040	5854180	Yeah, the only thing that bugs me about Origin right now, and it's really just my sheer laziness
5854180	5857300	about it, is that it auto loads when I start my PC.
5857300	5859100	That's about the only thing that annoys me.
5859100	5863120	Aside from that, though, I'm kind of over hating on Origin because I don't buy anything
5863120	5864120	on it.
5864120	5865120	So it's fine.
5865160	5868960	It's really funny too, because a lot of people were like, well, everybody hated Steam at
5868960	5871760	first, but then it grew into this thing that everybody loves.
5871760	5875440	So now it's like, wow, we really do see like Origin going down so far, at least a similar
5875440	5876440	path.
5876440	5879880	And if they keep giving away free shit, it's pretty hard not to like it.
5879880	5883200	The only problem with the free shit that they're giving away is it was all stuff they bought
5883200	5885380	in that one EA Humble Bundle that they had.
5885380	5890560	So it's like, oh, hey, Battlefield 3 is free, yeah, already got it, oh hey, you know, Dead
5890560	5892120	Space is free, eh, already got it.
5892160	5895320	I didn't have Dead Space, and I didn't have what they give away in Plants vs. Zombies,
5895320	5898960	and I didn't have that either, so I was like, oh, score.
5898960	5903720	Well, one game that they were giving away for free, at least for a 48 hour period, was
5903720	5904720	Titanfall.
5904720	5908440	Now, of course, their big competitor Steam does things like this, where you can like
5908440	5912000	download a game for the weekend, well, Origin's got it too.
5912000	5916320	Origin is making Titanfall free to download and play for 48 hours.
5916320	5918720	However, this is the interesting thing about it.
5918720	5924060	Unlike the Steam free weekend, Origin has the game free for a set period of time that
5924060	5927720	starts when you begin playing.
5927720	5933560	So you can make that weekend essentially whenever you want, so a 48 hour demo for you.
5933560	5936880	Progress during this access is saved, and if you want to purchase the game after that,
5936880	5940820	you can pick up right where you left off, so that's pretty cool, I gotta say.
5940820	5945860	So Origin's stepping up their game a little bit with a very recent game there, Titanfall,
5945860	5948920	which I'm sure they wouldn't mind selling a few more copies of.
5948920	5952100	Bayonetta 2 is a game a lot of folks are looking forward to on the Wii U.
5952100	5955140	I know I'm one of them, especially now that I know the original Bayonetta's gonna be with
5955140	5956140	it too.
5956140	5957140	That's pretty fucking rad.
5957140	5963140	Well, to go in line with that, Funimation has agreed that they will release the Bayonetta
5963140	5967140	Bloody Fate anime feature film in North America.
5967140	5972020	Bayonetta Bloody Fate, of course, based on the Bayonetta games, which sees Bayonetta
5972020	5976580	the Witch battling the forces of heaven in a quest to regain her memory.
5976580	5980820	So there is no release date from Funimation yet, no release window either, but it does
5980820	5986100	state that Funamori Kizaki will be on hand at Anime Expo in Los Angeles for a special
5986100	5990220	sneak peek at the English dub, because I'm sure you're all excited about the English
5990220	5991720	dub.
5991720	5994680	The screening is happening on July 5th.
5994680	5999460	I would imagine the movie should be timed around the game's release on Wii U.
5999460	6001540	I would think that's the smart thing to do, but...
6001540	6005740	Wonder if they'll ever make that into a live action movie.
6005740	6007740	I think that might be a bit much.
6007740	6010500	Have you played Bayonetta?
6010500	6011500	It's a little crazy.
6011500	6016200	They can have Angelina Jolie or something.
6016200	6020180	Or who they get, they can have Mila Jilovich do it.
6020180	6021180	Why not?
6021180	6022180	Why not?
6022180	6026900	Alright, now, could there be more functionality coming between the Wii U and the Nintendo
6026900	6029100	3DS in the future?
6029100	6033520	Miyamoto and Takahashi over at Nintendo have talked about that they have some more titles
6033520	6037780	that utilize a connection between the Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS in the works.
6037780	6042060	Now Super Smash Bros. will allow you to transfer character data between the two systems, but
6042060	6043220	that's really all we know.
6043220	6045300	However, there was a little more that came out.
6045300	6049720	Quote, with Smash Bros., because the two games have the same gameplay and the same controls,
6049720	6052740	that game in particular is designed where you want to start playing on the 3DS first
6052740	6056460	and build up your characters there, and transfer that character data over to the Wii U and
6056460	6057680	play with them there.
6057680	6060520	There's no real reason that we haven't done it yet, I guess it just hasn't really fit
6060520	6063760	into the titles that we have been making, and it's not that we haven't thought about
6063760	6064760	it.
6064760	6068000	In fact, with Wii Fit U, we created the Fit Meter, which connects to the Wii U gamepad
6068000	6070040	wirelessly and transfers data.
6070040	6073120	Within those plans, we also thought about potentially having some type of functionality
6073120	6076740	with 3DS that would connect to it, but ultimately we didn't include it.
6076740	6080140	We also had an idea where, if there's a Wii U at home, and maybe the father or kids have
6080140	6084480	a 3DS, then we might think up a system where the Wii U would know that you were home before
6084480	6086340	your dog did.
6086380	6089360	It was kind of an interesting concept based around that, but we ended up not doing anything
6089360	6093380	with the idea, it hasn't really worked its way into the titles we've been developing,
6093380	6096960	but there are some things we're working on that we haven't announced at E3 that do involve
6096960	6100760	some sort of communication between the Wii U and the 3DS, and then they go into a little
6100760	6101760	bit of a banter.
6101760	6103660	We can't say the title, can we?
6103660	6104660	Not really.
6104660	6111460	If you were to say it, they would really get excited, and they ended it with, we were thinking
6111460	6114060	about that with Mario and Donkey Kong.
6114580	6119580	I'm sorry, whenever they start talking about, hey, we have all this stuff planned, but we
6119580	6122420	can't tell you about it yet, I don't fucking care.
6122420	6128260	I just really don't care anymore, because it's just like, they can talk all about this
6128260	6131820	wonderful plans and stuff, but it doesn't mean it's actually going to come out, and
6131820	6135540	what they think is something that we'll get excited about isn't this.
6135540	6139180	Don't get me wrong, there are people that love Pikmin, and there are probably a lot
6139180	6143720	of people that love Pikmin 3, but for a lot of people, Pikmin 3, nobody gives a fucking
6143720	6148880	shit about, and that's kind of where I'm at with this thing, it's like, cool, why don't
6148880	6152720	we talk about what exactly you're saying, you know, what kind of interaction, you don't
6152720	6157920	have to say the title, just say the interaction, like, give me an example in a generic sense.
6157920	6159960	Maybe it would give it away, I don't know.
6159960	6160960	No it wouldn't, I'm sure.
6160960	6167480	JVMon in our chatroom says, please F0, yes, yes sir, yes sir, he said Mario Kart, I think
6167480	6173140	honestly Nintendo probably has at least a year long lifespan plan for Mario Kart 8.
6173140	6176100	They already talked, it's not on our show tonight, but they already announced that Mercedes
6176100	6181960	DLC is going to come to America, so we know the game is capable of handling DLC, how can
6181960	6186980	there not be a meaty $20 DLC, because you know Nintendo doesn't skimp on DLC, they will
6186980	6192180	do a meaty $20 DLC pack that's like tracks, racers, cars, they're going to extend the
6192180	6196460	life of that game, they don't need to make a new F0, as much as it pains me to say it,
6196460	6200420	because I really want a new F0, I'm going to have like an F0 track, aw that would piss
6200420	6204900	me off, that would just be rubbing it, oh my god, if they made Mute City a track in
6204900	6212420	Mario Kart 8, I would, I'll tweet a picture of my middle finger at Reggie, I will.
6212420	6215300	Actually I shouldn't, no I'm going to have to do it.
6215300	6225140	There, we'll see, I don't know, it's, here's my thing, and like I mentioned before, before
6225140	6229540	I had to change my plans of what I was working on and stuff, I'm just not going to wait for
6229540	6239060	them, you know, it's like listen, I'll make my own fucking F0, with hookers and blackjack.
6239060	6243700	Oh my god, wait, you're going to just make F0, but instead of like these futuristic races,
6243700	6245700	it's just going to be hookers.
6245700	6248260	Hooker race 2015 or something like that.
6248260	6254940	It wouldn't do anything with it, no seriously, I just, I wouldn't wait for them, just like
6254940	6261500	you know, maybe my next project after I finish my game, someday hopefully, is do a new excite
6261500	6264380	truck, because I'm tired of fucking waiting for a new excite truck, it's just never going
6264380	6265380	to happen.
6265380	6266380	Hooker race.
6266380	6271780	No we're not going to do a hooker race, that's silly and stupid.
6271780	6276740	I can't imagine a game that you designed doesn't have a little silly and stupid somewhere in
6276740	6277740	it.
6277740	6282700	Oh, there's plenty of silly and stupid planned, but I kind of want to make my kart racing
6282700	6291100	game, because it would be, I have a lot of notes on the design for that, but uh, someday.
6291100	6296780	Alright, speaking of your notes, let's go to the foogle question of the week, because
6296780	6308300	you take Facebook and Google Plus, and slam them together, and you get foogle.
6308300	6312540	Thank you actdeft in our chat room, excitehooker, there you go, get on it Loki.
6313420	6318820	In serious news though, going to our foogle question of the week, which is about the esports,
6318820	6322580	which funny enough was kind of a debate in our chat room for a little bit, but we posted
6322580	6326260	that a little earlier on our Facebook and Google Plus communities, facebook.com slash
6326260	6330580	orange lounge radio, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, and here's the question,
6330580	6335020	what do you think as a gamer about news, like league of legends becoming a varsity esports
6335020	6339300	team at a college in the Chicago area, do esports deserve the same sort of recognition
6339300	6345460	as more traditional sports, such as baseball, basketball, and soccer, p.s. happy world cup.
6346420	6348660	Although I think I mentioned that towards the beginning of the show.
6348660	6353380	Let's start over on Facebook, and we start with an answer from Renee, my pal from my
6353380	6359300	killer queens from outer space podcast, and Renee says, I work at the university's rec center,
6359300	6362500	and then it kind of clicked for me, I'm like well yeah Renee's in the Chicago area, and I knew he
6362500	6367940	worked, I did not realize he was, so here we go, so Renee gives an interesting perspective here,
6368020	6372580	and from that perspective, I think this is a great idea that will work towards bringing students
6372580	6377460	together into a community of their own, make friends in that environment, and learn teamwork,
6377460	6382260	leadership, camaraderie, and good sportsmanship, and give more choices to be involved with other
6382260	6387380	students in university life, but I'm sure that answer's got to be a little bit biased, no,
6388420	6392900	you make a convincing argument, you do, and ER says, I think it's a good thing, I'm not a huge
6392900	6397300	fan of esports or sports in general, but I did play fighting games at a decent level for a while,
6397300	6401220	and I can attest that it takes just as much practice to be competitive at a video game
6401220	6406340	as it does a sport, Raginator says, it's about damn time esports got some recognition,
6406980	6413060	JV Mon says, esports shouldn't be a varsity team in college, it's just a PC game, if gaming can be
6413060	6419220	a college sport, I want varsity edition of RuPaul's Drag U with queens from the top colleges, take just
6419220	6425700	as much talent and practice as games and sports, so why not, could lip sync for your life be an
6425700	6429860	Olympic sport, that would actually be kind of rad, because it's not that dissimilar from ice
6429860	6434900	dancing, people, all right, Degenerate Johnny says, as traditional sports such as baseball,
6434900	6439460	soccer, and basketball concentrate on the physical skills of athletes, so does esports in regards to
6439460	6444340	the cerebral skill of gamers, however, the best part about esports is that it's competition that
6444340	6449620	both genders can compete as equals, I believe as esports grow in popularity, we will see more of
6449620	6455540	a variety of games enter into the group of esports games that already exist, such as MOBAs, lol
6456100	6461140	Dota, RTSs, Starcraft, and digital card games, Hearthstone, Hex Shards of Fate, you know, you go
6461140	6464820	down a really interesting slope though with that answer where the whole both genders compete as
6464820	6469380	equals, I realize that, you know, in most professional sports right now, that's not the way
6469380	6475620	it works, but there's a lot of people kind of clamoring for, I seem to remember years ago, wasn't
6475620	6481060	there a woman who was like getting really far into getting into an NHL team, I want to say it was
6481060	6485780	hockey, maybe SSG100 remembers this better than I do, but according, then you have like NASCAR,
6485780	6492020	you know, and a factor, but obviously these are very few sprinklings of, you know, women in what
6492020	6498340	have typically been male-dominated sports, so it's, that's an interesting, very, very interesting,
6498340	6503620	you know, answer there in that regard, so, but it is, it's kind of a slippery slope to begin with,
6503620	6507860	because I think many would argue that, you know, both genders should be competing as equals in the
6507860	6515380	other sports too. Anyway, Awesome Unicorn says, well, I don't personally find MOBAs appealing,
6515380	6519860	I am definitely supportive of gaming being taken seriously, I'm still a little concerned about if
6519860	6525220	games with a fantasy skin like League of Legends or Dota will be taken as seriously by the general
6525220	6530580	public compared to, let's say, a war-themed game with a Command & Conquer skin. Critical Myth says,
6530580	6534900	I'm for it in general, but I'm not sure that a game infamous for its brutal and disgusting online
6534980	6538980	environment should be the game to get the attention credibility, but I realize that's more
6538980	6544180	of a function of which game the community supports more than any other reason. You know what, that's
6544180	6549700	a really important answer, is that, you know, League of Legends and some of those MOBAs have
6549700	6555300	really toxic online environments. They're really, really bad when you get that anonymity. Hopefully
6555300	6562260	this brings a little more classiness to it, but I think though, I mean, and it goes without saying,
6562500	6567860	there's certainly some toxic environments when it comes to, you know, shit talking in basketball
6567860	6574020	games and baseball games and things like that too. Unfortunately, that sort of trolling isn't
6574020	6582660	exclusive to MOBAs. However, and this is important, when you can be anonymous, like in a computer game
6582660	6586980	like League of Legends, it's a little easier to say some shit you wouldn't say to my face,
6586980	6594420	like you'd have to do in baseball or basketball. So that's something. All right. Let's see. Also,
6594420	6599460	we have DJ Rama S who says, frankly, it's bullshit to get a scholarship for playing a damn game. What
6599460	6603940	the hell do you need a scholarship for that? You can't take courses in video gaming in that aspect,
6603940	6608020	and I don't see the point in it either. If they're doing that, then I expect scholarships to be
6608020	6612820	handed out for computer building and networking as well. Want to impress me? Give them a scholarship
6612820	6618340	designing the game instead of playing a game. It's a joke. This is some very diversifying opinions
6618340	6625700	there over on Facebook. Let's go over to Google Plus and see what folks said over there because
6625700	6629780	I've been waiting for it to load. Fantastic live radio. Okay. We have a few comments here,
6630340	6634980	starting with Redertainment who says, I'm sorry, but I can't leave my gamer hat on for this.
6634980	6639860	As a member of the community, I would have a problem with my chronically underfunded public
6639860	6646180	schools spending a large amount of money on a sports program, even if that sport is esports.
6647060	6649620	Was this school a public school or a private school?
6650580	6654900	I don't think it's... I don't... It sounded like a private school.
6654900	6658660	Not to discount the opinion here, but just wanted to make sure that clarification is out there.
6659540	6663940	Ronnie B over on Google Plus says, I expect virtual sports to become more and more of a
6663940	6668820	serious and accepted thing in society as we head into the future. With the advancing hardware like
6668820	6673700	the Rift, Glass, Kinect, Morpheus, and even some cell phones being the start of mixing the physical
6673700	6678740	world with a networked virtual world, entertainment will likely take on a whole new level quicker than
6678740	6683700	we thought. Although the media, also the media always tries to link gaming with most tragic
6683700	6692180	events. So this is a bit interesting. And lastly, Act Def says, think the problem here is or not
6692180	6696740	recognized as a competitive pastime or whether it's considered a varsity thing or not. I think
6696740	6701780	the problem resides in calling it a sport or esport. I mean, there are other things that could
6701780	6707940	get you a scholarship for college, but we need to separate physical sports from esports. Hmm.
6707940	6711460	Interesting perspective there is that, you know, there are many things you can get a scholarship
6711460	6717460	to college for. This isn't a sport. It's an esport. Hmm. Interesting. All right.
6718340	6723380	Kaijuto in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says they should give them a digital
6723380	6730820	scholarship. It's good for 500 Microsoft points. I like that sassy answer. All right. Let's get
6730820	6734740	back into some other news. Hey, don't forget to friend us on Facebook and Google Plus so you can
6734740	6743140	answer our future questions in the weeks to come. Loki. All right. So let's see. Speaking of
6744020	6752180	things we may not consider sports, there's a fake EA Sports Instagram account. And this has to do
6752180	6763220	with FIFA 14 Ultimate Team. I guess EA Sports UT 2014 is the account and it's not legit. In fact,
6763220	6773060	it's actually trying to fish logins for Xbox Live in origin. Apparently they're offering free
6773060	6780420	in-game currency on the account. And if you log in to try to get this free in-game currency,
6780420	6787140	it'll ask for your login details and that's where they get you. So then you'll have, you know,
6787140	6793620	people buying FIFA Ultimate Team cards on your account. Kind of like how they've done past
6794340	6799220	FIFA games. Hackers are going to steal your money. Hackers going to hack.
6801540	6807060	All right. Speaking of EA, you know, when Battlefield 4 launched, I don't know how many
6807060	6812980	of you guys tried to get in there and play it, but online was fucked. Did you try to play
6812980	6817460	Battlefield 4 online at all? Nope. This isn't the type of game that's usually up my alley.
6817460	6821540	So I kind of missed this whole thing, but I did definitely saw the rants and raves on
6821540	6828420	Twitter and so forth. So yeah, Battlefield 4 launched and players had months of connectivity
6828420	6835700	issues. EA delayed development of the promised DLC packs in order of fixing the bugs in the game.
6837780	6843860	Now, what's interesting is the CEO of EA, Andrew Wilson, has kind of owned up to some of the
6843860	6848660	problems of Battlefield 4 this week, talking about, and I guess blaming it of sorts, on the
6848660	6854580	game's online scope. So here's the quote, quote, for me, the situation we had was unacceptable.
6854580	6859380	For the team, it was unacceptable. We have worked tirelessly since then to make sure the gameplay
6859380	6863540	experience got to where it absolutely should have been at launch. And we're focused on that,
6863540	6868820	and we continue to deliver that value to the player base. Now, notice there's not an apology
6868820	6875940	there. Now, also, he will not say that, you know, future games will be bug free, but that would be
6876900	6882660	a foolish claim to make, I think. So yeah, and according to some people that got to check out
6882660	6888180	the Battlefield Hardline Beta, or Alpha, I guess, I don't know, Alpha, Beta, whatever it was,
6888980	6894260	apparently, it plays very similar to Battlefield 4, and some of the glitches that you see in
6894260	6900500	Battlefield 4, you're seeing in Hardline, so. Wow. Hopefully, the netcode should be better.
6900500	6905460	I mean, since it's, I'm assuming using the same engine, and hopefully they can just transfer that
6905460	6912180	over, but it is a different developer, so cross your fingers, I guess. It's more of like, I think,
6912180	6916900	maybe, if anything, consumers can learn to be a little bit cautious, maybe not jump in immediately
6916900	6921700	for day one, just kind of see how it's playing, because obviously, it's going to be a focus of
6921700	6926100	a lot of the reviews, especially ever since, like, you know, SimCity and Diablo 3 and stuff,
6926100	6931140	it's just got to see how those servers are handling things. Let me read the quote about
6931140	6935460	not making promises about being bug free, because I think it's interesting. So again, Andrew Wilson,
6935460	6940740	the CEO of EA, goes on to say, quote, it would be disingenuous for me to sit here and say,
6940740	6944740	we will never have an issue again, because that would mean we are never going to push the
6944740	6948900	boundaries again, and I don't want to be that company. I want to be a company that pushes to
6948900	6953380	lead and innovate and be creative, but you can start to do things that give you a better handle
6953380	6957620	and a better view about what the potential challenges might be. Yeah, but that's not being
6957620	6962580	innovative, that's being like, you know, that's basically saying, hey, you know what, we're going
6962580	6969460	to go ahead and purchase this many servers for this game, and we're going to hope that not a lot
6969460	6973220	of people play it, maybe buggy at first, but we're going to save a lot of money in the long run
6974180	6980980	once that initial, you know, kind of spike subsides. So did they not know how many pre-orders
6980980	6984820	the game had or something? It's not, it doesn't matter, because even if they know how many pre-orders
6984820	6989220	they have, they know that not everybody is playing at exactly the same time, so they're never going
6989220	6994820	to have enough server spots open for every single person. That's, that's the thing, that's the gamble
6994820	6999700	is you could do that if you, you know, ideally you could say, okay, we know how many copies of this
6999700	7005540	game we're printing, so this is how many server spots we're going to have open, but then again,
7005540	7010740	you're going to lose money because you're going to have all these servers that you aren't utilizing.
7010740	7014740	It gets a little easier when you start using, like, these virtual servers through, I think,
7014740	7021540	like Amazon and, you know, like Microsoft Azure servers or whatever, where they can scale it
7021540	7028100	dynamically, and so they're not having to purchase all these servers, it's just, it's a lot easier,
7028100	7036180	a lot more flexible, but I don't know. I just think it's like, you know, what was it, last year,
7036180	7043300	you know, or was it SimCity, perfect example here, yeah, we saw how shitty the Diablo 3 launch was,
7043300	7048420	it's not gonna be like that with SimCity, and then it was fucking terrible, so I don't buy whenever
7048420	7053780	a company tells me that it's not gonna be fucking terrible after the last launch was terrible,
7053780	7059860	because it seems like every MMO, they don't learn their lesson, every MMO that launches
7059860	7065460	has this problem too, yeah, every single one of them, I mean, some difficulties, you know,
7065460	7070500	a little bit of, you know, hiccups here and there are okay, I think, I kind of expected, but when
7070500	7076420	it's just fucked up, you know, and we're not even talking, like, that their servers are being
7076420	7082580	overrun, it's just bad netcode, like the game just wasn't working very well, that's a little
7082580	7088900	bit different, so hopefully they got that ironed out for the next game. All right, I think we have
7088900	7094820	one more story here, and then we're gonna get to the mailbag and the FUs. All right, so game I
7094820	7099300	didn't really get to play, but remember last week asking about, hey, whatever happened to Ridge
7099300	7105940	Racer, and one of the games that, you know, they put out last was Ridge Racer Driftopia, well,
7106500	7112020	apparently that didn't do too well, it was a free-to-play game that was on PlayStation 3 and PC,
7113060	7119860	came out, I want to say, like, last year sometime, developed by Bugbear, and they had, like, an early
7119860	7125860	access version of the game that came out in August 2013, it was like a beta, and never, I don't think,
7125860	7134500	really left beta, but now it's being shut down. They're closing off the servers August 15th,
7135140	7141780	and so, yeah, so much for Ridge Racer. I don't know why the FU music started playing right there, but it
7141780	7147700	would seem very well timed, but yeah, so unfortunately, you know, if you wanted to play
7148260	7153460	Ridge Racer Driftopia, you might want to get into it now, before that, you know, they shut the
7153460	7158500	servers down, but apparently it's not that great. Actdeft in our chat says, Driftopia was meh,
7159460	7167620	so I want a real, like, I want a good, you know, PlayStation 4, Xbox One Ridge Racer game from
7167620	7174660	Namco, like, it would be fantastic. Give me, like, a new, like, R4, you know, quality game.
7174660	7180980	That's what I want to see. Actdeft is saying, it wasn't, like, bad, but god, it was pay-to-win,
7181860	7187140	so that seems to be its issue. Yeah, they had, they really hoarded the last, was it the Ridge
7187140	7192260	Racer game for Vita? I remember it just soured everything, kind of like, man, I was looking
7192260	7196580	forward to the Vita Ridge Racer game, and then it's like, oh, it's 30 bucks, but you only get,
7196580	7200980	like, four tracks, and, you know, or four cars in, like, a few tracks, and you have to buy the
7200980	7208820	rest, and it's like, you know, you guys suck. All right, well, let's go to the mailbag. Every week,
7208820	7214900	you guys email us, mailbag at, excuse me, participate at orangeloungeradio.com. I mentioned
7214900	7218260	it's 12 years old, and we had the same email address for 11 and a half of those years.
7219300	7224580	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is a place to send us an email, and we read your emails here
7224580	7229380	on the show. Usually DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and reads some of her favorite emails,
7229380	7235540	but since she's not here, the task has fallen to me, and we have four emails tonight. But,
7235540	7238580	look, you gotta respond to these two. Without DarkSakura here, I'm gonna need your help,
7238580	7242740	all right? So, let's start with this first email, which comes from our pal, Critical Myth,
7243620	7247700	one of the hosts, and I suppose the namesake of sorts behind the Critical Myth podcast,
7247700	7251460	which airs Monday, Wednesday, Fridays at the Voice of the East Network, vognetwork.com.
7252340	7256740	John from Critical Myth writes us and says, hey, OLR crew, I was listening to the commentary on
7256740	7260660	Ubisoft's fumble over the multiplayer co-op in Assassin's Creed Unity, and as a huge fan
7260660	7265140	of the franchise, a few statements were made that I think were unfair or uninformed. First, Rob,
7265140	7269060	at one point, you mentioned that the defense given in the written statement smacked of the,
7269060	7273940	quote, I have a black friend trope. What maybe isn't apparent is that the statement made by
7273940	7277700	Ubisoft is practically word for word the disclaimer presented at the start of every
7277700	7282020	Assassin's Creed game. It was originally required because the first game is, after all,
7282020	7286100	about Middle Eastern Arabs fighting and killing Christian Templars, and there was a bit of
7286100	7291780	controversy over that at the time. In the larger context, who do we have as playable lead characters?
7291780	7298340	Altair, Ezio, Connor, Aveline, Edward, Adewell, Arno, and Desmond. So, five out of eight are
7298340	7303300	persons of color, or at least of prominently non-European descent. I don't think token
7303300	7307460	representation is really an issue, especially when distinct cultural backgrounds are inherent
7307460	7312100	to the plot and character development in the games they headline. I have a feeling, and I gotta
7312100	7315460	go back to what I said last week, so I'm gonna be honest, I don't even remember, but I have a
7315460	7320660	feeling I wasn't trying to say that as a direct thing. I was trying to kind of say it as a
7320660	7326900	comparison, but I did neglect the fact that this is a standard disclaimer that they've been using
7326900	7331700	for a long time about the whole thing, but I'm sorry, that disclaimer doesn't really get them
7331700	7337300	out of the hot water of the statement that they made about, you know, essentially it's too hard
7337300	7343140	to put a woman in a video game, which is what it came off as. Whether they have this history or not,
7343140	7348580	you know, perception is a huge chunk of it, right? And the way the message is delivered,
7348580	7354580	and unfortunately the way Ubisoft's line came out was, you know, that, oh, we just, you know,
7354580	7359620	we don't really have time for women. That's how it came across. You know what it really is? It's
7359620	7367380	just the AI so good, this is gonna be totally gender... whatever. I don't care. It's very
7367380	7372020	inappropriate of me to say this, but anyways, um, yeah, me of course. Well, let's be real,
7372020	7375540	it won't be the first inappropriate thing you say on the show, so enjoy it while Jamie talks.
7375540	7381140	The AI is so good, it's just, she can't decide what to wear before she goes out and, you know,
7381140	7386340	and assassinate people, and so unfortunately they just, they can't get the character out there.
7386340	7389460	You're only saying this because you know if Dark Sakura were here, she'd chuck her
7389460	7394340	shoe at you right now, and luckily she ain't here to kick your butt, so all right.
7394340	7399060	And it's, it's only mildly funny, but no, seriously, it's just, they just made excuses.
7399060	7402900	All right, at least you admit it's a cheap joke. All right, uh, okay, let's go back to the email
7402900	7407460	here, uh, which brings me to my second point. When Aveline was mentioned as headlining
7407460	7412020	Assassin's Creed Liberation, Jamie quickly dismissed her as, quote, token female character.
7412020	7416500	This is gross misrepresentation of the situation. Aveline was the lead character in what was
7416500	7421220	intended to be a triple-A flagship title for the Vita, a game that received significant promotion.
7421220	7425540	The entire game was centered around a woman of mixed heritage living in colonial New Orleans.
7425540	7430100	That's about as far from a, quote, token female character as it gets. In fact, it aligns far more
7430100	7434180	with the positive elements you cited for Tomb Raider. What might not be apparent to those who
7434180	7438420	didn't play the games or follow the franchise is that players were able to choose female character
7438420	7443140	models for multiplayer from the start. Even before that, one could recruit both male and
7443140	7448180	female assassins to join the, quote, brotherhood. The intense criticisms of Ubisoft come not from
7448180	7453220	the standpoint of, here we go again, but rather, why is this an issue now? It runs counter to the
7453220	7458420	past several years or games of the franchise. I understand that, and I respect that, but I,
7458420	7461860	I think, and Jamie's not here to really respond to this, unfortunately, so I'm gonna have to take
7461860	7468900	my best guess and try to interpret her point here, but I don't think it was necessary that,
7468900	7475620	necessarily, that Aveline was a token female character in that game, but when they were using
7475620	7481460	her as the defense, she suddenly felt like the token female character, because like, oh, oh,
7481460	7485780	oh, but, but here, look, look at this over here, over here in this completely different game in
7485780	7491620	the franchise. We did this, this whole other thing, but that still doesn't explain why you
7491620	7499060	said it would take all this money to create female in co-op mode and, and all the, the clothes and
7499060	7504820	all this stuff, yet Sunset Overdrive shades you in literally less than a week after E3. You know
7504820	7509220	what I mean? It's just that's, that's the disconnect. And if we're going to do like,
7509220	7513940	oh, well, it's motion capping and stuff like that. There's a pretty interesting movement going on in
7514020	7520500	Sunset Overdrive. So, I don't know. Uh, on another topic, I would agree. Well,
7520500	7524500	before we get to the other topic, I just want to say, you know, I, I hope even though we're
7524500	7528980	continuing a debate here, I totally respect your viewpoint. And I understand there's a lot of fans
7528980	7534740	of the Assassin's Creed series who are very frustrated by what's going on, but I'm not sure
7534740	7541060	that's as much about the game itself as it is a commentary on the industry, because like I said,
7541060	7547060	this whole dam has been waiting to burst. And unfortunately it took this pull quote and this
7547060	7550820	circumstance for this. Oh, I shouldn't say unfortunately, because this needed to happen.
7550820	7555780	It's just, if you're sitting in Ubisoft shoes or you're an Assassin's Creed fan right now,
7555780	7560420	it's kind of unfortunate. I will say this. I saw a demo of the game at E3 and it looks pretty
7560420	7564980	darn good. I don't usually super get into these Assassin's Creed games, but Assassin's Creed
7564980	7568260	Unity looked like it might be pretty sweet and some of the co-op stuff. Yeah, it looks pretty
7568260	7573460	cool, but I can also see how it's frustrating where like, you know, if you're a female gamer
7573460	7579140	that was hoping to be the female slashing people up, it's not there for you. And their reason why
7579140	7584820	is kind of crappy. But anyway, I just want to say, I, I, I do respect the opinion and I understand
7584820	7589460	why Assassin's Creed's, uh, fan base is probably a little frustrated at why is this happening to
7589460	7595300	my franchise? Why did you have to open your mouth? All right. On another topic, I would agree that
7595300	7599620	Nintendo came out strong this E3. What I find regrettable is that many of the games sound great,
7599620	7603300	especially the new Zelda, but then I remember that I would have to deal with those awful Wii
7603300	7608100	controllers and my interest takes a nosedive. If the games were fully playable using classic
7608100	7612660	controllers versus the game pad motion control nonsense, I'd be far more inclined to take the
7612660	7618100	plunge. I think at least Smash Brothers, I mean, you can do the GameCube controller and all that,
7618100	7623380	but as far as Zelda goes, they have like a Wii U pro controller that they sell and a lot of Nintendo's
7623380	7627860	first party games, which is pretty much all that's on the Wii U supports that. Yeah. I think that
7627860	7631540	would probably be more of a tradition, especially because if they're going to be using the game pad,
7631540	7636420	it's gonna, it's gonna use that. They're not going to be using the Wii remote. They may have a mode
7636420	7640420	if you want to do Wii remote and nunchuck, but I think it's probably going to be Mario Kart 8. You
7640420	7645860	can do Wii remote nunchuck. Yeah. So I will say this. I mean, I, you know, everybody has their
7645860	7650420	own opinion or whatever. I don't think the game pads as bad as a lot of people think it is. I
7650420	7655300	mean, yeah, it's big, but when I'm holding it, it actually feels really comfortable. I prefer it
7655300	7660100	to an Xbox 360 controller. That's for sure. That's the one I can't stand is a 360 controller. At
7660100	7666980	least the D pad on the game pad works. Anyway, uh, one last thing I thought everyone knew that
7666980	7672340	Rob's real name is Danny Fantastico. How dare you? How dare you out me on the show? All right,
7672340	7676900	here it is. John from Critical Myth, uh, sending us that first email. Let's get to the next email,
7676900	7683220	which the subject line is yo, which I can't help but think of that app that everybody's talking
7683220	7688740	about this week. If you heard about the yo app, all you do is you said you said yo's to friends.
7688740	7696580	So it just pops up on the phone. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Wow. That's like only, only like a couple
7696580	7703300	decades away from was it? It is serious. It's like the flappy bird of social networking apps
7703300	7709540	right now. It's like, why out of all of the social network apps is this one? The one everybody's
7709540	7716100	talking about is it's stupid. And with all due respect to the creator of flappy bird,
7716100	7719620	who I admire being just one person, but it's still like, why out of all the games
7720420	7727060	on the marketplace are we fucking fixated on flappy bird? I don't know. All right. Anyhow,
7727060	7732260	uh, this email is actually from serious turtle who sent us the subject of yo who says, I want
7732260	7737140	to bring up two things. First, Jamie, good old games just had to the moon on sale for a dollar
7737140	7742660	99. I bought it solely on your strong recommendation and I need another game to make me cry.
7742660	7747540	I don't play too many eight bit RPGs. So that's a testament to how convincing your sales pitch was.
7747540	7751540	I'll let you know what I think when I play a few hours, we'll wait, we'll wait for the followup,
7751540	7755700	which good thing there'll be a followup cause Jamie's not here tonight. And secondly, I wanted
7755700	7760260	to let Shane know who also isn't here. Maybe he'll hear me. Maybe he's listening to the show. I don't
7760260	7764900	know. But a serious turtle said, I want to let Shane know that I'm playing Pokemon X. This is
7764900	7769780	my first Pokemon game ever. And it definitely took me four to five hours to start to get into it.
7769780	7774340	But now that I'm 12 hours in, I'm really enjoying it. And even though Shane sounds like Eeyore from
7774340	7781700	Winnie the Pooh, maybe it's a good thing he's not in the room. I still thought that he might crack
7781700	7787300	a smile at a Pokemon noob joining the ranks as always love the show and depend on your Monday
7787300	7794020	podcast to start my week off right. Well, no pressure. Your loyal turtle in Philly, serious
7794020	7803060	turtle. No pressure. I depend on your podcast. No weeks off for me. You better have a game plan
7803060	7812020	come July. You better take the day off. All right. Next question from EA Skizy, who is taking the
7812020	7816660	opportunity to turn our mailbag segment into like Ask Orange Lounge every week with his questions.
7816660	7822500	But you know, I put the mailbag out there for everybody. And if Skizy is going to be one of
7822500	7828500	four people. Oh no, Shane's listening to the show. Uh oh. Come here, Shane. Come here, come here.
7829700	7833220	Shane just burst into the room saying, I do not sound like Eeyore. Did you hear that email?
7833940	7839460	Yes. And what would you like to say to the Pokemon noob who got into Pokemon X,
7839460	7843300	even though he called you Eeyore? Congratulations. And you're an idiot.
7846660	7853380	Could the mic pick that up when he literally came in the kitchen and screamed, I'm not Eeyore.
7853380	7856020	I don't know. I guess we'll find out. I guess we'll find out.
7858500	7861860	All right. Anyhow, back to EA. The chat room's cracking up. All right.
7862580	7870180	On to EA Skizy's email who says, hello, Orange Lounge guys and gal. If you could commit just
7870180	7876260	one crime free of punishment, no matter the severity of the crime, what would it be and why?
7877060	7881940	Jamie isn't allowed to rob any taco stands because seriously, those guys are working hard. They don't
7881940	7887300	need that. Come on. Take it easy people. EA Skizy from Milwaukee. And they, by the way, they do say
7887300	7891940	they did hear Shane yelling all the way over there on the stream. All right. There you go. Live radio.
7891940	7897220	It's hilarious. Back to, um, back to Skizy's question. Uh, what is the one crime you would
7897220	7901780	do if free of punishment? Well, sadly, Jamie's not here to say how she would rob a taco stand,
7901780	7905220	but, uh, I'll ask Loki. What would you, what would you, what would be your crime
7905300	7908340	free of punishment? Oh, something that gives me a lot of money, I guess.
7909140	7912500	That's funny. Cause that's where my mind was. That is. I think the crime I would commit is
7912500	7917220	robbing a bank. I wouldn't hurt anybody. I wouldn't hurt anybody. I just, I just want
7917220	7923300	the money. Thanks. You said free of punishment, right? I wouldn't even rob a bank, rob like the
7923300	7928980	mint or something or like, you know, somehow get all the money that Comcast makes in a year or
7928980	7932740	something. I don't know. Just, well, I also, I don't know. I guess I really have to give this
7932740	7937540	more thought because like I wouldn't want to take money from people. I want money that insurance
7937540	7941780	will reimburse or something where the money doesn't directly come out of, you know, people's
7941780	7947060	accounts. I got it. I got a crime. That'd be perfect. Michael Bay direct the next star Wars
7947060	7956500	film. There you go. There's a crime. That's the crime you commit of all the crimes.
7957140	7961780	That'd be hilarious. Just like, let me cast, let me like write the script or whatever for the next
7961780	7968020	star Wars film. It won't make any fucking sense at all. It'll be awesome. No, I don't know. Money,
7968020	7973140	of course. Cause you know. You have to remember guys, I'm coming off a 13 episode marathon of
7973140	7978020	orange is the new black. I'm afraid to commit a crime right now. All right. I am not going to
7978020	7983860	prison ever cause they'd be crazy in prison. And I realized that was a woman's prison, but
7984340	7987780	you know, men have just as much drama. If not more, I wonder if there'll be a spinoff series.
7989060	7997460	All right. Anyway. Well, they, they had men in the first part of it was spoilers. OMG.
7998580	8004500	I think the first episode of season two. All right. No, he didn't spoil anything. Don't worry.
8004500	8011300	All right. Uh, last email tonight from dr. Noir who emails us, uh, uh, entitled gaming in Belgium.
8011700	8017300	Hmm. Uh, I'm going to totally mispronounce this first sentence. Uh, because that's what
8017300	8023300	happens when you send me, uh, non English words to open your emails, but born that night,
8023300	8030100	madam at Mrs. Day orange lounge. Greetings from your globe trotting correspondent, dr. Noir.
8030100	8034740	I just spent the last week in Brussels and I have to say, I am surprised by the absence of video
8034740	8040660	games in the country. I was at first encouraged by the presence of niche of PS four. Don't worry.
8040660	8045460	They'll sprout up there eventually. PS four and Vita kiosks at the airport when I arrived,
8045460	8051780	but if since to find so not so much as a poster or advert for any sort of video game during my stay,
8051780	8057540	not on TV print or billboards on the streets. This is surprising because even though I am,
8057540	8062260	my travels often take me to business settings in much of Latin America and I don't do too much
8062260	8067300	tourist exploring. I usually find some sort of video game shop at a mall or even a mom and pop
8067300	8073540	store peddling use games here and there here. Zero zip nada. I wonder if this is just a fluke
8073540	8077380	since I spent most of my time in the business and museum sectors, but I did go into one of the
8077380	8082340	shopping districts and take the subway and buses several times and I usually see at least a poster
8082340	8086900	or billboard there. Hopefully some of the local Belgian listeners can confirm. Yeah, we, I,
8086900	8091140	there's been at least two people from Belgium who have emailed us before, so maybe they can
8091140	8095060	give perspective. Where are you hiding? Where are you all hiding? Is there, is there like a club
8095060	8100180	that you have to be in over there to find all the cool gaming stuff? I don't know. Anyway,
8100180	8104660	Dr. Noir continues, in any case, what I did find is a good number of board games and even managed
8104660	8109140	to pick up a variation on the standard memory games for my kids, which should provide lots of
8109140	8114020	fun. It's called Shadow Monsters and the twist is that it includes three pairs of scary monsters in
8114020	8119220	the deck and if any of them come up and you do not match them, hijinks ensue. One of them has,
8119220	8124340	you pass your one stack to the right, another to the left, and the last, my favorite, shuffles the
8124340	8129460	remaining tiles in play. Also, the game matches the monster's image with their shadow, so it
8129460	8136020	makes the memorization a bit more difficult and suitable for adults or older kids. I also snagged
8136020	8140260	a bunch of lead figures of Roman medieval and renaissance soldiers that will see great use in
8140260	8146020	my D&D games in the near future. Anyhow, I should get to my gate now, so here's to, here's a salute
8146020	8153140	before 10 hours of flight time. Have a great week. Well, interesting. You know, and, and we talk
8153140	8156500	about that here on the show is that, you know, we're in a very interesting perspective with this
8156500	8162900	podcasting and radio or on the internet. You know, a lot of radio up until, you know, internet radio
8162900	8168100	was born was confined to local news and local things, you know, but now that we have the, the
8168100	8172900	power to reach the world, we really have to be mindful sometimes is that, you know, gaming in
8172900	8177860	different parts of the world is so different than what it is here. So, so different and granted,
8177860	8182580	although Dr. Noir, I mean, I would bet that, you know, these, our other Belgian listeners are going
8182580	8186260	to email us and just be all, he was just in the wrong place. It's everywhere. It's here and here
8186260	8190260	and here. And you just, you just didn't see it, you know, that type of thing, but still, you know,
8190260	8194660	in other countries, you know, it's very different, you know, the types of systems that are popular,
8194660	8199700	the PlayStation 4, the Xbox one, they're not out everywhere. We know how Japan feels about
8199700	8203940	Microsoft's products and we'll see if history is going to continue or what have you, you know,
8203940	8209620	it's very different. It would be nice to see them do okay, you know, in Japan stuff. I mean,
8209620	8216020	they can't, you can't fail like completely every time and they got to, you got to have a comeback
8216020	8221140	at some point, you would think. All right, well, that was it for the mailbag. If you want to
8221140	8225300	participate with the mailbag segment in a future week, send an email to participate
8225300	8232820	at orange lounge radio.com. Let's get into the FUs of the week and get out whatever angst we
8232820	8236020	might have tonight.
8249620	8255140	I'll start tonight cause rage nator and chat says, guy, your French needs work, dude. F you to rage
8255140	8260900	nator. I didn't ask to speak French on the show. It was emailed. So out of respect to the listeners,
8260900	8269860	I gave it my best shot. Never had a lesson. No, I didn't. I sure did. Maybe, maybe I could learn
8269860	8274100	a thing or two playing assassin's creed unity or something since it's in France. Uh, anyway,
8274100	8279620	in all seriousness, uh, F you the week goes to, um, I don't know. I actually don't,
8279620	8284260	I don't have a whole lot of FUs things to be angsty about. Cause, um, there's a lot of good
8284260	8290340	stuff coming up with days off work and stuff. So F you to just all the busy-ness that's happening
8290340	8299060	before two back to back long weekends. Yeah. Busy calendar. Loki. Um, just F you to, you know,
8299860	8303620	game development stuff taking three times as long as it normally, you know, you think it would.
8303620	8306980	And I'm kind of used to that now. Cause that seems to be everything, you know, everything I
8306980	8312260	think that we get done at a certain time, it takes about three times as long because unforeseen
8312260	8318980	problems, you know, arise and that kind of thing. I just want to get to non game engine stuff. Not
8318980	8324740	that it's not fun. It's just, uh, it'd be nice to build a show a little bit more like, you know,
8324740	8328180	I can't really make a video of what I'm doing now because it's completely boring. You know,
8328180	8333060	no one is a shit about, Oh, Hey look, you can fix your UV coordinates. Yeah. I'm excited about it
8333060	8338740	because I fixed my UV coordinates. You see, you see the big picture. Yeah. So I don't know. All
8338740	8342420	right. Just a couple more stories for you guys. And then, uh, we're going to get to the Skype line
8342420	8347060	at one eight seven seven Gamebo LR or username on Skype, orange lounge radio. But first Loki.
8347140	8353620	And speaking of unity, um, unity has officially come to PlayStation mobile. So if you, um,
8353620	8362660	download the newest version of unity, which is like 4.6, 4.5, I think it's 4.5 something. Cause
8362660	8367460	4.6 is not yet. Cause 4.6 is the one I'm waiting for. That's the one that has the revamped, uh,
8367460	8371620	GUI, uh, infrastructure. So you can actually make menus and stuff cause right now it's a piece of
8371620	8379860	shit. Um, but the new version, um, actually has unity for, um, PlayStation mobile and allows you
8379860	8386740	to create, um, you know, games for that platform as well as easily port stuff from iPhone, iPad,
8386740	8392340	Android devices to PlayStation mobile as well. And it allows you to kind of to publish on the
8392340	8397140	Vita platform. Although if you're looking to publish on the actual PlayStation Vita,
8397140	8403540	like as part of their store, I think you got to get permission from, um, Sony for that. But to
8403540	8409060	get access to be able to, um, output to PlayStation mobile, you actually have to go to the PlayStation
8409060	8417220	mobile website. So psm.playsation.net slash portal. And, uh, once you go there, you sign up
8417220	8423860	and you get a link to download the version of unity that supports that. So that's pretty cool.
8423860	8429860	And shit right now they, I think, you know, I saw a little bit of the next beta, but I think
8429860	8435220	we support almost every single console platform right now on PC and stuff. So it's a pretty
8435220	8440580	exciting. So once I do get to that point where I'm actually publishing something, maybe I will
8440580	8445940	publish it on, it would be cool to see my game on a, on a Vita. I would be totally stoked by that.
8445940	8451380	So, um, one of the reasons why I chose you in the first place. So very excited.
8452900	8456340	All right. What platforms will your game be coming out on?
8457300	8463780	Um, well, PC for sure. And then the rest is just kind of whatever you can get, right?
8463780	8470340	Well, um, like it's gonna, I've been trying to keep everything very simple for like mobile. I
8470340	8475140	don't know if it's gonna, when it's done, I don't know how it's gonna run as far as mobile goes,
8475140	8480420	but I've been trying to keep everything very optimized. Um, so it's just gonna be testing
8480420	8484340	to see, you know, I don't even know if it's the type of game that would work well with mobile, but
8484980	8489140	I don't know. Consoles would be cool if I could do that. I just don't know what's involved with
8489140	8496500	like publishing to, you know, Wii U or, um, to the Vita. I mean, obviously PlayStation, um,
8497380	8501860	you know, mobile's a little different, but it's not as easy to find stuff. I don't know,
8501860	8505620	it'd be interesting just to check it out. I seriously am probably going to run a Kickstarter
8505620	8510580	campaign at some point, but the thing is though, is if I'm going to do that, I want the game to be
8510580	8516340	fucking done or at least very, very, very, very, very extremely close to being done. Not this,
8516340	8521940	Oh, Hey, look, I got playable levels. Give me money. Cause you don't, I just don't, I don't
8521940	8527620	trust myself, you know, to, you know, but, uh, it would be, it's good for getting exposure out
8527620	8531780	there for your game. And also it helps with like the green light process and stuff like that to
8531780	8537140	get people excited about something. All right. Well, something, uh, some folks might be getting
8537140	8542500	excited about is a new movie that's coming out all about video games. It's called video games,
8542500	8545540	the movie, which was, uh, the result of a crowdfunding campaign. Actually,
8545540	8550580	speaking of all that stuff, it will be released at theaters in North America on July 18th,
8550580	8555460	but I wouldn't really expect it to see in every Cineplex across America. Um, but, uh,
8555940	8561540	before the film is in theaters, the initial debut will be on July 15th via an iTunes exclusive
8561540	8565380	release, which there's been a few movies recently that kind of dabbled in that. So I think it's
8565380	8570740	been kind of successful. Um, the movie is narrated by Sean Astin, who is one of the Goonies, uh,
8570740	8575860	also in the Lord of the Rings movies. Right. So he's done a few things there. Um, he, in the
8575860	8579860	movie, it will be documenting the rise of the games industry from when it was, you know, just
8579860	8585380	the little pixels on the screen to basically the gigantic, bigger than bigger budgets than movies.
8585460	8591060	They are today, uh, variants film president Dylan Marchetti in a statement said, quote,
8591060	8594900	everybody loves a great video game. In recent years, they've evolved into something way beyond
8594900	8598980	what any of us who grew up playing an eight bit system could imagine. But regardless of whether
8598980	8603700	you're up gaming until 3 AM or haven't played a video game in decades, there's something for you
8603700	8608100	in this film. And we think audiences will be delighted. Well, we'll see how well this does
8608100	8614100	when it comes out in about a month. So, all right, by the way, there's, uh, some other people,
8614100	8617140	I should mention some of the other people in this game. The film was also produced by Cliff
8617140	8622420	Pizinski, Cliffy B. Right. Uh, some of the people that are in the game, Zach Braff, Chris Hardwick,
8622420	8629380	Wil Wheaton, Nolan Bushnell, Hideo Kojima, and, uh, Alison, Alison Haslis. Sorry. I always say
8629380	8633540	her last name wrong. Sorry about that. But, uh, yep. There you go. Some of the people to, uh,
8633540	8639220	expect in the movie. All right. That's it. We're done. We got through all the news.
8639220	8643940	So it's your turn. We're open up the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype,
8643940	8650420	Orange Lounge Radio. If you'd like to give us a call, uh, we will take your call and we'll leave
8650420	8654260	the Skype line open for a little bit just to see if anybody's going to get through. Uh, in the
8654260	8658100	meantime, while we wait for some calls, I don't know if Loki has any last minute stories. I think
8658100	8663140	I have a couple Twitter topics I can pull up. I do have one thing. Uh, apparently the, uh,
8663220	8667780	Dropbox account for CD Projekt Red was accidentally turned public,
8667780	8672820	um, for a little bit. And, or it was, I think it was Dropbox or Google Drive or something like
8672820	8679060	that. And people are able to grab the, um, uh, what was it? The build documents for,
8679860	8685220	uh, Witcher 3, including all the spoilers and everything. So watch yourself out there.
8685220	8690100	Don't spoil or don't, uh, check out those spoilers. If you're trying to actually save,
8690100	8693300	you know, I wonder if they'll change it. The game's not due till early next year.
8693300	8696740	I wonder if they'll go back and change some key things. I doubt it. It might be too late to do
8696740	8700180	that. I don't know, but I'm sure some of the stuff will change because it's just a design doc, but,
8700180	8708420	um, uh, I want to say someone said 36 endings. So I don't know. All right, let's go to the phones.
8708420	8711380	We do have calls coming in, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8712020	8716660	Legend of Zaku here. Hey, Zaku. How you doing, buddy? Uh, nothing much. Just killing,
8716660	8722660	just killing a Sunday evening trying to, you know, uh, dull the loss. Well, not even loss,
8722660	8728980	but just like last minute draw of, uh, that soccer game. Yeah. You know, I don't do a lot of, well,
8728980	8732820	it's funny when I was younger, actually I played soccer for like five years when I was younger,
8732820	8736420	if you can believe it, when I was in like grade school or whatever, but nowadays the only soccer
8736420	8743620	I know is Mega Man. Yep. Well that, and right now I'm like, uh, playing flight simulator, trying to,
8743620	8749140	you know, land, well, actually taxi a plane back to the gate. Do you get into a lot of
8749140	8752820	those simulator games? Is it just flight simulator or do you like to play like farm simulator and,
8752820	8759220	and Europe flight simulator? As you can see, I bought myself a little choice, you know,
8759220	8764020	little messy. He's showing us on webcam, by the way, you have a messy desk, young man.
8764740	8771380	Yeah. I managed to put the plane on the ground without killing people. All right. Well,
8771380	8774980	congrats on safely landing the plane. Do you have aspirations to fly in real life
8774980	8781460	or is it just now just, just for games? What do you have aspirations to fly like IRL like
8781460	8785540	in real life or now just, just computer simulations? It's just one of those things
8785540	8790820	I've, you know, put off for so many years until I went to Micro Center one day and I saw for 30
8790820	8795940	bucks. I said, what the hell? I just, you know, I bought it, bought, you know, went to Best Buy to
8795940	8802180	get a cheap, uh, flight stick. And then that, you know, and then from there it's been snowballing.
8802180	8804660	Well, you're not the, you're not the only one that feels that way because you don't
8804660	8808660	our chat room over at live dot com says flight SIM 10 is the best. I still play it.
8809300	8814420	Yeah. I just, uh, I mean, I'm lucky. I still had, they still had box copies over there.
8814420	8817540	Well, what's on your mind. Did you, did you want to talk to us about flight Sims or was
8817540	8822100	something else on your mind tonight? I guess, uh, mostly, um, the whole,
8822660	8828260	I guess we'll see about E3 and how, you know, because I've been out of the loop for a while
8829220	8835380	and the fact that, um, a lot of games such as, uh, Kingdom Hearts three, very tight-lipped
8836260	8841860	to the point where, you know, they're really not, they really have a story down, but whether or not
8841860	8846500	Disney will actually let them use some of the more recently acquired properties just in time to make
8846500	8854260	whatever deadline they have set forth for the game, it's yet to be seen. Like if, you know,
8854260	8860420	possibility, like even the creator of Kingdom Hearts was, was stating that he would love to
8860420	8865380	only if he was able to like whether or not Disney's, uh, willing to license anything
8866020	8869620	in the realm of Marvel and, or Lucas or such a thing.
8870500	8874580	I would love to see something like that come to fruition as I think a lot of people would,
8874580	8878660	but yeah, it just, especially with the Star Wars stuff, you know, Star Wars kind of has its own
8878660	8882420	video games and so does the Marvels. So I don't know, but then again, so there's tons of other
8882420	8886980	types of Disney games. So I don't think anything's necessarily off the table. Um, I would think though
8886980	8890580	that the creators of Kingdom Hearts kind of already know where they're going with the story
8890580	8895620	and have kind of already planned out what worlds are included, but it's not like they can't, um,
8896420	8900740	they don't have access to rather like some of the Disney stuff that is coming out in the future.
8900740	8906340	I mean, Disney has their movies planned through like, I'm sure 2018 or 2019 at this point.
8906340	8909540	I would imagine they would have like a long-term roadmap.
8909540	8914420	So I imagine, you know, uh, the folks at Square get privy to some of that information
8914420	8920580	because like I think about like Tron, uh, not just the Tron, the 1985 Tron, but Tron Legacy
8920580	8925540	was in the 3DS Tron game and that wasn't that long after the movie. So it's like, you know, it's,
8925540	8928420	it is possible to get the newer stuff in there, even though the games might have
8928420	8929460	a long development time.
8929460	8935540	You think also, uh, then you also run the risk of a scope creep and then whether or
8935540	8941940	not you're able to punt the release date further, even though you're aiming for quality,
8941940	8944900	you pretty much, uh, you might get carried away.
8945780	8949460	Honestly though, Zaku, I think when it comes to these games, I think we'll be
8949460	8955540	lucky. We'll be very lucky if Final Fantasy 15 is next year. I honestly think at this point,
8955860	8960420	I'm thinking more like March, April, 2016, like in time for the end of the fiscal year.
8960420	8964900	I think that's when you're going to get a Final Fantasy 15. And honestly, Kingdom Hearts 3,
8965460	8969780	not tell well after that. And like, I'm, I'm talking like 2017.
8971220	8974900	I mean, so far, sure. They even have demo footage right now.
8976180	8977380	But is it playing?
8978820	8984900	You know, completely knowing that Tokyo Game Show is like only a few months away.
8985140	8991700	And, um, hopefully if anything, because the fact that Squeenix really didn't put out as
8991700	8998340	much for E3, because they're really not at a point to actually, uh, divulge any of it.
8998340	9002980	Hence the reason why they're trying to spread most of the news regarding, you know,
9002980	9005780	Kingdom Hearts and whatever other game they're going to come out.
9005780	9009620	Don't get me wrong, Zaku, I would love to be wrong on that, but it's just kind of like,
9009620	9012980	you know, these games take forever to develop and Final Fantasy 15,
9012980	9017940	didn't, I mean, it's been in development since it was 13, uh, side story, whatever it was called.
9018820	9020260	Loki, what do you want to say on that?
9020260	9023540	I don't think, uh, I think Final Fantasy 15 would probably be,
9024420	9028020	um, maybe, I think it's gonna be next year sometime,
9028020	9030660	because they've already had tons of footage of it and stuff.
9030660	9033380	Kingdom Hearts 3 though, there's hardly been anything for it,
9033380	9037380	and I'm guessing we'll maybe see like a better reveal at Tokyo Game Show,
9037380	9039860	but I would say maybe spring 2016.
9040740	9044340	Yeah, yeah, that, well, as I said, it really depends on how far
9044900	9050180	long they've gone in the process, whether or not A, they managed to make any, any front,
9050180	9052740	you know, any progress on the actual development, and B,
9052740	9056260	whether or not they have all the voice talents marshaled up and written scheduled.
9056260	9057300	It's all speculation.
9057300	9061940	One half is getting the game, you know, built out with all the assets and code.
9061940	9066340	The other half, and the more important half, is essentially the acting.
9066420	9071140	The fact that if they did decide to, you know, to go big and do like,
9071780	9074740	you know, Star Wars or anything Marvel related,
9074740	9078820	they have, they would have to at least schedule that well in advance.
9079460	9081940	Like if they pulled the trigger on this, knowing that they,
9081940	9085700	that Disney pretty much gave them the permit, you know, authorization to do it,
9086580	9090660	then yeah, they would, you know, assuming they got,
9090660	9095220	you know, assuming they got it a lot, a lot earlier than what we're anticipating,
9095220	9098100	they might have everything ready to, you know,
9098100	9100900	if they're running it concurrently, they might have everything.
9100900	9104580	I do think though, Zaku, I think you're onto something when you say the Tokyo Game
9104580	9106100	Show is probably going to show us a little more.
9106100	9109940	I kind of expect that would be, you know, when we'll get an update, if nothing else,
9109940	9111620	on at least 15.
9111620	9114740	I don't necessarily know if Kingdom Hearts 3, they'll say much more on it.
9114740	9118180	I mean, maybe just little sprinklings, maybe a new trailer or something like that,
9118180	9121060	but I still kind of think they're pushing the 2.5 remix.
9121540	9128900	So I bet at Tokyo Game Show, they give away that there's like a trailer
9128900	9131220	for the third game when you beat 2.5 remixers.
9131220	9133220	But see, that's the thing with 2.5 remixes.
9133220	9137940	I think when they're putting that out now, that the timing of that says that
9137940	9141860	three's not too far behind, because it wouldn't make sense to me to put it out
9141860	9145700	that far away from three, because they've been doing one each year,
9145700	9148100	and that makes you think, well, maybe it's going to be next year.
9148980	9150660	But I think it's still too...
9150660	9156980	Keep in mind, the remakes are essentially just mostly texture swaps,
9156980	9160900	but more importantly, getting it to run on the PS3 architecture.
9160900	9166340	But you're right, those take at least upwards to a year and a half of dev cycles.
9166340	9167300	But either way...
9167300	9171380	They're going to take you an entire year to understand anyway, so you know what?
9171940	9175300	Either way, TGS or hell, even PAX East.
9175540	9180100	Squeenix has, out of all the other developers aside from Ubisoft and Microsoft,
9180100	9182580	Squeenix still has some sort of presence.
9182580	9185940	That's whether or not they'll probably be the biggest ones.
9185940	9190020	I still think PAX is really their time to push the MMOs too, though.
9190020	9191060	Like 14, I think.
9191060	9193700	Because you know there'll be an expansion to support for that.
9193700	9195220	I kind of see that as a factor.
9195220	9198660	They're probably going to push them 2.5 remix.
9198660	9200500	And then they're going to save three.
9200500	9204180	They're going to start teasing a lot more three in TGS.
9205060	9206820	And hopefully PAX East.
9206820	9208260	I'm thinking PAX East.
9208260	9211700	I don't know, it's kind of like a far-fetched, wily-eyed idea.
9211700	9216260	But think about the fact that there's not that many larger game devs in PAX East anymore.
9216260	9217140	It's mostly indies.
9217140	9223460	And you know, to a point, with the Squeenix being one of the very few,
9224420	9227220	who knows how much more space they might give them,
9227220	9229540	especially if they have something exclusive like Kingdom Hearts.
9229700	9230660	Who knows, Zaku?
9230660	9231220	Who knows?
9231220	9234820	Because we could speculate for another four hours, I'm sure.
9234820	9236820	But Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.
9236820	9237460	Thanks for the call.
9237460	9238660	Have fun flying.
9238660	9239460	Don't kill people.
9240100	9241220	I landed, all right?
9241220	9242580	Now I gotta shut off the engines.
9242580	9243140	All right, bye.
9245060	9247620	Don't hit the wrong switch and you know, collide the bla-
9247620	9250340	You know, like accidentally you think the thing's in park and it's in drive
9250340	9251780	and you just go, boom, right in the terminal.
9252580	9253380	All right, anyhow.
9253380	9254660	Let's get to some more calls.
9254660	9258340	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9258340	9259380	Let's go to another call.
9260020	9261220	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.
9261220	9261700	Who's this?
9264820	9265940	I thought we had the call.
9265940	9267140	Let me try that again.
9267140	9268180	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.
9268180	9268660	Who's this?
9270580	9272020	Hi, this is Raging Eater.
9272580	9273140	Hi, Raging Eater.
9273140	9273940	What's on your mind, buddy?
9274900	9279940	Um, you know, one quick news story that wasn't covered in tonight's show.
9280580	9286420	Although Bobby Blackwell did touch on it slightly, you know, during his show earlier tonight.
9286420	9288340	What, you're trying to say he's better than us?
9288340	9289620	Is that what you're trying to come out here and say?
9289620	9290100	Oh, no.
9290100	9293380	I did not see anyone's bearing on the show.
9293380	9295780	I was just saying nobody wasn't covered.
9295780	9296100	Uh-huh.
9296100	9297300	Them's fighting words.
9297300	9297620	Yeah.
9297620	9298180	I'm just kidding.
9298180	9298580	What's up?
9298580	9298900	What's up?
9299940	9300340	All right.
9300340	9308500	As we have been rumbling and hearing rumblings for the past year or so that supposedly the
9309380	9318660	Games for Windows was going to be, quote, unquote, shutting down July 1st of this year.
9319220	9323540	And we already started to see how that happened, too.
9323540	9327220	Certainly being where we are in place.
9328420	9336660	But I looked to Bobby earlier tonight, basically saying, Microsoft is saying,
9337620	9342100	we're not going to take down the servers for Games for Windows.
9343940	9349860	So you can continue to download what you already bought, play your games, so on and so forth.
9350740	9356420	And personally speaking, I'll say this.
9356420	9360020	I didn't really like Games for Windows too much.
9360020	9364180	But in a way, it's kind of a good thing to keep your service going.
9365060	9372340	If only because there's some content that I did buy through Games for Windows before
9372340	9374260	I jumped ship to Steam.
9375780	9388420	Not only that, but even for those people that have long-term Steam users, there's probably
9388420	9390900	some games that they've used for a long time.
9391620	9397300	Users may have bought games for Windows in one capacity or another.
9398420	9408020	For example, if you have the Lost Planet games, be it original or second one, or even
9408020	9415940	Street Fighter Plus Tekken, all those games use Games for Windows, even though you may
9416020	9418660	have bought them on Steam.
9418660	9424180	It really seems to me like Microsoft is pretty much like they're just ending a lot of the
9424180	9425780	support for Games for Windows Live.
9425780	9428100	But they're kind of like, we're not going to unplug the computer.
9428100	9431700	But when it stops working, there's not exactly going to be anybody here to fix it either.
9433380	9436980	That's kind of the sense I get from the whole thing is that, okay, they're not pulling
9436980	9437780	it down.
9437780	9440980	But they're not really investing another dime in it.
9441700	9442340	Yeah, true.
9442900	9450020	Yeah, I mean, I'm the first to admit that Games for Windows in and of itself as a service
9450580	9454660	kind of pales in comparison to Steam, quite likely.
9454660	9458740	I think no one's going to argue any differently.
9458740	9463460	You know, in Microsoft, oftentimes, it's not the first time, and they're not the first
9463460	9469140	company to do this either, who sees a good idea, like a marketplace for games like that,
9469140	9471700	and tries to build something their own and make it work.
9471700	9473060	And it doesn't always work.
9474100	9479060	I remember a time being a podcaster for so many years where Microsoft tried very hard
9479060	9481300	to make Zune cast a thing.
9481300	9481860	You remember that?
9482420	9483140	Oh God.
9483140	9485940	Or Major Nelson's blog cast.
9485940	9490340	They refused to call it a podcast because they were trying to make the Zune thing like
9490340	9490820	happen, right?
9490820	9492100	Stop trying to make Zune happen.
9492100	9495620	Speaking of which, my wife got a hand-me-down phone.
9495620	9496820	It's a Windows phone.
9496820	9499700	What software do I have to use to put shit on the fucking phone?
9499700	9500260	Zune.
9500260	9500760	Zune.
9501380	9502020	Fuck that.
9502020	9503540	But here's the interesting thing.
9503540	9507620	But you can sit here and point off all of Microsoft's failures, but sometimes they kind
9507620	9511300	of take an idea and they do pretty well with it, like the Xbox.
9512500	9516180	So, you know, sometimes it's just a matter of trying these different ideas till they
9516180	9517060	get one that works.
9517060	9520660	But at the end of the day, if it's not making money, if people aren't loving it, if people
9520660	9524180	aren't using it, then you wave your white flag of surrender defeat.
9524340	9524840	Yeah.
9524840	9529540	Well, Peter does, in low-key kind of touch on it a little bit.
9531220	9532980	Personally, I love the Zune.
9534020	9535380	Not so much the hardware.
9535380	9544260	I never owned the hardware itself, but I love the Zune software, you know, the software
9544260	9547060	player in their marketplace.
9547060	9556180	I used it all the time before they shut that down and went strictly Xbox, 360, one, and
9556980	9557780	Windows 8.
9558660	9562740	But, you know, as a result, I had to switch over to iTunes.
9562740	9564740	But that's just me.
9564740	9566660	I'm probably the minority there.
9566660	9567160	So.
9568020	9573460	Well, you know, there's going to come a time when even Steam is going to be gone for the
9573460	9574260	next big thing.
9574260	9576980	You know, whatever is next in distribution.
9576980	9577860	There will come a time.
9577860	9580340	It's probably going to be a long ways away, but there will come a time, you know.
9580340	9584020	What I don't get it, though, just seriously talking about the Windows Phone 7 here that
9584020	9584980	my wife has.
9584980	9589860	It uses a standard USB cable to connect to the computer, but I have to use a fucking
9589860	9592100	program to put shit on it.
9592100	9596100	Whereas an Android phone, I connect to it, and hey, look, it's a drive I can dump shit
9596100	9596420	on.
9596420	9599700	I don't have to fucking have, like, if I want to make a ringtone, I don't have to.
9599700	9600820	It has to be 40 seconds.
9600820	9602020	It has to be under a meg.
9602020	9606100	You have to tag the genre as ringtone for this shit to pop up.
9606100	9607060	It's stupid.
9608420	9609140	All right.
9609140	9609940	Well, wow.
9609940	9612660	Did somebody's computer crash with Loki's ring right there?
9613540	9613780	All right.
9614420	9615220	Rage in here, buddy.
9615220	9618020	I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call
9618020	9620020	and I guess rest in peace, Gabe.
9620020	9623140	But at least, hey, at least you can still play Game Room for now.
9623140	9623860	Oh, yeah.
9623860	9627620	I'm still, in fact, I was just playing that all day, actually, so.
9627620	9628180	Nice.
9628180	9628740	All right.
9628740	9629460	Take care, my friend.
9630180	9630420	Yep.
9630420	9631140	Have a good one.
9631140	9631640	Later.
9632020	9632340	All right.
9632340	9637780	Well, I'll see if anybody else calls in 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio.
9637780	9642020	But meanwhile, I did see a few things on Twitter I wanted to make sure I got through.
9642020	9645540	I just saw a tweet come in from Koopa Club, which I plugged at the top of the show.
9645540	9647620	They just posted episode 52.
9647620	9653060	So if you need more of me after tonight's OLR, go download Koopa Club episode 52, which
9653060	9655140	is titled hashtag baby Jessica.
9655940	9657380	It'll make sense when you hear the show, okay?
9658180	9660900	Um, some tweets at the OLR accounts.
9660900	9662660	Twitter.com slash OLR.
9663860	9668180	Superhulk1999 said, talk about great golf games.
9668180	9672900	I've not played one since Outlaw Golf 2 on the first Xbox.
9672900	9674340	You a big golf game player?
9675140	9677140	No, I used to play a lot of mini golf games.
9677140	9679940	They used to be really big into 3D Ultra mini golf.
9679940	9680500	Yeah, I am.
9681140	9682500	I loved Kirby's Dream Course.
9682500	9684820	I think I brought that game up like three weeks in a row now.
9684820	9686340	Like on Super Nintendo, I love that game.
9686420	9688820	But it's not like super authentic golf either.
9689380	9693540	I would be down for like, I mean, they've got hotshots golf and then they try to do
9693540	9694180	a golf game.
9694180	9696180	I think there was one on Xbox one.
9696180	9697380	I want to say that they put out one.
9698580	9701140	I've heard the Mario golf game is pretty good.
9701140	9704420	I haven't played it myself yet, so I can't attest to that, but I've heard it's pretty
9704420	9704740	good.
9704740	9707700	Last golf thing I played was golf in Grand Theft Auto 5.
9710260	9711060	How about our chatters?
9711060	9715700	Do our chatters have any recommendations of really good golf games over at live.vognetwork.com?
9716100	9717140	Help a fellow listener out.
9717780	9721140	S2 and Hunter Matt has tweeted us saying you have to give it up to the hackers.
9721140	9726020	Mario Kart 8 has been demade for Super Nintendo via a ROM hack.
9726900	9727140	What?
9728340	9729220	That fast?
9730260	9731140	That was quick.
9731780	9732820	Where's that?
9732820	9733620	Apparently, I don't know.
9733620	9740100	He's linking me to a story at retrocollect.com where, let's see, there's a Mario Kart 8 demake
9740100	9741780	for the Super Nintendo.
9742740	9748260	Let's see, it says you can't do some of the things that the courses do in the game, but
9748260	9752580	the tracks from Mario Kart 8 have been brought over to Super Mario Kart as best possible.
9753220	9757940	The familiarity of the hit Nintendo Wii U's courses are present in the novelty ROM hack,
9757940	9761540	one which gives the timeless Super Mario Kart another jolt of life.
9762580	9763140	Interesting.
9764580	9765620	I want to see video.
9765620	9766740	Why is there no video?
9766740	9772580	I mean, they have a patch, but they have the patch that you can download, but where's my
9772580	9773140	video?
9773140	9778900	And apparently through the ZSNES emulator, you can play online and do online battle play
9778900	9780340	on old school Mario Kart.
9780340	9784740	Does that mean that they act, because Super Mario Kart has, like, a good battle mode?
9786420	9787220	Maybe that's a thing.
9787220	9787620	I don't know.
9788740	9790420	I'm sure there's a YouTube out there for them.
9791380	9793620	All right, let's see.
9793620	9797220	Act Def says I heard the Mario Golf 3DS games is good.
9798420	9798820	Let's see.
9799780	9803700	Tiger class says you need to download Double Twist for desktop.
9803700	9805380	Is that game or is that another?
9805380	9805940	Oh, never mind.
9805940	9807540	They're talking about something completely else.
9807540	9808820	It's like, what?
9808820	9811700	That is a program to sync music to Android phone.
9812500	9812980	There you go.
9812980	9813540	Sorry about that.
9814980	9816900	That was in the midst of golf game chatter.
9816900	9818900	I thought that might have been some golf game I never heard of.
9820740	9823300	Any other last minute stories, Logie?
9823300	9825140	I was going to mention, this was kind of a big thing.
9825860	9833220	They were, some modders found that the original shaders that were used in the E3 demo for
9833780	9841300	Watch Dogs were hidden inside the PC version of the game, and they enabled them, and it
9841300	9844660	looks much better than it does now.
9844660	9847780	I heard, though, it runs into major performance issues in some places.
9847780	9848740	It's not so bad.
9849700	9854580	From what I've seen, actually, they were saying that the performance is actually better, but
9854580	9856340	it's a little bit buggy.
9856340	9861060	It's not perfect, but they're working to fix stuff in there from the shaders and everything.
9861060	9865540	But it's still, once again, developers, if you're taking something out of a game and
9865540	9870020	you really don't want people finding it, remove it completely from the game.
9870020	9871220	Do not reference it.
9871220	9873060	Do not keep the code in there.
9873060	9874260	Take it all out.
9874260	9877300	All right.
9878820	9883540	Well, we're not getting any of the calls, so I guess this is where I close up the Skyline.
9884660	9885460	We're done.
9885460	9885940	That's it.
9885940	9887220	That brings us to the end of another show.
9887220	9890100	If you want to participate with the show, you didn't get a chance tonight, but maybe
9890100	9893060	you're listening to us at work on a Monday or at some point throughout the week.
9893940	9896340	First off, a big thank you guys who support the show.
9896340	9900580	Those of you that show up here live or those that listen on the podcast feed, however you
9900580	9905300	do it through iTunes, through Stitcher, through using Double Twist to get it from one place
9905300	9906580	to another, whatever it is you do.
9907140	9908900	Thank you guys very much for checking out our show.
9909460	9912260	If you liked what you hear, please consider leaving us a five-star review.
9912260	9912660	Oh, here we go.
9912660	9913620	Here's some pictures.
9913620	9916100	On iTunes or Stitcher or something like that.
9916100	9917620	We really appreciate it.
9917620	9920020	Quickly, Loki, you got some pictures?
9920020	9920180	Yeah.
9920180	9925380	If you click on the link on that story, it shows the pictures in robhacking.net.
9925380	9929940	And I mean, I can't really tell.
9929940	9933140	I mean, it's all right, I guess.
9933140	9935940	I just can't really tell because I've never played Mario Kart 8.
9936900	9940580	I can't really tell what these tracks are, but neat.
9941700	9942340	I don't know.
9942340	9945540	I'm more interested in the hacks that they had for Mario Kart Wii.
9945540	9951380	They had lots of cool track hacks that you can do with just a SD card.
9951380	9952580	Yeah, that's cool.
9953300	9953860	All right.
9953860	9955780	Well, that brings us to the end of another show.
9955780	9960180	So thanks again for downloading and tuning in and listening to it, however it is.
9960180	9963860	We will be back, of course, next week with another episode.
9963860	9966340	We'll talk a little bit about 12 years of OLR.
9966340	9969780	And of course, take your calls and talk about whatever should happen in the news next week.
9969780	9971700	I'd imagine things are going to ramp up a little bit again
9972260	9974820	more and more as we get closer and closer to the holidays.
9975860	9978260	Loki, though, before we say good night to everybody,
9978260	9981620	I got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
9981620	9982740	Loki, your final thought.
9982740	9987940	My final thought is I'm building my primitives again in my game that I'm developing
9987940	9989620	for hopefully the last time.
9990180	9992900	So once I'm at this and I get to learn how to write a shader.
9993540	9996340	So all the things I didn't want to learn, I'm having to learn.
9998180	10001860	My final thought tonight is Mario Kart 8 was super fun today
10001860	10003700	and I think we need to do more tournaments like that.
10003700	10006340	So we've got to do something with VOG, too.
10006340	10008660	I know, yes, I know there is one that has been set up,
10008660	10012100	but we haven't done a very good job promoting that because E3 happened.
10012180	10015300	So I think we do have to kind of have at least like a little VOG tournament
10015300	10016260	or something at some point.
10016260	10021380	And one of these weeks, I'm gonna have to go in and clean up the Minecraft server
10021380	10024980	and put the patches up and stuff because I don't think anyone's actually playing it.
10024980	10026580	I'm still paying for it, but no one's playing.
10026580	10027700	We haven't talked about it in a while.
10027700	10030580	So I think if you say, hey, something new is going on, we're gonna do something.
10030580	10035140	Minecraft server, I just have to update everything because I know that I have to.
10035700	10036420	It's been a while.
10036420	10038180	It's collecting dust.
10038180	10038500	All right.
10039860	10040740	That's it, guys.
10040820	10044500	Thanks again for downloading the show and checking it out and tuning in.
10046820	10047300	That's it.
10047300	10047940	We're done.
10047940	10049060	Did I give my final thought?
10049060	10051220	I don't even remember what I said now if I did.
10051220	10052740	I'll give another final thought.
10052740	10058740	My final thought is I think I might actually play some more Final Fantasy XI tonight.
10058740	10061140	Maybe I'll get to level my character to like 15 or something.
10061140	10061640	We'll see.
10062500	10065140	Or I'll get killed again in one hit like I did earlier today.
10065140	10065940	All right, that's it.
10065940	10070180	We'll be back here next week to say hooray for 12 years of OLR.
10070180	10074580	Thank you guys for downloading the show and tuning in and we'll see you next time.
10074580	10074820	Bye.
10100180	10102580	But you know they were all still true.
10105620	10116580	See you next week.
10130180	10142580	Bye.
