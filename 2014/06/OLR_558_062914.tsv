0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week YouTube announced support for 60 frames per second video and soon game trailers are going to look a lot smoother. If you remember Pat Rocks then maybe you want to vote for Rock Simulator on Steam Greenlight. Flashback to the 70s as we bring you all this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live on this June the 29th of 2014, the 558th episode of our show.
45000	61000	And of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com. We are right after the Bobby Black Wolf show over on that network and lots of other great podcasts over there too from all things around the geek universe.
61000	70000	And if you are listening live we invite you guys to join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where we do read some of our chat comments out loud throughout the show.
70000	83000	I'll introduce the folks here in studio for now. My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts, temporarily unavailable, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
83000	93000	The wonders of live radio. She just got up and disappeared but she'll be back in a moment. I know she was out last week but she is here tonight so we'll get her back here in a moment.
93000	96000	But joining us here is Techmaster Loki.
96000	97000	Hello.
97000	98000	How you doing Loki?
98000	99000	Doing fine.
99000	102000	Yeah. And what's new with you?
102000	105000	Not much. Trying to learn shaders.
105000	109000	Shaders? Trying to learn how to throw some shade in your game making?
110000	121000	No. It's the stuff that basically you use to write to a graphics card so that you can draw stuff on the screen. It tells things how to draw it.
121000	126000	And so you can do all sorts of shininess and stuff like that.
126000	134000	Because I'm trying to find how to build something very specific and I don't know how to do that so I tried following that.
135000	145000	There's a website I used to look at for Unity and stuff but they also have a CG section but this one was actually Unity and it's unitycookie.com.
145000	149000	And they've got this whole intro to shader things that I've been watching.
149000	156000	And it's like okay you're not going to be able to understand a lot of this but just follow along and I'm just like woof.
156000	158000	It's like over my head. I don't understand.
158000	160000	Unity Cookie?
160000	161000	Unity Cookie.
161000	162000	Cookies are yummy.
162000	165000	I know how to manage shaders in rendering programs.
165000	167000	Oh hey DarkSakura how are you?
167000	171000	Don't ask. I regret everything.
171000	172000	I regret nothing.
172000	175000	I regret everything I've eaten except it was delicious.
175000	176000	Welcome back by the way.
176000	177000	Thank you.
177000	178000	We missed you last week.
178000	180000	So I'll come back to you in just a minute.
180000	184000	But Loki brought up cookies DarkSakura you have to understand.
185000	188000	But yeah so I mean I kind of understand some of it.
188000	200000	It's just a lot of the remembering of like there's no way I'm going to remember the long line of code that's going to take to make like a you know a specular light shader or you know just different things.
200000	203000	There's no way I'm going to remember that. It's too long.
203000	208000	But I kind of have a basic idea of how Unity uses shader lab which is kind of weird.
208000	231000	It's like programming in multiple languages at the same time because you start off with kind of this framework that Unity uses called shader lab and then within it you can have the different shader programming languages like CG which is Nvidia's you know shader language and then they have like the OpenGL type stuff and Xbox and all sorts of crazy shit.
231000	234000	Now I'm going to be honest a lot of this kind of starts to go over my head.
234000	238000	So let me ask this question just to kind of you know wrap up this topic for now.
238000	245000	Is this a lot for one person? I mean I know this is the first game you really are programming in this new language.
245000	247000	Have you been off too much of the cookie?
247000	256000	Well I think it's more of like I'm over complicating everything but at the same time I'm kind of having to I'm doing it by choice.
256000	261000	You know I could probably do an easier like just use a standard shader that comes with it or find something that works.
261000	271000	But I want something very specific and in a roundabout way I'm kind of learning how to do different things that I probably should know because I don't want to have these gaps kind of in what I know how to do.
271000	279000	And I don't want to like sacrifice the look of the game just because I'm too lazy to program a shader or you know something like that.
279000	287000	Because you know had it just like I was oh maybe a diffuse shader would be fine because that's just the basic you know it has shadows on it and that's it.
287000	292000	So you're just not the type to do a Breakout clone or a Flappy Bird clone for your first game.
292000	298000	I don't want to do that. That sounds incredibly boring and yes I know that's what everyone recommends is your first project is do that.
298000	300000	But that's just not your style.
300000	303000	No I just don't want to do that and no I'm not giving up on any of this.
303000	312000	I just I'm kind of taking breaks from actually programming stuff to do some actual education you know to learn how to do things.
312000	320000	And the shader thing I'm actually almost done with because I keep watching these and I'm almost through the whole beginner tutorial thing.
320000	326000	But it's just I have a basic understanding of how things are and now I'm just going to piece stuff together based off of what I've seen out there.
326000	331000	And that's kind of how I do my code too. I piece it together and I kind of figure out how things work on my own.
331000	336000	Well you know I know we have some industry people that listen to the show and I'm sure there's some programmers out there that check out the show.
336000	344000	Even though not all of them email us all the time. I know you guys are out there so hi and keep on making the great games that we talk about on the show.
344000	352000	But Loki would you care for some advice if there might be some people out there who maybe are experts in throwing some shade and all that stuff?
352000	358000	I don't know. I mean I don't know what advice they could really give me because it's very limited in what you can do.
358000	359000	Make a flappy bird clone.
359000	365000	Yeah exactly. No seriously there's so many tutorials and stuff how to do that. I just don't want to.
365000	374000	That would be and after seriously after I finish this very long project that is something I'm going to be doing where I'm just going to be doing a lot of really small things.
374000	375000	Right.
375000	381000	Because you know dedicating a ton of time to one big thing it's going to be too hard to keep doing that.
381000	384000	Well I don't know what else to tell you but good luck.
384000	387000	Like I said I was checking in with you every week.
387000	394000	Well I keep trying to like get more stuff you know like acid creating them but like see I started doing that and that's where I started looking at the shade.
394000	399000	I'm like this doesn't look very good. It just the lighting on it wasn't interesting enough.
399000	406000	So I was like OK well I need to have you know bump mapping in there so at least I have some sort of looks a little bit more elaborate.
406000	414000	And I'm like well you know I can't just do that. I want to also have like you know some decals on top of it so I can add you know striping and stuff like that.
414000	424000	So I have an idea of what I want things to look like. I just have to figure out how to create that and actually I just found someone had created a shader that kind of do that.
424000	432000	But it's all written in that shader lab language and I want it to be also in CG so I have to figure out because that's faster.
432000	444000	If you do the shader lab language yeah it'll work but you want it to you want one for CG and then whatever if you're going to do mobile and stuff you have the right mobile language shaders and stuff.
444000	454000	So I just need to learn it without skipping stuff. I just need to actually sit down and learn it like I did with the whole you know modifying meshes and stuff.
454000	459000	Loki you might have to start a programming podcast just to talk about all these trials you've gone through. Loki's Diaries.
459000	464000	I tweet about it you know usually but yeah no one wants to hear any of that stuff.
464000	473000	No I think some people do you know that might be working on their own projects but for now we do want to get over to critiquing some games which we will do shortly.
473000	478000	However first I want to officially roll out the red carpet and welcome back to the show Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.
478000	479000	Hi.
479000	482000	Hi and welcome back. I know you weren't here last week.
482000	483000	Nope.
483000	489000	You did talk about on your Facebook page. I didn't tell the listeners what was going on last week but she did bring it up on your Facebook page.
489000	492000	You have some personal things going on right now.
492000	499000	To put it quickly my dad had a stroke. He's in the hospital paralyzed on one side.
499000	507000	Improvement I've been getting back and forth from family but for all the people who said nice things thank you.
507000	514000	And just hopefully putting you know funds and time aside so that hopefully I can go see him in August.
514000	527000	Right because I think it's important to know that you know what what makes the situation complicated is that you know your dad is still in Alabama where you were born and raised and you know you're out here which is just you know that's that's how families work sometimes.
527000	539000	So but anyway not to not to you know I know you're going through a lot with that right now but I felt if the listeners know that then they can send you a lot of love and hugs your way and I know that all that stuff goes a long way so.
539000	544000	It's been stressful but sure just trying to get through it.
544000	546000	Yeah you will you will.
546000	555000	My dad's in his mid 50s so that's kind of young to have a stroke so just think positive.
555000	564000	Definitely. Well we will still try to amuse and entertain and lift spirits over the next few hours because I'm sure a lot of our listeners are out there you know.
564000	573000	And into transition into this topic a little bit you know tonight we are officially celebrating 12 years of Orange Lounge Radio we had our birthday on Monday.
573000	585000	Episode number one was taped June 23 of 2002 and you know I have people ask me over the years and I'm sure you guys get this too you know what is it that keeps you doing this show week to week.
585000	600000	And you know for me a huge motivator is every time I get that tweet or that which is funny because we didn't have Twitter 12 years ago but that tweet or that email or you know whatever it is even sometimes in person that just says you know what like.
600000	611000	You guys are still there and you're doing your thing and you make me laugh about games in a hobby I enjoy even when I'm having like a really shitty week and you know just kind of puts a lot into perspective.
611000	623000	And is such a motivator to hear about that positive way that we impact people's lives. So thank you all for that. I don't know if you guys do you guys want to say anything here in in in.
624000	634000	Membranes of our 12 years here. Talk about. Let me let me throw this out there what is it that motivates you guys to do this week after week because you know I can't do this by myself.
634000	637000	What motivates you to do this week after week.
637000	646000	Loki I don't want to talk about games with at work anymore. My family doesn't give a shit about games. They get away from the kids. Mm hmm.
646000	660000	So this is this is your this is your escape. I've been doing it for like 12 years. So you do hit a certain point I think where it just becomes like it's what you know like and even the Sunday nights that I don't do O.L.R.
660000	669000	because you know we have a week off every now and then and even the Sunday nights where I don't do O.L.R. I'm still going through my head. I'm like Bobby's wrapping up right about now we should be on Skype.
669000	678000	Yep. You know we'd be at the intermission right now in the in between the two parts. And no we did. Yeah. So it's like I'm still going through the motions in my head like it's just it's that programmed into me at this point.
678000	692000	So. Dark Sakura what about you. What what is you. What is your motivation for these 12 years to keep going. I don't know. I mean I I just do it.
692000	704000	You know it's I enjoy doing it. Of course I've made a lot of good friends. And as long as people keep wanting to hear it then I'll keep wanting to do it.
704000	720000	So I'm still working on other outlets too. But honestly this has been I really don't I don't have a single reason. It's hard to narrow it down.
721000	733000	I think you bring up a really good point though with the whole friends thing because like you know I've met an extraordinary amount of people thanks to being able to work on the show and do this show and you know there's a lot of people that started as listeners of O.L.R.
733000	747000	And you know I don't look at listeners like I'm up here and you're all down there and I speak and you all listen type of thing like I just I really hope that isn't the way my attitude comes across on O.L.R. because I'm so against that.
747000	765000	I'm not saying other podcasts are like that at all. I'm absolutely not. Although I'm sure we've all met a person or two in our lives who is like that. But that is that is like so not me. Like I feel like you know we have these conversations we invite the listeners on to talk about things and so forth and I meet people in person who listen to the show like I've made genuine friendships in that regard.
765000	780000	You know what I mean. So it's it's it's it's been an amazing opportunity. So who would have thought who would have thought if you've never listened to O.L.R. before and this happens to be your first episode we all met at a local arcade.
780000	794000	That's one way you know it was 12 years ago because there was still an arcade scene then sadly rest in peace. We all met at a local arcade playing Dance Dance Revolution and all found that we kind of had a mutual interest of those music based games or Konami series was called
794000	807000	Bomani at the time. So much like you might have a podcast that talks about sports or a podcast that talks about movies. We want to have a podcast. Well at that time it wasn't a podcast I should say it was a live show.
807000	820000	We want to have a live show that talked about that community that was building up amongst those games. Dark Soccer and myself had a prior Internet radio experience I was on another show for several years called Understation Live which is still going strong to this day.
820000	832000	And so kind of all of that kind of came together into Orange Launch Radio what we have today and Loki Loki made a habit of it. It became it became Loki's Sunday night thing too and you know we added him as a co-host really really quick into the show's life.
832000	845000	So yeah here we are. So there it is. So congratulations to not just not just ourselves but all of you guys for your support and everything over the past 12 years. It means the world.
846000	857000	S.H.A.100Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm sure Rob is holding on to episode one for an extra special event. I'm actually not. It's out there. It's available. You can find it. I don't always...
857000	859000	The migraine episode.
859000	864000	Did you have migraine on episode one? You did. I remember you weren't even there for episodes two and three.
864000	866000	It was because I was in the Harry Potter room at the gay dorm.
866000	875000	Yes it was it was a weird start to the show but you know what it worked out. It was the one reason I don't put like some people wonder like why don't you just put episode one on the feed.
875000	886000	Because I kind of feel like it's not the same show people are subscribed to today. You know things change over 12 years and we've evolved a lot over 12 years and you know we made a decision several years ago.
886000	900000	Not all you guys might know the history but we had this show that was about DDR and Bamani and when the podcasting kind of started becoming bigger and was a thing you know I brought this to Loki and Jamie and I said you know guys.
900000	907000	I think like this whole thing they're calling TiVo for your iPod. I think this is going to be a huge thing and I feel like we should be on this somehow.
907000	917000	Now our three hour show is probably too big to be a podcast. Oops. Maybe made a bad call there but our three hour show might be too big to be a podcast so we should start like a separate show.
917000	920000	Great at that time it was like dial up so.
920000	934000	Yeah that's true. It was different when everything first started right. So I said let's do a separate like 20 minute show tops that's just like general games because like we get on our Bamani show and we talk about Kingdom Hearts we talk about you know all these other games that we really like.
935000	951000	So let's do a show about like general gaming. We'll call Orange Lawn Radio to go. So that lasted for a year and we were fortunate enough to get ahead of the curve and we were on iTunes when podcast officially launched and all that and we were in the gaming section fortunate enough to be there.
951000	964000	So it really took off and then suddenly you know we're having this look where we're going okay Konami is basically not making any more music games for right now and we don't know where this music scene is going right now.
964000	972000	And our show over here our little 20 minute show is getting about 100 times the listeners that our live show gets.
972000	982000	So what should we do about this situation and that's when we made the decision to say you know what let's make our three hour epically long show about the topics that we're talking about in our 20 minute show.
982000	997000	And you know we will always have a place for the music based games in our hearts, but we're going to move on from that for now just because we don't get involved with that community as much because sadly that community has effectively died with DDR freak closing I would say that communities died.
997000	1022000	I know there's people trying to keep it alive and I hope you guys don't take it take a slide or take it personally that I'm saying it that way of course there's going to be cheerleaders and there's going to be the you know isn't it cool when but I think when Bobby tells the story about last year at E3 and he goes to Konami's booth and asks them do you have anything about Bomani and somebody has to turn to somebody else at the Konami booth who works there and says what's Bomani?
1022000	1032000	I think that kind of just makes the point I'm very sorry to say those of you guys that still have a lot of love in your hearts for those games so anyway.
1032000	1036000	Yeah so that was a lot of rambling but here we are today.
1036000	1038000	I still miss doing the volume.
1038000	1041000	Like the random shows we used to do on when Orange Country was a network.
1042000	1062000	I miss my random music show because but now you know I don't really have a way to broadcast it myself and I work evenings now so I wouldn't say that Bomani is dead I would say it's kind of undead and wandering the earth chewing on the brains of other music games.
1062000	1091000	I think it's just like anything in pop pop culture that comes and goes there's still always going to be it might not be as big as it once was but there's always going to be a little community for it like I don't know like weren't like pogs a big thing back in the day right used to have pogs and no I don't know anybody that collects pogs anymore but you know what I bet rule 37 there's probably some like pog community shrine dedicated to that stuff that still keeps it going.
1091000	1093000	There will be pog porn.
1096000	1098000	Never doubt that it exists.
1099000	1102000	Oh thank you for mentioning Comic Insanity.
1103000	1120000	Mm hmm. And that was the podcast that I did with Dan shadow. Yeah. And tiara more and Marvel. And we ended up having to cancel that because of he had a baby. Right. Well he didn't have his wife had the baby he helped.
1120000	1127000	He lent genetic material for the formation of a small being. Yes we all know how it works.
1127000	1137000	It's just I have a personal problem with people saying we're having no no. She's having the baby. You're just helping and he's going to hear about it. Yes.
1137000	1147000	I like that. And then we just weren't reading comics like we used to. I don't really read comics that much anymore myself these days.
1147000	1162000	Well it is interesting all the side projects that O.L.R. is kind of helped start because you know a whorehouse is was a side project of O.L.R. in some ways and it's still going and now that whole show is really like just a different element of its own and it's it's really cool and I love doing that show too.
1162000	1176000	So I don't know if I could take on leading any more podcasts I contribute to another one seasonally about television shows involving drag queens but that's that's I don't I don't have to edit or worry about publishing or any of that stuff with that one.
1176000	1186000	So I still kind of want to do my my random co-host show. It's called let me explain you a thing. Or Jamie explains it all.
1187000	1196000	You know I totally support you doing a new side project if that's what you want to do. Same thing with Loki if he wants to do a Loki's tech journal or whatever the heck he wants to do.
1196000	1209000	I remember I still think one of the gems of O.L.R. we'll get into game talk in a minute guys I promise. One of the gems of Orange Launch Radio as a station that I don't think anybody ever heard was when you used to do live mixing on Friday nights.
1209000	1218000	Too damn hard with it was Wednesday was it was like Friday night she did it and I always said oh it's because it's Friday night nobody's going to be listening. I don't know I thought it was Wednesday.
1218000	1228000	Yeah but I mean no Wednesday was when we started outside the box which some some chatter calling precursor to what what O.L.R. kind of became maybe I don't know.
1228000	1237000	But yeah so used to do live mixing and nobody was listening to it sadly and because it was the time before podcasting I don't think we don't have recordings of it or anything.
1237000	1241000	I do. I have them all. You should put them out there someday. Good stuff.
1241000	1247000	You know I should talk to Drew and see if he wants to do. Let me explain you a thing with me. There you go. You know what's funny.
1247000	1260000	He started off in high school when we started the show. Now he's my coworker. Don't. Don't. Actually correction I might have those because it's on my old computer and my old computer is hard.
1260000	1269000	One of those have crashed. So we'll see. There's still ways of getting tiger on chat says live mixing as in two turntables and a microphone.
1269000	1276000	Well it was it was. I tried turntables but then ended up just doing like a digital mixer type thing.
1276000	1287000	I'll never forget when you got that song. Was it a Raven Simone song that you actually found the vinyl and you came home from like to Niles or something you're like Rob look what I got.
1287000	1294000	You're going to love this. I had all I gave away all my vinyls actually. I know I have the one I got you the guitar.
1294000	1308000	Well I gave them all away. I gave them away to my friend who's actually a D.J. He's a local D.J. Lisa and a good home because I'm like well dude look at my most prized possession vinyl wise so had to have been Eddie Murphy's album with party all the time.
1308000	1320000	That was fantastic. S2 and Hunter Matt and Chad says I believe outside the box was Rob lanky style and DDR angel. We love DDR angel but she was she was more of a supporter of the network.
1320000	1330000	It was actually she went by Rice Princess at the time. And now she's Princess Irene. No DDR angel is not Irene. No no no no no. Yeah no no. Yeah that's what I'm saying.
1330000	1340000	DDR angel was not a co-host on that show. She's a supporter of the network. But that wasn't Irene. Yeah the co-host was Rice Princess or Princess Irene. Sorry brain whatever.
1340000	1352000	No. All right. So there you go. Yes there it is. Nostalgia trip. And who knows this 12 year old show you know twelve twelve years old is is old enough to be having children if you watch it more.
1352000	1364000	Was it vanilla sky. Wasn't there like. That's right. We did that. You guys did the trivia show to kids bought music where you'd keep. That was a segment on outside the bar was outside the bar.
1364000	1380000	We should bring that back someday. Yes. The whole joke there was that you had to answer trivia about video games. It was 10 questions for every question you get wrong. The volume of a kid's bop song would be increased slightly to throw you off track is trying to answer the other questions.
1380000	1394000	So it was a lot to bring that back someday to bring that home stuck. What's that. Oh really. There's there's actually a piece that I actually like called elevator stuck which is basically the home stuck thing done done elevator music style.
1394000	1406000	And there's a one scene where basically the narrator as in Hussey is trying to screw with one of the characters. And so every time the character does something he doesn't like it plays really loud elevator music.
1407000	1419000	Well they stole it. They stole the idea for me clearly. All right. I did move things into gaming because it is a gaming real gaming show although it is a slow Newsweek guys that's why we're kind of stretching here a little bit with some of these other topics
1419000	1433000	it's a good week for nostalgia. But let me ask this question of you guys related to gaming directly and the 12 year history of this show. How has video gaming changed for you in the 12 years that we've been doing.
1433000	1444000	And this is very similar to the frugal question of the week tonight we'll get into later in the show where we hear from some of our listeners but I just want to know for you guys like how has video gaming changed for you in 12 years of O.L.R.
1444000	1449000	I'll let you guys do on that for a bit because I know that's a big question. I'll go ahead and answer because I knew I was going to ask it.
1450000	1468000	But for me honestly I think video gaming has changed a lot. We've seen and we talked about this when you know we went into the new decade a few years ago is that I think one of the biggest things that has changed gaming for good in the last decade is the advent of Xbox Live.
1468000	1478000	I think in a way has really changed gaming as we know it. It's shifted the conversation in a way to online. And I do know that PC gamers were doing it that way for a very long time.
1478000	1490000	But something about the centralization of what Xbox did I think was really huge for gaming. And so I think you know you didn't do that back in 2002 when we started our show.
1490000	1500000	Log in and talk literally talk with your mouth. I mean you could type in like fantasy star online but those games were extremely niche if you think about it.
1500000	1508000	Speaking of niche games I became more aware about the Japanese gaming industry because of a lot of O.L.R.
1509000	1521000	Honestly I think because a lot of that news didn't get over here all the time in magazines and things like that like I never knew about a lot of these games that were released on the Nintendo and Super Nintendo that we never even had over here.
1521000	1527000	You know I got to learn a lot more about that and it's been interesting to see the globalization of the gaming market in some ways.
1527000	1538000	And yes we've seen where the U.S. still gets its things. The U.K. gets its things that we don't get over here like Translated Mother 3.
1538000	1553000	Japan gets its things. But a lot of that stuff is way smaller than it used to be. I remember when we had to buy import PlayStation 2's to play BeatMania 2DX and the real DDR's and all those games.
1553000	1569000	You know it was just kind of different back then. And I remember when Final Fantasy I mean this is probably a little older than 12 years but when they finally released Final Fantasy 7 and kind of had to admit that they'd been misnumbering the series in the U.S. for the whole time.
1569000	1579000	That was kind of a huge moment. And then MMO's. I got addicted to a lot of MMO's. I mean World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 11, 14 all of it. All of it.
1579000	1582000	How has gaming changed for you guys in the past 12 years? Loki?
1582000	1586000	I'm less excited about a lot of the stuff that comes out nowadays.
1586000	1589000	You don't get excited about stuff like you used to.
1589000	1600000	Not as much just because I don't know there's just not a lot of at least as far as AAA publishers go there's not a whole ton of stuff that's really exciting anymore I think.
1600000	1607000	A lot of that's in the indie scene but even the indie scene there's so much to come out now that it's hard to keep track of all of it.
1608000	1616000	I was glad to be able to play Final Fantasy 11. That was fun. So I got introduced to that.
1616000	1622000	And crap just even all the stuff with DDR. I mean there's a lot of stuff there.
1622000	1634000	Got to go to some of the Konami press events and stuff. That was pretty fun playing on DDR machine while I think Naoki was there watching you play or something.
1634000	1641000	Were you like the first non-employee to play DDR Supernova? Because you were the first person to jump up on that machine at that event.
1641000	1647000	Maybe. I don't know. I wanted to play on the machine. I was like, oh machine! I'm going to play on that.
1647000	1650000	I think you were. I remember kind of noting that.
1651000	1660000	Let's see. What else? I got to go in the E3. That was fun. The few times I went.
1660000	1671000	I don't know. As far as stuff being changed. There's so much that's changed. It's hard to keep track of what was different.
1671000	1681000	I guess. I don't know. I just remember it differently I guess. I remember some of the stuff back in Playstation 2 and Xbox and GameCube days.
1681000	1690000	I thought a lot more releases coming out. And that probably was true because a lot of studios nowadays are putting out quality versus quantity.
1690000	1697000	But even now I think a lot of the quality stuff that they put out isn't as good as they think it is.
1698000	1703000	With all the patching and things. There you go. There's a perfect example of stuff that's changed.
1703000	1708000	They didn't have the ability to patch stuff back in the GameCube and Playstation 2.
1708000	1709000	That's very true.
1709000	1713000	Xbox days. Maybe the Xbox. I'm not really sure if they did patching over Xbox Live then.
1713000	1719000	But they didn't have a lot of that. So it was like, okay that shit better be working when it comes out the door.
1719000	1724000	Now I think things are a little bit lax. They're like, well it's a little fucked up but we'll fix it later.
1724000	1726000	Release day patches are standard now, yeah?
1726000	1735000	Yeah, pretty much. So I guess there's that. I don't know. I just want more things to be excited about.
1735000	1740000	Dark Soccer, how's video gaming changed for you in 12 years when we started this show to now?
1740000	1746000	Well, going just a step away from the things that other people have said. The big change for me came when I started becoming a designer.
1746000	1755000	And now I pay more attention, it seems, to the design of a game. To the world that's created. To its branding. To its feel.
1755000	1763000	Sometimes then I do actually playing the game. Like, I am one with my fly cam in Mass Effect 3. I mean, I'll put it that way.
1763000	1767000	You know, I look for all of the behind the scenes stuff. I look for what goes into it.
1767000	1775000	And for me, my focus on gaming has to do more with the production value. With the design behind it. With how it looks. How it feels.
1776000	1787000	I mean, yeah, I want there to be a game that plays solidly. But I will go for a lot more of the quirky, artsy games that may not get a bunch of attention anymore.
1787000	1789000	Basically, I've turned into a gaming hamster.
1789000	1794000	Really, that's all I can say.
1794000	1797000	Yeah, you would tell us more, but we've probably never heard of it.
1798000	1806000	Well, I mean, it's like, I've, you know, I've been getting my friends into some of the weird, quirky stuff I've found.
1806000	1811000	Like, I've got a few things that are on the top of my list right now from my Steam list that are...
1811000	1820000	I was attracted to them based on how they looked. Based on having a unique approach to them.
1820000	1828000	Basically, I'm looking for something unique. Something that has, especially the more hand-drawn it looks, the more I'm into it.
1828000	1834000	Excellent. I'm looking at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. VX JasonXV says,
1834000	1839000	For what it's worth, games have been patched as far back as Super Nintendo. Not in the same way, naturally.
1839000	1844000	But Donkey Kong Country has had three different versions. Version 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.
1844000	1853000	Yeah, no, no, no. That's true. They can patch things, but, like, if you had a 1.0 cart, you were pretty much SOL unless you, like, sold it back.
1853000	1860000	Or, you know, it wasn't something where they could just, you know, your Super Nintendo turns on in the middle of the night and fixes the game for you.
1860000	1867000	Like, it didn't really have that. When a game was patched, that was, like, notable. It was the exception to the rule.
1867000	1875000	And now, when a game isn't getting a zero-day patch, when a triple-A release doesn't get a zero-day patch, that's a shock. Right?
1875000	1876000	Yeah.
1876000	1883000	That's how things have changed in a big way. So, a conversation going on in the chat about DLC.
1883000	1889000	Kaijuto talking about, I haven't seen much of a change, but Black Wolf saying DLC was a big shift.
1889000	1894000	Kaijuto saying, DLC was something new, but I don't feel that it's lived up to what it could have been.
1894000	1899000	The DLC waters got muddied not long after it started. I think DLC was best when they came on disc.
1899000	1904000	Not because they were on disc, but it took time for it to come out and we got good content because of it.
1904000	1913000	Well, you certainly, but you definitely bring up the whole controversy there about, is DLC on a disc really DLC, or is that pay-to-unlock content?
1913000	1915000	Which, you know, we talked about on the show.
1915000	1926000	And I know that the excuses, you know, well, we want it so that the user has, you know, they don't have to download it or something like that.
1926000	1936000	There's always a convenient way to explain why it's done that doesn't sound like we did it because that was our big business plan on how to make money.
1936000	1944000	Or they were going to do DLC and they wanted to make sure that people that didn't own the DLC were able to play with people that did have the DLC.
1944000	1953000	But at the same time, there's also those compatibility patches I've seen, so that's not exactly a sure-fire excuse.
1953000	1958000	But yeah, I think a lot of people, you know, when you're developing a game, you have to kind of think about what you want to do for DLC.
1958000	1968000	I know I am, just because I've got to make a way if I'm going to do DLC at some point, you know, I've got to figure out a way to, you know, have the game actually be able to utilize whatever else I throw in there.
1968000	1980000	I haven't really thought about this in a while, but have games, do games still do on-disc pay-to-unlock content, or did that kind of phase out because hackers kind of figured out how to get it all out there?
1980000	1981000	Oh no, they still do.
1981000	1982000	Oh, interesting.
1983000	1993000	A lot of it, though, may not necessarily be, like, for example, Saintsboro IV. That was probably a good example, the last one I can remember that I played that had pay-to-unlock content.
1993000	2006000	The way they did it a little bit differently is that a lot of that stuff was on-disc, and then they would have, you know, X number of DLC packs that came out that would unlock all that stuff, and then they would basically, you know, exhaust everything they had on-disc.
2006000	2016000	Then they would patch the game, and in the patch would also have all that, this second wave of DLC stuff that you pay-to-unlock in there, and so on and so forth.
2016000	2021000	Now, Kaijuto does want to clarify, he's not talking about necessarily the pay-to-unlock content, although-
2021000	2022000	Expansion packs.
2022000	2028000	Yeah, he's talking about the expansion packs, like when you used to buy, like, the expansion disc or whatever.
2028000	2038000	Still a common practice in MMOs, in a way, although that's a lot of that shifted digital, but, like, Diablo II had an expansion that was, you know, on a disc.
2038000	2040000	Or Diablo III.
2040000	2042000	Halo got these expansions on disc.
2042000	2043000	Starcraft.
2043000	2044000	Yeah, yeah.
2044000	2057000	Although, let's be honest, the Starcraft thing with, you know, the fact that they're splitting up the three campaigns and the three expansions is a little fucking stupid, but whatever, I mean, that's whatever they want to use as their excuse to sell you the game three times.
2057000	2065000	But, I just, I don't know, I think a lot of it now, they figured out that they can make extra money that way, and so that's why they're doing it.
2065000	2068000	Because it's money on the table if you're just not doing that.
2068000	2078000	Yeah, your user base might respect you a little bit more, but let's be honest, they're not going to respect you that much less if you do that stuff, and you're going to make a lot more money.
2078000	2080000	That's kind of the way they look at it.
2080000	2084000	That's why EA's still in business, even though everyone apparently hates them.
2084000	2088000	Well, it seems like a lot of that's cooled down, though, over the past couple years.
2088000	2092000	So, now everybody's focusing on Ubisoft after this last E3, but that's a whole nother...
2092000	2096000	And they'll still buy all their games, and they'll still buy all the DLC for it, so, yeah.
2096000	2097000	Alright.
2097000	2104000	Well, we'll get some of your thoughts on how, some more of your thoughts, I should say, on how gaming's changed in the past twelve years when we get to our FUGU Question of the Week a little later in the show.
2104000	2112000	However, for now, I'd like us to talk about the current things going on, and what you have been playing in video gaming this week.
2112000	2114000	And how was your gaming week?
2114000	2123000	Dark Sakura, I know you probably haven't had a whole lot of time for a lot with what's going on, but have you been diverted with other games this week?
2123000	2126000	I played Final Fantasy XIV for exactly an hour.
2126000	2128000	And that's it.
2128000	2131000	And what's going on in XIV for you?
2131000	2133000	I finally have quests.
2133000	2135000	Yay! Things to do.
2135000	2140000	And then, I just, I couldn't keep up with it, so I was just like, why am I sitting...
2140000	2148000	Okay, this has been the weird thing, is like, I will sit and try to find things to distract myself with, and then I'll be like, what is this going to accomplish?
2148000	2150000	I'm not accomplishing anything.
2150000	2158000	And then I'll go log off, feeling kind of disgusted with myself, and then I'm like, I could be playing a game right now because I can't do anything about anything else anyway.
2158000	2162000	So it's sort of like a loop, and I just said, screw it, I'll just hang out with a husband.
2162000	2165000	Or, you know, drink.
2165000	2167000	Not really.
2167000	2170000	But I did play D&D yesterday and it was great.
2170000	2172000	There you go.
2172000	2176000	Sometimes the pen and paper games are still where it's at, and the board games and all that.
2176000	2181000	Still a notable and worthy use of recreational time.
2181000	2184000	Yes. Rolling the dice.
2184000	2186000	No, really, rolling the dice.
2186000	2188000	Seriously, rolling the dice.
2188000	2195000	There's something therapeutic about stacking your dice when you're in a slow part of the game and seeing how tall you can get it before the whole thing falls over.
2195000	2197000	I used to do the same thing with playing cards.
2197000	2201000	As long as the table's not shaking too much, you can build little card houses. It's fun.
2201000	2203000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2203000	2205000	I played nothing.
2205000	2206000	What?
2206000	2207000	Yeah, I played nothing.
2207000	2212000	I did watch quite a bit of the summer games done quick, so that was kind of fun.
2212000	2220000	There was games I didn't even know they existed in there, like yet another sequel to I Wanna Be the Guy, so I was like, oh hey, that's pretty sweet.
2221000	2228000	I don't know. What was it that I watched that was interesting? I was a little pissed off.
2228000	2232000	They had a Mario Kart run that they did, Mario Kart 64, but they did it all legit.
2232000	2235000	So that was a little annoying, because I wanted to see all the glitches and stuff in the game.
2235000	2237000	Oh, I was like, what's annoying about playing Mario Kart?
2237000	2245000	Well, he was really good at racing. I mean, he kind of not really snaked everything, but he was going pretty fast.
2246000	2253000	I just would have liked to have seen more of the glitches, but they did that last year, I think, the awesome games done quick.
2253000	2257000	I remember they had a glitch one, so I just needed to look in their archives.
2257000	2270000	And what the fuck, starting the stupid feed at midnight, and then they had the cool games like ZZT, a speed run of ZZT that I couldn't watch, because it was at two in the morning.
2270000	2276000	So a little bit annoyed there, but I don't know. That's really all I did this week.
2276000	2287000	I did not, because I was working on game stuff, I was finishing converting, once again, all my meshes from 3D models I made into my own thing.
2287000	2290000	So I converted all that, so that's what I was working on all my free time.
2290000	2294000	And so that's all done, and I decided, hey, I've got to learn about shaders now.
2295000	2301000	But yeah, I didn't buy anything on the Steam sale, so I showed much restraint there.
2301000	2310000	And I did pick up the free things that they had on GOG.com, so I don't remember which games those were, but I got those.
2310000	2315000	Because that was pretty much my entire library, and GOG is just free stuff that they have.
2316000	2328000	And then on Steam, what was it they had, finally Shovel Knight, that's available now, so I finally redeemed that, but I haven't got a chance to play it yet.
2328000	2334000	I don't know, at some point I'm going to probably take a break and play some games, but not yet.
2335000	2344000	I couldn't get the group to play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 either, but I am thinking about maybe going back to Grand Theft Auto 5.
2344000	2350000	Maybe play some Grand Theft Auto Online, but I don't know what the online situation is there, I'm still waiting for DLC.
2350000	2356000	That's it, and definitely nothing coming out any time soon that I'm looking forward to because it's just dead.
2356000	2365000	So, I don't know what the next game I'm actually looking forward to playing, other than No Man's Sky, but who knows when the fuck that's coming out.
2365000	2366000	It's going to be a ways out.
2366000	2371000	Alright, I'll talk about my gaming week, and to be honest, I've played a lot of the same things that I usually do in a week.
2371000	2378000	I talked a little bit about my return to 11, Final Fantasy 11 last week, and yes, that's still kind of been going on in a thing this week.
2378000	2384000	Which is filling in my MMO time a little bit, because World of Warcraft, and I talked about this a little more in depth on Hoard House,
2384000	2391000	but World of Warcraft just really isn't doing it for me right now, and there's no expansion on the horizon until, you know, God knows when, probably around Blizzcon.
2391000	2398000	Final Fantasy 14 isn't due for a patch until 2.3, so 11 is kind of filling in my time. They had a double XP weekend this weekend.
2398000	2408000	I leveled the Corsair from 1 to, I think, 16 when I quit in like an hour. It's pretty disgusting. Remember that would take like 2 months to do?
2408000	2409000	Damn.
2410000	2420000	Between the Records of Eminence, the XP ring for Empress Band, the double XP, and having an entire party with me through the Trust NPCs to just slaughter through things.
2420000	2425000	Oh, and the Field Manual, like it just flew by. Crazy. So there's that.
2425000	2436000	But, I will say this, and since you guys are, you know, Loki, you just talked about there's not a lot to play right now, I'm going to tell you both, I think one game you guys ought to both have your eyes on and check out at some point.
2436000	2444000	Because I think this game is fan-fucking-tastic and right up the alley for both of you guys, and that game is one a lot of people are talking about this week, Shovel Knight.
2444000	2457000	Shovel Knight, of course, the kickstart funded game through Yacht Games, finally saw its release this week on the PC and the Wii U, and I decided, oh, and the 3DS, and I decided to pick it up on the Wii U.
2457000	2475000	I was surprised just how good the game comes across on the Wii U, and works in some of that Wii U integration. You know what I mean? Like, I was really surprised at how natural it felt, especially for such a retro game.
2475000	2486000	Okay, so Shovel Knight. Like, if you haven't seen anything on this, Shovel Knight is, you know, it's got a very DuckTales look to it, especially when you see Shovel Knight jumping with his shovel pointed down.
2486000	2493000	It kind of reminds you of, you know, Scrooge McDuck with his cane, but he doesn't bounce. Very important difference, he doesn't bounce.
2494000	2508000	The game also seems to have a Mega Man aesthetic to it, but you don't, at least not to where I'm at so far, you don't exactly inherit the powers of monsters that you defeat, although you can pick up other powers.
2508000	2516000	It plays a little more like, I don't know, something like Zelda 2 or something in that regard, where you have the different spells that you can cast for an amount of time.
2517000	2530000	Soundtrack, fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. VRT, I think, does the soundtrack, and it's great. I know there were a couple contributions as well from some of the classic 8-bit game composers.
2530000	2540000	The Wii U integration that I mentioned a bit before. You, of course, can use the game pad as like your sub-screen where you can choose items and things like that, but one of the tabs says Diary.
2540000	2550000	When you go to that tab, you actually see Miiverse posts, but not like the little drawn things, like text Miiverse posts, I guess sometimes drawings show up too.
2550000	2557000	So you see both of those specific to the room that you're in, in whatever part of the game you're at.
2557000	2570000	So let's say, for example, I zoned right into one area, it was like the very first area you go into, and I went into the diary in Miiverse, and the posts say, go left, there's a secret here.
2570000	2575000	And sure enough, if you go left, there was a secret room with one of the little bar things that's there to collect.
2575000	2587000	And I definitely sat there for a moment and I went, huh, that is, it's kind of like Dark Souls method, and there's, I would argue there's a lot of Dark Souls inspiration in this game too.
2587000	2597000	Because it's, A, it gets very mind-numbingly difficult in some parts. B, when you die, you lose some of your gold, and you have to go back to the point you died to collect it.
2597000	2609000	Where have I seen that before, right? And then C, this whole part about, like, remember Dark Souls and Demon Souls, really, you find the little pages and the ghosts on the ground that tell you the warnings and things like that.
2609000	2621000	Like, it kind of felt like that, but in Shovel Knight. And the way it's presented still has, maintains that retro feel to it, that very retro vibe to the game.
2621000	2631000	So I was really impressed with that, and I think, although I would like to pick it up on PC at some point, just because, you know, I think a really good game I like to own on multiple platforms.
2631000	2632000	Did you back it?
2632000	2644000	I didn't back it. You know how I feel about Kickstarter. So no, I didn't back it, but like many things I talk about on Kickstarter that I support, and it's like, I'll certainly buy that when it comes out.
2644000	2652000	Shovel Knight was one of them. I'll buy my number nine when it comes out, too. But yeah, I was hearing a lot of great things about Shovel Knight, and I was like, oh yeah, I gotta get that. I gotta get that today.
2652000	2670000	So I did, and I wasn't disappointed. Fantastic, kind of like a tickle of the retro funny bone type of thing, where you have that level of nostalgia, but yet has enough of that new technology in it to make it feel like you are playing a game that couldn't have been made on the NES.
2670000	2684000	So it's, I was, yeah, extremely pleased with Shovel Knight. It's an earlier, it's an early candidate for game of the year. I'm serious. It's that good. So I think a lot of you guys should be definitely checking that out.
2684000	2704000	Let's see, going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. ActDef says, most people have said that the Wii U version of Shovel Knight is probably the definitive version. Hard for me to speak to that because I haven't played the others. I'd be very curious on the 3DS, how it works, though I imagine it's very similar with the item stuff on the bottom and so forth.
2705000	2717000	SSJ100Matt says, Shovel Knight on 3DS is more of a personal thing. I kind of wish I could play it on a larger screen to admire the game. Also, I tend to grip the controllers more on platformers with handhelds that's slightly uncomfortable.
2717000	2727000	ActDef saying, yeah, Shovel Knight does a Dark Souls type of thing. So there you go. Some of the comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com on Shovel Knight.
2728000	2738000	That was pretty much the bulk of my gaming week. Otherwise, I actually picked up a few more games in the Steam sale and I was kindly gifted a few games and Dark Sakura got me a couple games.
2738000	2750000	DDR Angel, who we brought up earlier in the show, funny enough, also bought me a game. She bought me Steam World Dig. Dark Sakura got me Dark Souls, right? And Alice Madness Returns. So there you go.
2750000	2751000	Happy birthday.
2751000	2759000	Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Yeah, I had a birthday this past week too, but whatever. We won't talk about that. Because as this show ages, so do I.
2760000	2770000	Alright, there you go. That was my gaming week. So some quick housekeeping. Be sure to follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. And we're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and of course on Google Plus.
2770000	2778000	For those of you that are still on Google Plus, Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word. Be sure to follow us and all that good stuff.
2778000	2782000	And let's get into some gaming news for tonight. Loki.
2782000	2795000	So Oculus is going to hopefully get a new design, at least aesthetically, because they are purchasing the design team that kind of worked on the Microsoft Xbox 360 controller, Carbon Design.
2795000	2806000	And basically it's for a bunch of unannounced projects, I guess, they're working on. So I don't know.
2806000	2820000	Didn't really see how much they were going to be purchasing them for, but it'll be interesting to see how that ends up affecting the retail piece when it finally does come out someday.
2821000	2838000	And then a little bit on the front of lawsuits. ZeniMax, you may remember, had filed a lawsuit against Oculus for apparently stealing patent information, information about VR and stuff.
2838000	2854000	Basically ZeniMax saying that they own the rights to the Oculus technology because without, I guess, John Carmack's input, they wouldn't have been able to make the Oculus Rift, which doesn't really make any sense, but whatever.
2855000	2870000	Of course, Oculus has come out, they've done the response, and just basically saying ZeniMax falsely claims ownership in Oculus VR technology in a transparent attempt to take advantage of the Oculus VR sale to Facebook.
2870000	2884000	And by deliberately misstating some of the facts and omitting others, ZeniMax makes an incredible assertion that it, a video game software publishing company for personal computers and consoles like the Sony Playstation, invented and developed virtual reality hardware and software.
2884000	2909000	So, I only kind of glanced over it, but apparently the complaint ZeniMax is saying is that because of, I guess, the exposure they gave the Oculus because of the integration with Doom 3 BFG edition that came out that was going to have Oculus Rift support, because of that, that they, I guess, are not going to be able to do that.
2915000	2937000	And apparently, Oculus is saying that, well, they're just bitter because they've had multiple opportunities to get in on the ground floor with financing and kind of backing this whole thing, but they didn't until, you know, and then Facebook bought them, and now they're just pissed off that they didn't get any of that kind of payout from the acquisition.
2938000	2956000	I don't know. The whole thing comes down to if John Carmack actually was working on this stuff, you know, while he was working at ZeniMax and, you know, what his whole contract is, you know, if anything he develops there, if that is going to be owned by them or not.
2956000	2975000	According to Oculus, their, you know, development kits and stuff have no code that's owned by ZeniMax in it, and, you know, ZeniMax has access to that, and they can see clearly that there's none of that, but I think it's just going to be, it might just go to court. I don't think they're going to settle, so...
2975000	2982000	Eh, I don't know. Sometimes these companies trade some pretty big barbs in the press, and then they end up settling anyway, so...
2982000	2991000	I mean, it really depends on how stern Oculus may feel if they have to settle or not. It does seem to me that they're very much like, we don't owe you shit.
2992000	3001000	I'm thinking maybe they're just hoping that they settle so that they can get in, like, okay, you know, as a settlement, you know, ZeniMax can, you know...
3002000	3003000	Get a cut.
3003000	3004000	Get a cut, yeah, or something.
3004000	3011000	Or, you know, be able to have some type of exclusivity or something, you know, some little perk out of it. Who knows?
3011000	3022000	I don't know, but it's interesting. Definitely go take a look at, you know, the paperwork that they filed with the court. It's just, it's interesting.
3022000	3026000	And some colorful, you know, language in there, just, you know...
3027000	3034000	I don't know. It's not entirely professional, I think, but it'll be interesting to see how this all plays out.
3034000	3045000	Well, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com. GameGuru says, so Oculus will have a crappy D-pad? Poking a little fun at the Xbox 360 controller. Well, we can pray it won't.
3045000	3047000	I hope they learn their lesson there.
3047000	3058000	But Bobby Blackwolf, who of course follows a lot of the Oculus stuff, as you guys know, is mentioning in chat. It's for input. They bought them to create an input device, not necessarily to redesign the HMD.
3058000	3066000	And saying to GameGuru that no D-pad at all. It's more like the Razer Hydra, but actually working. So, we'll see.
3067000	3071000	They could give input in, you know, I mean... I don't know.
3072000	3078000	It's also very much not about necessarily cloning the past as it is creating the future, right?
3078000	3089000	Speaking of which, I was going to say, I don't think we were covering any of it, but that whole Google I.O. press conference was this week.
3090000	3093000	No, it's not on our show world tonight, so if there's anything you want to share, please.
3093000	3110000	Well, I thought it was interesting. They had the whole Google I.O. thing, and then, aside from announcing that they're doing support for Google TV, which is going to be like this streaming, or no, Android TV, which is basically Android for TV.
3111000	3116000	And so, streaming boxes and stuff can have this built in. You have support for Android apps and stuff like that.
3116000	3122000	But one of the things that they showed off was Project Cardboard, and it was a cardboard piece.
3123000	3131000	And what it ended up being was this thing that you could strap in your phone to, and it kind of does this pseudo virtual reality thing.
3131000	3142000	Kind of think of it like, man, this is a while back, but on the PSP, they had a Melgears Subsistence game that came out.
3143000	3154000	I want to say the Subsistence 2, and it had a 3D thing where you'd put this thing over your face and put it to the screen, and it would kind of show things in 3D.
3154000	3171000	Well, it's kind of showing, I guess, a cheap way to do VR. Granted, it's not going to be as great as the Oculus or something, but a cheap way to do VR on your phone, I guess, or at least 3D display on your phone, which is kind of neat.
3172000	3178000	And it's just a piece of cardboard, and they have the design online. You can make it with cardboard, a couple magnets, and Velcro.
3179000	3191000	I thought that was interesting. They even have an API or SDK to develop for that if you want to make your own tech demo or something. I just thought that was interesting.
3192000	3198000	That was kind of the response to the Oculus. I don't know if it's their official response, but it's a neat idea that they're toying around with.
3200000	3201000	That's it.
3202000	3205000	That Google conference went on for a very long time, though, right?
3205000	3220000	Oh my God, yeah, but last year was even longer, but yeah, that thing drug on. Because it was funny, they were saying, yeah, it's going to be, unlike last year, which is like three and a half hours, it's going to be a tight two hours this year. Nope, that was not what happened.
3221000	3231000	Alright, well, speaking of Google, you know, they own YouTube, and some news came out this week that YouTube will be allowing videos to be rendered in 48 and 60 frames a second.
3232000	3237000	I can't believe that the streaming technology is that good to actually be able to show that, and that the internet is fast enough.
3238000	3245000	But, of course, you will have to have, of course, a really, really good computer that can process the data that fast and a really good connection in order to do that.
3245000	3257000	Yeah, that was the issue, was it last year with, or was it even earlier this year, but with season two of Video Game High School, they did all their video game sequences in 48 frames per second.
3258000	3272000	And so they actually had the, they couldn't put that on YouTube that way, it was all 24 on YouTube, but they had to build their own player to be able to show that, because they didn't have a player up until that point to support 48 frames per second. So now they can do that.
3272000	3284000	Now they can do that. So we'll see if more and more YouTube channels take advantage of this technology as Google rolls it out, because I don't think it's still like, you know, Joe Blow can sign up and have it on his YouTube channel yet.
3285000	3294000	But they do have some concept videos, examples of that out there already. You can see that, I'm sure, on a lot of gaming websites this week, the Titanfall gameplay at 60 frames a second.
3294000	3304000	There's also some Battlefield Hardline, you can look that up on YouTube as well if you want to see that in action. And see if your computer can handle it, because sadly if it's more than a few years old, it might not be able to.
3305000	3310000	So, there you go. It must take a really mega computer to be able to record that too.
3311000	3321000	Alright, and speaking of YouTube, now of course a lot of you guys on Twitch, I know I'm on Twitch, I actually did a Final Fantasy XI game broadcast the other night, and had a few people on a Friday night for that.
3321000	3330000	Well, if I wanted to, I could have broadcast to my YouTube channel via Twitch that I was in fact broadcasting.
3331000	3339000	So yeah, I mean, the way Twitch is built now, like your subscribers, if they opt into it, they can get an email or they can get an alert on their phone.
3340000	3345000	In fact, somebody actually was like, did you have to go live at 1230, because I just lied down and I got an alert on my phone.
3345000	3349000	And I was like, why don't you turn that off so I don't wake you up, don't make me feel bad.
3350000	3359000	Sometimes I go live late at night, because that's just when I'm up, and sometimes I do it with the intention of recording it for people to consume later.
3360000	3361000	I don't expect everybody's necessarily there right that minute.
3362000	3369000	But anyway, another way you can actually broadcast to everybody that you're going live is a Twitch live annotation for YouTube.
3369000	3375000	And what happens is it does a promotional alert on your YouTube videos that says, I'm broadcasting.
3376000	3382000	So that's kind of neat that it can edit the YouTube videos that fast for people that are watching to know that you're live.
3383000	3391000	Now for little old me, who hardly has any subscribers on YouTube, and maybe gets a couple video views a day, this isn't particularly useful.
3392000	3402000	But if you're somebody like, I don't know, PewDiePie, who all day long has zillions of, you know, young boys and girls watching his stream, you know, at any given moment.
3403000	3408000	I mean, think about it. At any given moment in the day, there's thousands of people watching a PewDiePie video.
3409000	3413000	And that is why we are all now dumber for having watched.
3414000	3417000	Stop. Don't throw shade just because you're successful.
3417000	3420000	No, no. I'm not throwing shade because he's annoying.
3421000	3427000	Like, don't get me wrong. It's cool that he's successful and everything, and I'm not jealous in any way.
3428000	3431000	Granted, I would love to make millions of dollars each year, but I'm not jealous in any way.
3432000	3437000	But the fact that he's just an obnoxious person. Maybe that's why people like watching him, but he is a fucking obnoxious person.
3438000	3444000	I didn't want to make this about him. I wanted to talk about that, you know, if you are someone like him, because he's not the only one.
3444000	3447000	Well, what? Like, Yogscast probably has zillions of people, too. You know, all these big...
3448000	3450000	Much less annoying people. Those people are actually cool.
3451000	3454000	Fine, fine. Then, whenever they go live, they can have a little pop-up that goes,
3455000	3457000	Boop, we're live. And, you know, all the people can go right to their livestream and interact.
3458000	3462000	I think that's really cool. You know, if we had more of a YouTube presence, I'd be able to take advantage of that.
3463000	3467000	We have our shows on YouTube. FYI, guys, Jason works hard on archiving those shows.
3468000	3469000	But, you know, those aren't really getting a lot of hits either.
3469000	3474000	But I think it's a great way, like, if you want to pull up OLR on the 3DS, you know, you can do that.
3475000	3479000	And I think another really good thing is that, for the really...
3480000	3482000	You know, they'll be on YouTube until YouTube goes away.
3483000	3487000	So, when people want to go back and hear a show we did a year ago, they can do it in a snap. They don't have to dig it up.
3488000	3492000	Maybe if we release episode one, I'll just put it on YouTube. You know, something like that.
3493000	3495000	You know, it's a really great kind of archiving method, if nothing else.
3495000	3501000	So, alright. Let's see. Going to our chatroom over at live.fognetwork.com, TigerKala says,
3502000	3504000	I think YouTube increasing the frame rate is good for movies, too.
3505000	3511000	Movies that are being shot at 48 frames a second, the studio could potentially release trailers for the 48 frames per second version of the movie.
3512000	3514000	For example, the latest film in the Hobbit trilogy.
3515000	3519000	You know, that is true that this is definitely going to see an impact more than video games.
3519000	3525000	I'm curious to see what the first music video shot at 48 or 60 frames a second is going to look like.
3526000	3531000	And if it's going to be OK Go that does it. Because their videos are insane. Have you seen that latest one? It's so cool.
3532000	3533000	They're all insane.
3534000	3536000	It's so cool. But anyway, back to the movie thing. Yeah.
3537000	3543000	It would have been really interesting if people could have seen what The Hobbit was going to look like before they necessarily went and saw it.
3544000	3546000	It wasn't well received across the board, obviously.
3546000	3550000	Yeah, but that's the thing. Maybe less people would have gone and seen it. Not necessarily.
3551000	3557000	Maybe if they had taken the single book and left it as a single movie, people might have been interested in seeing it.
3558000	3561000	Instead of it being the snore fest that I was forced to sit through.
3562000	3564000	I can't comment. Haven't bothered with the movie. Didn't read the book.
3565000	3567000	I read the book when I was in second grade.
3568000	3569000	I saw the Lord of the Rings movies, though.
3570000	3574000	And I read, actually, the Lord of the Rings trilogy when I was in third and fourth grade.
3574000	3577000	That last Lord of the Rings movie, though, seriously had, like, six endings in there.
3578000	3583000	It's like Fade to Black. We're done? No. Oh, fuck. Come on. Fade to Black. We're done? Oh, no. No.
3584000	3589000	Well, now you literally do have Fade to Black sequences and there's more movies coming. It just never ends. Never ends.
3590000	3592000	Alright, Dark Sakura. What do you have for us?
3593000	3598000	Well, there was a show that had a character that was voiced by Mr. Samuel himself.
3599000	3600000	It's called Afro Samurai.
3600000	3609000	And it was a pretty, pretty cool show. Now there's going to be an Afro Samurai game coming out.
3610000	3617000	It's supposed to be on one of the, I guess, now current gen consoles and on PC.
3618000	3626000	But it'll be put out by Redacted Studios and is a third person game with a new storyline that has more stuff to do.
3626000	3630000	Special moves, combos, and dismemberment.
3631000	3637000	That first game, I think, came out a few years ago. It was Namco that released that. I just don't remember. It was alright.
3638000	3641000	It had Samuel L. Jackson in it, so it couldn't have been that bad.
3642000	3643000	That's right. That's right.
3644000	3645000	Samuel L. Jackson is going to be good.
3646000	3652000	Samuel L. Jackson is one of those actors. He can literally play anything and I would want to go see it.
3652000	3662000	You know, we're talking about the Lord of the Rings. If he'd been the Lion in the Chronicles of Narnia, how much better would that have been?
3663000	3671000	No disrespect to Ralph Fiennes or whoever did do the voice, but there's so many things that could be improved through Samuel L. Jackson's voice, just saying.
3672000	3674000	That would have been awesome.
3675000	3688000	I love Donald Sutherland as the President of the Capitol, as President Snow in the Hunger Games movies, but can you imagine if it had been Samuel L. Jackson? Think about that latest preview that's out there now.
3689000	3697000	Can you imagine if he played the role of Katniss Everdeen? Think of how much more awesome that would be and very awkward at times.
3698000	3702000	I still haven't watched the first movie, Rob, after you loaded it to me, but I've read the whole series of books twice now.
3702000	3704000	Oh, you haven't seen the movies yet? Oh, they're so good.
3705000	3706000	I've watched parts of them on YouTube.
3707000	3713000	Some think the movies are better than the books and all I have to say is that the third and fourth movies better be better than the book.
3714000	3715000	You know, the third book was pretty good.
3716000	3726000	But yeah, the movies are very well done. I mean, there's always going to be those moments of, well, they didn't do that in the book, but if you are willing to cut them a little slack, you'll be rewarded.
3727000	3730000	That's where I'm totally rewarded for being ignorant and not reading any of the books.
3730000	3732000	That's right. To me, everything's brand new.
3733000	3736000	That's what I did with Harry Potter. I'm like, wow, dude. Yeah, seriously.
3737000	3738000	I see why kids love this. These movies are great.
3739000	3743000	Even like the third and fourth movies where people were like, they cut so much out.
3744000	3754000	I had, Tiara and I had this thing that we did for like the last four of the books where we would just sit online on AIM and read the book and ask where each other was in the book.
3754000	3756000	Oh my God, Darcy, I remember.
3757000	3758000	And me sitting here.
3759000	3767000	You sitting on the show, reading Harry Potter during the show because the, the seven elegy or whatever you would call it, septilegy wasn't done yet.
3768000	3772000	Yeah. And then I would go home and finish reading it. I would read each of the books in a day.
3775000	3778000	And remember, I would buy the British versions, read them, and then the American versions.
3779000	3780000	Didn't I buy you for a birthday present once?
3781000	3782000	You bought me a Japanese one.
3782000	3790000	And they had to explain what the British slang was because I remember seeing, I was trying to just flip through to see if I could read any of it.
3791000	3798000	And I was like, jump, they're explaining what a jumper is, what a crumpet is, you know, just different things.
3799000	3802000	I was like, they actually have a glossary section in the Harry Potter book for the Japanese readers.
3803000	3804000	There you go. All right.
3804000	3811000	By the way, I just bought a shirt at the place I normally don't give my money, Walmart, because it said Hogwarts Alumni on it.
3812000	3816000	Well, when you have to have something, you have to have it no matter where it came from, right?
3817000	3818000	All right. No matter how many-
3819000	3820000	That's Raginator. What?
3821000	3822000	Samuel L. Jackson is Dr. Frankenfurter.
3825000	3826000	That man could pull it off.
3826000	3833000	Okay, but hold on, hold on. Now, despite everything I just said, now you're playing with Tim Curry roles.
3834000	3838000	And I'm not, when it comes to Samuel L. Jackson versus Tim Curry, I'm not so sure.
3839000	3840000	Tim Curry can make an awesome president in snow.
3841000	3844000	Yeah, there are limits to this. There are limits to the Samuel L. Jackson role.
3845000	3848000	If we were going to go that far, why not have Morgan Freeman as Dr. Scott?
3849000	3855000	And now imagine him doing from the day he was born in the Morgan Freeman voice.
3856000	3860000	Oh my gosh, what is this show becoming? All right, we need more gaming news, Loki, quick.
3861000	3875000	All right, so there was this hilarious article that came out talking about EA CEO Andrew Wilson reflecting about what exactly they learned from the mobile version of Dungeon Keeper.
3875000	3889000	Yes, mobile version of Dungeon Keeper. You may remember it as a version of the game that they hoard the living shit out of with microtransactions to a ridiculous extent and everybody hated it.
3890000	3892000	So what did they learn exactly from this?
3893000	3900000	One, they have to stay as true as possible to a revive series essence rather than purely going for new players.
3900000	3909000	And that when you think about a business model, premium subscription, free to play, value has to exist.
3910000	3919000	Whether it's a dollar, ten dollars, a hundred dollars, or a thousand dollars. You have to deliver value and always err on the side of delivering more value, not less.
3920000	3930000	So they learned nothing because that game was a pile of shit and it sounds like to me that they just don't really understand why people didn't like it.
3931000	3943000	They think that, oh, for my dollar I'm not getting enough. Maybe that's true, I think it's more of the, oh, in order to break a block in this game I have to wait 24 hours or I have to pay money, is a little ridiculous.
3944000	3953000	I think that's the problem, but considering how much information they learned about Dungeon Keeper makes me wonder how much they learned from Battlefield 4.
3954000	3959000	Because they claim that they're totally going to do everything differently, but it sounds to me that they're not really learning anything.
3960000	3967000	I kind of hope that this is the crack in the glass, so to speak, when it comes to the whole free to play mobile thing.
3968000	3976000	Because, you know, you read investors and financial websites and thanks to stuff that is batshit crazy popular and I'll never understand why to this day.
3977000	3987000	Things like Candy Crush Saga, Farmville, and all that stuff that I guess the broader market of non-hardcore or even non-casual gamers, but they still play those games.
3987000	4003000	Buy up that stuff, you know, that's where investors and all that seem to think that everything is going to, but I'm hoping that EA saying this, a big company like EA saying that this whole model with Dungeon Keeper is a crack in the glass with this whole free to play mobile bubble.
4004000	4012000	Because I think there's so many games that are doing it wrong that I want to see the bubble burst on that so badly.
4012000	4021000	Everybody's got a little bit of gaming cynic in them, and I try not to be too overly cynical, but when it comes to this stuff I get a little bit cynical. I kind of want the bubble to burst.
4022000	4036000	I get that there's games out there that they have free to play games and stuff that a lot of it is based off microtransactions, but to the point where it's just like they're hitting you up for money all the time.
4036000	4046000	Just constantly hitting you up for money, and then there's games that are free to play that they have microtransactions in there, but it's not necessary to do that.
4047000	4054000	For example, I think like Tiny Tower or something, that's a perfect example of a free game that you don't really need to buy the microtransactions.
4055000	4062000	Sure, it'll speed up some of the development and stuff in the game, but it's not as ridiculous as like, okay, I'm going to make a new dungeon here.
4062000	4078000	Okay, to break this block is going to take 72 hours. That is fucking stupid. If that was a game that I had picked up, and I didn't know that that was in there, and I saw that, I would probably delete it immediately off of my device.
4079000	4082000	I would just be like, nope, I'm not fucking with this. Forget it.
4082000	4090000	I think also the problem was that people, the original Dungeon Keeper games were available on good old games and stuff like that for like 10 bucks.
4091000	4097000	It's like, okay, I can spend the hundreds of dollars that you want me to spend on this stupid mobile game, which I'm never really going to do in the first place.
4098000	4107000	Or I can just go buy Dungeon Keeper for 10 bucks, and I think I even gave it away for free at one point around that same time when the game came out.
4107000	4117000	But it's just, I don't know. I see them doing this a lot, and I see Namco trying this a lot, and I think a lot of these guys don't understand.
4118000	4132000	Not every game is going to be like a Flappy Bird or Candy Crush or whatever. They're so flash in the pan fads that tomorrow could be something completely different that people are into, and their game is just going to be toast.
4132000	4137000	You said Namco, and it reminded me of that offensively bad Soul Calibur game.
4138000	4148000	Exactly. No, Namco is going the route of, we're trying to apply the free-to-play model that's in mobile to console, and they started with fucking Ridge Racer on the Vita, and it's only gotten worse from there.
4149000	4159000	Well, the Tekken game wasn't so bad. That game wasn't offensively bad as the Soul Calibur was. Oh my god. Go back a few episodes to hear my review on that game.
4160000	4163000	So, I was not pleased with that.
4163000	4187000	Some people out there are not pleased with some things they were hearing in the Destiny alpha. Destiny, of course, a huge game coming from Bungie, and some saying it's so huge, it's a $500 million game, which Bobby Kotick, the Activision CEO, would like to let you, he actually described it as a $500 million bet.
4188000	4206000	But Bungie would like to let you know that, I guess, it's associated marketing costs and so forth, it is nowhere near $500 million. So why Bobby Kotick called it that, who knows. Maybe that's how much he expects the game to make. I can't imagine they haven't dropped a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of money on this, though.
4206000	4218000	No, they've been marketing since last year. They're definitely spending a lot of money on it, but I'd be really surprised if it was $500 million that they spent on that. I don't even think, granted, that $500 million was that much.
4219000	4233000	Now, when I talked about the whole thing that some people weren't happy with what they were hearing, Ghost, which is this little floating guy that is kind of with you for certain parts of the game, Ghost is voiced by a famous actor, Peter Dinklage, which you guys watched Game of Thrones, you've probably seen him before, right?
4233000	4241000	No, from Elf. Elf. And his recent guest appearance with Tartar Sauce, the grumpy cat.
4242000	4258000	Alright, well fair enough, fair enough. Wherever you may know him from, you probably recognize him, but people not happy with him in Destiny, saying that his delivery was weak, lifeless, and even though this is technology, I mean Claptrap was technology too, but Claptrap did not feel weak and lifeless whatsoever.
4259000	4260000	Claptrap was fucking awesome.
4260000	4277000	Exactly. So anyhow, Bungie says that ghost lines have been updated for beta and they'll be updated again for launch, meaning they either got, and what's not said here, not to start rumors, but either they got him back in the studio or they got someone else.
4278000	4286000	We'll find out when the beta begins momentarily. Again, not to start rumors, it's probably him, but it's probably maybe some different takes or something like that, we'll see.
4287000	4294000	Alright, Destiny. Looking forward to playing the beta for that. When does that start?
4295000	4296000	The 17th.
4297000	4298000	All PlayStation Plus people are getting in on that, right?
4299000	4303000	PlayStation Plus are getting in on that, and if you have a code, I think it's also on PC.
4304000	4319000	Which we do have a few extra codes we'll be giving away here between OLR and Hoard House, but I really can't imagine a lot of you guys won't find your way in one way or another, but if you're in need of a code, if you still need one, come the 17th, we'll be hooking as many of you guys up as we can.
4320000	4321000	As we can.
4322000	4325000	I'm thinking most people could get in through PlayStation Plus, but...
4326000	4338000	Ironically enough, mine expired, and I don't have enough money to renew my PlayStation Plus, which is fine, because I was like, oh, I'm going to download the new games, and I'm like, oh, it's expired. But that's alright.
4339000	4346000	But I already have my code redeemed, so I'm in it. Am I actually going to play it? Who knows.
4346000	4360000	Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, going back to the Peter Dinklage lines, says, Dinklage sounded as if he sleepwalked through his lines, or sleptwalked through his lines, or was just told, just say this, we'll re-record it later for now.
4361000	4376000	That actually does happen sometimes. There is placeholder voice acting plenty of times in, like, concept early stages of games, so that actually is an excuse that could be valid. Placeholder stuff especially.
4377000	4386000	But usually it's the other way around. Usually a production guy or somebody that works for the company records the lines that a celebrity will come in and do later.
4387000	4388000	Like Portal 2.
4388000	4396000	Excellent example. So I know of other ones too, but I don't know if I can say them on air, but I could just say, I've heard that this is something that happens.
4397000	4405000	Samuel L. Jackson doing the voice of Chell, but then they decided, you know what, that is too much money, too much money to spend on that character, so we're going to make her silent again.
4407000	4408000	Possibly.
4409000	4414000	Dark Sakura? How about Samuel L. Jackson as GLaDOS? Would you love GLaDOS as much as you do?
4415000	4416000	No.
4416000	4417000	Fair enough.
4418000	4419000	Because no one is the great Ellen.
4420000	4422000	That's true. Ellen is great. You might get to meet her in two weeks.
4423000	4425000	Yay. I want to give her a huge hug.
4426000	4427000	You should.
4428000	4429000	And then I want her to sing with me.
4430000	4431000	She might.
4432000	4433000	I'll say, let's go do karaoke. I'll pick something a product.
4434000	4435000	You never know.
4436000	4444000	I actually want to ask her what her vocal range is. Because it came up after listening as, like, I really want to ask her what her vocal range is.
4444000	4453000	It's a bummer. I don't think the wedding is happening anymore. She probably would have performed at it, but I think they didn't have it in the budget to be able to actually do the wedding at GamerX anymore.
4454000	4455000	She kickstarted it.
4456000	4460000	I think they did. Sadly didn't meet that stretch goal or whatever. But anyway, we're still going to have a good time.
4461000	4471000	Which reminds me, I forgot to say it during housekeeping, but we will not be here live in two weeks. We may try to record something either early or, like, at GamerX.
4472000	4480000	I'm thinking there might be, like, a special that we do at the show, especially involving some of our other podcast friends, that maybe we put on the feed.
4481000	4485000	But sadly for you live folks, we won't be here live that week. So you are free to make other plans.
4485000	4490000	Anyway, let's move on with some news. DarkSara.
4491000	4498000	Well, there is a... I actually think it's kind of funny because we talked about this a little bit at Atari Party about Primal Rage.
4499000	4501000	You know, no one brought in a copy of it. We were thinking that was a shame.
4502000	4511000	But, you know, before there had been a Primal Rage 2 that had shown up on various other sources.
4511000	4521000	About a year and a half ago, actually. And, well, it apparently is real, and now is playable.
4522000	4532000	There's, let's see, basically the development had already gone on on it, and now there is a playable version in Illinois.
4533000	4537000	I'm not finding the name of the location, but this says that it is in Illinois.
4537000	4544000	Yeah, I can't remember. It looks really wonky though.
4545000	4552000	Because you play as like human characters that transform into dinosaurs, which are way, way cooler.
4553000	4556000	And it's a galloping ghost arcade in Brookfield, Illinois.
4557000	4558000	You know what's best though about these pictures?
4559000	4560000	What?
4561000	4563000	The Black Knight 2000 in the background. And I think a creature from the Black Lagoon.
4563000	4565000	So, yeah. That's the best thing about this.
4566000	4568000	Looks like that might be a pretty kick-ass arcade to go visit.
4569000	4571000	Primal Rage 2, my butt.
4572000	4579000	You know, whenever they decide to make the next arcade or HD remake or whatever, like they did with Killer Instinct.
4580000	4586000	I hope they choose Primal Rage next. That would be fantastic. Or Clay Fighter.
4587000	4591000	Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some games that will be coming out a lot sooner than a Clay Fighter remake.
4591000	4594000	Yes, sadly. Man, that would be so awesome.
4595000	4598000	But anyways, so this week, not a whole ton of stuff.
4599000	4605000	Sniper Elite 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, I believe PC.
4606000	4619000	And then also, if you haven't purchased this already on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, they're getting the Far Cry compilation with Far Cry 3, Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.
4619000	4626000	And I want to say on the Xbox 360, Far Cry instincts, Predator might be in there as well.
4627000	4630000	I hope so, because that's the way it was in the UK, but I don't remember.
4631000	4633000	That is it. That is all this week.
4634000	4636000	Alright, well it doesn't look like it's a very busy week over in Japan either.
4637000	4642000	On the PlayStation 4 this week, you have Akiba's Trip 2, which is out on July the 3rd.
4642000	4651000	I'm sorry, over on the PlayStation 3, also in Jilhai, Battlefield 3 gets a price reduction. That's really it on the PlayStation 3.
4652000	4660000	Over on the Wii U, we don't have anything until July 17th. That's when Wii Sports Club gets its retail release in Japan.
4661000	4666000	PlayStation Vita does have Demon Gaze Global Edition is out this week on the PlayStation Vita.
4667000	4673000	And on the Nintendo 3DS right now, Island Days is the only release to look forward to this week.
4674000	4676000	So kind of a slow week in Japan as well.
4677000	4678000	DarkSakura.
4679000	4685000	We actually have kind of a busy day on July 2nd. Child of Light is coming out on PlayStation Vita.
4686000	4690000	Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition on PS4 will be out.
4690000	4692000	Ratchet and Clank Trilogy for Vita.
4693000	4699000	Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution 2 will be on Android, iPad, and iPhone.
4700000	4703000	And then on the third Chibi Robo Let's Go Photo on 3DS.
4705000	4709000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
4710000	4716000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andretti with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase PIZZA.
4720000	4727000	Anyways, so, Kinect. Right now they do have a SKU on Xbox One without Kinect.
4728000	4733000	And Phil Spencer is basically saying, hey, you know what? People will buy Kinect because it's so awesome.
4734000	4736000	And there's millions and millions of people using Kinect today.
4737000	4744000	They've got a billion voice commands. They're throwing out some random statistics and stuff.
4745000	4749000	Consumers love the device. They love it so much that they're not willing to buy the system with the device.
4750000	4758000	But it says they will be able to buy it at launch when they buy their console or they'll be able to buy it after the $399 console.
4759000	4762000	But they don't have it available yet on its own.
4763000	4769000	And I'm kind of worried though now that it isn't necessarily standard that a lot of people aren't really going to buy it for these Kinect-enabled games.
4770000	4777000	Because, let's be honest, like the Xbox 360, they told me I need that Kinect because it's integral to playing these games.
4777000	4783000	And we're just kind of let down. Unless you're a big fan of Just Dance or Dance Central.
4784000	4792000	That's the problem is that a lot of those things were new. When Kinect came out, I mean, yeah, we had the Wii, but you couldn't get an experience like Dance Central really on the Wii.
4793000	4797000	I mean, I know they have put Just Dance on the Wii, but it's not the same. It's really not.
4798000	4803000	So, you had these new experiences that kind of justified the Kinect. It was a different experience than the Wii.
4803000	4811000	And so it's like, okay, well if I want to try these new games that are kind of something different, something I can't really play anywhere else, I gotta go and get a Kinect.
4812000	4825000	And then what happened? There was just a bunch of dance games. You never really saw Kinect utilized to do anything really groundbreaking or really new outside of the music games.
4826000	4830000	But that's the thing though. It's exactly what he's talking about now. He's saying, okay.
4830000	4838000	And that's the problem and why people, I mean, and granted I know there were things like Child of Eden, which was actually pretty cool, but unfortunately that was a diamond in the rough.
4839000	4840000	I mean, there was very few.
4841000	4842000	How do you think the Kinect worked that well with it?
4843000	4848000	I seem to remember what actually was pretty cool and you flicked your hand and said, you did these really cool things with it. It was actually a lot of fun to play with Kinect.
4849000	4853000	It just, you know, if you had a well-lit room and all that stuff, it just unfortunately is one game out of how many.
4853000	4862000	But anyway, that's the whole thing, Loki. And I think what you're trying to get into is that, okay, but now on the Xbox One, it's kind of a been-there-done-that feeling.
4863000	4869000	And like the whole integration of the voice and the interface and everything, it's just not that exciting anymore.
4870000	4882000	Yeah, and exactly with Kinect, I know it does some processing on the actual camera itself to help alleviate the system, but I know the system also does some of the processing as well.
4883000	4889000	I just don't understand why those voice commands have to only come from the Kinect camera.
4889000	4903000	That never made any sense to me how we have to have this Kinect camera to do voice commands in Halo, you know, coming out of the anniversary edition, which made no fucking sense in the first place because it was just really stupid.
4904000	4909000	It's like, why would I want to yell grenade to throw a grenade when I can push a button way faster than I can say the word grenade?
4910000	4916000	Or, you know, I guess navigating through some of the menus and stuff might be cool to do with Kinect, but that's really it.
4916000	4926000	As far as gameplay goes, we're seeing the exact same shit that was on Xbox 360, actually probably less than that because it just came out on Xbox One, but we're seeing the exact same stuff.
4927000	4937000	How are you utilizing Kinect differently on the Xbox One than the Xbox 360, aside from interface navigation with your voice, which technically you could do on the 360, just didn't work very well.
4937000	4947000	All you have is you have Kinect Sports, and you have fucking dancing games, and music games. That is the only thing. Oh, and fitness. Fitness stuff. It's the same three categories.
4948000	4963000	Well, Fantasia, I mean, I know is another music game, but it still kind of looks like it's doing something a little different, and I think Fantasia might be a really cool experience, but the problem is, with that game being delayed, essentially, I think a lot of us expected that that game was going to be more of a launch title than what it kind of ended up becoming.
4963000	4977000	I know Harmonix needs the help, but unfortunately, it's kind of missed the boat in some ways, and now, yeah, you're going to have a lot of people buying Xboxes this holiday without Kinect who may decide that Fantasia's not really worth it.
4978000	4989000	I'm a little bit on the fence myself. I do want Fantasia, and I want the Dance Central reboot, but there's not a lot of people to think like me in regards to the Xbox.
4990000	4999000	Well, and that's the thing, too, is with me, I bought the Kinect, and I just didn't use it. I bought the Vision camera when they had that out, and I didn't use that either, and it just didn't work that well.
5000000	5009000	I'm falling into a cycle here where you're promising me all this functionality, and then I get the actual product, and it just doesn't work the same way as you're showing me.
5010000	5014000	It's just like the tech demos where they showed you scanning the skateboard and doing dress-up and shit.
5015000	5016000	None of that happened.
5017000	5027000	None of that happened, and they're like, well, this time it will. This time it will with the new Kinect. Yeah, and then I'm going to get this new Kinect, and there's nothing going to be out for it. It's going to be the exact same shit they had with the original Kinect.
5028000	5030000	I don't believe it until the game is out on store shelves at this point.
5031000	5043000	I want to see the reviews, just like when they were doing that mech combat game they had with Kinect, and it was just fucking Steel Battalion, the new Steel Battalion with Kinect.
5044000	5050000	See, that could have been really cool if it worked like it was supposed to, but it didn't. It was just fucking terrible.
5051000	5054000	So that's why I'm just worried that they're not doing anything interesting with it.
5054000	5066000	Now, on the indie side, there was at least one demo that I saw where it was a 2D platformer where your shadow basically casts a doorway into another dimension.
5067000	5075000	So that was kind of a neat platforming element to it, but that was one title that was indie produced out of everything.
5076000	5081000	That's not enough for me to buy a system with a Kinect. If I was going to buy an Xbox One, it would not have Kinect with it.
5081000	5090000	Alright. Microsoft, you gotta convince Loki to get a Kinect when he gets his Xbox One. Gotta get those games out there that justifies it.
5091000	5094000	They really need to do something interesting with that, because right now it's just kind of useless.
5095000	5100000	And you know what? And I'm not just saying that it's Microsoft's fault either. Sony has the same problem.
5101000	5108000	Sony, what the fuck are you doing with that camera aside from having people use it for streaming on their channels when they're doing Twitch streaming stuff?
5108000	5114000	It really isn't utilized for anything other than that in dancing games. So they are just the blame.
5115000	5116000	Playroom.
5117000	5122000	And Playroom. Oh, ooh, a free tech demo. Ooh. Okay. So that's exactly the same shit that they had.
5123000	5124000	I do agree. I do agree.
5125000	5131000	Both of them need to come up with something interesting to do with that stuff, because they're really not necessary.
5132000	5135000	I go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
5136000	5138000	Dartatouya says, I heard the reviews for the Steel Battalion Seagull were just awful.
5139000	5145000	Tech2030 says, I want to be excited about Kinect, but I've never seen one title that has warranted any excitement.
5146000	5153000	ActDef says, meanwhile with the Wii U, and says ActDef uses the gamepad for a lot of things.
5153000	5161000	Well, but to be fair, there's a lot of people that are pretty critical about the gamepad as well, and is it really essential to the Wii U.
5162000	5170000	And, you know, even Nintendo had to play defense a little bit at E3 with, you know, these are Miyamoto concept demos where the gamepad is essential.
5171000	5180000	But I don't care about this. Like, they showed me, they showed that, like, that stupid giant robot thing, and I was just like, I don't care about this.
5180000	5186000	To Nintendo's credit though, to Nintendo's credit though, at least they are trying like hell to support it.
5187000	5193000	Whereas, you know, Sony and Microsoft arguably have not. In fact, Microsoft's pretty much relied on third parties to do it.
5194000	5196000	You know, save for what, Kinect Sports or whatever.
5197000	5204000	So, to Nintendo's credit, at least they're believing in that gamepad, and it's like, we're going to make this happen, dammit.
5204000	5211000	Well, the gamepad is not a stretch for them, because they have the second screen with 3DS, so they kind of have the idea of what to use that second screen for.
5212000	5220000	It's just, it's not entirely necessary to have that. And if it's such an expense, then it's not really worth having that tied to the system.
5221000	5229000	That being said, I would love to have a gamepad that worked with all consoles, because that would be awesome to be able to just play and sit down and not have to turn on my TV to play my game system.
5230000	5232000	That's really the only draw for me for a Wii U.
5232000	5239000	Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sony's using Morpheus for the camera. And that's, that is true.
5240000	5246000	But how much is Morpheus? Like, why do I need to buy a $60 peripheral now for $300-some plus dollar peripheral later?
5247000	5253000	Well, and, you know, and as much as, you know, I talked about this on the E3 wrap-up show, the Morpheus, I was very impressed with that tech demo I played.
5253000	5262000	But, it was one short demo that's not going to convince people to drop hundreds of dollars on, you know, the future of gaming.
5263000	5274000	And I said this before a few weeks ago, as impressed as I am with where Morpheus is at now, now what I'm excited to see, and now what Morpheus has to bring to the next E3 if they're going to end up releasing it for holiday 2015,
5274000	5284000	is what is Morpheus' Wii Sports? What is that game that you have to have this for, that you just, you're not going to get this experience without it?
5285000	5293000	Because without that game, and others like it to really back that up, even the Morpheus is doomed, as much as I enjoyed, you know, my time with it at E3.
5294000	5297000	It's got, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and the same thing goes through the peripherals.
5297000	5309000	So, alright. Well, one thing that is fantastic in a game, it's not the peripheral, but you just could not imagine a game without its soundtrack, without the music.
5310000	5317000	The soundtrack really makes, unless you're talking really, really old games, but for newer games, the soundtrack really can, you know, make the game.
5318000	5323000	And Mega Man, that whole series, some of the most iconic soundtracks of all time, right?
5323000	5334000	So, this is pretty cool. Old meets new. Capcom's licensing partner, Something Else Music Works, is releasing Mega Man music for digital download.
5335000	5344000	So now, you can actually go into iTunes, and check out Volume 1 and Volume 2, and these are just the Mega Man and Mega Man 2 original soundtracks that's available.
5344000	5356000	It has the original NES music, and the arranged songs that were in the Complete Works PlayStation re-release, and some other bonus tracks, and you can get those for $9.99.
5357000	5362000	July 29th will bring Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 4 in Volume 3 and Volume 4.
5363000	5373000	So, if you are into the digital music collecting, and want to put some more video game music in your iTunes library, I think the Mega Man games might be a worthy addition.
5374000	5384000	I love the cover art, too. Just this Mega Man soundtrack, Volume 1, just so many cool little pictures from that game.
5385000	5391000	Really sucks that Capcom won't make a new Mega Man game, but they'll keep milking the old ones, but alright, I guess I'll take what I can get.
5392000	5401000	Alright, well let's travel back in time a little bit. We'll travel back to the era of Mega Man and other games like it in a more classic time for video games.
5402000	5403000	It's the classic game of the week!
5404000	5417000	Dark Sakura's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing this game. Enough with your virtual reality and your cameras. You didn't need a camera.
5418000	5419000	You don't need Primal Rage.
5420000	5421000	You needed a controller.
5422000	5423000	You just rage primarily.
5424000	5426000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5427000	5434000	The classic game is Kiko Cubicle, which also came out in Japan as Meiki Ujima, which means Maze Island.
5435000	5438000	And it's a puzzle game that was done by Irem. You know what else Irem did, right?
5439000	5440000	Kari Wars?
5441000	5442000	Arkai.
5443000	5451000	And then it came out in arcades in 1988 and then came out on the NES in 1990.
5451000	5455000	It plays very similarly to Adventures of Lolo and Pango.
5456000	5468000	So basically, you have to go through all these lands in the fantasy kingdom, and on the US and European versions you play them in a set order, but in the Japanese version you can play them in any order.
5468000	5479000	But you have to go through and complete the major four lands, and then you get a special game that has 30 harder levels.
5480000	5491000	So you have to basically solve all the puzzles that are on the different islands, and then you have to get the red dream bags, and then once you take care of all that, then bam.
5492000	5493000	You know, beat game. Hooray.
5493000	5502000	And like I said, on the Japanese version you can play the worlds in any order. Also, the Japanese version was harder. It had more enemies in each level, too.
5503000	5509000	So, there's really not too much to say about this one. It's just a pretty simple little game.
5510000	5522000	If you've played Pango, if you've played Lolo, it's very similar. You walk around, you can kick your blocks, hence why the US version is clickable cubicle, and you have to clear out the levels.
5523000	5526000	It's really a cute little puzzle game, that's all.
5527000	5531000	Alright, that's it? Did you play this game a bit back in the day?
5532000	5533000	I have it in the box.
5534000	5538000	I rented it once, and I remember thinking it looked a lot cooler in the commercial than it actually played.
5539000	5549000	Yeah, it's not really one of my very favorites, but given that my internet was down today, I looked at the first box in the NES pile, and it was kickable cubicle.
5549000	5551000	I was like, I haven't done that before.
5552000	5559000	But I like the way that the levels are in the shapes of parfaits and radishes. That one's the radish.
5560000	5565000	And of course, you had Pango a couple weeks ago, and like you said, that's definitely an influence on this game as well.
5566000	5571000	And I think I like some of the characters in this. I can't think of a mascot quite like Kickle Cubicle.
5572000	5576000	Little DJ Snowman or whatever the hell he's supposed to look like.
5579000	5584000	I know those are supposed to be earmuffs, but they look more like headphones to me. It looks like a DJ.
5585000	5596000	Well, the thing about this game is it really does take a good bit of precision, given that you have to knock things in a certain place and work the puzzles a different way and solve them.
5597000	5602000	So, maybe Pango is pretty hard on its own. This is hard in a different way.
5602000	5609000	Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week, ladies and gentlemen. Kickle Cubicle from the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5610000	5625000	Alright, that's going to do it for part 8 of our show, but don't go anywhere, guys. There's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including the FUGL Question of the Week, about 12 years of gaming, some rapid-fire news, and gaming doing good for charity, and gaming doing not so good with potential layoffs. Yuck.
5626000	5630000	Alright, but we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5632000	5646000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June 29th, 2014, our episode 558 already in progress.
5647000	5652000	Next weekend, I know, is a holiday for many of you guys in the US with the 4th of July holiday.
5653000	5658000	Also, not on the weekend, but coming up in the next couple days, a happy Canada Day, to those of our listeners up there.
5658000	5665000	But we will still be here next Sunday live, as we always are. The holiday will not deter that show.
5666000	5675000	In fact, it falls at a really convenient time this year, though, with July 4th actually being on Friday. It gives a lot of people that day off. Not everybody, but a lot of people will get that day off, so it kind of gives it a long weekend.
5676000	5682000	I know I'm one of them, yes. So, excited to catch up on a lot of gaming that weekend. We'll see. We'll see.
5683000	5688000	Alright, well, meanwhile, let's get back into some gaming news with rapid fire news. Loki.
5689000	5705000	So, Deep Silver is going to be publishing Goat Simulator for retail, and that is the PC version. Don't get excited. It's not coming to the consoles anytime soon, because I'm pretty sure that a game that crashes quite frequently because of all sorts of reasons, probably not appropriate for consoles.
5706000	5716000	But, it will be coming for $9.99, and it will be available at retail, which I'm sure is just a Steam code to play the game.
5717000	5736000	And then also, in the age of games kind of knocking off other games, a developer, Strange Panther Games, has put out, or is developing a game called Rock Simulator. Not as in rock and roll, but as in rock, a thing that doesn't really do anything.
5737000	5750000	They basically say it's supposed to be a parody of Goat Simulator. If you ask me, I think it's more of a cash grab, kind of like the iOS and Android Goat Simulator type games that are kind of out there.
5753000	5764000	You know, he basically says, I saw other games such as Goat Simulator can be successful, so I thought, if a goat can be a good game, then a rock can be too. So, if that doesn't sound like cashing in on something, I don't know what is.
5765000	5774000	Also, I didn't expect anything near this reaction it's getting. It originally started off as a joke, and now we're seeing the reaction. It's a completely real game.
5775000	5780000	Yes, if you haven't learned yet, people like stupid games sometimes. So, I don't know.
5781000	5792000	But, if you're interested, I guess they say that the simulator will launch for free on PC, and they are doing an Indiegogo campaign to raise funding for it.
5793000	5797000	So, he's got a flexible funding campaign with 27 days left, and he's already passed his goal.
5800000	5802000	So, yes, for $15, they will send you a real rock.
5805000	5807000	$30? Two rocks.
5807000	5811000	Wow! Can I, like, put faces on them and things like that?
5812000	5817000	$50, three rocks, and a note with your name in the credits.
5818000	5826000	Tigercall on chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, someone needs to make an OLR simulator. I'm not sure how that would work.
5827000	5832000	Did you like the picture that I reposted on Facebook of the Fisher Price Studio?
5833000	5834000	Yes, I did actually see that one.
5834000	5838000	I'm going to repost that to my big tumbler, my public tumbler.
5839000	5848000	Nice. And in case you're wondering what a rock simulator is, it's basically you just sitting there as a rock. You don't move. Just a rock.
5849000	5852000	You don't get to move anywhere or do anything? You just watch the grass grow around you?
5853000	5856000	You just rock, yeah. Oh, yep, I see rolling down a hill.
5857000	5859000	Custom rock shape, size, texture.
5860000	5867000	Now, wait a minute. If you're a rock, shouldn't you be able to skip across the lake, too, if properly thrown?
5868000	5869000	I don't think you're that type of rock.
5870000	5872000	Maybe that's for Rock Simulator 2? I don't know.
5873000	5875000	They do have to plan for DLC, I suppose.
5876000	5879000	It is free to play, you know. It's got to have some sort of DLC.
5880000	5885000	Also, hey, you know, I'm sure that there's a lot of people out there saying, you know what?
5885000	5895000	I would totally buy an Ouya if only I could pay a lot of money to donate money to a better cause and get it in some sort of weird blue and white color.
5896000	5902000	Well, now you can, because apparently the Reading Rainbow Kickstarter campaign now has a new tier for $250.
5903000	5911000	You can get a brand new Ouya signed by Levar Burton in the Butterflies in the Sky blue and white.
5911000	5915000	Yeah, it's a limited edition.
5916000	5920000	But with this Ouya, will you be able to go twice as high?
5921000	5922000	I don't know.
5923000	5924000	With the amounts that you spend on games?
5925000	5930000	No idea, but yeah, it's in there if you pledge $250.
5931000	5936000	Honestly, just pledge money to the Reading Rainbow, but if you're doing this for an Ouya, it's probably not worth it.
5936000	5943000	Probably not the best way to go about getting an Ouya, but if it happens to be a free prize, then whatever, right?
5944000	5946000	Well, it's not free. It's $250.
5947000	5950000	It's about as free as a PBS tote bag.
5951000	5955000	But how well has it started doing? Is it how much money now at this point?
5956000	5967000	I think it's over $4 million because I remember that Seth MacFarlane said he's going to match the next million dollars, so if they get up to $5 million, he'll kick in another million dollars.
5968000	5972000	Wow, I wonder if he's going to do that through Kickstarter if he's donating it directly so they can't take the 5%.
5973000	5976000	Yeah, I would imagine it's after the fact. I don't think he's actually going to do it through Kickstarter.
5977000	5982000	Smart. Very smart. Think about it. Kickstarter gets what, 5%?
5982000	5987000	So yeah, they're going to make, what, $200,000?
5988000	5997000	Whoa. I don't know what that is. One of my things is doing an autoplay. Sorry about that. I hate that shit when sites do that.
5998000	5999000	Flash block.
6000000	6007000	So annoying. Anyhow, sorry, where were we? Oh yeah, 5%. Kickstarter's going to make, what, $200,000 off of that? Something like that?
6007000	6012000	I'm trying to do math in my head real quick. Carry the one. It's a lot of money. They're going to make a lot of money.
6013000	6020000	Yeah, they're up to, as of right now, they're up to $4.5 million.
6021000	6024000	Alright. 64 hours ago.
6025000	6034000	Some of you might be saving your money for some of the games that Nintendo announced that won't be coming out until later. One of those games is Splatoon. That's probably not going to be until next year.
6034000	6040000	And you know, one of the questions that was asked during our interactive coverage was, does Splatoon have voice chat or not?
6041000	6046000	Well, here's the answer, apparently. They still don't know if they're going to put voice chat in the multiplayer shooter or not.
6047000	6058000	Because they're not necessarily sure that the game needs it. Hmm. Well, here's the quote. This is from producer manager Hisashi Nogami and lead Tsubasa Sakaguchi.
6058000	6068000	Quote, the core concept of Splatoon is that by looking at the way the ink is being spread around and progressing, you know, you can kind of see what your enemies are doing, what your teammates are doing, and then you're able to decide what you want to do.
6069000	6076000	And that's kind of the main thing we're always thinking about. And we kind of get similar questions about the number of people that can be a multiplayer, but for this game, it's really that 4 on 4 is the best number.
6077000	6085000	With 4 on 4, the amount of influence that a single player has is perfectly balanced, but also the speed at which the battle changes, the way the battle is developing changes, is also completely perfect.
6085000	6093000	The idea being that the core concept is basically that players look at the way the ink is being spread around, the way it's being painted around to decide what to do.
6094000	6101000	If in any way that doesn't disrupt that balance we've created, we'll definitely consider different ways of communication and introduce that to the game as we go forward with development.
6102000	6109000	Well, why not the way Mario Kart 8 did it then? Just have it available in the lobbies so that after the game you can talk about what did and didn't work.
6109000	6116000	And I'm okay if they want to do the Nintendo thing and have it so that you can only talk to friends, and you don't get to talk to strangers.
6117000	6118000	That's dumb, but whatever, yeah.
6119000	6123000	Let's be real, a lot of strangers on Xbox Live, I don't want to talk to them.
6124000	6127000	But that's fine, just lock it down to friends, I guess that's okay.
6128000	6135000	I would be okay with friends of friends though. I think there should be a way that you talk to friends and friends of friends, but maybe that's asking too much.
6136000	6141000	I don't know, I understand their point, but it just also sounds like a cop-out.
6143000	6155000	Alright, well, speaking of Nintendo, Platinum is obviously putting out a pretty big Nintendo title, you know, Bayonetta 2, and it seems like they are very excited with the whole process.
6156000	6162000	And when asked a question about what role does Nintendo have in the next Bayonetta games and how intertwined are the two companies,
6162000	6166000	director of Bayonetta 2, Yusuke Hashimoto, said, quote,
6167000	6174000	In terms of nurturing the content of this game, there's a lot that we learned from Nintendo, and if possible, we would love to do it again and keep nurturing our child.
6175000	6179000	Can anyone say Bayonetta 3 confirmed? If this sells well?
6180000	6186000	I'm waiting for them to announce when she's going to be in Smash Brothers. That may be the guy from Wonderful 101.
6187000	6188000	Maybe.
6189000	6190000	The main character.
6190000	6197000	We'll see. But for now, by the way, Platinum Games, just on a side note, I don't know if you saw it announced this week, a Legend of Korra game.
6198000	6204000	And so some people are pretty excited about that, because, you know, Platinum Games is kind of putting out this certain caliber and type of game.
6205000	6206000	Yay, Legend of Shipping!
6207000	6215000	Well, it'll be interesting to see what Platinum brings to the table on that.
6216000	6217000	Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura.
6217000	6220000	Well, we do have some other stuff, actually.
6221000	6230000	For one thing, and this is something that was mentioned by Aonuma about the new Legend of Zelda Wii U game, about what the scale is.
6231000	6243000	Well, his comment was, think Kyoto, that he uses Kyoto as the basis for any type of game for planning out a location.
6244000	6251000	So, the actual quote is, in terms of the scale of the new Zelda world on Wii U, I always think of Kyoto as my base.
6252000	6255000	Do you know Kyoto? So, fairly decent size.
6256000	6261000	I mean, Kyoto was the capital of Japan ages and ages ago.
6262000	6263000	So, gotta be pretty big.
6264000	6268000	And then, Cookie Mama 5 is coming out, yay! Well, it's already been out in Japan.
6269000	6274000	But, Cookie Mama 5 Bon Appetit will be out for North America and Europe in September.
6275000	6284000	So, yay! Hawaiian pancakes and barbecue and pumpkin gratin and raisin bread and pork cutlet rice bowls and chicken nuggets.
6285000	6290000	But if it doesn't sell well, Mama can't fix bankruptcy. So, if you like these games, be sure to support it.
6290000	6292000	And be sure to tell PETA where to stick it.
6295000	6298000	Are they against Cookie Mama? Oh, that's right, they did that parody.
6299000	6300000	Yeah.
6301000	6302000	Those stupid butt heads.
6303000	6311000	Alright. Well, complete opposite of stupid butt heads, meaning like awesome sparkly faces, would be you guys, our listeners.
6312000	6313000	Worst transition ever.
6314000	6315000	He's calling you vampires.
6316000	6317000	Worst transition ever.
6318000	6319000	He's calling them fake vampires, that's even worse.
6320000	6321000	Google question of the week.
6322000	6323000	Glampires.
6324000	6327000	You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam it together, you get foogle.
6328000	6331000	And this week, as promised, about 12 years of history.
6332000	6337000	Our 12th birthday was this past Monday and tonight we are looking back at the past 12 years of not just OLR, but the gaming industry.
6338000	6340000	How do you think the gaming world of 2002 compares to today?
6341000	6344000	Surely, there have been technological advances, but what about the games themselves?
6345000	6346000	The way we enjoy and play them.
6346000	6347000	So, what do you guys think?
6348000	6349000	And I love some of these comments, so let's get to it.
6350000	6351000	Over on Facebook, Tech 2030 says,
6352000	6354000	Digital distribution is the biggest leap to me.
6355000	6358000	Independent devs are able to get their games out to so many more people these days.
6359000	6366000	And if it weren't for services like Steam and even PSN or XBL, I would have never heard of or played smaller games that probably wouldn't have gotten a physical release.
6367000	6368000	That's a really darn good point.
6369000	6372000	You know, indie games was like a PC only thing 12 years ago.
6373000	6375000	You didn't see indie games really on consoles.
6376000	6383000	I mean, you might see like smaller studios and stuff, but, you know, Loki could not have programmed a game for the Xbox by himself 12 years ago.
6384000	6386000	No, it would need a net euros instead.
6387000	6388000	Yes, very different time.
6389000	6394000	So yeah, digital distribution, I mean, and hell, with the Xbox One, that almost became like an exclusive thing.
6395000	6398000	Some of the, you know, things have gone a different way.
6399000	6400000	Critical Myth says,
6401000	6403000	The console marketplace in many ways is more fractured.
6403000	6406000	Nintendo's doing their own thing with hardware and handheld.
6407000	6409000	Xbox largely known for shooters, racing games, et cetera.
6410000	6412000	Sony focused more on JRPGs, et cetera.
6413000	6414000	Even control schemes are becoming more distinct.
6415000	6419000	I sometimes gripe about that, but it means fans of certain franchises or genres have clearer choices.
6420000	6422000	Not every console has to try to cover all the bases.
6423000	6428000	You know, to take that comment one step further, and I apologize, Critical Myth, that this isn't where you were really intending to go with it,
6428000	6433000	but it kind of makes me think about when you talk about the specialized in one console or another,
6434000	6437000	fanboyism seems to have changed a lot in 12 years.
6438000	6440000	I mean, I don't know. I mean, there was definitely, you had fanboys back in the day.
6441000	6444000	You had your very anti-Xbox people and your pro-Nintendo, just like we have today.
6445000	6455000	But I don't know, it seemed like 12 years ago, it was, you know, a lot of people owned like a GameCube and a PS2 or an Xbox and a GameCube or something like that.
6455000	6461000	Like it didn't, you know, nowadays it seems like people really tend to go for like one or the other and they really rally around that.
6462000	6463000	So, kind of interesting.
6464000	6473000	All right. Fifth dream, by the way, kind of with a comment in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com talking about indie games killed the NES, almost the industry.
6474000	6477000	Kaijuto saying most indie games are sold off the game's website.
6478000	6482000	Steam and the others are good, but indie games would still sell out without them and maybe make more money too.
6482000	6488000	There is that website, there is some website out there and I apologize guys, I forgot the name, but maybe a chatter remembers it.
6489000	6492000	But it was a website all about, these are indie games that are not on Steam.
6493000	6495000	It was like a, you know, a store for indie games not on Steam.
6496000	6498000	It was like, I think it was called like notonsteam.com or something.
6499000	6500000	It's not Desura?
6501000	6504000	No, no, that's another alternative. Somebody in chat knows, I know it.
6504000	6516000	Red the Haze says something amazing that I could not have imagined in 2002 when I was playing a full console game like Ratchet and Clank is that I would be able to play that exact same game on a handheld like the Vita 12 years later.
6517000	6528000	Back then, handhelds were very different experiences, but now the lines are blurred because of the technology and how we spend our gaming time, whether we want brief or long gaming sessions, wherever we might be.
6529000	6533000	That's a really good point, because like what, we were on the Game Boy Advance in 2002, right?
6534000	6538000	And that was like maybe Super Nintendo quality games in your palm of your hand.
6539000	6543000	Now you're getting like PS2, PS3 quality stuff on the Vita. Pretty crazy, right?
6544000	6546000	I think Tiger Claw linked notonsteam.com.
6547000	6549000	So that is it, notonsteam.com, there you go.
6550000	6560000	Stephen D. replies on Facebook and says, if you told me in 2002 that I could play Grand Theft Auto 3 on my phone in 2014, I would have been like, wow.
6561000	6566000	That's, you know, we didn't even really touch on that, but damn, the mobile markets changed significantly.
6567000	6576000	You know, in 2002, you know, podcasting wasn't even a thing yet because there was no iPhone because iPods were still kind of blooming.
6577000	6582000	I mean, they were out there, but they were still blooming. You know, that was not quite the must-have thing it is now.
6583000	6590000	Were all of us pissing ourselves at E3 for the cell phones they had out to demo that Final Fantasy 7 game, remember?
6591000	6592000	The taco, the N-Gage was a mobile phone.
6593000	6595000	Well, that's not what I was talking about. This was before the taco was out.
6596000	6598000	But whatever the game we play as the Turks.
6599000	6614000	Yeah, yeah. I remember even when I lived with Loki, I had this derpy little Sprint phone that was like this top-of-the-line phone, and it could play games, but it was like really derpy little Game Boy color style games.
6615000	6616000	Like, not even that good.
6617000	6618000	Snake. It's all about snakes.
6619000	6625000	I had Snake on my Nokia, and then I remembered when I finally got to play Bejeweled on my flip phone.
6626000	6629000	Renee A. replies on Facebook and says,
6630000	6641000	By leaps and bounds, we've seen how far portable gaming has progressed, both with dedicated consoles and mobile phone apps and games, but also the inevitable return of the console wars between Sony and Microsoft.
6642000	6643000	Degenerate Johnny says,
6644000	6654000	Gaming genres seem to be combining themselves. VR is bringing the action to your face. The console wars are getting more vicious, but like 2002, they still won't faze the PC master race.
6654000	6657000	Happy 12th anniversary, O.L.R.
6658000	6661000	So I suppose for some people, some things have stayed the same, right?
6662000	6664000	Yeah, like Half Life 3 not being out yet.
6667000	6673000	Who knew that in 2002, Duke Nukem Forever really would come out someday, and it would be awful.
6674000	6677000	Well actually everybody thought it was coming out soon, right?
6678000	6679000	S2100Matt says,
6680000	6692000	My biggest innovation in gaming over the years was the enhancements in online gaming. While it existed long, long before 2002, but since then, gaming with people around the world has been more accessible and unbelievably innovative.
6693000	6697000	Between MMOs and co-op gameplay, online gaming has made big jumps over the years.
6697000	6709000	Ain't that the truth? I mean, MUDs existed well before even 2002, you know, BBS door games and things like that, but like the full graphical MMO, Ultima Online was what? 2001? No, actually it was probably before that.
6710000	6711000	Yeah, I was playing Ragnarok online.
6712000	6713000	Yeah, so it was probably a little bit before that.
6714000	6720000	Yeah, because Ultima was on, I was still in high school, so it was in the 90s actually.
6720000	6732000	Yeah, but like, you know, probably EverQuest was around 2001, 2002 was probably when that was still the king bee, because WoW didn't, WoW is turning 10 this year, so WoW wasn't out until 2004.
6733000	6736000	Sure, EverQuest wasn't earlier than that?
6737000	6744000	Oh, EverQuest was earlier, but EverQuest was king of MMOs in 2002. Either that or Ultima Online was probably close between the two, but I think it was EverQuest around that time.
6745000	6761000	So, you know, but even EverQuest didn't quite penetrate the marketplace the way that World of Warcraft did. I mean, EverQuest was a really niche thing. I mean, World of Warcraft is kind of a niche thing, but EverQuest was still a niche thing, but it was a way bigger niche than like MUDs, which were the predecessor in a way.
6761000	6777000	So, alright, let's see, let's go over to Google+, and check out some of the answers there on our Google Plus page, because of course you can follow us on Google, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, and we do have three comments over there.
6778000	6784000	So I'll start with ActDeft saying, I think the biggest change in video games so far is how mainstream they've become.
6785000	6800000	That was a very short answer, but, you know, I think he has a point. Video gaming is more and more mainstream. I mean, when you go back 12 years, you know, a lot of people that grew up on video games are now in their 20s and 30s and so far.
6801000	6820000	I mean, not that there aren't people in their 40s, 50s, and beyond who also grew up with video games, but as, you know, people kind of were surrounded with that as they were a kid, and they get older and introduce it to their kids, and it's just become more and more a part of our lives, I definitely see where that, you know, comes into, that is appropriate that video games is so much more mainstream.
6821000	6826000	And then of course you look at things like the Wii that, you know, really even pushed that mainstream even further, so.
6827000	6841000	All right. Redertainment says, 2002, man, I can hardly remember that year what tech was in it. My 2002 was spent trying to get my first job out of high school. Insert additional comment here that makes Rob feel old. Smooches.
6841000	6857000	And Ronnie B says, I think in 2002 it was a happier time in most gaming communities, especially the online experience. Xbox Live was brand new. I feel like the people who actually appreciated the technology had it, so this made Xbox Live more fun to play.
6858000	6870000	I don't recall much derogatory vocabulary or campers, just a lot of fun and actual teamwork. That's a very interesting thought, that when these things were harder to get into, there were far less trolls.
6871000	6880000	Because everybody had to work to get there. Very interesting perspective on there. I love these answers, you guys. That was a great question. So I read them all, so thanks you guys for responding.
6881000	6892000	You can participate in a future week by following us on Facebook or on Google Plus. I think we kind of touched on this ourselves a little bit ago. I don't know if you guys have anything you want to add to that. If not, we'll go ahead and move on. Loki.
6892000	6906000	Alright. Well, there's some rumors coming out of Crytek UK, apparently issues with employees not being paid and cuts at the studio level and stuff like that.
6907000	6923000	Apparently, I want to say it was Kotaku that had gotten a report of some of these employees that were anonymously reporting that they had not been paid or been paid partially over the course of the last few months.
6924000	6940000	And also that they were, I guess, having some cancellations of different titles, including, apparently, the rumored cancellation of the sequel to Rise, which is interesting.
6941000	6961000	Now, of course, Crytek is claiming this is not true. There's an interview, I guess, with a German magazine, GameStar, and they're saying regardless of media reporting, mostly based on recent article published by GameStar, the information in those reports and GameStar article are itself rumors and Crytek denies these.
6962000	6975000	We continue to focus on developing and publishing our upcoming titles, Homefront Revolution, The Hunt, The Hoards, Guild Age, Arena of Fate, and Warface, as well as providing ongoing support for CryEngine and its licensees.
6976000	6990000	So it's kind of like their PR department saying one thing, apparently the employees saying another thing, so it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out, if it's indeed something like this is going to happen, or is happening.
6991000	7002000	Almost seems like kind of what we heard right before THQ closed, but I don't know. That's hard to say, because it's all secondhand stuff right now.
7003000	7008000	So we don't have a definitive answer, but unfortunately, all signs are not looking very good, right?
7009000	7027000	Basically, they're saying there's a high turnover due to the staff being paid late numerous times, and they said the list of people who's left include key art, design, programming employees, and other employees in there.
7027000	7043000	But I don't know. It always sucks when you hear this kind of stuff, with publishers and developers not paying their employees in time and stuff, and I know that they run into financial trouble, but I thought Crytek was doing okay.
7044000	7057000	I thought so too, despite the fact that, I mean, and I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm kicking someone while they're down, but it's just the reality. Rise was not really all that, to put it lightly. Not a great reception to that game.
7058000	7073000	So, I mean, unfortunately, if there was a lot of money poured into that, which I think there was, because that started as a 360 game at one point, right? And it was retooled for the one. Not too good when a game like that doesn't perform to expectations, right?
7074000	7086000	Well, yeah, and remember, that was one of those games that was gonna be, okay, here's why you need to own a Kinect, and then they kind of made it that as a whole, oh, well, you can play it that way if you want, but you can also play the controller.
7087000	7112000	It's sad, because if that had worked out, you know, that would have been a great example of why you need to own this Kinect, because look at this game, look how immersive it is, and now it's just kind of like, well, we couldn't really make it as immersive as we wanted to, so it just speaks to the level of power that that peripheral has. It's just, I don't know, I think they're promising too much rather than what they can actually deliver.
7112000	7119000	All right, well, moving on to some exciting updates that are coming to the Xbox One pretty soon. I'm trying to get to some good news.
7120000	7127000	Some things that are coming to the Xbox One are changes to Xbox.com that will help support that Xbox One experience.
7128000	7138000	Starting in the next week, you're gonna be able to use Xbox.com to check the data from the One, like player activity, achievements, and gameplay clips, which will be interesting.
7138000	7146000	So maybe you're not near your Xbox One, but, you know, somebody you know did something really awesome in a game, you could watch that clip through Xbox.com.
7147000	7156000	I'm assuming that would extend to your mobile phone, but maybe, maybe not, I don't know, maybe it'd have to be on a computer at, you know, your work or something, even though it's probably blocked.
7157000	7167000	But whether you're on your own profile or if you're on a friend's profile, you can go through that profile, you can look at clips on the profile, or you can look at a user's entire library of the clips.
7168000	7177000	Achievements are similar to that. You can go down and look at a game's specific achievements and see, you know, what the achievement's artwork looks like and drill down to that level.
7178000	7186000	The 360 would already kind of tell you, like, you know, you can compare what you have versus what a friend has, so none of that is really new, but it'll just kind of enhance that a little bit there.
7187000	7196000	They are saying, at least Major Nelson is saying, that this is an update that is, quote, the beginning of a number of community-requested features on Xbox.com.
7197000	7215000	So this is, this is what, supposedly, the users have demanded. So, there it is. So, yeah, coming very soon, and so I don't know if a lot of you guys use Xbox One as well as, or excuse me, use Xbox.com in tandem with your One, but there you go.
7216000	7225000	Pretty cool. It's kind of like Miiverse coming to the web, and now I can link some of the Miiverse art that I see on my Twitter, so that's kind of nice when you have that extension.
7226000	7228000	All right, moving on. DarkSakura.
7229000	7245000	Well, we're all a big fan of the Humble bundles and their sales and whatnot. Well, at this point, they have now earned more than, the Humble store, that is, has earned more than a million dollars for charitable proceeds as of this past week.
7246000	7257000	So that's discounts on PC games, 10% of the sales are always going to American Red Cross, Child's Play, the Worldland Trust, and a few other charities.
7258000	7267000	They've done more than 500 games since the launch of November, and they are working on a compilation meant to benefit a few other charities.
7267000	7275000	Oh, Doctors Without Borders, my apologies. And it's going to be going on during the Summer Games Done Quick charity, so check it out.
7276000	7293000	All right. Kudos to gamers for donating to these charity efforts, game companies for having their games be a part of it, and how the Humble bundles kind of grown really quickly in the past couple of years from what seemed like it was just going to be a one-time or occasional charity event into this ongoing thing.
7293000	7297000	Also, Kudos are delicious, but I don't know if they make them anymore.
7298000	7299000	I haven't seen a Kudos bar in years.
7300000	7301000	Those are great.
7302000	7303000	All right, Logie.
7304000	7313000	So Mario Kart 8 is continuing to sell extremely well. They have now sold approximately 2 million copies worldwide in less than a month of its release.
7313000	7323000	And apparently, according to Nintendo, that the system sales as a result of it had quadrupled the following week of its release.
7324000	7333000	And apparently they will have an official number later on after their quarterly financial results, which are supposed to be happening on July 30th.
7334000	7336000	So we'll hear about even more sales, I'm sure, on that title.
7336000	7346000	It probably helps that they had a bundle with the game in there for a really decent price, and there was also a free game given away with Mario Kart 8 as well.
7347000	7350000	So that kind of helped, and hopefully we'll see some more of that in the future.
7351000	7359000	Also, they have re-elected company president Satoru Iwata. So that's pretty sweet.
7360000	7366000	Yeah, didn't news come out this week that he had actually had surgery during E3? So it wasn't just that the doctors told him to stay behind.
7367000	7374000	The doctors told him to stay behind for surgery, which I believe was his bile duct, was what he was having surgery on, was that something was trapped in there.
7375000	7379000	Which, by the way, guys, that's very similar to some of the circumstances that I had in 2008 when I was really sick.
7380000	7384000	Because I had gallstones in there, and that's no joke. That stuff can make you really sick.
7384000	7397000	I didn't have surgery, but, well, I did end up having surgery to get my gallbladder out, so that stuff is no fun. So good luck to Mr. Iwata as he recovers with that.
7398000	7407000	Yeah, and of course, he wasn't actually able to attend their AGM since he's recovering from surgery.
7408000	7416000	Sure. Well, that's cool that they re-elected him, obviously, in spite of all that. And in spite of, more importantly, the Nintendo...
7417000	7423000	Well, nothing's more important than the health, but, you know, I think it would be very cruel to oust somebody over health issues.
7424000	7435000	But weighing into that, the performance of Nintendo. And, you know, not everybody's been very rah rah rah, especially in the investor world, about Nintendo's performance.
7435000	7441000	So it's interesting that they are still letting Iwata kind of continue despite the performance of the Wii U.
7442000	7452000	I think they're gonna need another year once Zelda comes out. If that doesn't... I mean, I'm sure that will sell systems, but if that doesn't sell enough systems, then I gotta wonder what they can do.
7452000	7465000	Well, you know, the news did come out. Mario Kart 8 has already broke 2 million copies. So, which, you know, some websites, using their very complicated formulas and ratios, predicted that it would only...
7466000	7473000	It would never break 2 million. It would only sell... They have these little graphs that show you exactly how much it's gonna sell, and it was only gonna sell 1.6 million in a lifetime.
7474000	7478000	But who would've thought? Those guys are proven wrong. In a month, 2 million copies sold.
7478000	7489000	That's why I never try to guess how many copies of something is gonna sell. Unless, unless it's the Eye of Judgment, which, I mean, come on. No one is gonna buy that piece of shit.
7490000	7501000	That is some absolute... That, that was, you know, going back to the 12 years of doing this show, that was something at E3, when they were showing us that demo, and I was just like, this doesn't... I don't get this.
7501000	7518000	What? Why are you... Why are we using the camera like this? Why? This is really stupid. You know, couldn't you just play, you know, a board game or a card game? Why do we need this to visualize on the screen exactly what we're doing? It makes no fucking sense. And sure enough, it sold like shit.
7518000	7535000	In some ways, don't, don't go too crazy on me with this comment, but in some ways, I think it might've just been ahead of its time. Like, you know, now the cameras are much more, like, you know, we all have cameras now sitting on our gaming devices, with the Kinect, with the PlayStation camera, you know, now it's more common.
7536000	7537000	Big Brother is watching.
7537000	7555000	That's right. It's not that at all. It's just, it's stupid. It's, it's basically an accessory to a board game. Now, if those cards had some sort of RFID chips, and you can collect them to collect your figures and level your figures up, they could've been onto something, but no, it was, it was something more ridiculous.
7556000	7557000	This could be double plus ungood.
7558000	7575000	Well, even though folks may not have played the Eye of Judgment, I think everybody should check out Catlateral Damage, and I think a lot of people will check this out. Catlateral Damage, of course, started as this project in a game jam that kind of went viral a little bit, and now lots of people are like,
7575000	7584000	hell yeah, I want to play this game where I'm just a cat that just, you just basically get to be asshole cat. It's asshole cat the game. You are just that asshole cat that knocks everything over.
7585000	7598000	And, of course, that's right. Fuck this shit cat game. Absolutely. So, obviously, this game had no problem meeting its funding goal of $40,000. Now it's trying to create its stretch goals.
7599000	7607000	They're trying to do stretch goals over these last few days, including extra levels, a PlayStation 4 version, and support for the Steam Workshop.
7608000	7619000	This game is also participating in Ouya's Free the Game funds, so his financial support will double, meaning the game will also come to Ouya, inevitably, at some point.
7620000	7624000	So, there you go, and a lot of people looking forward to playing Asshole the Cat.
7624000	7629000	Yeah, let's go play the alpha. It's free, and it's on the Kickstarter page.
7630000	7631000	Alright. That's fun.
7632000	7638000	Well, I don't know if we have any asshole cats that email us, because I don't think they have access to keyboards, but I guess you never know.
7639000	7649000	I like that their tiers are labeled, like $40 or more is the gamer cat. It includes the hipster cat tier, and you get Goat Simulator and Octodad with it.
7649000	7658000	And then $50 is the early little cat. I'm just laughing at the tiers. There's Lil Dog. That's one of them.
7659000	7664000	Alright, well we're going to get to some listeners and their cats who may or may not have emailed us this week.
7665000	7674000	Participate at Orangelauntrader.com is the place to send us an email, and every week you guys send us emails, and DarkSakura, out of the goodness of her heart, reads them on air.
7674000	7680000	Mm-hmm. Hello, O.L.R. I wanted to answer the email from Dr. Noir last week.
7681000	7693000	Oh, just to get background on this, DarkSakura, since you were here last week, we got an email from Dr. Noir who was talking about how he was on a trip in Belgium and didn't really see gaming presence like he sees in other places.
7694000	7703000	Like no billboards, or he didn't even really see a lot of game stores or anything like that. So I'm going to assume this is probably somebody in Belgium who's going to tell us how it really is.
7704000	7705000	You're not assuming, Rob.
7734000	7741000	Get regular updates. The kiosks in Belgium never get any updates, and the same launch game demos remain in them until the kiosks break down.
7742000	7747000	They are then removed, never replaced. Every now and then there are people demonstrating new games never in Belgium.
7748000	7752000	I'm going to have a shirt that says never in Belgium on it with a big video game cartridge.
7753000	7764000	And congratulations on your 12th birthday, O.L.R. I've been listening ever since the PSP had the podcast update, probably five years or more now. Never been bored, although there was always a lack of Rob floods.
7765000	7775000	No. That is not encouraging you to start one. How long, when was the last time you updated O.L.R. PSP.com, which by the way no longer works, sorry.
7776000	7777000	I don't remember.
7778000	7779000	I think it was more than five years ago.
7779000	7780000	It was a long time ago.
7781000	7784000	That radio app thing there, I modified the radio app thing.
7785000	7791000	I gotta say though, that was a smart thing for this show. I think that brought a lot of people to this show. It was a smart project, so good on you for that.
7792000	7796000	Unfortunately now everything works really well with the internet, so it's like, eh, I don't need to do that.
7797000	7798000	It's not the novelty it used to be. Anyway.
7799000	7806000	As always, thanks a lot for making the podcast almost every single week. I really look forward to a new episode every week. You guys brighten up my Mondays.
7806000	7815000	Are there still plans for an international show? I've listened a few times at night getting up at 3am, but that's kind of a crappy hour to call into the show since everyone is sleeping.
7816000	7817000	Oh my gosh.
7818000	7822000	You're truly Fabrice from Belgium. P.S. maybe we should start an O.L.R. con with all two Belgian listeners.
7823000	7826000	You should get together and have some waffles.
7827000	7832000	No, you should get together and send dark chocolate to dark sakura. Because Belgian chocolate is the best.
7833000	7841000	Thank you very much for the email. And it's interesting to hear that maybe the situation isn't as dire, but that there is definitely some notable differences.
7842000	7846000	I did not realize he lived in such close proximity to France, so he can really kind of see the two sides of it.
7847000	7849000	Belgium is in close proximity to everything around it.
7850000	7854000	I guess that's a good point. But two kilometers? That's nothing.
7855000	7862000	Is Belgium the one that has the international border that's like a coffee shop with one country? I don't think it's France.
7863000	7864000	So that was Netherlands and...
7865000	7867000	Yeah, it was like a coffee shop where it's like, here's the border.
7868000	7870000	Meanwhile, we have like a wall with barbed wire and everything.
7871000	7875000	Exactly. Even with Canada, it's not exactly an open...
7876000	7880000	You know, I haven't noticed any time where we've ever had anyone complain about Canadian immigrants.
7881000	7882000	Hmm.
7883000	7884000	Never mind.
7885000	7886000	Because they're so polite.
7887000	7890000	I thought you said it's because they're all white, and I was like, yeah, probably.
7891000	7892000	Why?
7893000	7897000	Because stupid, you know, racism, especially along that part of the country. So, whatever.
7898000	7900000	Just, bleh.
7901000	7904000	Let's think about Belgium. Let's think about our happy country.
7905000	7906000	Alright.
7906000	7909000	Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood, serious turtle.
7910000	7911000	This one's to me.
7912000	7913000	Jamie, I really enjoyed To The Moon.
7914000	7918000	At first the humor was a little too corny, but I quickly started enjoying it and was cracking up with the end.
7919000	7920000	By the end.
7921000	7922000	I love the story and how the game makers did so much with so little.
7923000	7924000	Because, yeah, that was done in RPG Maker.
7925000	7930000	Rob, since you and I agree on the fact that Super Metroid is the greatest game ever,
7931000	7935000	I thought you should know that I'm currently playing Guacamelee that I finished during the Steam sale.
7936000	7939000	Did you ever finish it? What did you think about it in the end?
7940000	7944000	And what games would you recommend that are similar to Super Metroid, playable on the PC Master Race?
7945000	7948000	Loki, hi. You're serious turtle and Philly's serious turtle.
7949000	7950000	Loki, hi.
7951000	7957000	There was another game that was very similar to Super Metroid that was, actually it was,
7958000	7962000	they had a story not too long ago, it was on Destructoid, where they had an interview with,
7962000	7968000	or they had, I guess, Reggie there, and he actually went to the booth that had it during E3, the indie booth.
7969000	7971000	And he saw it and he's like, that looks like Super Metroid.
7972000	7975000	So there was a game, and that was actually on Kickstarter, I don't remember the name of it though,
7976000	7982000	but it's, there's a lot of indie games especially that were on Kickstarter that looked like, you know, a Metroidvania type game.
7983000	7990000	Um, uh, yeah, I honestly can't think of anything that really just screams on PC,
7991000	7994000	that really screams Super Metroid besides Guacamelee, I mean that's why it keeps coming to my mind.
7995000	8001000	I'm gonna be honest, I did not finish it, but I'm holding off for the PlayStation 4 release that's coming like this week, I'm very excited.
8002000	8010000	If you haven't played it yet, and it's pretty old by now, but it's not exactly like it, but Cave Story is really good.
8010000	8016000	Oh yeah, Cave Story is a good one, that is. I also keep thinking of stuff on like, I guess Strider, the new Strider,
8017000	8022000	it's got a very Metroidvania element to it, and I know that just came out not that long ago on PC,
8023000	8026000	and it's on like PlayStation 4 and all the consoles as well, that's definitely worth checking out.
8027000	8029000	Agadeft mentions Dust and Elysian Tail.
8030000	8032000	I haven't checked that one out yet, although it's in my library, so.
8033000	8035000	Yeah, it's one of collecting virtual dust.
8036000	8039000	Yes, the Steam Plague, you all know what I'm talking about.
8040000	8044000	So, also you should check out a game called Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
8045000	8047000	It's a great Super Metroid-type game.
8049000	8054000	But yeah, I'll finish Guacamelee on PlayStation 4 when that Super Turbo Edition comes out.
8055000	8057000	Great soundtrack, fantastic soundtrack.
8058000	8061000	And lots of funny, lots of internet meme references, I love that game.
8062000	8064000	Darcygar, if you haven't checked out Guacamelee, you must at some point.
8065000	8068000	I like guacamole. Maybe I'll get a burrito on the way home.
8068000	8069000	Yum.
8070000	8072000	Cave Story's pretty good, Dan actually got into Cave Story for a little while.
8075000	8077000	So how about another email?
8078000	8079000	How about it?
8080000	8082000	Making me speak Dutch, really dude? Okay.
8083000	8087000	Gode van Damassen Herren van Uller. I hope I said that right.
8088000	8092000	I want you to practice your Dutch since I am from the north of Belgium and since some of you claim to have Dutch heritage.
8093000	8097000	Okay, that would be Rob. I just married a person with Dutch heritage, okay?
8098000	8102000	Just because I have Dutch heritage doesn't mean I've ever even visited there, unfortunately.
8103000	8106000	You know what Dan's grandfather says? If you ain't Dutch, you ain't much.
8108000	8112000	I have a picture of Dan holding up a picture of cheese that's got Van Gogh on it.
8113000	8115000	And it's called A Dutch Masterpiece.
8116000	8123000	I am Belgian, currently living in Brussels, so I wanted to answer our dear friend Dr. Noir on his questions in gaming in Belgium from last week's show.
8124000	8125000	Wait, wait, we heard from two!
8126000	8127000	Both of them!
8128000	8131000	Both of our Belgian fans.
8132000	8134000	Well done responding to the call.
8135000	8136000	All two of them.
8137000	8139000	I think we're going to cut a gold star in half and have them share it.
8140000	8144000	I would like to have five Belgian listeners so we can each give them a point.
8145000	8147000	And then we'll eat the center.
8150000	8155000	First of all, he seems to have discovered the country was devoid of video games.
8155000	8159000	First of all, Dr. Noir mentioned sticking to the museums and business districts in Brussels.
8160000	8162000	Obviously, you won't find any gaming shops here.
8163000	8167000	Neither would you in the touristic areas in Paris, Amsterdam, etc.
8168000	8170000	There are only a handful of shops that sell games in Belgium.
8171000	8174000	All the other ones went out of business together with CD stores and movie rental places.
8175000	8177000	There's a dedicated chain of stores called GameMania.
8178000	8180000	They sell nothing but games, mostly console games.
8181000	8182000	Their stores are usually on the outskirts of towns and cities.
8182000	8190000	In the cities you can find big chain stores such as FNAK, a French company a crossover between Best Buy and Barnes and Noble.
8191000	8197000	And Media Market, a German company similar to Best Buy.
8198000	8203000	I've lived in Germany and Spain as well and I can tell you the retail market for games is similar all over Europe.
8204000	8207000	Limited to a handful of the same big stores that sell all types of media and electronics.
8207000	8212000	So don't we all buy our games on Steam nowadays anyway? Who needs stores?
8213000	8217000	When it comes to advertising for games, this is still something of a novelty here.
8218000	8220000	I remember seeing posters from Max Payne 3 in Germany once.
8221000	8224000	And you will see an occasional trailer on TV or in a movie theater, but that's it.
8225000	8228000	I can't confirm people of all ages and ethnicities game in Brussels.
8229000	8234000	For example, I bought, no I can confirm people of all ages and ethnicities game in Brussels.
8234000	8239000	For example, I bought my PS3 secondhand from an 8 year old Latin American kid in Brussels.
8240000	8241000	It's a very diverse place.
8242000	8245000	This concludes our report on gaming in Belgium.
8246000	8250000	It appears in fact people here can occasionally put down their waffles and beers long enough to hold a controller.
8251000	8253000	But why should they?
8254000	8259000	This has been Martin live from Belgium for Orange Lounge Radio back to the studio.
8260000	8263000	Okay, Martin is officially our Belgian correspondent.
8264000	8266000	Don't shaft the other guy.
8267000	8270000	The other one is officially our Belgian fan club president.
8271000	8274000	Okay. Giving them two distinct roles to share.
8275000	8276000	Yes.
8277000	8280000	I want to know if we have other people in Belgium who are listening. That's pretty awesome.
8281000	8283000	I'm putting the call out for Belgian emails.
8284000	8287000	Teach me something in Dutch every week.
8289000	8292000	Which is really awful because I'm still studying for the JLPT.
8292000	8295000	Speaking of correspondence, Extafur is on a plane.
8296000	8299000	Extafur from Hoard House, my buddy from Hoard House. He's been on this show a handful of times.
8300000	8303000	He is on a plane right now on his way to the UK.
8304000	8306000	Leaving on a jet plane.
8307000	8309000	That little jerk. He is meeting Sil in person.
8310000	8311000	I love Sil.
8312000	8316000	I know, I'm so fucking jealous that I can see red.
8317000	8319000	I'm going to ask Sil to be my girlfriend.
8320000	8321000	Is Dan okay with that?
8322000	8323000	I don't care.
8324000	8326000	He's a man, yes.
8329000	8332000	This is my cute European girlfriend.
8333000	8334000	I don't know.
8335000	8336000	There you go.
8337000	8338000	She can be my pretend girlfriend.
8339000	8341000	Sil, be my official fake girlfriend.
8342000	8343000	Please.
8344000	8347000	Wow, we just had a proposal live on air here at OLR.
8347000	8348000	That's no OLR first.
8349000	8350000	Check yes or no.
8351000	8353000	I'll play mash with her.
8354000	8356000	Will you pretend to go out with me?
8359000	8360000	Check one.
8361000	8363000	We can go to Belgium together.
8365000	8366000	Can I do the next email?
8367000	8369000	Are you guys going to elope to Belgium? That's how this ends.
8370000	8375000	No, we're going to elope to Aruba.
8375000	8377000	Where they speak like eleven languages.
8378000	8380000	Which is a Dutch country.
8381000	8385000	And they have their own special language that's like a weird combination of seven languages.
8386000	8387000	Because I read it last on the internet.
8388000	8392000	Next email. I've been to Aruba. I was seven years old and I don't remember much, but I've been there.
8393000	8394000	Aruba, Jamaica.
8395000	8400000	Hey, OLR peeps. Your friendly neighborhood South African again got all over the world.
8400000	8405000	First of all, I'd like to wish you all for the many years of broadcasting. Congrats.
8406000	8411000	And secondly, not everything happens in Johannesburg, Rob. Just most things.
8412000	8418000	I actually stay in Durban on the east coast right on the beachfront. Not that I ever actually go there. The sun is a monster.
8419000	8423000	Anyway, I was wondering what internet speeds you guys are all running so I can be all jelly about it.
8423000	8430000	You see, down here in South Africa our max line speed is only ten megabytes and I myself only have a one megabyte line.
8431000	8435000	Then for a more fun question, if you could have any superpower what would it be and why?
8436000	8437000	Thanks again for all your hard work, Screeze.
8438000	8440000	I think we have a twenty-two.
8444000	8450000	I have no idea. I'm almost afraid to run a test while the show is in progress. It might knock us offline.
8450000	8457000	But I'm running one on my mobile right now. I'm going to run on my mobile phone to tell you what it is because it's going to piss this guy off.
8458000	8466000	Well, my friend Tarali who I sent a copy of her stolen fan art to off of a Russian magazine.
8467000	8477000	She was telling me just the other day online because we chat every morning for her and morning for me about what it's like in Australia versus what it's like here.
8477000	8487000	She says that in Australia they are still using copper phone wires and have no fiber optic or any of that and get very, very low speeds.
8488000	8493000	Alright, for our listener in Not Johannesburg, tonight is like international night at Orange Laundraido.
8494000	8497000	Actually, I got to tell you this since we're talking about anniversaries and things.
8497000	8509000	I do love that this show has an international, and I feel like we've succeeded in having a show that works internationally.
8510000	8522000	Because I think in some of the podcasts I've listened to out there and so forth, not to knock other people, but I do feel like sometimes there's too much of a focus on one place when podcasting is a worldwide thing.
8522000	8531000	So I take it as a huge compliment and I'm thankful that we have listeners in all these countries and all these places who actually give a damn enough to email us.
8532000	8533000	So thank you very much.
8534000	8545000	Now to make this guy feel bad, since he asked, here you go. I ran a speed test on my iPhone 5, which keep in mind is wireless right now and runs through the wireless network while the show is broadcasting.
8546000	8557000	Paying 36 milliseconds, download 16.41 megabits, upload 11.53 megabits. And what did he say he had? He had a one down?
8558000	8559000	Yeah, a one.
8560000	8561000	So 16 times as fast.
8562000	8564000	Well hopefully he pays much less than we do for...
8565000	8566000	Hopefully. I don't know though.
8567000	8568000	Well, and mine at home...
8569000	8570000	If he lives out by the beach...
8570000	8581000	My home, when it works because Comcast, lol, is like 22 to 25, something like that. And that's with Dan Sim racing and me doing all my stuff.
8582000	8584000	Yeah. Again, I would run it on the computer, but we are trying to do a show.
8585000	8597000	Well, I'm just saying I updated my entire Adobe suite because now that I'm finally paying for it, hooray student discount, I downloaded the entire Creative Cloud suite in like less than an hour.
8597000	8606000	Well, next time I sit here and complain about my internet being out or being too slow, I will remember, you know, kids in South Africa have no fast internet.
8607000	8613000	So actually I have a question because I was reading about languages and about multilingual countries.
8614000	8629000	I know that English is probably one of the more commonly used languages in South Africa, but I was reading about some of the other commonly used ones like Afrikaans is basically coastal, I believe.
8629000	8639000	But I'd like to know what languages that you are fluent in being in South Africa, what you hear used most in your region, because I have an interest in these kinds of things.
8640000	8641000	All right.
8642000	8645000	Also, the other question was if you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?
8646000	8647000	I feel like we got asked this before a couple of months ago.
8648000	8650000	No, last week we got asked what crime we could commit.
8651000	8656000	Oh, all right. Superpower. I would like to be able to heal sick people.
8656000	8675000	I know. That or be invisible. Hard to tell. It depends what side of me is answering the question. Do you get Halo Rob or Horns Rob? Uh-oh. Here comes Alan with his own answer to the question for me, I'm sure.
8676000	8678000	Hello. Do you want to heal sick people?
8678000	8679000	Yeah.
8680000	8692000	So, they have cancer. What's your favorite Super NES game? Super Metroid or Chrono Trigger? Chrono Trigger. Oh, I'm so sorry. That's so horrible to hear.
8693000	8695000	Stop. You are not funny. Get out.
8696000	8697000	I thought that was adorable, Alan.
8700000	8702000	Alan, how's Final Fantasy XIV going for you today?
8703000	8704000	Oh, shut up.
8705000	8710000	I just got him revved up. Wait, can you come here a second so I can tease you on air, please? Please?
8711000	8712000	Shall we leave the room so you can have some private time?
8713000	8717000	So, Alan got banned from Final Fantasy XIV. Not really. What happened, Alan?
8718000	8728000	My security software smartphone token app mysteriously reset or I was probably handling the phone when I was half asleep and did something to it.
8728000	8744000	But yeah, I can't generate the one-time password like in a WoW authenticator and they don't have support open on weekends and I had written down or saved every other number associated with my account but the emergency security token removal password.
8745000	8756000	Which you have to log in to get and you're supposed to save it like in a text file and I can't log in to see it without that. So, I was dumb. And I locked myself out of the game.
8756000	8764000	So, now because Square Enix support is closed today, Alan is forced to play his backlog of Steam games that he bought during the Steam sale. You poor thing.
8765000	8774000	Yes, I bought even more Steam summer sale games than I've actually been forced to install and play some of them. What's up with that? Games are Pokemon. You just collect them. You don't play them.
8777000	8780000	Can you try to breed them so we stop spending so much money on them?
8781000	8782000	Sure.
8783000	8785000	Can you sell Pokemon because you can't sell Steam games?
8786000	8790000	I could breed this Portal 2 with this Half-Life 2 and maybe I'll get a Half-Life 3 out of it.
8791000	8801000	If you're Shane, you breed like 500 Oshawottes in your quest to get a shiny and then you talk about, I asked him, I said, well what happens to the Oshawottes that don't become shinies? And he says, they turn into coats.
8802000	8812000	But, see, I think it's more the Steam collectible card thing is, you know, like Pokemon versus, you know, actual game buying.
8812000	8817000	Can I ask you about dinner since I've already threadjacked your entire show?
8818000	8819000	Sure, why not?
8820000	8823000	I can make tortellini and then mix in penny pasta or is that just too carby and pasta for you?
8824000	8826000	Nothing is too carby and pasta for me.
8827000	8828000	That'll be filling enough for you?
8829000	8830000	Sure. I'll get to work.
8831000	8833000	Thanks, honey. You're the best.
8834000	8835000	Ellen is a good house husband.
8836000	8837000	I don't know what the word too carby means.
8838000	8840000	I know. It's not in my dictionary. Not at all.
8840000	8843000	Alright, where were we? Superhero powers. I said mine. What about you guys?
8844000	8845000	Um, portal powers.
8846000	8848000	Oh, okay. You just want a portal gun.
8849000	8853000	Yeah, and the lungful boots, and the lungful boots. Except, I don't know, I get super motion sick.
8854000	8856000	So maybe also add in the bonus drama meme power.
8857000	8858000	Uh, Loki?
8859000	8861000	I don't know. The power to commit crime.
8861000	8874000	I can't think of any serious answers. The other one I liked was Don Cheadle's version of Captain Planet. Human tree! Human tree! Human tree!
8875000	8879000	Oh, oh, oh, oh. I thought of this one. The psychic bitch slap.
8880000	8884000	Where you just have to think and they'll get bitch slapped. They're like, ow!
8884000	8894000	They had a great Reddit thread that was this week where they were talking about, like, if you had the power of telekinesis but you could only use it to be a jerk to people, how would you do that?
8895000	8904000	And so they had some really good ones. Like, you know, oh yeah, I'd move the straw out of the way whenever someone was trying to sip their soda or something like that.
8905000	8911000	Or like, I would follow someone around and make them think that they had telekinetic powers until they became famous and then leave.
8911000	8921000	And then, uh, there's some other funny ones in there. But, uh, yeah, I think it'd be fun just to mess with people. And money.
8922000	8925000	Alright, I think we've given a fair answer to this guy's question.
8926000	8927000	The ability to fire money from my hands.
8928000	8929000	How about the next email?
8930000	8931000	Yes, next email.
8932000	8933000	Loki's living out in his money pool.
8933000	8942000	Dear Peoples, I saw this story just now and I was struck with a series of questions that someone more aware of the history and current status of the politics in this area is more adept at answering.
8943000	8952000	And the thing was, Oakland was moving to, uh, says Oakland moves to flip decades old pinball ban and work on you gambling laws.
8953000	8957000	Uh, basically I think it was Alameda County had, uh...
8958000	8962000	Which is funny because I think they had a pinball museum there anywhere. They have a pinball museum there anyway. It just doesn't take quarters.
8963000	8964000	You pay to get in.
8965000	8976000	There's a line in the article, pinball machines continue to be illegal in Alameda, but the Pacific Pinball Museum, which features over 90 classic machines for the public, registered as a non-profit, removes the coin slots to comply with the law.
8977000	8982000	It is really interesting to see because something very similar happened in San Francisco recently.
8982000	8996000	Um, they're trying to put an arcade in the Castro, actually, of all places, and it was limited on the number of machines they could have because of some old-ass law that dates back to arcades being equated with gambling machines so they couldn't have all the machines.
8997000	9007000	But they, they, they got around it at the end of the day, so they're gonna have this bar-cade type of thing in the Castro in San Francisco, which, you know, the gay nerd in me is like super excited for, actually.
9008000	9009000	So, yay!
9009000	9023000	Um, but, uh, yeah, as far as the pinball thing goes, I think, I think it's, I'm, I'm glad these old laws are being challenged, and you know what? Sometimes laws have to change as, you know, new technologies and new things come up.
9024000	9028000	Maybe patent law will be next, but that might be wishing for tomorrow.
9028000	9039000	Well, I just was, I saw this morning they're putting some anti-patent reform person that, or they're supposed to be putting some anti-patent reform guy as the head of the patent office or something now.
9040000	9043000	So, it sounds like the whole FCC thing all over again.
9044000	9045000	Oh boy.
9046000	9048000	Anyway, read the rest of the email.
9049000	9059000	Why the fuck didn't they do this sooner? Have the local morons who claim to represent people, aka politicians, tried to do this before? What the fuck kind of fucking argument can people make against the overturn of this fucking law?
9060000	9062000	Seriously, what the fuck? Stay black, redertainment trainer.
9063000	9067000	To be fair, had anybody really challenged it before? Do we have evidence that people-
9068000	9069000	I haven't read the article in full.
9069000	9076000	Yeah, I mean, I don't know. Did people really try to challenge the law before, or did people accept it as status quo, and I'll go build my arcade somewhere else.
9077000	9087000	It sounds like they're supposed to be reviewing this. This article was posted on June 20th, so it looks like they may have already had the review and it's supposed to go to vote in July, so.
9088000	9097000	I bet most politicians today in Alameda County had no idea that it was a law. That's how complicated it can get sometimes, unfortunately.
9097000	9099000	Alright, last email?
9100000	9105000	Yeah, I was seeing what was wrong with y'all. Apparently it was over our internet connection.
9106000	9107000	Oh, I'm sorry.
9109000	9117000	I'm not sorry over something I can't help. If I could share my internet speed I would more than happily do it, but I can't.
9118000	9120000	I think you need to download more RAM.
9123000	9125000	You're like a tech support commercial.
9125000	9130000	No, they seriously have a website where you can download more RAM. It makes your computer faster.
9131000	9132000	Next email.
9133000	9139000	What's up, Orange Lounge? This week I'm on my annual fishing trip and I'm sending my email from the beautifully stinky city of Dryden in Ontario, Canada.
9140000	9144000	There's a giant paper mill in the middle of the city that keeps it nice and, quote, fresh.
9145000	9150000	For the record, Mobile, Alabama, where I grew up, had the Scott Paper Company mill.
9151000	9157000	And it smelled like paper mill for years and then when it shut down we finally realized what the ocean breeze actually smells like.
9158000	9163000	What was your, where was your favorite vacation? What did you do? And what was the most memorable part?
9166000	9170000	Wow. My favorite vacation? I guess all the million times I've been to Disneyland.
9170000	9173000	Because I like going to Disneyland a lot.
9174000	9183000	I did have a really good summer as a kid where my dad, his wife at the time, my sisters and I went up and went water skiing for an entire week.
9184000	9192000	Just camping out. I think I didn't change out of my bathing suit for an entire week except to change into another bathing suit.
9193000	9206000	And it was just great. You know, it was really fun. I had a great time. Caught fireflies at night because we apparently don't have fireflies in California.
9207000	9212000	Nope. And ate good food. I mean, that was pretty fun.
9213000	9221000	I think my favorite vacation was probably in 2009. So it was while this show was going on. I went to Hawaii by myself.
9222000	9227000	I went to a wedding that was out there. But it was after a really shitty year which was 2008.
9228000	9232000	And if you go, if you kind of go back and listen to this show, in 2008 that was the year that I was really sick.
9233000	9240000	I had to have the surgery. I went through a really bad breakup with, I'm not going to mince words here, was a pretty toxic person.
9241000	9247000	So, you know, it was really like I went to this wedding that was at the very beginning of 2009.
9247000	9254000	It was literally like the first or second weekend in January that I went out there. And it was really like setting the tone. I'm cleaning the slate.
9255000	9263000	I'm starting over. And it was just such a great vacation in the way of like cleansing the past year of shit and starting a better year.
9264000	9268000	And 2009 was a better year. I started dating Alan at the end of 2009.
9269000	9277000	Actually, there is something. The money that I used to move out here was the money I was using to go to my first Anime Expo.
9278000	9283000	So technically, me moving to California was a vacation that never ended.
9284000	9285000	A one-way vacation.
9286000	9288000	A one-way vacation. And Dan and I went to my first Anime Expo.
9289000	9291000	Well, you have worn out your welcome. I'm just kidding.
9292000	9295000	Well, bitch, you know, I'm just kidding. Hearts, hearts, hearts. I love, love, love, love.
9295000	9304000	But no, it's hard being away from my family sometimes. But I've had nothing that could happen since I moved out here, really.
9305000	9306000	Loki?
9307000	9310000	I don't really take vacations.
9311000	9313000	Maybe you should start.
9314000	9316000	Okay. Who wants to take the kids?
9319000	9320000	Your grandparents.
9321000	9322000	Yeah, I don't think so.
9322000	9325000	Dan will babysit them and then he'll be glad to give them back when you're back.
9326000	9328000	Can't you take them to a kennel?
9329000	9330000	Baby Wrangler.
9331000	9332000	Baby kennels.
9333000	9334000	Darn, somebody should start that.
9335000	9336000	They should make baby kennels.
9337000	9338000	They should make a baby kennel.
9339000	9340000	There's some food in there. It'll be fine.
9341000	9342000	Put the emails down. We're joking.
9343000	9344000	There's more.
9345000	9346000	Oh, there's more.
9347000	9349000	I meant the people that were going to email us, how dare you suggest that babies go to a kennel. Blah, blah, blah.
9350000	9351000	Because we don't have them.
9352000	9355000	Some days, man. Some days. And I do have them.
9356000	9357000	Alright.
9358000	9360000	Just a word of advice for all new parents.
9361000	9362000	You had control over that.
9363000	9371000	When you go to the hospital and, you know, the first night or whatever, they're like, hey, do you want us to take the baby to the nursery, you know?
9372000	9377000	Because the first time when we had Josh, we were like, no, we'll keep him in here. He's a new baby. We want to make sure he's okay and stuff like that.
9378000	9381000	Fuck that. Send the baby to the fucking nursery.
9382000	9385000	You will not get any sleep. That's your sleep time right there.
9386000	9390000	Get your sleep time in because you won't get sleep time any time after that.
9391000	9393000	When was the last time you slept, Loki?
9394000	9398000	Oh, I sleep, but I sleep, I always wake up around four or five in the morning every day.
9399000	9400000	Don't you guys go sleep?
9401000	9402000	No. I thought you did.
9403000	9411000	No, it's just that we have to get up that early because Josh, for some reason, has his clock set to, I'm going to wake up at six at the latest.
9412000	9419000	Well, this just reiterates to me that toddlers and cats have the same mentality.
9420000	9426000	Oh, fuck my cat, too. Seriously. Four in the morning. I want attention! I want attention! Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch!
9427000	9437000	Fuck you. I just woke up with the baby and now you're going to come wake me up and the baby? Oh, and if I don't answer the door, or it's like, well, I just want you to turn on the faucet and the sink in the bathroom because I want to drink water from there.
9438000	9440000	You have a bowl of water I just filled up.
9440000	9441000	Get one of those fountains.
9442000	9444000	It doesn't matter. She will still go to the sink.
9445000	9449000	Who knew that an emailer asking about vacations would get Loki riled up tonight?
9450000	9451000	Not like it takes much.
9452000	9453000	Not so silly this week.
9454000	9455000	When you haven't vacationed for years.
9456000	9459000	I have a vacation for the rest of my life.
9460000	9463000	Because I can't have them and now I'm happy.
9464000	9465000	The end. I have a cat.
9465000	9471000	Not so silly this week, but still a good topic. Everyone enjoys a damn I wish I was there story.
9472000	9473000	Much love, EA Skeezy.
9474000	9478000	I guess in this case you wouldn't want to go damn you if you were there when you've got cats and babies waking you up.
9479000	9482000	Loki, I will babysit for you and Nellie once.
9483000	9485000	Yeah, good luck. I'm here trusting anybody.
9486000	9487000	Once.
9488000	9492000	Alright. If you want to email us, participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
9493000	9495000	You can also ask us questions about games.
9496000	9499000	I don't mind the random stuff. I mean that's cool that people want to get to know us better and what have you.
9500000	9501000	But you can also ask us about games. Just saying.
9502000	9503000	Oh, I did remember one other good vacation.
9504000	9505000	Alright. Quickly.
9506000	9507000	When we went to PAX and I took selfies with Jonathan Coulton.
9508000	9509000	That was awesome.
9510000	9513000	Good times. Good times. Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live dot vog network dot com says,
9514000	9516000	Jamie's favorite vacation was spending a day at Disneyland with me.
9517000	9518000	Was it because we went to Electronica?
9519000	9521000	Uh, yes because that's where vog started.
9522000	9523000	Yeah.
9524000	9525000	Actually, very memorable.
9526000	9528000	And, and Electronica.
9529000	9530000	Yes.
9531000	9532000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
9533000	9535000	From vacations to reality.
9536000	9537000	It's the FUs of the week.
9547000	9561000	FU to the incredible amount of stress I've been under since finding out about my dad.
9562000	9567000	I've, I mean I'm doing okay at work. I can make it through my day.
9568000	9575000	But then I come home just so exhausted from I think having to keep my head above water.
9575000	9581000	The worst thing is that I'm stuck here and really don't have a way to get back to Alabama for the time being.
9582000	9591000	I mean, and just getting pressure from family and pressure from this, that, and the other when really all I want is my dad to be better.
9592000	9595000	So, that's it.
9596000	9597000	Uh, Loki.
9598000	9600000	I just have to do my headache. Probably ice cream.
9601000	9611000	Um, I don't know, my FU of the week, uh, just goes to, oh, goes to walking uphill in San Francisco last night.
9612000	9614000	Those hills are no fucking joke in San Francisco, I'll tell you that.
9615000	9617000	An FU to traffic coming out of the city.
9618000	9620000	A good old fashioned standard FU to traffic.
9621000	9625000	Took me like 45 minutes just to get out of San Francisco, which whatever, pride's a freaking mess anyway.
9625000	9632000	But I was stuck for an hour, and that's not an exaggeration, like when people say like, oh it was a whole hour, it was really like 10 minutes, no.
9633000	9635000	It was an actual hour, I measured it on the clock, I knew very well.
9636000	9644000	Uh, it took an hour to get across the stupid Vallejo Bridge, Carquinez Bridge or whatever they call it because they had three booths open on pride weekend.
9646000	9647000	FU to traffic.
9648000	9649000	That made me a little bit upset.
9650000	9653000	So I went to bed at 3am and I got up at 9am today, no naps.
9653000	9655000	Been doing okay so far, knock on wood.
9656000	9662000	Alright, a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9663000	9664000	But first, Loki.
9665000	9672000	So Minecraft sold a whole ton of copies, in fact it sold more copies on console than it has on PC.
9673000	9679000	54 million total copies sold, and console editions of course have outsold PC now.
9679000	9686000	So that is a lot of copies of that game, and I can only imagine that more copies are going to be sold every day.
9687000	9691000	And I would love to see what the next update is because I have been so out of Minecraft.
9692000	9697000	I really need to go update the server, might as well just call the server OLR PSP.
9698000	9701000	Update the server and I'll finish digging more holes.
9702000	9707000	It's a mean, you can play it, it works, it's just I haven't updated any of the plugins that go with it.
9707000	9711000	But I'll do it one of these days.
9712000	9720000	Alright, and lastly, ending on this note, it's been referenced a couple times in tonight's show, but just one more shoutout for Summer Games Done Quick.
9721000	9726000	Because I know a lot of our listeners get really into this, I brought up Extrovert earlier and I know he likes to watch these and was tweeting about it.
9727000	9731000	And I know plenty of you guys love to watch these quick game run-throughs that are done.
9731000	9741000	And Speed Demo Archives has come out and said that over $700,000 was raised for the Doctors Without Borders charity in this past week.
9742000	9749000	So that's really cool, and if you don't know what Summer Games Done Quick is, that means people that are very good at certain games play them very quickly.
9750000	9752000	And sometimes they're blindfolded and what have you.
9753000	9758000	And since they are doing party tricks, we donate money, and we know that the money goes to a good cause.
9758000	9766000	A combined total of $2.75 million raised for charities since the Game Done Quick marathons began.
9767000	9772000	And I know there's another one that comes in the fall, winter-ish time, so they do a couple of these a year.
9773000	9778000	So congrats to you guys in giving a good name for gamers out there, using games for good.
9779000	9780000	That's always worth reporting on.
9780000	9785000	Alright, it's that time of the show where we open up the Skype line. Ready, set, go!
9786000	9791000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. If you want to give us a call, it is open now.
9792000	9797000	And Tigerclaw, pointing out in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, they are still broadcasting with the bonus stream.
9798000	9804000	That is going on right now, so if you still want to check it out and give them more money, you can if you'd like.
9805000	9809000	I looked at that earlier today. I thought they had stopped, so I didn't watch it. Oh well.
9810000	9815000	Dan's been watching it pretty regularly, and we watched some of the demonstrations of some of the game glitches. It was pretty neat.
9816000	9818000	Didn't Mario Marathon happen really recently, too? Yeah, it did last weekend.
9819000	9821000	Lots of good stuff. Alright, we do have a call coming in, though, so let's get to it.
9822000	9823000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9824000	9825000	It's the one and only Rama.
9826000	9827000	Hey, Rama. It's the one and only Artemis.
9828000	9829000	Him, too.
9830000	9831000	How you doing, my friend?
9832000	9833000	I'm doing good. How about you, good sir?
9834000	9836000	I'm super. Thanks for asking.
9837000	9838000	Is that your answer to everything?
9838000	9840000	Shouldn't it be?
9841000	9842000	Fair enough.
9843000	9844000	Oh, you're wearing your Minako shirt.
9845000	9846000	Yes, I am.
9847000	9849000	Have you been practicing your Luigi deaths there?
9850000	9855000	Do you know how many requests I got for that when I was dressed as Dr. Mario in Anime Next?
9856000	9864000	I worry that's going to jump the shark a little bit. Don't get me wrong. Angry Luigi is a great thing, and I'm glad to see Nintendo kind of get a meme out of one of their games like that.
9864000	9869000	But let's use Angry Luigi sparingly at this point.
9870000	9871000	Okay, the villager will come back.
9872000	9878000	No, let Nintendo milk this because Luigi Death Stare has increased sales of the Wii U, and you know they need it.
9879000	9882000	That is true. This is true. I'm not complaining about that end of it.
9883000	9884000	Mm-hmm.
9885000	9886000	So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9887000	9889000	Well, besides the fact that I officially graduated from college...
9890000	9891000	Congratulations!
9892000	9893000	Thank you. Thank you.
9894000	9895000	Thank you for having me. I see how you are.
9896000	9901000	Well, I was about to do a birthday celebration, but if you want to be like that, I can hang up.
9902000	9904000	No, no, no. It's okay. If you want to make it about me, that's fine.
9905000	9911000	Well, I will do something special besides the fact that I do believe it's OLR's 12th birthday, or it was last week.
9912000	9913000	Belated, yes.
9914000	9918000	So I went into the fridge, and if you look at the camera, I got a little something special here.
9919000	9921000	Heck yes. Some Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey right there.
9921000	9925000	It was that or the Kraken.
9926000	9927000	Release the Kraken.
9928000	9932000	I'm saving that for another convention, and as you can see, I am doing my pour.
9933000	9938000	I love this, and he's on webcam. I know this makes for great radio, but he is pouring out a very full shot of Fireball.
9939000	9941000	That is... You are not fucking around with that shot.
9942000	9946000	You should see me around Spiritus. That stuff's 196 proof.
9946000	9947000	Yeesh.
9948000	9951000	Alright, a toast good sir. I raise my coffee mug.
9952000	9954000	Here's to you. Here's to me.
9955000	9957000	I'll have some amaretto when I get home.
9958000	9963000	Awesome. Here's to OLR. Here's to you. Here's to me. Best of the friends we'll ever be.
9964000	9967000	If we should ever happen to disagree, well fuck you, and here's to me.
9969000	9970000	Cheers.
9972000	9973000	One down.
9974000	9975000	Pour in another one.
9976000	9978000	Uh oh, the bottle's looking a little empty.
9979000	9981000	Well, I had this at a convention, so I had to save the left over.
9982000	9983000	And there's some left.
9984000	9989000	Hey, you need to tell about our hunt for soda when we had the Pineapple Malibu at Fanime.
9990000	9996000	Oh, that was fun. Didn't we end up finding an awesome place to eat for breakfast or something like that when we were doing that hunt?
9997000	10002000	We did, but they were closed at the time, and we found a vending machine that cost one more quarter than what we had.
10003000	10004000	And then we found a quarter.
10004000	10006000	Yes, that was awesome.
10007000	10013000	But I'm only doing a half shot because, unlike last year, I have a job and I have to be somewhat responsible.
10014000	10016000	Responsible? Overrated.
10017000	10018000	Well, I do work in IT, so...
10019000	10020000	Alright, fair enough, fair enough.
10021000	10026000	To you, Rob, thank you for everything you've helped with Anime Jam Session, OLR, and everything else.
10027000	10033000	You are a catalyst, you are a great person, and sometimes you're a real rap bastard, but I don't want it any other way.
10034000	10036000	So to you, good sir, happy birthday.
10037000	10039000	I'll take it. Thank you, that was very kind.
10040000	10047000	And that's it. And now I'm gonna go back to finish eating my dinner I just cooked like ten minutes ago before I walked in and turned on the feed.
10048000	10052000	Alright, well best of luck with that, and I will talk to you later, good sir.
10053000	10054000	You got it, bro.
10055000	10056000	Stay black.
10057000	10058000	I'll try.
10059000	10060000	Have some Sharpie.
10061000	10062000	I'm done! Ow, come out.
10062000	10063000	Alright, bye.
10064000	10068000	Alright, actually, I regretfully, we are going to close up the Skype line a little early here.
10069000	10071000	If you did want to get through and didn't, please consider emailing us.
10072000	10074000	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.
10075000	10079000	But I know both Loki and DarkSaga have to get going, they've got some other stuff they've got to get to, as we talked about earlier.
10080000	10084000	So we are going to go ahead and wrap up because we're after nine o'clock on the West Coast, or midnight for you East Coasters.
10085000	10088000	Again, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com, we do welcome your voices.
10089000	10091000	Twitter.com slash OLR as well.
10092000	10096000	So, quickly, quickly, any last minute headlines you want to get out, Loki?
10097000	10102000	Just that planetary annihilation apparently has released a physical version into retail.
10103000	10105000	The only problem is, it's still early access.
10106000	10109000	So it says, early access edition includes free upgrade to full game.
10110000	10111000	It's getting ridiculous now.
10112000	10113000	Alright.
10114000	10116000	That is going to do it for another episode of Orangelounge Radio.
10117000	10119000	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.
10119000	10123000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orangelounge Radio, please help spread the word about our show.
10124000	10128000	Tell a friend or two or fifty about our show and spread the word, that's all we got.
10129000	10130000	A nice review on Stitcher goes a long way.
10131000	10133000	Thank you, I saw a couple new reviews pop up in the past week.
10134000	10135000	Thank you very much for those five star reviews.
10136000	10138000	iTunes reviews are great too, and just, you know, word of mouth.
10139000	10140000	That's all we got.
10141000	10143000	Thank you again, and don't be jerks to each other online with gaming.
10144000	10145000	Quickly going around and getting final thoughts.
10146000	10147000	Dark Sakura?
10147000	10148000	Um, yeah.
10149000	10150000	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10151000	10152000	Can I borrow Mario Kart Wii?
10153000	10154000	Mario Kart Wii? Like, Mario Kart 7?
10155000	10156000	Yeah, sure, go for it.
10157000	10158000	Alright, cool.
10159000	10160000	Well, I have to ask, what brought that on?
10161000	10166000	Well, I've been trying to find my copy, because I was telling my son about it and stuff, and I was trying to get him, see if I could get him to play it.
10167000	10171000	But, uh, I can't get my, can't find my copy.
10172000	10173000	Yeah, go for it. Just make sure I get it back someday.
10173000	10180000	And make sure the disc is actually in the box, because I'm one of the, I'm that guy that, you know, you'll open that up and you'll be like, what's Metroid Prime doing in here?
10181000	10182000	Don't be that guy.
10183000	10184000	I'm totally that guy.
10185000	10188000	Uh, and my final thought is, I'll try to stop being that guy, but sometimes I can't help it.
10189000	10190000	I can't help it.
10191000	10196000	Thank you very much for listening to the show, have a great week everybody, and we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
