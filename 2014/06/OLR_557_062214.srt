00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,880
This week, the playful jobs at Ubisoft continue with Sunset Overdrive offering full customization

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,400
no matter the gender you select.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,800
EA CEO has owned up to Battlefield 4's issues, but stopped short of promising that it will

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
never happen again.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,920
We'll tell you more about all this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,040
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,880
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:46,000
Live for this, our 557th episode, June the 22nd of 2014.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
We're here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,840
gamer lifestyle with me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,160
Unfortunately not here tonight, DarkSakura, she has the night off, but here in studio

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,560
with me, TechMasterLoki.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,840
I get the comfier chair today.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,920
Yes, you get the upgrade in DarkSakura's little fuzzy chair.

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Yeah, throne.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Yeah.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,480
It is appropriate that DarkSakura gets a throne here on the show, but sadly, you're a seat

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,800
warmer tonight with her being out, so.

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
That's fine.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,960
Well, how you doing, Loki?

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
What's new with you?

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Not much.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Yeah?

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,320
It's just, uh, I don't know, working on my game in free time and I did like house repairs

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
today.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
Wow.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,920
I repaired a drain in our bathtub.

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,360
I got some things that need repairing too, I'm just kidding.

30
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,760
We were talking a little bit before the show tonight about the steam sales, cause you know,

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,760
it is that time of year where, or actually it's several times, that biannual time of

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,960
year, cause there's two of them usually, the summer and the winter sale.

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,680
I know they do, do they normally do a spring sale too?

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Do they?

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,560
They did, because I remember last year it was the winter and then spring sale.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Oh wow.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Maybe I'm thinking the winter sale, I don't know.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,720
Maybe it's like mini sales or something, I don't know, maybe like a, I feel like there's

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,840
a sale around Black Friday, you know, usually, but anyway.

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,640
We all know there's a summer sale and a winter sale, right, so, and steam, there's a lot

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,160
of stuff always on sale, so there's the huge summer sale going on, but you said, unfortunately

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,240
you haven't really got to participate much this year, just cause, you know, you're trying

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,800
to look out for the monies, right?

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,200
Money and also just, I don't want to buy anything.

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I mean, just, I have so much that I've bought before, I haven't played most of it, like

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,880
everybody, but you know, there's not really the point of a steam sale, but there's not

47
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,680
really anything that jumps out that like I need to buy it because like most of the things

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,920
like are on sale right now, I already own.

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,800
So your EP is directly judged by how big your steam library is.

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,120
It's 350 games in my library.

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,200
What was the last one you played?

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I don't know.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,560
Probably sieve four or no sieve.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Was it sieve five?

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,040
You don't even know what damn game you play.

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
No, no.

57
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm saying which one you played.

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Sieve five.

59
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
No, we'll get into that in my gaming.

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,560
We played one today.

61
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,440
But no, um, I mean I have, there's a lot of stuff out there, but there's not really anything

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,760
new that I'm getting aside from, you know, free games and um, like, uh, no, actually

63
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,800
I should give you, I have a steam code for a game that I have a DRM free copy of, um,

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
that kickstarted.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,360
It was a rhythm shooter, like a space shooter, but it's a rhythm game sort of.

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,480
That'll be one extra inch on my collection.

67
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
There you go.

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,720
Um, so, but yeah, aside from like stuff that kickstarted that they have, like, you know,

69
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,600
steam codes for, I haven't really been buying any games.

70
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Okay, we'll take that back.

71
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,920
I did buy that bundle at E3, but I only paid a dollar.

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,640
I didn't want any, like I said, I don't need the Mortal Kombat arcade collection cause

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,080
I just don't, I'm not a big fan of Mortal Kombat, you know, and they have like, now

74
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,240
I have a bunch of random DLC for shit I don't own.

75
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,400
Funny enough, that was the last game I bought before the steam, I bought on Epic on the

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,440
steam sale yesterday cause that was the game I had my eye on for a while anyway.

77
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,960
I haven't played it yet, but you know, I will four months from now when I get really

78
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
bored.

79
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Right.

80
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Uh, no, hopefully sooner than that.

81
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,600
But before that I bought Mortal Kombat, the, the, the reboot, Mortal Kombat nine or whatever.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,920
No, I guess it really was eight.

83
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
I don't know.

84
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Whatever.

85
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
You know what I'm talking about?

86
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,680
The reboot Mortal Kombat, uh, was the last thing I bought on steam, even though I already

87
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,120
owned it on PS3, but the steam one was so cheap and it's like, Oh, this one comes with

88
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,360
Freddy Krueger and, and all the other characters, Kenshi and, um, so whatever.

89
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,840
Yeah, they did re-release the Mortal Kombat game.

90
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,080
Uh, they did like a game of the year edition with, yeah, that's what I bought on steam

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,500
or whatever it was, but yeah, I mean they've got, you know, like dead rising three look

92
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,960
kind of cool, but I don't think my, I don't think my laptop would run it very well.

93
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,540
So yeah, I just dumped all that money into my new PC.

94
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,720
So I no longer have to worry about, will my computer play this game?

95
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,440
Because the answer is yes, it will, at least for the next year or two, well, I'll be fine.

96
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
You know?

97
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Yeah.

98
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,800
I mean, it's just, I don't want to really right now, I'm trying to focus on finishing

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
my game.

100
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,080
So that's why I haven't been buying anything or playing anything because you know, I don't

101
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
want to be distracted from that.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,620
Although I may force myself to actually play something just because I sometimes maybe need

103
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,500
a distraction just to kind of take a break from it, you know, for a little bit.

104
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,420
But I don't know.

105
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,180
I just, there's not really anything new out there that I'm like, Oh, I got to play that.

106
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,420
You know, it's like so brand new, like, Oh, I need to get a copy of that.

107
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,820
Um, well there's having come back off of the E3 episode last week, there were certainly

108
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,300
some games I saw there where I'm like, Ooh, I definitely want to get that one.

109
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,320
That's out, you know, uh, on the PC front, this will surprise nobody, but civilization

110
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,140
beyond earth, uh, looks, um, right up my alley.

111
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,020
Well, yeah, I mean, some of those games are cool, like No Man's Sky and stuff when that

112
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
comes out on PC.

113
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,820
Hell yeah, I'd want to pick that up.

114
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,140
But you know, right now there's not really anything like indie that's like super, I mean,

115
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,660
there's a couple like I've seen a Kickstarter stuff that looked kind of cool that maybe

116
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,020
I'll pick up when they come out, but there's not really anything that I like that's out

117
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,580
there right now that's on the marketplace of like, Ooh, I really, really need that.

118
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,540
You know, what I found has been extraordinarily useful for finding new games on steam that

119
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,420
are, you know, things that have not been on my radar, but they're usually indie because

120
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,340
you know, ever since Greenlight started, indies have really, really, really become

121
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,460
very prevalent on steam.

122
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,940
They're doing very well there.

123
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,180
And you know, a lot of them are, are, are really low value, you know, under $10.

124
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,660
Some of them go on sale, they're like $2.50, right?

125
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,820
So what's been really useful for finding a lot of those steam keywords have been like,

126
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,460
I got to say that was actually a really cool feature they implemented because like, you

127
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,340
know, I might be looking at a game's page and then I'll see that the, um, the keywords

128
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,180
on the game are like JRPG or something and I'll be like, Ooh, I wonder, I wonder what

129
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,220
the big selling JRPGs are because you can click on that keyword and then you sort like

130
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,980
what are the top sellers, what are the new or like roguelike or, you know, things like

131
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,980
that.

132
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,420
Like, like categories that the games aren't often sorted into, like, you know, action

133
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,220
adventure sports, you know, you get a little more specific than that, which has been really

134
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,300
good for targeting games.

135
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,380
I think they've got some like super hot, look pretty cool.

136
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,980
Like I'd want to kind of check that out.

137
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,820
There is one, it's a Devolver Digital's new game that they published.

138
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,100
It was, um, I figured it was a, it was a kind of a rogue-like first person shooter game.

139
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,380
I think it's called Bullets or Six Bullets or something like that.

140
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,700
It's a game where you're fighting these monsters.

141
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,140
It's kind of a retro arcade looking title, but, um, you have to go and pick up your bullets

142
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,420
because you only have six bullets.

143
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,640
So you shoot something and you have to go run and pick up your bullet, um, and before

144
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,600
you, more monsters attack you.

145
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,680
So, I don't know, I have to look at some of that stuff, but right now there's not really

146
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,360
anything that jumps up that like I really want to play.

147
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,440
Just mainly because, you know, if there is something like maybe like Arma 3 or something,

148
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,160
which I have Arma 2 and I still haven't fucking touched that game, so I don't know, but, uh,

149
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,400
it looks interesting, but that'd be something I'd want to sink, you know, several hours

150
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
into.

151
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,520
Like, I was like, oh, I could get South Park, but I already have it on 360, so I don't really

152
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,520
need to buy it on PC as well, but, ooh, I could get that game, but it wasn't really

153
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
marked down that much.

154
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,760
I just, I don't know, there's not really anything that's really jumping out at me.

155
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,000
All right, so I need to introduce our chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,640
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

157
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,820
The time is six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern to catch our show.

158
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,120
That's right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and of course you can participate live along

159
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,360
with our show at the chat room, which is at live.vognetwork.com because we are the show

160
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,000
where every gamer has a voice, including actdeft, who's clarifying some information

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,920
about the sale, saying they used to do a spring sale, but this year they didn't, though the

162
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,700
big sales are summer and winter.

163
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,600
Now some other voices in chat rooms reminding us not to forget about other sites.

164
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,560
You know, we talk Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, but I see a lot of chatter about Humble Bundle,

165
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,080
although I don't think there's a main Humble Bundle going on right now.

166
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,680
There's always like the weekly as they do those, right?

167
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
They have one at the store.

168
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,380
No, they have one going on right now.

169
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,640
They have the games done quick, Humble Bundle, but it's not really a Humble Bundle.

170
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,880
It's like, you know, you have to pay 25 bucks as the minimum to get a bunch of stuff, but

171
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,360
it's like quite a few games.

172
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
They're all pretty good.

173
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,760
They have like the Gianna Sisters, Twisted Dreams in there, and there was a bunch of

174
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,080
other ones, and I think Stanley Parable and stuff was a part of that.

175
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
So those are pretty good.

176
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,680
There's also like the other non-Humble Bundle sites, like Indie Royale.

177
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,440
Well, I was gonna say, fifth dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says GOG,

178
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,740
or Good Old Games, is getting more money from me than Steam this weekend, and DungeonBuster

179
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
adding to that.

180
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,620
Good Old Games is having a summer sale, too, for classic titles and some not-so-classic

181
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,620
titles.

182
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,620
Yeah, that's good.

183
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,900
Also, like I said, the Indie Royale, Indie Gala, there's one other one that they have,

184
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,500
too, that's out there.

185
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,820
But those also have, usually it's a lot of like kind of secondary stuff, but you can

186
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,100
get stuff really cheap on there.

187
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,940
They have bundles for three bucks, four bucks, and it's usually like eight games in there.

188
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,820
And of course, there's always gotta be those people that do the anti-sale, right?

189
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,940
Remember Cards Against Humanity on Black Friday jacked the price of their game up by $5, and

190
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,380
people still paid it, right?

191
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,780
But I'm looking in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, our pal Bobby Blackwolf is in there sending

192
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,860
over a tweet from At Fork Parker, who said, all Devolver Digital games are double the

193
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,660
price in Portugal for the next 24 hours, which, if you don't catch the reference, appears

194
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,060
to be a direct response to the World Cup game that just took place, which resulted

195
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:33,220
in a tie, which I don't follow a lot of soccer if it's not preceded by Mega Man, which I

196
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,140
believe puts the U.S. in a not-so-great position where they have to go up against Germany,

197
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
which is really good, too.

198
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,900
I think, yeah, he was saying, though, if U.S. did win the World Cup, that he would give

199
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,660
away a thousand copies of Broforce, but he's like, I'm not actually gonna do that because

200
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,820
they know there's no way they're gonna win or something.

201
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
I love his humor.

202
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,820
It's hilarious.

203
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Yeah.

204
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Good times.

205
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Good times.

206
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Let's see here.

207
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
So, let's see if there's any other.

208
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,980
Oh, yes, I did have another kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight before we got

209
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,220
all on the tangent about steam sales.

210
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,060
You know, we talk about new games here on OLR, but we love classic games, too, right?

211
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,380
Dark Soccer, she always does the classic game of the week, although I'll do one tonight

212
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,780
since she's not here, but we, you know, we try to find the balance between the classics

213
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,260
and the new stuff, right?

214
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,620
So, I love stories like these, and this has been making its way around Facebook and Twitter

215
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,620
and all the social media.

216
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,940
This kind of went viral, so I bet a lot of you guys have seen this.

217
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,660
I don't know if you've seen this, Loki.

218
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:36,020
A brand new trick discovered in Super Mario Brothers, as in the NES launch title here

219
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,700
in the States, Super Mario Brothers, right, where now there's a new way to get unlimited

220
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,940
one-ups, and we all knew about, like, at the end of a level, you could bounce the Koopa

221
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,420
Troopa on the staircase over and over.

222
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Yeah, it's like 3-1 or 3-1.

223
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,820
Yeah, that's a really hard trick to do, though.

224
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,060
I don't know if I've ever pulled that off successfully.

225
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,980
And you can also, in, you know, the Minus World was something that was discovered, you

226
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,300
know, not long after the game's release and all that stuff.

227
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,060
Well, somebody found a new trick that you can do in the game, and this was something

228
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,980
that I guess was discovered on, like, a YouTuber or whatever.

229
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,700
Keep in mind this game is 30 years old, and what happened is that they were kind of ping-ponging

230
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,980
against Mario and Luigi, and what they found is that, in order to do this, you have to

231
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,900
go through the game one whole time, because this is something you can only get on the

232
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,340
second quest, okay?

233
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,380
You take Player 1's Mario to the second level of the game and throw away your first life.

234
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,100
Then you have Luigi take over and get all the way to World 5-2, but if you're good at

235
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,740
Mario Brothers, you Super Mario Brothers, it shouldn't be too hard for you, right?

236
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,780
And you get to the hidden Beanstalk block that's halfway through the stage.

237
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:52,620
What you do is Luigi starts climbing the vine, but you wait and then get killed by the Hammer

238
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,540
Brother that's right there.

239
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,540
And what that does is that causes you to get killed while the vine is growing.

240
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,960
So when you switch back from Luigi to Mario, guess what?

241
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,720
The vine keeps growing.

242
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,900
And suddenly this vine appears in World 1-2 at the very beginning, and all you have to

243
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,660
do is you use that to bounce on one of those little beetles, because all the Goombas at

244
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,420
the beginning become beetles in the second quest, and there you go, unlimited 1-Ups.

245
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,540
Now, obviously that's not easy.

246
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,540
It's not an easy thing to do.

247
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,820
It's also very ridiculous considering that you're already to Level 5, or World 5 in the

248
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,820
game, so.

249
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
On the second quest.

250
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,660
On the second quest, it's like, I don't care, whatever.

251
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,220
But, you still got to admit, 30 years after the game comes out, finding new bugs and new

252
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,820
glitches and, you know, finding other things beneath the surface is pretty darn cool.

253
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,140
Because obviously with this really convoluted trick, nobody was going to find this right

254
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,140
away.

255
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,900
But it's, you know, still pretty cool.

256
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,900
So.

257
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Yeah.

258
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Yeah.

259
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,860
Any glitches in old games that you always enjoyed?

260
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,340
Like especially when you were younger as a gamer?

261
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Hidden secrets and things?

262
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,540
I don't know.

263
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,140
I just remember, the only one I could think of, it was kind of stupid, but in, was it

264
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,620
GoGlo 13 on the NES, you can make a moonwalk.

265
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,620
Really?

266
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,180
Yeah, you can get it so that the anima- like he's stuck one way and you can move a different

267
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,660
direction so it looks like he's moonwalking.

268
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,660
Nice.

269
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,660
That's kind of fun.

270
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,660
I was always a fan of the custom passwords that were put in games, which I guess was

271
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,180
probably for debug or whatever.

272
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,600
But, you know, you could put like in Metroid, what, Justin Bailey and, you know, have it

273
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
underlined or whatever.

274
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,240
You could do the Kid Icarus, you could do what, the Terror, Danger, Horror, god damn

275
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,880
it, I don't remember the- oh I think it's just a bunch of exclamation points is the

276
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,200
last one you put.

277
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,240
So and then that is like, you start part way through the game with this weird configuration

278
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,480
of items and things like that.

279
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,120
So I don't know, I always kind of like that stuff.

280
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,280
Because you know, when those games didn't have save batteries here in the US, you know,

281
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,460
because they were disc system games in Japan, they came over here, they don't have batteries

282
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,060
or whatever, like that was really the only way you could be like, I just want to sit

283
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,020
down and beat the game real quick in one sitting.

284
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,900
You know, there's no warp whistles like there are in Mario Brothers or something like that.

285
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,420
If you just want to spend 30 minutes you want to beat through the game, you have to use

286
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,100
these, you know, crazy passwords.

287
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
So I kind of always like things like that.

288
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,580
I remember we used to mess with Game Genie codes, especially in like, was it Street Fighter

289
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,340
or yeah, Street Fighter 2 and stuff where you'd do the codes to get, play as, you know,

290
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,860
the boss characters in there, but it wasn't really the boss characters.

291
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,100
It was just kind of the boss character skins on like Ryu or something like that.

292
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,260
And so you'd have, you know, he could do that with like, okay, I want block on the Ryu skin.

293
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,460
So you do like, you know, a hurricane kick or whatever.

294
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,620
And he's just like in this shock, you know, a shock animation while he's flying across

295
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,500
the screen or, you know, if he did E Honda, he'd be doing the hundred hand slab as he

296
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
flies across the screen.

297
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Oh yeah.

298
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,020
I never had a Game Genie, but I always, I think I've like borrowed one from a friend

299
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
or something.

300
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,580
Cause I, yeah, you could put in some crazy codes on those that, you know, which was,

301
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,340
which was probably the equivalent of like editing the registry on a game or something

302
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,260
on a PC, you know, like where you could, you know, really screw some things up by changing

303
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
values.

304
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,860
Um, but yeah, that was, that was some good times with the, uh, Game Genie.

305
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,940
And then, uh, our, my, my other favorite was watching, um, my friend's copy of Akari Warriors

306
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,700
that was just really glitchy.

307
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,340
Like, it was like dirty or something, but it would get glitchier as we'd play through

308
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,340
the game.

309
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,300
So like at one point, like, Hey, I'm stuck under the background now, uh, I can't really

310
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,300
attack anything, but I'm going to keep following you guys.

311
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,860
And I don't know, it's just, it was really silly cause it would just be completely messed

312
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
up.

313
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,100
Uh, Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com is talking about all the, all the ones from

314
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
Street Fighter II, the World Warrior.

315
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,260
You could turn Dalzium invisible with the right button combo or Guile's various tricks

316
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,500
and you could even reboot the game.

317
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Yeah.

318
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,740
Wasn't there the whole like quote unquote handcuffing, you know, Guile's handcuffs or

319
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,220
something that was like, that was like a, uh, arcade urban legend, but like you can

320
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,440
do it on the super Nintendo version, but it really was just that you like stun the other

321
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,620
character or something and it caused the game to reboot.

322
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,620
I don't know.

323
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
My memory is a little fuzzy on that.

324
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,620
Sorry guys.

325
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,180
But, uh, yeah, I also liked codes that would like really change the nature of the game

326
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,580
because you guys all know I love the guardian legend, right?

327
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,660
It's like one of those eight bit Nintendo classics that, you know, I think it was really

328
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,660
underrated at the time, but in retrospect it was like, so fricking phenomenal.

329
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,620
Well, there was a code in that game.

330
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,540
If you just put TGL as the password, you just put TGL.

331
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,980
What happens is that it removes all of these Zelda-esque stages, the overworld parts of

332
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,760
the game, and it just becomes a straight up shooter.

333
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,100
You just play the shooter stages.

334
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
That's all you do.

335
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,420
So it was like, it kind of like changes the nature of the game in a way.

336
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,820
I always thought that was kind of cool.

337
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,180
And you'd even get like, I think you'd get random power ups that you would get from the

338
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,140
overworld stages, like after each stage.

339
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,260
So it's like they built this mode of the game specifically for people to be able to play

340
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,780
like just a shooter.

341
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,140
That's kind of neat.

342
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,500
And Dr. Sui says the handcuffs was only in the arcade version.

343
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
All right.

344
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
My bad guys.

345
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
That was like 20 years ago.

346
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,660
All right.

347
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,660
So game glitches.

348
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Good times.

349
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Good times.

350
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,980
See if there's any other comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

351
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,220
Dungeon Buster says turning the power on and off really quickly with the Atari VCS created

352
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,660
screwy game effects.

353
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,940
I don't remember that.

354
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,420
I seem to remember there was something though where we would sit there and we'd reset the

355
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,940
game like 30 times to get something to happen.

356
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,340
My memory is really fuzzy, but I remember something with that.

357
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,060
Cause you know, like the switches on that thing were really, there were like these little

358
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,060
nubs you'd push up and like the reset one, you could literally flick.

359
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,180
And like, I remember sitting there flicking it like 30 times to get something to happen.

360
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,300
I don't remember what.

361
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,580
That's a really horrible story.

362
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,580
Isn't it?

363
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,020
You guys, something really cool will happen.

364
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,100
I think, but I don't know, but I was like six at the time.

365
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,380
So just try it on all your games.

366
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,740
Tiger Claw asks, what does TGL stand for?

367
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,180
The guardian legend, Tiger Claw, the name of the game.

368
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,740
Perhaps you missed me saying that was the name of the game.

369
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,340
Uh, let's see.

370
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,900
Tiger Claw also says, I remember back in the days would play metal gear on the NES.

371
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,940
I used to try to enter random passwords into the game and sometimes get lucky when the

372
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,500
game loads with certain number of items I couldn't find before making the game easier

373
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
to play through.

374
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Huh.

375
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Interesting.

376
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,140
Uh, back in the day when they had gaming codes in the back of magazines, not anymore.

377
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,700
That's part of a DLC pack.

378
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Yeah.

379
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Or yeah.

380
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,460
I go to game facts.com if there are even codes in the game, which what, what recent games

381
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,080
have those types of codes in them?

382
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Not a lot.

383
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,840
I thought a five did, and I'm sure there's other games out there.

384
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Yeah.

385
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,120
Well sometimes also some companies kind of do it like intentionally, especially a lot

386
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,020
of the indie stuff that tries to invoke the retro vibe we'll, we'll do that.

387
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,520
So all right, nice.

388
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,200
Uh, and dungeon buster says it was really random.

389
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,940
We just kept going at it with the, uh, resetting on the Atari until it created a bizarro screen

390
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,200
that we try to play with whatever game we had.

391
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
It sounds like, like the kill screen on Pacman or something.

392
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
I don't know.

393
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
All right.

394
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
All right.

395
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,380
The talk is fine and we'll do more of it later with the classic game of the week, but let's

396
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,200
talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this

397
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,640
week, whether they be new or old.

398
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Logie?

399
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,080
Uh, the only thing I played this week was modern warfare two because it had been several

400
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,120
weeks since our, our kind of group got together and played.

401
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,560
So I'm like, Hey, uh, you guys want to play modern warfare two because it's been several

402
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,000
weeks since we've played our game and they said yeah.

403
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,280
And then I kicked the crap out of them in a very vicious way.

404
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,880
Uh, I did notice a lot of places I can actually climb up on.

405
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
So that's, that's kind of fun.

406
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,280
I like, I kind of doing that kind of thing, but, um, yeah, it was fun.

407
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
I had fun.

408
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,980
Um, that was about it cause I didn't really play anything else.

409
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
Even programming a lot.

410
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,200
I've been looking at your Twitter.

411
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Yeah.

412
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Putting updates on your game.

413
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Well, okay.

414
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,160
So like I decided to change up how, um, cause right when I originally had it, I had a, an

415
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,960
Atlas, which is basically just, it's a big texture file.

416
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,320
Instead of having several textures, you have one big texture with several textures inside

417
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,400
of it and you just kind of move where it looks for that texture.

418
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
So, okay.

419
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,760
Looks at, you know, 50% over on the top or, you know, 75%, et cetera, et cetera.

420
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,880
So that's how I had it.

421
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
The change colors.

422
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,080
I'm like, well, I don't really need to do that.

423
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,120
I want some additional like detail in there.

424
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,080
So I'm going to add a bump map to it so I can have a little bit of a texture and it

425
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
looks better.

426
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,000
And then I can just change the colors with the vertex colors cause in the actual like

427
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:36,920
3D mesh, you can save a color and some people use that for like blending between two textures

428
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,840
or actually change the color of something.

429
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,520
So in this case, I'm actually going to use it to change the color.

430
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
So I'm like, okay, fine.

431
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,740
That's, I'll just change it up and I'll create this texture and we'll go with that.

432
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:53,120
And then I was looking at the code for each mesh and I realized that the program they

433
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:59,400
had for the, I guess, add on they had for the Atlas thing was really fucking up all

434
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,560
my meshes.

435
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,880
It was like screwing up.

436
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,040
They have this thing called the UV, which basically says, okay, here's how I'm going

437
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,360
to draw this texture on this object.

438
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,060
So you set, okay, here's where this corner goes.

439
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,280
Here's where this corner goes.

440
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,880
And you just kind of lay it out so that it knows how to put the texture on that object.

441
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,200
And it, all it was doing was creating a single point where it was putting the texture.

442
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,040
So I didn't notice it on these objects because I was using a solid color and so it would

443
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,800
still be a solid color anyways.

444
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,940
But when I actually wanted to put texture on it, it was just all fucked up.

445
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,180
So I had to write something to manually fix everything.

446
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:45,240
And so I'm just kind of, I finished that last night and I'm just have to fix all my UVs

447
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,800
and then actually save new meshes off of that.

448
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,400
And I'm going to delete, it'll allow me to also go back and cause I have like several

449
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,840
copies of all these 3D objects I've made when I've made changes to them that I have to keep

450
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,920
referencing too.

451
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,640
So I'm just going to clean all that out.

452
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,840
And it's just kind of funny because all these things I end up either buying or finding,

453
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,840
I ended up writing my own version of it because it either doesn't work right or I just end

454
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,680
up using my own version instead.

455
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,720
It sounds like it's been an extraordinarily educational project.

456
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Exactly.

457
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Well, that's the whole reason.

458
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
I hope you get through it.

459
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,000
I really hope you get something playable out of this.

460
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah.

461
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,640
I mean, that's the whole thing is why I went with the Atlas program anyways because I didn't

462
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,840
want to mesh.

463
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,560
Like I thought all this like, oh, working with meshes and UVs.

464
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,880
I don't understand any of this is really confusing to me.

465
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,560
And then when I actually did, I'm like, wow, actually that's not that confusing now that

466
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,400
I've messed with this.

467
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,960
And so now I can do cool things like I can manually modify my object and stuff like,

468
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,560
okay, I want to move this point over and I type in a new coordinate for it.

469
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,200
And hit build and I can see my changes and allows me to have like full access all over

470
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,880
the stuff instead of relying on a 3D program.

471
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,040
Because I've rebuilt my, you know, objects several times.

472
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,400
So this is the last time I'm doing it.

473
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,880
But yeah, it's just, I'm learning a lot through and it's kind of exciting in that sense.

474
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,380
And so I'm just trying the whole point of getting, you know, because I started building

475
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,380
an object.

476
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,380
So I was like, okay, cool.

477
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,260
I'm going to get to the point where I can actually build some stuff and then start working

478
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,620
on the game part again instead of just the engine part.

479
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,000
And you know, that's when I was like, okay, well, I just want to change how it looks because

480
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,620
everything was really plain.

481
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,680
It just wasn't, it didn't look right to me.

482
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,340
And so now that I'm, now I have to go back and change all that stuff and then I'll go

483
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,580
back to building assets again and start working on the actual game part.

484
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
Nice.

485
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,460
Um, but yeah, I mean, give me something playable for Christmas.

486
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,460
I'm working on it.

487
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,460
It's taking time.

488
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
All right.

489
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,220
Uh, well, if there's nothing else for your gaming week, I'll talk briefly about my gaming

490
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220
week.

491
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:57,300
Although admittedly, uh, after getting back from LA, I had a high priority this week to

492
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,700
finish orange is the new black season two.

493
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,900
Look, it's, I don't watch a lot of TV shows, but I watched that one.

494
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,720
And because of the way Netflix's model is where people can binge watch everything in

495
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,120
a weekend, I have so many friends that do that and then start spoiling everything.

496
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,680
So like I, I'm afraid to go to certain places on the internet, Tumblr being one of them

497
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,840
because I knew I would get spoiled on orange is the new black.

498
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,000
So I finally sat down, watched the whole thing and, uh, I'm not, I won't, don't worry.

499
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,280
I'm not going to spoil anything about it.

500
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,360
I will just say I finished it finally.

501
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,320
So I could finally use some of that time to play video games again.

502
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,200
Uh, so I did check out a few games.

503
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,440
I did check out at least one new game this week and then I went back and revisited one

504
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
too.

505
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,200
Uh, the new game I checked out this week is available on PlayStation four.

506
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,320
I believe it's on PC.

507
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,960
I saw it on Wii U as well.

508
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,000
Uh, it is called 1001 spikes.

509
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,200
And speaking of retro games, Xbox indie even, is it really, that's where I think it first

510
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
started with.

511
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Oh, interesting.

512
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Indie games.

513
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Well now it's on a lot of other places too.

514
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,600
It's on a PlayStation four is where I checked it out myself.

515
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,880
Uh, it's very much a retro game.

516
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,620
Like this is like the, it's like eight bit nes straight up.

517
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,940
Like the sound, the way it plays, the controls, like all that stuff just really feel like

518
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,380
an old school eight bit nes game, but of course for widescreen.

519
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,700
So it's a little weird to be playing something like that on the PlayStation four, but hey,

520
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,260
you know, I realized the whole retro stuff is kind of in right now and it is, it is kind

521
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,660
of fun to play.

522
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:31,060
Um, so in a sense it's a bit of a puzzler game, but it's like a puzzler mixed with

523
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,300
like super meat boy.

524
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,300
It's one of those things where you're going to do this level over and over and over again

525
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,380
and you're going to go crazy doing it because these spikes will pop out of the ground that

526
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,020
you didn't realize were there before and boo, you're dead.

527
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,180
And uh, you know, all those sorts of things.

528
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,180
You have to kind of like memorize how the level is laid out in order to really get,

529
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,900
you know, through the level.

530
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,260
And the reason why it's called the thousand one spikes, I believe is because you have

531
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,140
1001 lives.

532
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,600
So every time you lose a life, you go down.

533
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,900
So I think, I think I only beat the first world and I'm super meat boy in a way.

534
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,620
Yeah, but you're still limited on the number of lives and super meat boy, you didn't, you

535
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,060
weren't really limited on it.

536
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,640
So it's, it's a little bit of that scare factor because like, Oh shit, I need to not die so

537
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,260
much because I just got through world one and I was down to like 980 lives.

538
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,140
I was like, I need to stop being so stupid on some of these things I'm doing.

539
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,100
I want to see is I want to see them bring, I want to be the guy to like steam and um,

540
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,380
you know, like Wii U or something like that.

541
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,860
I think that would be funny.

542
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
Yeah.

543
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:40,220
Cause I remember trying to play on, you know, I want to be the guy guide in and that's fucking

544
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,220
hard.

545
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,540
Even the original game is fucking hard.

546
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
Yeah.

547
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,420
Uh, dark to see you in chat says I've heard 1000 spikes was tough.

548
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,420
Yes.

549
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,740
Like when I compare it to super meat boy, there's a reason for that because it's that

550
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
whole infuriating.

551
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
Damn it.

552
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,740
I died.

553
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
Damn it.

554
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,740
I died again.

555
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
God damn it.

556
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,300
I was almost complete with that, but I had the DRM free version so that I don't think

557
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,140
that transferred over to my steam version.

558
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,460
I'm like, I don't want to play this again.

559
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,980
I only have like a, like one or two of those things left to get, you know?

560
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,100
Oh, and then here's the other thing too, because on PlayStation four, so every time you die,

561
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,900
the controller like flashes pink, like, so like you see, like I see it on my hands cause

562
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,840
like, you know, the way I'm holding a controller, especially if I'm playing in a dark room.

563
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,860
So when I die, it's like my room lights up slightly.

564
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,580
Like you're an idiot.

565
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,340
So it's interesting how that little controller light is really added a lot to so many different

566
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,700
games, especially to those who tend to play in like dark rooms.

567
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,820
So the TV lights, the thing.

568
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,820
So there you go.

569
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,580
Fifth dream says you can use the Konami code for 3 million and three lives.

570
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
Is that, is that real?

571
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,260
I didn't know that if that's a thing that's pretty funny.

572
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,220
So let's see.

573
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,220
So there you go.

574
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,220
Sorry.

575
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,380
I'm laughing at this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

576
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,220
This is something you said, Loki orange, orange launch radio is the new black Wolf.

577
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
Yeah.

578
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,220
Cause someone said, yeah.

579
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,780
An active to the orange laundry is a new black.

580
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,260
So yeah, I like that.

581
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
That's funny.

582
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,260
That's funny.

583
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,260
All right.

584
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Uh, okay.

585
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,820
So I did revisit a classic this week too.

586
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:17,680
So you guys know Shane, good Palomine friends, a very long time, and Shane has this really

587
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
good ability.

588
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,820
If you weren't aware to talk people into, to talk people into buying and playing games

589
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,620
that they probably wouldn't have done otherwise.

590
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
Right.

591
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,380
Like the man should sell video games for a living.

592
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,940
Like I realize it's kind of what you do, Loki, but like Shane's really, really, really good

593
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
at it.

594
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Right.

595
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,500
So, um, the game he convinced me to give another go to so I could play with him and one of

596
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:47,700
his other friends he plays MMOs with is five has the 11, the classic and uh, you look your

597
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,900
needs to go free to play.

598
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,340
I mean, seriously, that, that would ruin my life though.

599
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,740
Well, and my God is the, there's the system to like get your character activated and all

600
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,740
stuff of that game.

601
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,740
It's a mess.

602
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,820
Like, because you know, the play online system is so old, like they've really had to kind

603
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:10,300
of backend all this new stuff, like the Square Enix global ID and all this stuff into the,

604
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,060
you know, the old play online thing.

605
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:17,060
So, um, but I did finally figure it out and I got it up and running and I'm being trolled

606
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:22,180
by Alan in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com who says, how many MMOs are you subscribed

607
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
to right now?

608
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,180
Just wondering.

609
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,260
I have three, three MMO subscriptions right now, but not on purpose.

610
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
Okay.

611
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,260
Here's what happened.

612
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,060
Finally I see 14 that one I'm like actively playing and I like a lot.

613
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:39,100
I did 11 for the lolz and you know, I'll talk more about that in a second, but my third

614
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,100
subscription, I accidentally got my world of Warcraft subscription renewed for another

615
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,700
month because I went back to that last month, just kind of on my own whim.

616
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,220
I was just like, Oh, I wonder what's changed.

617
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
What's different.

618
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,740
And the answer is nothing.

619
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,440
So I checked that out and I went to go like, Oh, I need to go cancel my game before it

620
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,940
recharges me for another month.

621
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,540
I log into the site and it had renewed the day before.

622
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,960
Yay.

623
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,380
So yeah, I ended up paying for that for another month.

624
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,620
So right now I have three subscriptions, but the world of Warcraft one will expire next

625
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,580
month and I'm not going back to that until the expansion is out.

626
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,180
And I don't think the final fantasy 11 one will last very long.

627
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,580
It's just kind of one of those, like for the lolz things.

628
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,140
But um, I will say this Loki, since I know you used to play the game for a long time

629
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,760
yet again, even though I just, I kinda flirted with this game about a year and a half ago

630
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,020
or so, you know, I was playing for a little bit and I talked about how like some of the

631
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,380
experiencing was different cause you use the books, you go out in the world and you find

632
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,500
the books and you, you can kill certain monsters that way.

633
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,660
Well, they added two new, like really, really major things into the game to make it a little

634
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,540
more less grindy and honestly more single player friendly.

635
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,300
And the hugest one is called the trust system.

636
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,180
And with the trust system, what happens is you get this quest and you'll go find certain

637
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:01,140
NPCs and they will allow you to basically clone them to make alter egos of them so that

638
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,920
they can join you in the world.

639
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,440
You summon them basically.

640
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,820
It's a new type of magic category called trust and you summon them.

641
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,800
And so it's like you have a party full of NPCs, but they're fully functioning party

642
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,140
members that will act like, you know, those class types should, for example, since I started

643
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:22,900
in one of the cities in 11 Bastok, um, you can talk to an NPC that is a warrior, Najee,

644
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,420
who's a warrior in Bastok.

645
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
And so he'll join your party.

646
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,460
So I have a tank.

647
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,460
So when I'm a red mage right now and I can cure myself, me and a tank make a pretty good

648
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
party.

649
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
Oh man.

650
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,460
Yeah.

651
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
And here's the thing.

652
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,900
You can have up to three of them at one time, man, a party of four anywhere you go.

653
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Right.

654
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Okay.

655
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
So that's one big thing.

656
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,980
And they, I guess just in the last update, they made it so that like if let's say Shane

657
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,760
and I are in a party, he can call two people.

658
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,540
I can call two more people.

659
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
We have a full party.

660
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,540
That'd be a party of six.

661
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
Yeah.

662
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
Is it a party?

663
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540
Uh, final fantasy 11 parties for six people.

664
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Really?

665
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
Yeah.

666
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
Wow.

667
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,540
Is five.

668
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
14 is four.

669
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,540
They all have to be different for some reason.

670
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
I don't remember.

671
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
It's been so long.

672
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,540
Yeah.

673
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
So, um, let's see.

674
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
So yeah, there's a that.

675
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,660
And then the other big, big thing they added to the game is something called the records

676
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,140
of eminence, I think is what it's called.

677
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,700
And it's, it's like achievements.

678
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,700
Okay.

679
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,100
It works like achievements, but they're achievements that get you rewards and it's rewards in the

680
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,940
form of XP.

681
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,940
Big one, right?

682
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,640
Gill and these like tabs or something that you can turn in for, um, armor and things

683
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,380
like that, uh, elsewhere.

684
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:38,760
Um, so it's like, you know, uh, kill 10 monsters in South Gustav Berg or, uh, do one, do a

685
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,500
move that does 11 to 20 damage 10 times or something like that.

686
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
That's cool.

687
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Yeah.

688
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
When you do that, you get XP.

689
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
So it helps.

690
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,580
I wish this game would be a free to play.

691
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,580
So like in one night last night, I got to level 10 real quick or I'd be fine if they

692
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,220
just raised the price, let's just raise the price to like, you know, back to $50 again

693
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,100
and make it like buy to play, you know, like Guild Wars, uh, and fifth dream in our chat

694
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,300
over at live.vog network.com says, please do this in Final Fantasy 14.

695
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,660
Well, you know, it's interesting because, um, and the reason why I bring this up, cause

696
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,660
I'm sure some of you guys are getting put to sleep with the Final Fantasy 11 chatter.

697
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,460
If you're not laughing at the fact that I went back to a game that's like 12 years old

698
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
or whatever.

699
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
Who cares?

700
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,480
Well, I will be, I think it's interesting to go back to these aging MMOs and see how

701
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:29,420
they're keeping themselves playable when their user base is dwindling fast, because obviously

702
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,740
Final Fantasy 14 tore a big piece of 11's fan base out, you know, cause a lot of people

703
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,780
moved on to 14, even though the games are very, very different in how they play, you

704
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,020
know, because Final Fantasy 11 is more rooted in EverQuest and Final Fantasy 14 is more

705
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,740
rooted in this weird Warcraft Guild Wars 2 hybrid thing.

706
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,740
Okay.

707
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,820
So they play very different at its core, but, um, I still think 14 kind of took a lot of

708
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,460
11's players, but there's still, you know, uh, I did a slash C all so you can see all

709
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,460
the people on the server.

710
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,940
There were still like 1800 people logged into the server yesterday that I was playing on.

711
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,220
So kind of interesting.

712
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,740
Lots and lots of level 99's.

713
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,740
That's for sure.

714
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
Uh, let's see.

715
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
Let's see.

716
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
So let's see.

717
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:16,340
Um, over at, uh, live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says, Shane's should be VOG's official PR

718
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,340
person.

719
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,340
Not a bad idea.

720
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,060
If he'd be willing to do it, he could probably, uh, get us some more listeners maybe.

721
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,700
Uh, Alan, who of course is, is my boyfriend is in chat and talking about, uh, listening

722
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,680
to me play Final Fantasy 11.

723
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,900
And when you try to sell him a game, he's like, this is stupid forever and I'll never

724
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
play it forever.

725
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,380
And he stays true to his word.

726
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,560
He will never play it.

727
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,640
But this guy is like, Shane, stop it and look at what happens.

728
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,920
Uh, he's, that is all in response to Shane is the worst enabler.

729
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
So there you go.

730
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,640
So yeah, I went back to Final Fantasy 11, but I don't, I don't know how long it'll last.

731
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,760
I mean, it's still, I gotta say there's still things about 11 that hold up very well after

732
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
12 years.

733
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,240
The graphics are starting to show their age a little bit, but you know, especially on

734
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,440
the PC where you can kind of up the resolutions and everything through some registry edits,

735
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,680
it doesn't look bad.

736
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,680
You know, it's still, I mean, it was a game on the 360 and it probably looks about like

737
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,840
that on your PC.

738
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,780
So it's still, you know, has that the music is still great.

739
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,840
The class design is really fantastic.

740
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,680
There's so many classes in the game and the fact that you can have a main job and you

741
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,640
get a sub job where you get half the levels of whatever second job you want and that you

742
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
can switch those jobs on demand at any time.

743
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,520
You know, that whole system is really fantastic and I can't think of anything really like

744
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,560
it in other MMOs.

745
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,720
So cause even 14 doesn't have sub jobs, it has cross-classing, which is kind of a different

746
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
thing.

747
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Oh man.

748
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,640
Final Fantasy 11 HD free to play.

749
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Dream on.

750
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Dream on.

751
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
It is.

752
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,080
Well, there was those rumors about a Vita version a long time ago, but then it's like,

753
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,600
how would you chat on the Vita version?

754
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Who cares?

755
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Voice chat.

756
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Screw it.

757
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Who cares?

758
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,080
Act Deft in chat says the only thing that's stopping Shane from conquering the world is

759
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
apathy.

760
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Whatever.

761
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
All right.

762
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
So there you go.

763
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,120
I've been playing a little bit of that as well.

764
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,220
And then I've been continuing to play Final Fantasy 14 as well and some Mario Kart 8 today

765
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,360
as well, which moving into our housekeeping segment, I will talk about now.

766
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,840
So I plugged this last week on the show.

767
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:24,920
We were going to do today a tournament for podcast cross zone, which is the panel that

768
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:32,280
ourselves, uh, horde house, uh, video game, realness, game, buoy.org, game bar, Koopa

769
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,140
club, all these podcasts coming together to do this panel at gamer X, uh, which is only

770
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,200
like two weeks away at this point, which I can't believe, but, um, yeah, we're all coming

771
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
together to do this panel.

772
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,600
So we wanted to bring awareness, you know, just try to get it out there.

773
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,260
So we had this tournament today, uh, and that happened a couple hours before the show tonight.

774
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
We had pretty good participation.

775
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,460
Uh, I guess everybody couldn't fit in one room.

776
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,260
So there was like several rooms going on.

777
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,420
Uh, and you know, you played 12 games to get your score and, uh, the whole thing was won

778
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,820
by Jeremy over at Koopa club, who I think got first place in almost every single race

779
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
he did.

780
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,740
Cause, uh, he's, I guess, scary.

781
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,740
Good.

782
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,740
Yeah.

783
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,740
I was not in the same room as he was.

784
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,040
I was in a room with like act deft from like OLR and stuff.

785
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,260
And I was with the guys from video game realness, uh, were in my, uh, battle.

786
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,020
So it was unfortunate that because there's so many people, we couldn't all really race

787
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,020
against each other.

788
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:26,100
It was still, I mean, it was still a loads of fun, uh, just kind of knowing that like

789
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,020
when I use the golden mushroom to fly past Delvin from video game, Rena realness, right

790
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,380
at the last minute, it's like, I can hear him screaming in my ear, right?

791
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,720
Like, Oh no, you didn't that type of thing.

792
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
So it was a lot of fun.

793
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:50,180
Uh, now as far as how I did, I have like the fourth from worst score out of everybody.

794
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,460
I'm just not that good at Mario Kart eight.

795
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
It's okay.

796
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,460
It's okay.

797
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,460
I don't know.

798
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,180
Some of these guys, they figure out how to get to the front of the pack right away and

799
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,860
they never, they never fall back.

800
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,060
Whereas I have the problem where when everything gets chaotic, I fall back to like 10th place

801
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,660
and then I have to keep catching up.

802
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,080
And if I'm lucky, I'll get all the way up to like third, but usually I end up in like

803
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,420
seventh place.

804
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,180
So there it is.

805
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,180
So yeah.

806
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:20,460
Congrats to Jeremy from Koopa club for winning the podcast cross zone tournament.

807
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,780
You bastard, even though they gave the prize because they did, they wanted to give the

808
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,280
prize to like a listener.

809
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,180
They gave it to somebody else and I unfortunately don't, don't remember who that was off the

810
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
top of my head.

811
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,240
Uh, but I think it was one of the listeners of Koopa club that ended up winning that.

812
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,900
So grats to you guys.

813
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,260
Speaking of Koopa club, um, they had me on as a guest on Friday.

814
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:43,580
We taped the show and uh, it was myself and some of the guys from Koopa club and a slide

815
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,220
kick from game buoy.org all did the show.

816
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,740
And I got to say it was really funny.

817
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,140
And we played, uh, we played Nintendo password.

818
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,700
Like you know how we do game shows here on OLR.

819
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
They do some on Koopa club too.

820
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,240
They do password is one of their games.

821
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,620
So, uh, we did Nintendo password and there were some crazy words, uh, which I'm not going

822
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:06,500
to give away what happens, but, uh, one of the passwords was, uh, fire.

823
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,420
I think it was fireball, right?

824
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,020
And I said fire and that wasn't good enough.

825
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:18,340
So the clue John gives me to try to get it is just like, what are you doing right now?

826
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,340
So check that out.

827
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,060
I don't think they posted it just yet, but Jeremy said he'd get it up today or tomorrow.

828
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,860
So it's episode 52 you're going to be looking for.

829
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,180
So they, they really edit their podcast together and, you know, shift segments around and put

830
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
music in it.

831
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,500
So it's a little, it takes them a little bit to edit it, but check that out.

832
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,420
That's Koopa with a Q club with a K.

833
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,420
So they're Q K.

834
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,900
So, uh, check that out.

835
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,620
Uh, I will be on episode 52 whenever that is posted.

836
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,820
Um, and that is really all I can think of for housekeeping because of podcast cross

837
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,660
zone and gamer X, there will be no show on July 12th, uh, but we should be here.

838
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,780
There's two more shows until then, um, our 12th birthday here at orange launch radio

839
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,020
is tomorrow.

840
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,540
Our very first episode was June 23rd, 2002.

841
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,860
Um, so we will be turning 12 years old tomorrow.

842
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,740
So we'll, uh, we didn't want to have a bunch of celebration though without dark soccer

843
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,740
here.

844
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,980
So we'll talk a little more and, and have some retrospective and reflection on 12 years

845
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,380
of orange launch radio next week, uh, on the 29th of June.

846
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,380
All right.

847
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,020
That's all I have for housekeeping.

848
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,540
Plugs for Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge

849
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
radio.

850
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,180
Let's get into some gaming news.

851
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
Loki.

852
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,180
All right.

853
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,180
So, um, apparently insomniac games does what Ubisoft doesn't.

854
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,860
And that would be, uh, they had, it was funny, they had this nice little teaser video as

855
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,700
talking about sunset overdrive and the customization.

856
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:49,620
And of course they said, you can play as a male character or as a female character and

857
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,620
all the customizations are completely neutral, um, or gender neutral.

858
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:59,780
So if you want to have a guy in a dress or you want, you know, a woman in, I don't know,

859
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,940
guy clothes, I guess, regular clothes, you can do that.

860
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,980
And what's kind of funny, a little tongue in cheek, I guess with the video, they have

861
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,500
the character dressed up like one of the assassins from assassin's creed, you know?

862
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,820
So, uh, that's pretty cool.

863
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,280
Well, at least, uh, lots of customization there cause I know all the gameplay that they've

864
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,980
shown so far has been kind of the, um, you know, punk rock looking, um, guy from the

865
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,980
game.

866
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,460
So, uh, very cool that they have that and apparently not impossible to do.

867
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,420
Um, so yeah, um, that word.

868
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,820
That was some pretty epic shade throwing by those guys, the whole Ubisoft thing.

869
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,660
But it's, it's one of the things where you kind of look at it and go, wow, that was a,

870
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,700
that was, that was some shade, but you kind of go, but that needed to happen.

871
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:51,900
Like Ubisoft needed to be spanked like that, you know, for that really insert, you know,

872
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,340
open mouth, insert foot comments.

873
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
Pretty ridiculous.

874
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:00,020
I mean, they could, they could just keep the animations with the same guy animations in.

875
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,820
I get it that, you know, in co-op, you're really just playing clones of the main character.

876
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,380
So that's all they have is what they should have said.

877
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,380
That's what they should have said.

878
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,740
Well, you know, we're, we don't have any customization because you're just playing clones of the

879
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,740
main character.

880
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,740
Done.

881
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,740
The topic done.

882
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,740
That's all you have to say.

883
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,660
And then said, you know, we do have some strong, diverse characters in this game, not, not

884
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,940
historically or whatever this whole, like we have a diverse team.

885
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,300
We're going to like, here are some other examples of diverse characters in the game.

886
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:34,260
And then if they can't name any, uh, well, there's a bigger problem Ubisoft, but, and

887
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,420
then, then I think they said even like, uh, maybe they're talking to the next Watch Dogs

888
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
game or something.

889
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,220
They were saying that they wouldn't be doing a female character.

890
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,820
I don't know if they are, or they were talking about the original Watch Dogs game, but there's

891
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,020
another game that they mentioned that also female characters weren't going to be a part

892
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,020
of.

893
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,380
But I just like, I think if they just say, explain that, listen, you know, we didn't

894
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,760
design any other characters other than, you know, any other playable characters other

895
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,120
than this main character.

896
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,680
And so that's why they play as clones.

897
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,800
I mean, you know, we, we don't have any other guy characters.

898
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,480
We don't have any other women characters.

899
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,600
We just, that's why we designed all these things and to go ahead and add any, you know,

900
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,360
if it was guy or women, you know, playable characters, it would have taken a lot more

901
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
time.

902
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
Keep it at that.

903
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,480
Keep it not, don't make gender a, an issue in it.

904
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,760
But when you say, oh, well, it's too hard to render women, you just, you're just asking

905
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
for trouble.

906
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Stop talking.

907
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,120
You're making it worse.

908
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,480
So it's just, I don't know, sunset overdrive looks awesome.

909
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,640
And I'm glad to see that there's a lot of customization there.

910
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,640
So, um, it'll be kind of cool when that comes out.

911
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,320
I'm still waiting to hear when we're going to hear about the next Assassin's Creed, what

912
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,760
the current gen or not current gen last gen version, I guess that would be games com.

913
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,320
Maybe it was when they're going to announce that, Oh, I mean this, are they going to put

914
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,720
unity on the, it's unity is only on PlayStation four and Xbox one and PC still doing an assassin

915
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,960
street for the, they're doing one for a, it's like a, I thought it was like cosmos

916
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,400
or something like Assassin's creed cosmos or something that had to do with like space.

917
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,760
I don't remember what it is.

918
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,320
It's not actually in space, but it's just like, um, I was like, that's when you know

919
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,880
this series is dark when it's Assassin's creed in space.

920
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,880
That's a bit much like, isn't that when Friday the 13th on all the scary, like call of duty

921
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,880
ghosts.

922
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,880
Sure.

923
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,880
Call of duty ghosts.

924
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,880
They had a mission.

925
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,960
I think it was in the trailer where it was people fighting with, you know, sub machine

926
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,160
guns in space.

927
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,680
It was really, really ridiculous.

928
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,680
Uh, go into our chat room for some comments on this over at live.vognetwork.com JV Mon

929
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,680
says, sunset overdrive is my most anticipated game of the year.

930
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,000
You know, I don't think you're alone in that.

931
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,960
I think some people are going to finally pony up for an Xbox one because of this game.

932
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,440
I may or may not be one of them, but I also may or may not be more motivated by Forza

933
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,720
horizon two, which yes, I realize is on the 360, but it's going to be prettier on the

934
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,560
one and pretty is important.

935
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,160
Uh, let's see.

936
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,200
SSG100 Matt says there are some fights you can't win.

937
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
This is one of them.

938
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,480
Well, you know, like I said last week though, this was just the damn waiting to burst because

939
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,960
obviously there are some major problems in the industry.

940
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,840
There's some problems with some of the thoughts that go in the rationales behind them and

941
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
so forth.

942
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:27,160
And I think honestly, Ubisoft's comment, I hate to say it, but it had to happen so that,

943
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,600
and hear me out here, it had to happen so that people would get pissed off.

944
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,640
And so that we really start demanding change and diversity.

945
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,680
And there are people, there are lots of people that would like to see more of themselves

946
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,680
reflected in games.

947
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,640
And as we got into last week, that doesn't necessarily mean down with the straight white

948
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,640
male.

949
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,640
No, that is absolutely not what anybody's saying.

950
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,080
It's saying, how about options?

951
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Oh, sorry.

952
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,920
It's too expensive, too expensive for options.

953
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,880
That was just really bad.

954
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,280
It was a really bad excuse if really what it was.

955
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,400
And if they literally just stayed with, listen, we designed, you know, this, this main character

956
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,720
and you play as clones of him in multiplayer and we didn't design any other characters

957
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,160
to play as, male or female, left it at that, then that would have been okay.

958
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
They're just lazy.

959
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,880
Instead of, no, they're just too lazy to create women in the game.

960
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,400
I mean, it's, it would have been, no, they're just too lazy to create any other characters

961
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,400
in the game.

962
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,760
But I think, you know, like I said a minute ago, we've been waiting for the damn to burst

963
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,880
on this for a little bit and this is something that, you know, unfortunately has to happen,

964
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,520
you know, so that the, all these guys developing the games kind of wake up and say, oh shit,

965
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,400
you know, there are a lot of people out there that want this, you know, or if it's not too

966
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,120
late, put a female lead in the PS3, Xbox 360 one.

967
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,720
I mean, they had one for the Vita, so it might be too late at this point for that.

968
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,360
But you know, again, or how about give some examples again of some of the characters.

969
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,520
I mean, cause what they said is that they said, we look forward to introducing some

970
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,400
strong female characters in Assassin's Creed Unity soon, and I'm sorry, but that comment

971
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,520
comes to me like, oh fuck, we haven't designed any, we better hurry up and do it to shut

972
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,520
everybody up.

973
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,880
That's how that comment hears to me, unfortunately.

974
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,480
So for better or worse, all right, anyway, not to, not to repeat everything from last

975
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,660
week, so let's move on to something else.

976
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,840
Following E3, some interesting financial news about one company and that is Capcom and some

977
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,920
interesting news coming out about shareholders.

978
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:39,560
And there's a vote going on right now to end the company takeover defense at Capcom.

979
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:44,240
Capcom could be taken over by a company that will, that could purchase large amounts of

980
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,680
its stock.

981
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,680
Now this causes the internet to go into a tizzy because this causes everybody to go,

982
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,000
OMG, who should buy Capcom?

983
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Who's going to buy Capcom?

984
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,080
Is it going to be Nintendo?

985
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,000
They get all the, oh my God, Mega Man on Wii U exclusive.

986
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,840
Can you imagine if it was Warner Brothers, then we could finally get Street Fighter versus

987
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,440
Mortal Kombat.

988
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,720
Very interesting prospect there, I like that.

989
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,000
But here's another thing is that I also see a lot of this as hype, hype, hype in the media

990
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,720
because, just because they're open for that doesn't mean they will.

991
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:29,160
And I don't believe Capcom is actively seeking a bidder in this or is actually actively seeking

992
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,160
this.

993
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,080
But I mean of course when the shareholders do make a move like this it does sort of send

994
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,800
a message that, you know.

995
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,320
I gotta be honest though, their portfolio is not as strong as it used to be.

996
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,040
I mean it's like kind of, they're going the way of like Konami right now where, I mean

997
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,940
let's look at what they've got coming out this year.

998
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:53,880
They've got another Street Fighter IV version and that's about it.

999
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:02,420
I mean they have a new Phoenix Wright trilogy like re-release thing.

1000
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:07,460
That's pretty much it, I mean there's just nothing else coming and nothing, I don't think,

1001
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:13,100
I think they've got that, what was it, Deep Down or something like that, that tech demo

1002
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,100
that they showed.

1003
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,100
That was supposed to be coming at some point, but there's not really anything big, I mean

1004
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,740
I'm assuming Street Fighter V is being worked on at some point, but they don't have, Resident

1005
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:27,220
Evil is not as strong as it used to be anymore, Monster Hunter IV I guess would be something

1006
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:34,980
on 3DS, but they just don't have, they don't have like Mega Man anymore really, and Dead

1007
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,920
Rising is not as great as it used to be, I don't know.

1008
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,860
Interesting comments in our chat room, JV Mon says, people just want Capcom bought out

1009
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:50,540
because they're bitter about Mega Man Legends 3, I'm kind of over that, I don't think that's

1010
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:57,380
far off the mark though, no, but I'm looking forward to, you know, Mighty No. 9 Legends

1011
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,120
at some point.

1012
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,240
As far as likely buyers for Capcom, you know, I don't know if it would necessarily be one

1013
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,760
of the big companies, I mean, Deep Silver, I think it would be, nah, I think it would

1014
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,020
be hilarious if it was somebody like Nintendo and I think Nintendo would be a great fit

1015
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:19,100
honestly, but I just, I don't know, you know, I just, there's something about that match

1016
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:24,220
up that doesn't really make a lot of sense to me, I honestly think the likely candidate

1017
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,940
would be Bandai Namco, I kind of think would be, I could see as the one that would snatch

1018
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,180
him up, but I, I don't know.

1019
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:36,300
I don't know if they're rewinding, but I would think Deep Silver's been buying, well I mean

1020
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,520
they bought THQ's, most of THQ's assets.

1021
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,380
But did Nordic Games get a lot of that too?

1022
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,980
Nordic got a bunch of their catalog.

1023
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,020
They got the name too, right?

1024
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,300
I don't know why, but yeah, I mean, they got that, but yeah, they've got a lot of the catalog,

1025
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:59,180
they have MX vs ATV, but like most of the main franchises that they had were purchased

1026
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:04,300
by Deep Silver, so I could see them maybe doing that, because Deep Silver also had,

1027
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:10,380
who else did they buy, they bought another, well they bought another company too, but

1028
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,580
I don't know.

1029
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:17,500
So I don't know, I could see them doing that maybe, but yeah, I don't know if it means

1030
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:23,820
necessarily that anybody's gonna buy them out right away, I just, I don't know.

1031
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,900
Konami could use some extra titles, it would be kind of cool to roll that together, because

1032
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,420
shit, I'm surprised Konami's not being bought out by anybody, because-

1033
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:35,780
That's, that, well and I said that last week, it's funny, because I said last week, I said,

1034
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,340
you know if anybody's probably gonna get bought in the next few months, it's gonna

1035
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:44,020
be Konami, and then the news comes out like the next day, oh it's Capcom's the one that's

1036
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,020
on the block.

1037
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,720
Yeah, don't get me wrong, Metal Gear Solid 5 looks awesome, but they're banking everything

1038
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,340
on Metal Gear Solid 5, because if that shit doesn't work, then I don't, I guess they're

1039
00:52:54,340 --> 00:53:00,180
gonna be going straight slot machines, because they've got that in Pro Evo, and that's it,

1040
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,180
that is their slate.

1041
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,900
Pro Evo's the only thing coming out this year, so they're hurting.

1042
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:11,460
Alright, speaking of Capcom, some interesting other news coming out of there that is around

1043
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:16,900
Yoshinori Ono, and Yoshinori Ono, of course a lot of people know as the producer of Street

1044
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:22,540
Fighter 4, which keeps going, it's the game that keeps on giving, well this week he announced

1045
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,580
that he is leaving Capcom Vancouver.

1046
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:30,420
I resigned from the director position about Capcom Vancouver, thanks good staff of Capcom

1047
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,980
Vancouver and Dead Rising staff.

1048
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,960
I had to take some time, I think over very carefully about next things, I'd like to watch

1049
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,900
TV for Brazil World Cup before thinking it.

1050
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:46,420
Now this caused a lot of people to go, oh fuck he left Konami, he left Capcom, but actually

1051
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:52,940
he furthered, he did a little clarifying tweet, my position within Capcom has not changed,

1052
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:57,920
I'm still involved in all the projects I'm currently working on, only my role for Capcom

1053
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,920
Vancouver has ended.

1054
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,920
So interesting.

1055
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,480
So he's just like, instead of being whatever he was plus head of Vancouver, he's just...

1056
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,720
I can understand that maybe you're stretched so thin, you've really got to focus on one

1057
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:17,440
or two things, I understand that very well, so I can see why he resigned in that regard,

1058
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,660
where it's like, if he's not able to handle it all because there's too much going on over

1059
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,960
here or whatever, they've got to be looking at the future of Street Fighter in some ways,

1060
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,240
somebody's got to be whispering Street Fighter 5 over their cap, somebody's got to be doing

1061
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,360
it, because they keep cranking out these sequels to Street Fighter 4, and it's like, really,

1062
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,480
how many more can they do?

1063
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,000
So somebody over there's got to be begging for Street Fighter 5.

1064
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,640
I think they're already working on it, it's probably next gen, but that would be cool

1065
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,240
at Tokyo Game Show if they showed something like that.

1066
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,740
You never know, you never know.

1067
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:59,000
So there you go, a revised or reduced role for Yoshinori Ohno, but at his own choice

1068
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
there.

1069
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Yeah.

1070
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,560
Well, speaking of Capcom, can I jump in real quick with an interesting comment from our

1071
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,000
chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Blueberry jumped in with a comment saying, Konami doesn't

1072
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,160
really focus on games any longer, they have sports centers and everything in Japan.

1073
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,920
You know, that is true, is that, you know, even though maybe at E3 we see kind of one

1074
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,440
side of it, is that their presence over in Japan might be very different, and I think,

1075
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,920
like you said a minute ago, they do have all those slot machines and things, you go into

1076
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,960
any casino, like you're going to see Konami's logo everywhere, they make a lot of slot machines.

1077
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,560
And also they do a lot of mobile stuff, so I think that's where they're moving.

1078
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,000
But I mean, come on, I'm not talking like, I'm talking Konami as in, you know, a game

1079
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,240
publisher like on console, a console and portable game publisher.

1080
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,160
You want your Bemani and your Castlevania and your Silent Hill.

1081
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:55,080
I'm not holding my breath on any sort of, you know, Bemani stuff, but I would expect,

1082
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:03,600
you know, with like, you know, games kind of like, you know, Amnesia and, you know,

1083
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,400
even what was it, The Evil Within, and that kind of stuff that's probably going to do

1084
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,400
pretty well.

1085
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,400
I could see a little bit more of the resurgence of, you know, the survivor horror genre, and

1086
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,920
I could see them maybe trying to do a next gen version of Silent Hill.

1087
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:25,040
I'd be down with that, but it's just, you know, I'm not, they've had a lot of flops

1088
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,800
I'm just hoping that they, you know, hit a home run with one of these.

1089
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:34,080
ActDeft in chat saying, Konami at E3 said, or sorry, I can't, I keep mixing those two

1090
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,080
up tonight.

1091
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:39,800
ActDeft says Capcom at E3 said they're working on Street Fighter 5 for the new consoles.

1092
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,560
So, but I mean, that's, I mean, that's as a given as, you know, there's, the PlayStation

1093
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,160
5 is currently being developed somewhere, absolutely, of course, and the success of

1094
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,000
the Xbox One, absolutely.

1095
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,800
Those things are planned out years and years in advance.

1096
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,800
Hey, guess what?

1097
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,800
There will be new Nintendo hardware.

1098
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,680
It's being planned right now.

1099
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,400
It's just nowhere near time to show it yet.

1100
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:07,520
I think it needs to be brought up, but, um, where the fuck is Tekken Cross Street Fighter?

1101
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,080
Oh yeah, good question.

1102
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,720
Where is it?

1103
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,200
It wasn't at E3 this year.

1104
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,200
That's true.

1105
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,200
That kind of disappeared, didn't it?

1106
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,200
Yeah.

1107
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,200
Huh.

1108
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,200
Where is it?

1109
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,360
Well, I'm assuming at this point it's going to be next gen for a hat.

1110
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,440
Maybe I was wrong in my Bandai Namco idea.

1111
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,800
Maybe there's some bad blood going on there.

1112
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
I don't know.

1113
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
I don't think it's bad blood.

1114
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,920
I think they're probably just developing a new engine for a new Tekken game that they're

1115
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,080
going to put out a straightforward Tekken game, maybe like a Tekken 7 or something.

1116
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,040
And then they'll run off that engine.

1117
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,760
And so they'll build, you know, two birds with one stone.

1118
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,880
They held it for next gen.

1119
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,240
They held it for next gen and they're building a new engine for Tekken 7 and that'll be

1120
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,240
that.

1121
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,240
Um, okay.

1122
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,120
So anyway, speaking of Capcom, uh, this is kind of interesting.

1123
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,400
I've never heard of a straight to Crackle movie, but apparently Dead Rising is going

1124
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,400
to be a...

1125
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,480
What the hell is Crackle?

1126
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,040
I've seen it on PlayStation 4, but...

1127
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:07,160
Crackle apparently is Sony's like a video streaming, um, app or whatever.

1128
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,960
So it's like Netflix, but like Sony wants their own Netflix.

1129
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,080
But it's not necessarily, it's free.

1130
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:17,000
So all this, like they have like a bunch of old action movies on there and stuff and it's

1131
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
free.

1132
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,920
So you can get like a bunch of cool stuff on there.

1133
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,080
Now you're talking.

1134
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,080
I did not realize.

1135
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,320
At least, at least when I perused it once, I'm like, shit, there's all this cool stuff

1136
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,040
I don't want to watch and I completely forgot about it.

1137
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:36,060
But anyways, so they're gonna, uh, put this movie on, um, that channel and apparently

1138
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,960
it's being, uh, let's see here, who is producing it?

1139
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,080
Uh, oh, um, Thomas Harlan.

1140
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,640
Did you say what movie it was?

1141
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,640
Yeah, Dead Rising.

1142
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,640
Okay.

1143
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:54,360
It's, um, Thomas Harlan is producing it and he did, uh, the Mortal Kombat Legacy digital

1144
00:58:54,360 --> 00:59:03,240
movie, or not movie, but I guess a web series, um, so they've got that and on top of, um,

1145
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:11,760
having it on Crackle, it's gonna be also distributed on DVD, video on demand and also, uh, TV and

1146
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,640
I'm assuming like Netflix and all those other places, but it'll be at Crackle first, um,

1147
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,840
I think Crackle's free.

1148
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,840
I don't know.

1149
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,000
I've, like I said, I've only looked at it like a couple of times.

1150
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
No idea what exactly the premise is going to be, um.

1151
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,640
There's actually quite a few people, um, commenting on Crackle, um, let's see, Act F says it's

1152
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,160
kind of like Netflix, Blender says all free movies and TV Sky, I watched Lords of Dogtown

1153
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:41,200
last week, Fifth Dream says Crackle has anime as well, Bond Solo 6 says think Hulu, Netflix

1154
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,480
and Amazon Instant Watch.

1155
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,640
Well, yeah, but most of those that you name, you have to pay for, well, I guess Hulu has

1156
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:52,080
a free, well, it's only free on PC for some limited limited thing, but yeah, so it is

1157
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:56,600
free, I think, from what I remember, um, it's interesting though that they mentioned this

1158
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:03,160
because I want to say that they had for Dead Rising 2, maybe it might have been 3, they

1159
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,920
had like a little live action short thing that they did that was kind of like a Japanese

1160
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,600
live action short that was, uh, following like Dead Rising 1 or something like that

1161
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,440
and they had kind of some stuff with that, so I'm just kind of curious what the premise

1162
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,320
would be or if this is going to be, you know, hopefully it's not like a sci-fi channel movie

1163
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:26,360
quality or something like that, you know, I hope it's actually something pretty polished

1164
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:32,080
and, um, you know, it says feature length film, but is it a feature length film that's

1165
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,400
going to be CG or is it going to be a live action film?

1166
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:43,000
I don't know, that'd be kind of curious, I don't know, I'm down, down with that.

1167
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Interesting.

1168
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,720
Uh, yeah, I don't know what I would expect out of a movie like this either, but I guess,

1169
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,000
you know, because it's based on a big zombie franchise, it'll just be like kind of like

1170
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
a...

1171
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,920
It's gonna be weird though, watching the main character go, hey, you know what, I think

1172
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,200
I'm gonna put on this little kid's clothes and then I'm gonna stick this, I'm gonna stick

1173
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:07,600
this Mega Man, uh, blaster on my arm and then, uh, I'm gonna totally like, um, I'm gonna

1174
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,440
run around with this chainsaw now and, I don't know.

1175
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,800
Alright, uh, let's move on to news about the Xbox One in Japan.

1176
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,400
Yes, the Xbox One in Japan, it is happening, just in case you weren't aware, uh, they're

1177
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,880
gonna try to make it work in Japan and it's launching in September, 29 games at launch.

1178
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:32,160
Uh, some of the games that will be coming out include the launch window games we had,

1179
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,400
things like Dead Rising 3, Crimson Dragon, uh, also included things like Strider and

1180
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,400
Titanfall.

1181
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:44,560
Uh, Konami will be out with Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes, so that'll be a pretty good,

1182
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,120
you know, cause I was wondering last week, you know, what was gonna be the game that

1183
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,200
really gets people on Xbox One, except the only problem is that Ground Zeroes is also

1184
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,200
on PlayStation 4.

1185
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,840
Well, here's the other thing, the problem is Ground Zeroes is the prequel to Metal Gear

1186
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,840
Solid 5.

1187
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,840
Oh yeah.

1188
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,600
So, no one gives a shit about it.

1189
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,600
Duh.

1190
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,440
Uh, yeah, so everybody's already played that on PlayStation 4.

1191
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,480
Uh, Tecmo Koei will have a port of Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate.

1192
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,520
Um, Cyberstep will have their free-to-play MMORPG Onigiri.

1193
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,320
Uh, that is a PlayStation 4 exclusive in North America, but it'll be available for the Japanese

1194
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,240
Xbox One at launch, that's very interesting.

1195
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:26,600
Um, so yeah, uh, some other titles that will be coming to the Xbox One in Japan in the

1196
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:33,260
coming months, uh, Natsuki Chronicle, Shooting Love Trilogy, uh, Azito simulation game, so

1197
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,900
some other stuff to look forward to there on the Xbox One.

1198
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,940
And, and, a new Raiden game.

1199
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:39,940
A Raiden game.

1200
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,460
Oh yes, a new Raiden game.

1201
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,940
Uh, hopefully it's a disc-based game, because you know what that means?

1202
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,940
Import!

1203
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:46,940
Because it's reader-free!

1204
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:47,940
Nice.

1205
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,940
Yeah.

1206
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:52,940
I'd be down with that.

1207
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,940
Alright.

1208
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,940
Looking.

1209
01:02:54,940 --> 01:03:00,780
Um, so this is kind of disappointing, normally when we're talking, you know, Nintendo going

1210
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:05,780
to court against, you know, uh, patent, you know, infringement cases and stuff, they're

1211
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,260
pretty much victorious.

1212
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,860
Well, not this time!

1213
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:17,180
Unfortunately, um, they have, um, ruled against Nintendo, um, in the patent lawsuit against

1214
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:25,540
Philips, and this, I guess, affects both the Wii and Wii Rem- uh, Wii U, and, um, the technology

1215
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,220
that they were kind of, um, saying that they were infringing on had to do with the Wii

1216
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,660
Remotes and the Wii U gamepad.

1217
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:38,020
So, not sure yet, they haven't really said what this is going to mean, if it means, you

1218
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:43,980
know, what kind of fines, damages, are they going to try to stop the sale of the system?

1219
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,420
To which you can make the pun, do they really need to help them stop the sale of the system?

1220
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:51,140
You know, so on and so on, but, no, are they going to, you know, try to bar that?

1221
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:55,520
I don't think that, you know, looking at like, you know, I want to say the Xbox 360 kind

1222
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,560
of had the same thing, um, they had like a patent lawsuit that involved that system,

1223
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,560
and-

1224
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,560
Controller, right?

1225
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,960
I don't know if it was a controller, I think it was, it was the software, um, it was like

1226
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:15,760
for decoding, like video and stuff like that, and they ended up settling, but they, or maybe

1227
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,120
they had to pay fines or something like that, but they ended up not, it wasn't pulled from

1228
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,120
the market.

1229
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,040
So, it's still, they're still going to be probably selling the system, but I'm sure

1230
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,040
they're going to have to pay some sort of fines or something.

1231
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,040
Yeah.

1232
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:31,400
Um, or I don't know if they can, you know, do some sort of appeal or something, but that's

1233
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:36,800
unfortunate, I guess you can't win them all, but.

1234
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:41,000
That law, and this is so complicated, and I thought I saw a story, um, you know, somewhere

1235
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,640
like on Google News or something about how the Supreme Court was kind of starting to

1236
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:49,720
come down on, and that, obviously we're talking US versus UK, but still, you know, this is,

1237
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,720
this is a problem in a lot of places.

1238
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,080
The US is kind of, the Supreme Court here is kind of starting to come out with a lot

1239
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,160
of decisions that are really anti-patent troll sort of thing, and you sort of get the sense

1240
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,600
that legally we're starting to kind of move towards a different system, and I believe

1241
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,800
it had said something about, you know, don't quote me on this because I don't have the

1242
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,120
article right in front of me, but it was something about like the whole like, you can't, you

1243
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:12,760
can't patent a lot of this software, these ideas, and things that are in software.

1244
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:18,320
Well like, yeah, what they're, the premise was is that they can't patent, say for example,

1245
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:24,400
um, say there's a patent out there for like, you know, point of service or something like

1246
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,240
that, where you're, you're purchasing something or doing something in the real world, you

1247
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:34,240
can't have another patent that says, doing this thing, but on a computer, you know, like

1248
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:39,520
you can't have a patent for playing music on a device and then saying, oh, but this

1249
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:44,160
is playing music on a device on your computer, you can't have a patent for that if it's basically

1250
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:52,160
the same thing, or you know, I don't know, it's kind of a step towards not being able

1251
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,320
to patent software, which I think is a good idea, I don't think you should be able to

1252
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:02,600
patent software, um, you know, maybe patent the code for your software, so like, and that's

1253
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:08,440
really how it should be anyways, like, you know, so it just stops people from blatantly

1254
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:14,480
decoding, you know, reverse engineering your software and just putting it into their software,

1255
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,000
that's the whole point of the patent office is to stop stuff like that, stop you from

1256
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,240
reverse engineering these things, but not necessarily like, oh well, this is a patent

1257
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:30,080
for, you know, Wii remote type things, you know, infrared, wireless remotes, I have a

1258
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:35,680
patent for it now, and now you can't make any sort of wireless remotes, it's kind of

1259
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,680
backwards the way it works.

1260
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,480
GameGuru in our chatroom says that Nintendo is appealing actually, well that's not a surprise

1261
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:48,400
at all, that's what would happen on the US as well, appeal, appeal, appeal, so this will

1262
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,560
not be resolved anytime soon unless they finally reach that magic settled out of court, so

1263
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,560
there it is.

1264
01:06:54,560 --> 01:07:00,920
Alright, so, very interesting new game coming out, and I'm not sure if this infringes on

1265
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,320
any patents, let's hope not, because it looks like it's going to be interesting, it is called

1266
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:10,440
The Rhythm of Fighters, and The Rhythm of Fighters, it's going to be an iOS and Android

1267
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:17,840
game, but it's like a, it's a rhythm game based in the King of Fighters universe, so

1268
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:22,440
I guess there's tap on notes that are kind of in an ellipse style wireframe, and when

1269
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,280
like a cursor goes over the notes, you tap them out, and depending on how well timed

1270
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:31,080
it is, you either do damage or you take damage, we don't know a whole lot else about the game

1271
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:36,760
besides, it's happening, so fans of King of the Fighters, especially if you're into that

1272
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:41,280
and music games, which, this sounds like somebody made a game for Dark Sakura, it's a real bummer

1273
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,240
she's not here tonight, I kind of see this and I go, hey, somebody made Dark Sakura's

1274
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,240
video game.

1275
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:51,400
Well they've got like a, they've spun off so much stuff for the King of Fighters, remember

1276
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:56,480
they have the shooter game at one point, yeah, that was pretty funny, I like that, I'm not

1277
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,480
surprised.

1278
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,560
Not at all, but this will be fun.

1279
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:03,280
So yeah, check that out, the rhythm of fighters, of course we don't know when, but I can't

1280
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,400
imagine it's going to be too, too long.

1281
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,080
Speaking of not having to wait too, too long, let's travel around the world and check out

1282
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,200
some release dates.

1283
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:16,400
Yes, this week actually you do have a few things coming out before pretty much the dead

1284
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:22,540
time which is, what is it, July, when nothing comes out, you used to have NCAA.

1285
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:26,600
This week though, if you happen to be a fan of Transformers and maybe you've seen the

1286
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,160
movie, they have kind of the best of both worlds, whether you like the Transformer

1287
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:35,800
movie games or not, it's Transformers Rise of the Dark Spark that's coming out on Playstation

1288
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:44,620
3, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, Xbox One, Wii U, and 3DS.

1289
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:55,200
Also this week we've got Grid Autosport, which is out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, which

1290
01:08:55,200 --> 01:09:00,920
is kind of cool, it's being published by Codemasters and they actually have, it's funny

1291
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:05,440
how Codemasters kind of jumps between publishers and stuff, so now it's Namco Bandai publishing

1292
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,440
it.

1293
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:17,160
Outlier Rorona Plus, The Alchemists of Arland on Playstation 3, also, let's see here, oh,

1294
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,160
actually that would be it.

1295
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,160
That's it?

1296
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,160
Yep.

1297
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,160
Alright.

1298
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,160
That is it.

1299
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,180
You think there'd be more leading up to what, July 4th weekends next week, you think there'd

1300
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,700
be a little more, but maybe they just figure a lot of people are away on break or whatever.

1301
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:32,500
Well, spoiler, next week there's really only, there's two games coming out next week, Sniper

1302
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:39,300
Elite 3 and the Far Cry collection on 360, which I was hoping that would come out here

1303
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:44,600
because it's in the UK, but I don't think it includes the first Far Cry, because the

1304
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,540
one in the UK included the first Far Cry on 360 but not on PS3, because they never did

1305
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:50,540
one on PS3.

1306
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,540
Right, right.

1307
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:52,540
Interesting.

1308
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:56,060
Alright, well, going over to Japan, looking at the rest of the world and the release dates

1309
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:01,300
there, on the Playstation 4, Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate is out on June 26th, as well as

1310
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:05,740
Watch Dogs gets its release on the Playstation 4 in Japan this week.

1311
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:11,620
Over on the Playstation 3, an awful lot on June 26th, that's my birthday, it's all, they're

1312
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:15,220
celebrating my birthday over there in Japan this week with all these game releases.

1313
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:22,060
Cross Channel for all people, Date Alive, Arusu Install, there's a regular and limited

1314
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:26,900
edition for that, there's the Devil May Cry HD collection getting a price reduction, Grand

1315
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:32,580
Theft Auto 5 gets a price reduction as well, Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider Batride War 2 in

1316
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:37,700
a regular and premium edition comes out from Bad9Amco, and Watch Dogs gets its Playstation

1317
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:44,260
3 release as well, and also Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition goes into the Playstation

1318
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:48,820
3 the best, which of course Biohazard means it's Resident Evil over there in Japan.

1319
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:53,900
On the Xbox 360, just some price reductions as we look at F1 2013 and Grand Theft Auto

1320
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:59,540
5 getting price reductions, but Watch Dogs also gets a 360 release in Japan this week.

1321
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:05,980
On the Wii U this week, Kamen Rider Batride War 2 is out on the Wii U as well.

1322
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:10,740
And lastly, looking at the Playstation Vita and the 3DS, on the Vita, Cross Channel for

1323
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:19,180
all people, Freedom Wars, Girls and Panzer, Senshado Kiwa Meimasu comes out, there's a

1324
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:23,740
whole accessory set coming out for that as well, so this is a pretty big one, Robotics

1325
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:31,420
Notes Elite comes out as well, and lastly on the 3DS this week, if I can get to those

1326
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:36,380
dates here, oh, much less on the 3DS, but for you music game fans, you'll recognize

1327
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:44,780
the name Taiko no Tatujin Don Tokatsu no Jiku Daibuken comes out this week on the 3DS, so

1328
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:49,580
if you like your taiko drum master, you can import that, but hopefully you have a Japanese

1329
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:52,180
3DS to play it on, because it is region locked.

1330
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,460
There's also a pen set coming out too, that matches.

1331
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,940
That's completely stupid that the 3DS is region locked.

1332
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,180
Releases over in the UK, Dark Soccer's not here tonight, but I have them up for you.

1333
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:06,980
On June the 25th, the Another World 20th Anniversary Collection's out on PlayStation 4, Vita and

1334
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:11,460
3, and the Swapper out on PlayStation 4, Vita and 3.

1335
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:16,660
As far as some retail releases, you have Grid Autosport on PC, 360 and PS3 coming out on

1336
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:23,780
June 27th, Sniper Elite on many platforms, that's PS3, 4, Xbox 360, 1 and PC, that's

1337
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:29,380
Sniper Elite 3, and lastly, Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare makes its way to PC in Europe

1338
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,380
on June 27th.

1339
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:36,260
I did forget a couple real quick, BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma on Vita was this week, and

1340
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,260
a Vita game!

1341
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:42,780
Yeah, there you go, and I got another one, X-Blaze Code Embryo on PlayStation 3 and Vita

1342
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:43,780
as well.

1343
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:48,060
So, a couple more Japanese games there.

1344
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:53,780
Alright, so this is kind of cool if you're into, you know, esports.

1345
01:12:53,780 --> 01:13:00,100
There is a college, actually, offering scholarships for League of Legends players.

1346
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:08,980
It's the Robert Morris University in Chicago, and apparently they will be the first university

1347
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:14,220
to offer a competitive team on the varsity level, and will offer scholarships for up

1348
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:18,700
to 50% tuition and 50% room and board.

1349
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:24,900
So, that's different, I guess, seeing esports actually being part of, you know, college

1350
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,900
sports.

1351
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:31,260
It's cool in a way, I mean, as somebody who's obviously a big gamer, it's nice to see that

1352
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,260
happening.

1353
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:38,660
It's, I go back to those days when, you know, we were focusing exclusively on music games

1354
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:42,060
and we talked a lot about DDR and what was going on in that scene, and you remember when

1355
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:48,080
DDR became a sport in, like, Norway or something, one of the Scandinavian countries, I remember

1356
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,060
we talked about it here on the show a lot, you remember that when that happened?

1357
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:54,220
DDR became, like, an officially recognized sport in one of those countries, and we talked

1358
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:57,140
about, like, could it become a sport here and so on, and it was interesting because

1359
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:01,980
you saw more and more DDR that would hit school classrooms and things like that, but one of

1360
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:06,380
the interesting points that was brought up is about how, well, when you have a ball and

1361
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:11,500
you go outside and you have those types of rules, you know, you can really play those

1362
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:17,340
games with anything, I mean, as long as you have, like, a ball, you can play soccer.

1363
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:21,900
Now, granted, you might, or I guess you have to have really goalposts, too, but you know

1364
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:25,340
how people, you know, people will kind of modify these types of games, like, they'll

1365
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,060
say, okay, well, that tree is the goal or something, you know, you know what I mean?

1366
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,540
People, like, modify these things sometimes, right?

1367
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:37,580
But when it comes to an e-game, there's a third party involved in making the play field,

1368
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:41,780
and only they can do it, and only they control it, and it was, I don't know, I don't know

1369
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:45,820
why, but that's what my mind kind of always goes to, is, like, a really interesting difference,

1370
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:49,580
and I, and I get, you know, and I'm sure some people, chatters are gonna say, oh, but there's

1371
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:52,460
regulation rules, especially when you're playing in college, and you can't use any

1372
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:55,240
ball because there's regulations on the ball that you can use, and there's regulations

1373
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,780
on, you know, what, what the sizes are and everything like that, yeah, I get that, I

1374
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:03,140
get that, I get that, but those, I, I still feel like when we were talking about esports,

1375
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:06,780
they're still a third party that's ultimately in control of all of that, they can kind of

1376
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:10,700
change that on a whim, too, like, aren't they making changes to some, some pretty big changes,

1377
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,700
some League of Legends maps?

1378
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,260
Like, that seemed, that was in the news not that long ago, I think we talked about it

1379
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:18,660
on Hoard House this week, so, you know, I, I don't know, it, it's weird when you have

1380
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:24,340
a, it, I guess it feels way more commercialized when this third party's in control, and I

1381
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:28,220
even realize, yes, there's the NBA in the, well, I guess, but they aren't involved with

1382
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:32,180
college, either, but NCAA, if you will, or whatever, like, I, I still feel like there's

1383
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,460
just, like, a difference here.

1384
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:37,700
And it also seems really weird that it's this college doing it, I mean, I could see something

1385
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:43,100
like, you know, a game design college or, like, some sort of tech, like, I could see,

1386
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:47,300
you know, MIT or something doing something like this where they have, you know, a team

1387
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:54,300
that's playing esports, maybe that's too cliche, but it just seems really odd that

1388
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,820
this random university's doing this, but hey, whatever, that's cool.

1389
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:01,700
It gets them a lot of press, and certainly, you know, if you're a college trying to recruit

1390
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:07,660
some smart kids, you know, putting something out there, you know, anyway, let's see, Raman

1391
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:10,660
in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, if they're giving out scholarships for

1392
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:15,940
playing a fucking video game, I want to see scholarships for people building a computer.

1393
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:19,700
Let's see, SHU100Matt says, DDR was going to be in the X Games a while back, but it

1394
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,260
fell through due to music licensing issues.

1395
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:25,500
That was, that was another big issue with the whole sport thing.

1396
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,360
That's why you need DDR USA.

1397
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,860
You can do DDR USA because it's all Konami originals, for the most part, I think.

1398
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,020
Didn't they have, like, Smoke on the Water and some of that other stuff?

1399
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:37,020
That was not in, uh, oh, the arcade version.

1400
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,020
Arcade version.

1401
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:39,020
Was the arcade version?

1402
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,540
Oh, Stomp to My Beat was in the arcade version.

1403
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,540
Ha!

1404
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:42,540
No, it wasn't.

1405
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:43,540
Yes, it was.

1406
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,100
Stomp to My Beat was in DDR USA Arcade.

1407
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,100
Was it?

1408
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,460
Don't play with me on DDR trivia!

1409
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,860
We used to play that song all the time!

1410
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,020
Yeah, but we used to play it on 4th Mix.

1411
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:57,820
No, I'm telling you, somebody look it up, threw Loki wrong for me.

1412
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:59,540
I just don't remember that.

1413
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:06,460
I thought it was, uh, I know End of the Century was in there, um, I don't remember that being

1414
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,460
on there.

1415
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,460
Maybe it was.

1416
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,560
It's been so long!

1417
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,980
How long has it been since I played a USA mix?

1418
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,020
That's how we all met, so it was probably, what, like 12 years ago, right?

1419
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:20,780
Yeah, I mean, seriously, so, I don't know.

1420
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:23,980
Sorry that I don't remember.

1421
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:28,780
I'm actually trying to look it up right now on Wikipedia, but there's, like, so many frickin'

1422
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,980
articles on this.

1423
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:36,860
You just need to look up, was it, uh, let's see, there's releases, list of DDR video games,

1424
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:42,100
let's see, is this Dance Dance Revolution, where's USA?

1425
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,100
There it is.

1426
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:48,020
They can click it, and music, show soundtrack.

1427
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:52,700
Right there, biatch, stomp to my beat, JS16 in the list.

1428
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:59,060
Alright, well, I just didn't remember, I mean, sorree.

1429
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,540
Dubby Dub would've been a licensed tune, there was Smile Decay, Boyz.

1430
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:06,420
But still though, I mean, they could've, they could've done it, but they could've just, yeah,

1431
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:07,420
just don't do those songs.

1432
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,420
Can't do those songs.

1433
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,820
Everybody's gotta do La Senorita.

1434
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:14,340
Alright, uh, let's get to the classic game of the week.

1435
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:21,980
Cuz back in the day, these weren't sports, they were just fun.

1436
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,940
Every week, Dark Soccer dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,

1437
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,900
you kids should be playing this video game this week, but guess what, she's not here,

1438
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:33,340
ha ha ha, so I'm taking over tonight with my take on-

1439
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:38,060
They should've made him play all solo, uh, Dance Dance Revolution solo bass.

1440
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,060
Heck yeah.

1441
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,300
That would've been awesome.

1442
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,300
That was great.

1443
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:45,860
Alright, anyway, quiet on the DDR talk, cuz this game even predates DDR, it's that old.

1444
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:49,620
This is an old, old classic, and it's one that I have chosen, uh, tonight to bring to

1445
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:54,100
the table, and that game I have chosen is Lode Runner.

1446
01:18:54,100 --> 01:19:00,420
Let's write Lode Runner, and the way Lode Runner, it's L-O-D-E Runner.

1447
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:06,260
And I particularly remember this on the Commodore 64, but this game does exist on a variety

1448
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:07,260
of platforms, actually.

1449
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:11,620
Uh, so let's talk a little bit about Lode Runner, which is a puzzler game that was published

1450
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:17,060
by Broderbund in 1983, but here's what's made Lode Runner unique.

1451
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:21,380
Lode Runner was one of the first games out there that actually had a level editor inside

1452
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:26,500
of it, so you could make your own levels for the game, and this caused it to be, like,

1453
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,500
hugely popular.

1454
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:31,000
Um, because, you know, why do people love things like Little Big Planet, or people are

1455
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,020
excited about Mario Maker, cuz they get to make their own stuff and share it with friends,

1456
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,020
and that's what Lode Runner was all about as well.

1457
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:43,180
So, um, Lode Runner was developed by Douglas E. Smith, who lived in Washington at the time.

1458
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:46,420
He was an architecture student at the University of Washington.

1459
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:51,580
The prototype, which was originally called Kong, was written for a Prime Computer 550

1460
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:55,760
minicomputer, and it was on the University of Washington campus.

1461
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:01,980
It was ported after that to VAX, and then over a weekend in 1982, Douglas Smith built

1462
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:08,300
a playable version in 6502 assembly language on an Apple II+, and he renamed the game Miner

1463
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:10,060
at that point.

1464
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:15,660
He kept refining that version, and then finally he submitted his rough version to Broderbund,

1465
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:20,980
and he got a rejection letter that said, sorry, your game doesn't fit into our product line.

1466
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:24,780
So he borrowed money to get a color monitor and a joystick, and he kept working on the

1467
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,520
game, cuz the original version of the game was black and white only.

1468
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:32,640
So Christmas of 1982, he submitted the game to four publishers, and he got offers from

1469
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,280
all four.

1470
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,560
So he took the deal with Broderbund, which is interesting.

1471
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,880
They rejected him the first time, but he ended up going with them anyway.

1472
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,200
So anyway, he was given a $10,000 advance to go ahead and design the game and to do

1473
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,040
150 levels for the game.

1474
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:52,920
Apparently, and I don't know if this is true or not, he paid neighborhood children to design

1475
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,560
levels with the editor he coded.

1476
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,360
Just an awesome way to outsource.

1477
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,560
Molons are design levels for my computer game.

1478
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,800
All right, so what was the game all about?

1479
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,920
Okay, so you played in these levels where you had ladders, and you had, I always called

1480
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:12,080
them monkey bars, but they were basically like wires that you could kind of climb across,

1481
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,760
and there were bricks all over.

1482
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,600
What you could do with the bricks, you could dig holes in the bricks, and that could allow

1483
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,760
you to do several things.

1484
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:28,800
It could allow you to go get through an area without having to use a ladder, because you're

1485
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,260
constantly being chased by guards the whole time.

1486
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:36,440
But if a guard falls into a pit, the gravity works a little different for them.

1487
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,560
They will not fall all the way to the ground.

1488
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,200
They will become trapped in that hole.

1489
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:48,040
Now after about two seconds, they will make their way out of that hole and continue chasing

1490
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,040
you.

1491
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,260
The holes fill in after about five seconds.

1492
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:56,280
So if you time it just right, or if you build a sequence of holes, like three back to back

1493
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:59,900
that the guard keeps falling in back to back and climbing out of, eventually the guard

1494
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:02,120
will get buried alive, essentially.

1495
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:05,240
So he gets killed, and he restarts at the beginning of the level.

1496
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,720
So it's a really great way to get the guards to start chasing you.

1497
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,520
And the guards are really stupid.

1498
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,120
They only chase you, you know the patterns.

1499
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,720
They're always going to take the most direct route to you no matter what, but it was the

1500
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:20,200
way you built the holes that could really change the level.

1501
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,320
Now of course, you're not just running around dodging guards.

1502
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,040
You're actually trying to collect gold throughout the level.

1503
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,720
And once you get all the gold, you go to the top of the screen to get to the next level.

1504
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,200
And the level designer, you actually have an exit ladder that you can design that would

1505
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,720
show up once all the gold has been corrected.

1506
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:40,080
So you can only dig a hole on the sides.

1507
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,200
You cannot dig a hole underneath yourself.

1508
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:48,840
So meaning if you fall in a hole and you get stuck, you will die unless you are smart enough

1509
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,360
to build like a line of three, fall in a line of two, fall in a line of one.

1510
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,880
You can do that really quick if you don't have a lot of guards chasing you.

1511
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,880
So kind of neat there.

1512
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:03,280
If you start with five lives, but every time you finish a level, you get an extra life.

1513
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,440
And if a guard catches you, of course, the current level restarts.

1514
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,880
You can fall as far as you want, but you can't jump.

1515
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,520
So very, you know, kind of a simple game in that regard.

1516
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,960
But it was the level editor and the fact that people kind of did their own crazy things

1517
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,600
with it that really, you know, made this game, I think, influential on some of the stuff

1518
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,960
we see today.

1519
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,400
The game was pretty well received when it came out.

1520
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:35,000
For instance, PC Magazine gave the game 16.25 out of 18 points.

1521
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,980
It said that the game was a tour de force of American ingenuity and the first release

1522
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:43,820
in a long time that can honestly bear the title Computer Game.

1523
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:50,060
Zzap!64 in 1985 said that the Commodore 64 version was, quote, not one of the most recent

1524
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:54,300
games, but certainly one of the best, a classic for a long time to come.

1525
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:58,740
The Spectrum version voted number 37 in the official top 100 games of all time for the

1526
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,740
Sinclair.

1527
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:03,180
GameSpot named Lode Runner as one of the greatest games of all time.

1528
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:10,140
Time rated Lode Runner the number one game in the greatest games for the Apple II list.

1529
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:16,900
And Alexey Pajnetov, who designed Tetris, confirmed that it is his favorite puzzle game

1530
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:19,420
for a long, long time.

1531
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:23,740
Now there were other versions of Lode Runner that came out.

1532
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,780
This game, of course, is successful in that it spawns a hell of a lot of sequels, including

1533
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:32,780
Championship Lode Runner, which was a sequel with 50 levels, Lode Runner's Rescue, which

1534
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:38,340
was a 3D sequel for Atari 8-bit computers, Hyper Lode Runner, which was on the original

1535
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:39,860
Game Boy.

1536
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:42,660
There was arcade versions of this as well.

1537
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:46,700
And then in the 90s, Sierra brought, because they acquired a lot of this stuff, brought

1538
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,340
back Lode Runner.

1539
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:53,540
Sierra brought back Lode Runner The Legend Returns in 94, Lode Runner Online, Mad Monks

1540
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:59,100
Revenge, which actually had online play, excuse me, Lode Runner 2 with isometric 3D gameplay,

1541
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:03,980
and Lode Runner 3D for the Nintendo 64.

1542
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:08,460
And lastly, to note, the Xbox Live Arcade.

1543
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:14,140
In 2008, a remake of Lode Runner was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show, and it was

1544
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:17,500
released in April of 2009.

1545
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,980
The game has revamped 3D graphics, more game modes, cooperative and competitive multiplayer

1546
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:27,460
support, six block types, and a level editor, as well as live leaderboards and a timeline

1547
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,140
of the game's history.

1548
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,180
So there you go, Lode Runner.

1549
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:35,140
Now Lode Runner, I'll mention this as well real quick, Lode Runner was also available

1550
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:38,940
on the Nintendo Entertainment System, so I see some of you guys probably remember it

1551
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:39,940
from there.

1552
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:44,940
Let me jump ahead to a little clip of this Lode Runner on the Nintendo Entertainment System,

1553
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:49,580
because obviously it had a little bit, it made a little more music when he was walking

1554
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:50,580
along.

1555
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:53,500
And it was weird too, because the screen would scroll around.

1556
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,940
I don't know if it's the way the game was designed or whatever, but the sprites were

1557
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:02,500
so big that the screen actually panned around to fit it all.

1558
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:07,260
And the other really, really interesting thing about the NES version, the enemies, the guards,

1559
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:08,260
were all Bomberman.

1560
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:11,260
I don't, like they look like Bomberman.

1561
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:15,980
I don't know why they did that, but they did, I guess maybe to recycle some sprites or something

1562
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:17,460
like that, I don't know.

1563
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:18,540
So there you go.

1564
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:21,300
There it is, your classic game of the week, Lode Runner.

1565
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:25,060
I remember it fondly on the Commodore 64, but I think most people probably started on

1566
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:29,580
the Apple IIe, or maybe even the Nintendo Entertainment System, but it's available a

1567
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:30,580
lot of different places.

1568
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:32,700
You ever played Lode Runner when you were a kid, Loki?

1569
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,900
I think so, I just don't remember.

1570
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:39,780
I'm trying to see, it doesn't look familiar, but maybe it did.

1571
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,220
I played a lot of different games.

1572
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:45,380
I would have thought the creation element of it would have really appealed to you.

1573
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:51,300
But remember back then though, I didn't really, it was hard to be on top of everything that

1574
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,340
came out, because you only had magazines.

1575
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:59,340
So I don't know if that ever came up on my radar.

1576
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:02,780
All right, well, you'll have to check it out at some point during the week.

1577
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:06,780
There's lots and lots of different ways to play it, and one of its sequel forms is nothing

1578
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:07,780
else.

1579
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:12,460
I still say the original's the best, and there's all those websites of questionable legality,

1580
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:15,300
but they allow you to play the old school computer games, right?

1581
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,860
Like the Apple IIe games, you know?

1582
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:20,220
So I'm sure if you Google it, you'll find a way to play Lode Runner, or remember that's

1583
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:21,220
L-O-D-E.

1584
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:26,980
Although I always kind of thought that was a tongue-in-cheek way of, you know, because

1585
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,900
you would load your user levels.

1586
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,900
I don't know.

1587
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:30,900
Anyway.

1588
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:31,900
All right, forget it.

1589
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,780
All right, that's going to do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but guys,

1590
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,780
don't go anywhere.

1591
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,220
We have plenty more show coming up right after this quick break.

1592
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,220
So don't go anywhere.

1593
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,220
We'll be right back.

1594
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:53,300
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June the 22nd of 2014

1595
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:56,180
with the 557th episode of our show.

1596
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:58,860
Just Loki and I here in studio tonight at our Sakura.

1597
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:02,580
She is out tonight, and yeah, no, Jason's not in town.

1598
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,500
He's back home in Colorado.

1599
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,180
Shane's doing something else online.

1600
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,180
Alan's at work.

1601
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:09,180
So all the usual standby people not available.

1602
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,900
So it's just Loki and I, just us.

1603
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:15,900
But you guys with us in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and on the Skype line

1604
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:20,340
in just a little while, you can add us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1605
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:21,380
That's all one word.

1606
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:24,740
Or you can always use the telephone, too, even though I think everybody in this day

1607
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,380
and age is really switching over to Skype.

1608
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,180
But 1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number.

1609
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:33,300
Speaking of Skype, if you do plan to call us that way, please do us all a courtesy.

1610
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:37,460
Call Echo 123 first before you call into the show.

1611
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:40,740
Just make sure that you're settings and you sound good and all that good stuff because

1612
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:45,740
nothing's worse than getting a call on the show live that goes, hello, hello, hello,

1613
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:46,740
hello, can you hear me?

1614
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:47,740
Hello.

1615
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:48,740
Hi.

1616
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,740
Hello.

1617
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,740
Hello.

1618
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:51,740
Are we here in the background?

1619
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:52,740
Are we here ourselves on repeat?

1620
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:55,540
I mean, as lovely as our voices are, you know, we don't need to hear ourselves.

1621
01:28:55,540 --> 01:29:00,180
So Echo 123 is always a good protocol.

1622
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:03,900
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1623
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,700
use the passphrase, beaver.

1624
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:11,820
All right, going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, they're still debating the whole scholarship

1625
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:12,820
thing that came up earlier.

1626
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:15,500
So we're gonna get into that in the FUGL Question of the Week.

1627
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:18,500
So if you weren't here live, you're missing some spirited debate tonight.

1628
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,740
And I don't mind spirited debate as long as everybody stays respectful, which everybody

1629
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:22,740
is.

1630
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:23,740
So we're cool.

1631
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,740
We're cool.

1632
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:25,740
But here's some more things to debate.

1633
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:26,740
It's rapid fire news.

1634
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,740
Let's do some other quick gaming stories.

1635
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,740
Loki.

1636
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:35,860
This week, there was, right before the Steam sale, there was this Team Fortress 2 update

1637
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:36,900
tease thing.

1638
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:42,700
And they've been kind of doing that throughout the week beforehand, where people would see

1639
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:46,300
randomly spawning bread when they would use a teleporter.

1640
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:51,660
And they kind of had to do with this whole, I forget what they called the update, the

1641
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,300
Love and War update.

1642
01:29:53,300 --> 01:30:05,580
They had this 15 minute long mini short film that they had made with the film editor.

1643
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,780
And hilarious.

1644
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:12,980
And it had to do with some of the bread stuff and teleporting and there's like a bread monster

1645
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:13,980
now.

1646
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,280
But on top of that, there's also some new actions.

1647
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:21,520
They have a new head-butting action square dancing, conga dancing, extreme flips, rock

1648
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,940
paper scissor.

1649
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:28,120
They also had some new items that appeared in the game as well.

1650
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:30,560
Like some more costumes, hats and that kind of stuff.

1651
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,400
Dance mode icons are very important, you know?

1652
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,120
So that's pretty cool.

1653
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,480
And definitely check out the short film if you haven't yet.

1654
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,480
It's pretty awesome.

1655
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:42,480
It's amazing that they are still cranking out updates to this game.

1656
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:49,800
And it kind of makes you want an actual film from Valve for Team Fortress 2.

1657
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:50,800
That's kind of what you got.

1658
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,800
It's just a short film.

1659
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,000
Yeah, but I want a full length video.

1660
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,640
I want a full one.

1661
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:58,640
It's pretty awesome.

1662
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,400
You know, Loki, we don't always get what we want.

1663
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,280
I want a playable version of your game.

1664
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,000
You will get that eventually.

1665
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,160
I'm just getting the end of the stuff done.

1666
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,640
He promised everybody episode 557.

1667
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,320
Hey, I'm hurrying.

1668
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:17,440
If you don't produce, I'm going to just start calling you Valve.

1669
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,360
No, no, no, see, I have to start.

1670
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,880
I'll have to do a Kickstarter first, you know, so they don't produce, yeah.

1671
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,880
And then, yeah.

1672
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:27,880
Alright.

1673
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:28,880
What else you got?

1674
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:36,500
Anyways, so on top of that, they've been, they started selling a text adventure game

1675
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:49,160
actually on Steam, and this one is called Heroes Rise, and it's a text-only game.

1676
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:55,180
It's pure text adventure without any sort of audio-visual elements to it, so talk about

1677
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,180
old school.

1678
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:58,220
But you can pick that up.

1679
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:01,620
They've got, they're on sale right now for $1.99 each.

1680
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:08,460
They have the Hero Project, the Prodigy, and I don't know if they had another one coming.

1681
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:12,100
I realize these are newer text adventure games, but can't you buy some of the classics on

1682
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:14,940
Steam like Zork and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?

1683
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:19,220
Maybe, I don't know if they were on there, but I don't know.

1684
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:20,220
It's newer.

1685
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:24,460
I mean, it's definitely an interesting genre, I guess.

1686
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:29,500
Well, you know, some people prefer reading a book because then you can make up the graphics

1687
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,220
yourself.

1688
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:35,020
I'm being serious with that comment, you know?

1689
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:40,780
And your graphics in your head, always running at 60 frames per second or higher.

1690
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:46,740
That's right, your mind is more powerful than current-gen systems.

1691
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:49,020
Always one step closer to the holodeck.

1692
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:50,020
Yeah.

1693
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,020
So.

1694
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,380
No Zork on Steam.

1695
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:56,380
I thought that some of the old- Good old games probably has it, though.

1696
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,900
Yeah, probably good old games.

1697
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,820
I used to be on GameTap.

1698
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:01,820
Remember GameTap?

1699
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:08,380
I used to love GameTap, and then they kind of sold and went to crap.

1700
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:11,260
But let's see, I'm looking right now to see if it's something that's available on good

1701
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:12,260
old games.

1702
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:16,540
Yes, the Zork Anthology is available for three bucks on good old games.

1703
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:23,460
And speaking of Kickstarter, a game that actually was pretty interesting when I got to check

1704
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:26,740
it out, the demo and stuff that they had, also built in Unity.

1705
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:32,500
Cat Lateral Damage, the first person kitty simulator where you as a cat knock over shit

1706
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:36,180
in your house and just generally piss off people.

1707
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:40,100
But to be a full cat sim, they had to add a few things.

1708
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:46,340
And with that, in this brand new video, they have the ability to take a nap, chase a mouse,

1709
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:47,340
chase a laser pointer.

1710
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,460
It is the pure cat sim.

1711
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:55,820
And they are looking to raise $40,000 by July 11th.

1712
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:59,580
And I believe, let's see where they're at here real quick, they were pretty far, yeah,

1713
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:00,580
they're gonna make it.

1714
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:04,100
They're at $36,218 and they've got 18 days to go.

1715
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,700
So it is gonna happen.

1716
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:08,660
People are loving what they're seeing in the cat simulator.

1717
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:10,340
So it's pretty awesome.

1718
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:15,500
I was gonna see real quick if they had any stretch goals that they are adding there.

1719
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:19,300
But definitely if you haven't gotten a chance to play the game yet, oh, here you go.

1720
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:22,540
New features and content that they've added since the demo.

1721
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,260
You can chase or ignore mice.

1722
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:25,780
You can play with them or catch them.

1723
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:30,540
You can sit in a box, lie in a sunbeam or both at once, chase a laser pointer and completely

1724
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:36,260
freak out, hack up a hairball, find lost cat toys under the couch and play with them, explore

1725
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:42,140
or hide underneath the bed, trip out on catnip, stand at a doorway and be indecisive about

1726
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:49,100
going in or out, meow using state of the art cutting edge meowing technology.

1727
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,700
Where's ignore the dog?

1728
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:51,700
Is that a-

1729
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,860
I don't know if there's a dog in the game yet.

1730
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,900
Maybe the sequel.

1731
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,260
It's pretty awesome.

1732
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:01,940
They're gonna try to get some procedurally generated houses and rooms that you can play.

1733
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:04,260
Lots of fun stuff.

1734
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:05,260
Go check it out.

1735
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:10,580
If you haven't played the demo yet, I think you can check it out on their website, maybe

1736
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,620
catlateraldamage.com or something.

1737
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:17,260
But if you go to the actual Kickstarter page, they have the web demo actually embedded in

1738
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:18,260
there.

1739
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,260
So if you wanna check it out, you can play it.

1740
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:20,900
Or they have a link to it, I guess.

1741
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:25,340
catlateraldamage.com slash play if you wanna check out the demo.

1742
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:28,660
Which I recommend you should if you haven't done it yet.

1743
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:32,100
They really should make cat lateral damage like an MMO.

1744
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:38,340
Where we could all coexist in the same cat person's apartment.

1745
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:44,380
You know, the cat owner that has like 50 cats, we can all exist in that one place.

1746
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:48,160
And here's something that maybe even Jamie, I don't know if she wants to pitch money towards

1747
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:54,360
a Kickstarter, but you can for $60 right now, if you pledge $60, you can make your

1748
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:58,200
cat famous and they will put a photo of your cat in the game as a frameboaster.

1749
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,200
Aw.

1750
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:06,720
In fact, they even had one if you pitched enough money, it was limited though, you can

1751
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,840
play as your cat in the game.

1752
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,400
So that's kinda cool.

1753
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,240
Fifth Dream in chat says, my cat is gonna be in cat lateral damage.

1754
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:16,680
So I guess Fifth Dream is to pony down that to get that in there.

1755
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,680
But that's awesome.

1756
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:24,160
You know, to give a shout out to an old Xbox indie arcade game that was made by our friend

1757
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:29,200
YYR, you remember about two years ago, he made Bungie Ferret Tossing, which is one of

1758
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,040
the OLR dream games we talked about.

1759
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,120
He made Bungie Ferret Tossing into a game.

1760
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:37,920
But the opening splash screen is a, you know, please don't actually harm animals because

1761
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:42,180
the joke is that they're explosive ferrets, but he has his responsible disclaimer that

1762
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:46,580
says this game is a joke and you don't actually want to harm animals.

1763
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:49,280
And he put pictures of animals in games.

1764
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:54,860
And so Alan's cats, Maruko, who is still alive at the time, and Sanrio, who is still around,

1765
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:58,900
they actually appear in Bungie Ferret Tossing, which is great.

1766
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:03,980
So even if my cats didn't get in cat lateral damage, they at least will forever be immortalized

1767
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,100
in one video game.

1768
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:07,420
So thank you to YYR for making that happen.

1769
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:14,660
All right, um, anyhow, let's talk about some other stories, including free things, yay,

1770
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:15,660
free things.

1771
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:19,540
It will involve Origin, however, so however you feel about that, although I gotta say,

1772
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:24,140
you know, as much as warmed up to it, as much as Origin has been the laughing stock of PC

1773
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:29,040
storefronts and all this over the years, they've made a lot, a lot, a lot of strides in the

1774
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,040
past couple of years.

1775
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:34,180
Yeah, the only thing that bugs me about Origin right now, and it's really just my sheer laziness

1776
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:37,300
about it, is that it auto loads when I start my PC.

1777
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,100
That's about the only thing that annoys me.

1778
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:43,120
Aside from that, though, I'm kind of over hating on Origin because I don't buy anything

1779
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:44,120
on it.

1780
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,120
So it's fine.

1781
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:48,960
It's really funny too, because a lot of people were like, well, everybody hated Steam at

1782
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,760
first, but then it grew into this thing that everybody loves.

1783
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,440
So now it's like, wow, we really do see like Origin going down so far, at least a similar

1784
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,440
path.

1785
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:59,880
And if they keep giving away free shit, it's pretty hard not to like it.

1786
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,200
The only problem with the free shit that they're giving away is it was all stuff they bought

1787
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,380
in that one EA Humble Bundle that they had.

1788
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:10,560
So it's like, oh, hey, Battlefield 3 is free, yeah, already got it, oh hey, you know, Dead

1789
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,120
Space is free, eh, already got it.

1790
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:15,320
I didn't have Dead Space, and I didn't have what they give away in Plants vs. Zombies,

1791
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:18,960
and I didn't have that either, so I was like, oh, score.

1792
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,720
Well, one game that they were giving away for free, at least for a 48 hour period, was

1793
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,720
Titanfall.

1794
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:28,440
Now, of course, their big competitor Steam does things like this, where you can like

1795
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:32,000
download a game for the weekend, well, Origin's got it too.

1796
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,320
Origin is making Titanfall free to download and play for 48 hours.

1797
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,720
However, this is the interesting thing about it.

1798
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:44,060
Unlike the Steam free weekend, Origin has the game free for a set period of time that

1799
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:47,720
starts when you begin playing.

1800
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:53,560
So you can make that weekend essentially whenever you want, so a 48 hour demo for you.

1801
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,880
Progress during this access is saved, and if you want to purchase the game after that,

1802
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,820
you can pick up right where you left off, so that's pretty cool, I gotta say.

1803
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:05,860
So Origin's stepping up their game a little bit with a very recent game there, Titanfall,

1804
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:08,920
which I'm sure they wouldn't mind selling a few more copies of.

1805
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:12,100
Bayonetta 2 is a game a lot of folks are looking forward to on the Wii U.

1806
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:15,140
I know I'm one of them, especially now that I know the original Bayonetta's gonna be with

1807
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:16,140
it too.

1808
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:17,140
That's pretty fucking rad.

1809
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:23,140
Well, to go in line with that, Funimation has agreed that they will release the Bayonetta

1810
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:27,140
Bloody Fate anime feature film in North America.

1811
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:32,020
Bayonetta Bloody Fate, of course, based on the Bayonetta games, which sees Bayonetta

1812
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:36,580
the Witch battling the forces of heaven in a quest to regain her memory.

1813
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:40,820
So there is no release date from Funimation yet, no release window either, but it does

1814
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:46,100
state that Funamori Kizaki will be on hand at Anime Expo in Los Angeles for a special

1815
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:50,220
sneak peek at the English dub, because I'm sure you're all excited about the English

1816
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,720
dub.

1817
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,680
The screening is happening on July 5th.

1818
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:59,460
I would imagine the movie should be timed around the game's release on Wii U.

1819
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,540
I would think that's the smart thing to do, but...

1820
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:05,740
Wonder if they'll ever make that into a live action movie.

1821
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,740
I think that might be a bit much.

1822
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:10,500
Have you played Bayonetta?

1823
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,500
It's a little crazy.

1824
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:16,200
They can have Angelina Jolie or something.

1825
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:20,180
Or who they get, they can have Mila Jilovich do it.

1826
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,180
Why not?

1827
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,180
Why not?

1828
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:26,900
Alright, now, could there be more functionality coming between the Wii U and the Nintendo

1829
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:29,100
3DS in the future?

1830
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:33,520
Miyamoto and Takahashi over at Nintendo have talked about that they have some more titles

1831
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,780
that utilize a connection between the Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS in the works.

1832
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:42,060
Now Super Smash Bros. will allow you to transfer character data between the two systems, but

1833
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,220
that's really all we know.

1834
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:45,300
However, there was a little more that came out.

1835
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:49,720
Quote, with Smash Bros., because the two games have the same gameplay and the same controls,

1836
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:52,740
that game in particular is designed where you want to start playing on the 3DS first

1837
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:56,460
and build up your characters there, and transfer that character data over to the Wii U and

1838
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:57,680
play with them there.

1839
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:00,520
There's no real reason that we haven't done it yet, I guess it just hasn't really fit

1840
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,760
into the titles that we have been making, and it's not that we haven't thought about

1841
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,760
it.

1842
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:08,000
In fact, with Wii Fit U, we created the Fit Meter, which connects to the Wii U gamepad

1843
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,040
wirelessly and transfers data.

1844
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:13,120
Within those plans, we also thought about potentially having some type of functionality

1845
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:16,740
with 3DS that would connect to it, but ultimately we didn't include it.

1846
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:20,140
We also had an idea where, if there's a Wii U at home, and maybe the father or kids have

1847
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:24,480
a 3DS, then we might think up a system where the Wii U would know that you were home before

1848
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,340
your dog did.

1849
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:29,360
It was kind of an interesting concept based around that, but we ended up not doing anything

1850
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:33,380
with the idea, it hasn't really worked its way into the titles we've been developing,

1851
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:36,960
but there are some things we're working on that we haven't announced at E3 that do involve

1852
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,760
some sort of communication between the Wii U and the 3DS, and then they go into a little

1853
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,760
bit of a banter.

1854
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,660
We can't say the title, can we?

1855
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:44,660
Not really.

1856
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:51,460
If you were to say it, they would really get excited, and they ended it with, we were thinking

1857
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:54,060
about that with Mario and Donkey Kong.

1858
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:59,580
I'm sorry, whenever they start talking about, hey, we have all this stuff planned, but we

1859
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:02,420
can't tell you about it yet, I don't fucking care.

1860
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:08,260
I just really don't care anymore, because it's just like, they can talk all about this

1861
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:11,820
wonderful plans and stuff, but it doesn't mean it's actually going to come out, and

1862
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:15,540
what they think is something that we'll get excited about isn't this.

1863
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:19,180
Don't get me wrong, there are people that love Pikmin, and there are probably a lot

1864
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:23,720
of people that love Pikmin 3, but for a lot of people, Pikmin 3, nobody gives a fucking

1865
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:28,880
shit about, and that's kind of where I'm at with this thing, it's like, cool, why don't

1866
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,720
we talk about what exactly you're saying, you know, what kind of interaction, you don't

1867
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:37,920
have to say the title, just say the interaction, like, give me an example in a generic sense.

1868
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,960
Maybe it would give it away, I don't know.

1869
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:40,960
No it wouldn't, I'm sure.

1870
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:47,480
JVMon in our chatroom says, please F0, yes, yes sir, yes sir, he said Mario Kart, I think

1871
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:53,140
honestly Nintendo probably has at least a year long lifespan plan for Mario Kart 8.

1872
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:56,100
They already talked, it's not on our show tonight, but they already announced that Mercedes

1873
01:42:56,100 --> 01:43:01,960
DLC is going to come to America, so we know the game is capable of handling DLC, how can

1874
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:06,980
there not be a meaty $20 DLC, because you know Nintendo doesn't skimp on DLC, they will

1875
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:12,180
do a meaty $20 DLC pack that's like tracks, racers, cars, they're going to extend the

1876
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:16,460
life of that game, they don't need to make a new F0, as much as it pains me to say it,

1877
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:20,420
because I really want a new F0, I'm going to have like an F0 track, aw that would piss

1878
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:24,900
me off, that would just be rubbing it, oh my god, if they made Mute City a track in

1879
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:32,420
Mario Kart 8, I would, I'll tweet a picture of my middle finger at Reggie, I will.

1880
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:35,300
Actually I shouldn't, no I'm going to have to do it.

1881
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:45,140
There, we'll see, I don't know, it's, here's my thing, and like I mentioned before, before

1882
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:49,540
I had to change my plans of what I was working on and stuff, I'm just not going to wait for

1883
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:59,060
them, you know, it's like listen, I'll make my own fucking F0, with hookers and blackjack.

1884
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:03,700
Oh my god, wait, you're going to just make F0, but instead of like these futuristic races,

1885
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:05,700
it's just going to be hookers.

1886
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:08,260
Hooker race 2015 or something like that.

1887
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:14,940
It wouldn't do anything with it, no seriously, I just, I wouldn't wait for them, just like

1888
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:21,500
you know, maybe my next project after I finish my game, someday hopefully, is do a new excite

1889
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,380
truck, because I'm tired of fucking waiting for a new excite truck, it's just never going

1890
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:25,380
to happen.

1891
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:26,380
Hooker race.

1892
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:31,780
No we're not going to do a hooker race, that's silly and stupid.

1893
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:36,740
I can't imagine a game that you designed doesn't have a little silly and stupid somewhere in

1894
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:37,740
it.

1895
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:42,700
Oh, there's plenty of silly and stupid planned, but I kind of want to make my kart racing

1896
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:51,100
game, because it would be, I have a lot of notes on the design for that, but uh, someday.

1897
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:56,780
Alright, speaking of your notes, let's go to the foogle question of the week, because

1898
01:44:56,780 --> 01:45:08,300
you take Facebook and Google Plus, and slam them together, and you get foogle.

1899
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:12,540
Thank you actdeft in our chat room, excitehooker, there you go, get on it Loki.

1900
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:18,820
In serious news though, going to our foogle question of the week, which is about the esports,

1901
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:22,580
which funny enough was kind of a debate in our chat room for a little bit, but we posted

1902
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:26,260
that a little earlier on our Facebook and Google Plus communities, facebook.com slash

1903
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:30,580
orange lounge radio, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, and here's the question,

1904
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:35,020
what do you think as a gamer about news, like league of legends becoming a varsity esports

1905
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:39,300
team at a college in the Chicago area, do esports deserve the same sort of recognition

1906
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:45,460
as more traditional sports, such as baseball, basketball, and soccer, p.s. happy world cup.

1907
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:48,660
Although I think I mentioned that towards the beginning of the show.

1908
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:53,380
Let's start over on Facebook, and we start with an answer from Renee, my pal from my

1909
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:59,300
killer queens from outer space podcast, and Renee says, I work at the university's rec center,

1910
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:02,500
and then it kind of clicked for me, I'm like well yeah Renee's in the Chicago area, and I knew he

1911
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:07,940
worked, I did not realize he was, so here we go, so Renee gives an interesting perspective here,

1912
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:12,580
and from that perspective, I think this is a great idea that will work towards bringing students

1913
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:17,460
together into a community of their own, make friends in that environment, and learn teamwork,

1914
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:22,260
leadership, camaraderie, and good sportsmanship, and give more choices to be involved with other

1915
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:27,380
students in university life, but I'm sure that answer's got to be a little bit biased, no,

1916
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:32,900
you make a convincing argument, you do, and ER says, I think it's a good thing, I'm not a huge

1917
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:37,300
fan of esports or sports in general, but I did play fighting games at a decent level for a while,

1918
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:41,220
and I can attest that it takes just as much practice to be competitive at a video game

1919
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:46,340
as it does a sport, Raginator says, it's about damn time esports got some recognition,

1920
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:53,060
JV Mon says, esports shouldn't be a varsity team in college, it's just a PC game, if gaming can be

1921
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:59,220
a college sport, I want varsity edition of RuPaul's Drag U with queens from the top colleges, take just

1922
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:05,700
as much talent and practice as games and sports, so why not, could lip sync for your life be an

1923
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:09,860
Olympic sport, that would actually be kind of rad, because it's not that dissimilar from ice

1924
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:14,900
dancing, people, all right, Degenerate Johnny says, as traditional sports such as baseball,

1925
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:19,460
soccer, and basketball concentrate on the physical skills of athletes, so does esports in regards to

1926
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:24,340
the cerebral skill of gamers, however, the best part about esports is that it's competition that

1927
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:29,620
both genders can compete as equals, I believe as esports grow in popularity, we will see more of

1928
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:35,540
a variety of games enter into the group of esports games that already exist, such as MOBAs, lol

1929
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:41,140
Dota, RTSs, Starcraft, and digital card games, Hearthstone, Hex Shards of Fate, you know, you go

1930
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:44,820
down a really interesting slope though with that answer where the whole both genders compete as

1931
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:49,380
equals, I realize that, you know, in most professional sports right now, that's not the way

1932
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:55,620
it works, but there's a lot of people kind of clamoring for, I seem to remember years ago, wasn't

1933
01:47:55,620 --> 01:48:01,060
there a woman who was like getting really far into getting into an NHL team, I want to say it was

1934
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:05,780
hockey, maybe SSG100 remembers this better than I do, but according, then you have like NASCAR,

1935
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:12,020
you know, and a factor, but obviously these are very few sprinklings of, you know, women in what

1936
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:18,340
have typically been male-dominated sports, so it's, that's an interesting, very, very interesting,

1937
01:48:18,340 --> 01:48:23,620
you know, answer there in that regard, so, but it is, it's kind of a slippery slope to begin with,

1938
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:27,860
because I think many would argue that, you know, both genders should be competing as equals in the

1939
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:35,380
other sports too. Anyway, Awesome Unicorn says, well, I don't personally find MOBAs appealing,

1940
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:39,860
I am definitely supportive of gaming being taken seriously, I'm still a little concerned about if

1941
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:45,220
games with a fantasy skin like League of Legends or Dota will be taken as seriously by the general

1942
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:50,580
public compared to, let's say, a war-themed game with a Command & Conquer skin. Critical Myth says,

1943
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:54,900
I'm for it in general, but I'm not sure that a game infamous for its brutal and disgusting online

1944
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:58,980
environment should be the game to get the attention credibility, but I realize that's more

1945
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:04,180
of a function of which game the community supports more than any other reason. You know what, that's

1946
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:09,700
a really important answer, is that, you know, League of Legends and some of those MOBAs have

1947
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:15,300
really toxic online environments. They're really, really bad when you get that anonymity. Hopefully

1948
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:22,260
this brings a little more classiness to it, but I think though, I mean, and it goes without saying,

1949
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:27,860
there's certainly some toxic environments when it comes to, you know, shit talking in basketball

1950
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:34,020
games and baseball games and things like that too. Unfortunately, that sort of trolling isn't

1951
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:42,660
exclusive to MOBAs. However, and this is important, when you can be anonymous, like in a computer game

1952
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:46,980
like League of Legends, it's a little easier to say some shit you wouldn't say to my face,

1953
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:54,420
like you'd have to do in baseball or basketball. So that's something. All right. Let's see. Also,

1954
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:59,460
we have DJ Rama S who says, frankly, it's bullshit to get a scholarship for playing a damn game. What

1955
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:03,940
the hell do you need a scholarship for that? You can't take courses in video gaming in that aspect,

1956
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:08,020
and I don't see the point in it either. If they're doing that, then I expect scholarships to be

1957
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:12,820
handed out for computer building and networking as well. Want to impress me? Give them a scholarship

1958
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:18,340
designing the game instead of playing a game. It's a joke. This is some very diversifying opinions

1959
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:25,700
there over on Facebook. Let's go over to Google Plus and see what folks said over there because

1960
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:29,780
I've been waiting for it to load. Fantastic live radio. Okay. We have a few comments here,

1961
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:34,980
starting with Redertainment who says, I'm sorry, but I can't leave my gamer hat on for this.

1962
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:39,860
As a member of the community, I would have a problem with my chronically underfunded public

1963
01:50:39,860 --> 01:50:46,180
schools spending a large amount of money on a sports program, even if that sport is esports.

1964
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:49,620
Was this school a public school or a private school?

1965
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:54,900
I don't think it's... I don't... It sounded like a private school.

1966
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:58,660
Not to discount the opinion here, but just wanted to make sure that clarification is out there.

1967
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:03,940
Ronnie B over on Google Plus says, I expect virtual sports to become more and more of a

1968
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:08,820
serious and accepted thing in society as we head into the future. With the advancing hardware like

1969
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:13,700
the Rift, Glass, Kinect, Morpheus, and even some cell phones being the start of mixing the physical

1970
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:18,740
world with a networked virtual world, entertainment will likely take on a whole new level quicker than

1971
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:23,700
we thought. Although the media, also the media always tries to link gaming with most tragic

1972
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:32,180
events. So this is a bit interesting. And lastly, Act Def says, think the problem here is or not

1973
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:36,740
recognized as a competitive pastime or whether it's considered a varsity thing or not. I think

1974
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:41,780
the problem resides in calling it a sport or esport. I mean, there are other things that could

1975
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:47,940
get you a scholarship for college, but we need to separate physical sports from esports. Hmm.

1976
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:51,460
Interesting perspective there is that, you know, there are many things you can get a scholarship

1977
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:57,460
to college for. This isn't a sport. It's an esport. Hmm. Interesting. All right.

1978
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:03,380
Kaijuto in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says they should give them a digital

1979
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:10,820
scholarship. It's good for 500 Microsoft points. I like that sassy answer. All right. Let's get

1980
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:14,740
back into some other news. Hey, don't forget to friend us on Facebook and Google Plus so you can

1981
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:23,140
answer our future questions in the weeks to come. Loki. All right. So let's see. Speaking of

1982
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:32,180
things we may not consider sports, there's a fake EA Sports Instagram account. And this has to do

1983
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:43,220
with FIFA 14 Ultimate Team. I guess EA Sports UT 2014 is the account and it's not legit. In fact,

1984
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:53,060
it's actually trying to fish logins for Xbox Live in origin. Apparently they're offering free

1985
01:52:53,060 --> 01:53:00,420
in-game currency on the account. And if you log in to try to get this free in-game currency,

1986
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:07,140
it'll ask for your login details and that's where they get you. So then you'll have, you know,

1987
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:13,620
people buying FIFA Ultimate Team cards on your account. Kind of like how they've done past

1988
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:19,220
FIFA games. Hackers are going to steal your money. Hackers going to hack.

1989
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:27,060
All right. Speaking of EA, you know, when Battlefield 4 launched, I don't know how many

1990
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:32,980
of you guys tried to get in there and play it, but online was fucked. Did you try to play

1991
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:37,460
Battlefield 4 online at all? Nope. This isn't the type of game that's usually up my alley.

1992
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:41,540
So I kind of missed this whole thing, but I did definitely saw the rants and raves on

1993
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:48,420
Twitter and so forth. So yeah, Battlefield 4 launched and players had months of connectivity

1994
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:55,700
issues. EA delayed development of the promised DLC packs in order of fixing the bugs in the game.

1995
01:53:57,780 --> 01:54:03,860
Now, what's interesting is the CEO of EA, Andrew Wilson, has kind of owned up to some of the

1996
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:08,660
problems of Battlefield 4 this week, talking about, and I guess blaming it of sorts, on the

1997
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:14,580
game's online scope. So here's the quote, quote, for me, the situation we had was unacceptable.

1998
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:19,380
For the team, it was unacceptable. We have worked tirelessly since then to make sure the gameplay

1999
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:23,540
experience got to where it absolutely should have been at launch. And we're focused on that,

2000
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:28,820
and we continue to deliver that value to the player base. Now, notice there's not an apology

2001
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:35,940
there. Now, also, he will not say that, you know, future games will be bug free, but that would be

2002
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:42,660
a foolish claim to make, I think. So yeah, and according to some people that got to check out

2003
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:48,180
the Battlefield Hardline Beta, or Alpha, I guess, I don't know, Alpha, Beta, whatever it was,

2004
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:54,260
apparently, it plays very similar to Battlefield 4, and some of the glitches that you see in

2005
01:54:54,260 --> 01:55:00,500
Battlefield 4, you're seeing in Hardline, so. Wow. Hopefully, the netcode should be better.

2006
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:05,460
I mean, since it's, I'm assuming using the same engine, and hopefully they can just transfer that

2007
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:12,180
over, but it is a different developer, so cross your fingers, I guess. It's more of like, I think,

2008
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:16,900
maybe, if anything, consumers can learn to be a little bit cautious, maybe not jump in immediately

2009
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:21,700
for day one, just kind of see how it's playing, because obviously, it's going to be a focus of

2010
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:26,100
a lot of the reviews, especially ever since, like, you know, SimCity and Diablo 3 and stuff,

2011
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:31,140
it's just got to see how those servers are handling things. Let me read the quote about

2012
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:35,460
not making promises about being bug free, because I think it's interesting. So again, Andrew Wilson,

2013
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:40,740
the CEO of EA, goes on to say, quote, it would be disingenuous for me to sit here and say,

2014
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:44,740
we will never have an issue again, because that would mean we are never going to push the

2015
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:48,900
boundaries again, and I don't want to be that company. I want to be a company that pushes to

2016
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:53,380
lead and innovate and be creative, but you can start to do things that give you a better handle

2017
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:57,620
and a better view about what the potential challenges might be. Yeah, but that's not being

2018
01:55:57,620 --> 01:56:02,580
innovative, that's being like, you know, that's basically saying, hey, you know what, we're going

2019
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:09,460
to go ahead and purchase this many servers for this game, and we're going to hope that not a lot

2020
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:13,220
of people play it, maybe buggy at first, but we're going to save a lot of money in the long run

2021
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:20,980
once that initial, you know, kind of spike subsides. So did they not know how many pre-orders

2022
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:24,820
the game had or something? It's not, it doesn't matter, because even if they know how many pre-orders

2023
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:29,220
they have, they know that not everybody is playing at exactly the same time, so they're never going

2024
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:34,820
to have enough server spots open for every single person. That's, that's the thing, that's the gamble

2025
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:39,700
is you could do that if you, you know, ideally you could say, okay, we know how many copies of this

2026
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:45,540
game we're printing, so this is how many server spots we're going to have open, but then again,

2027
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:50,740
you're going to lose money because you're going to have all these servers that you aren't utilizing.

2028
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:54,740
It gets a little easier when you start using, like, these virtual servers through, I think,

2029
01:56:54,740 --> 01:57:01,540
like Amazon and, you know, like Microsoft Azure servers or whatever, where they can scale it

2030
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:08,100
dynamically, and so they're not having to purchase all these servers, it's just, it's a lot easier,

2031
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:16,180
a lot more flexible, but I don't know. I just think it's like, you know, what was it, last year,

2032
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:23,300
you know, or was it SimCity, perfect example here, yeah, we saw how shitty the Diablo 3 launch was,

2033
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:28,420
it's not gonna be like that with SimCity, and then it was fucking terrible, so I don't buy whenever

2034
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:33,780
a company tells me that it's not gonna be fucking terrible after the last launch was terrible,

2035
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:39,860
because it seems like every MMO, they don't learn their lesson, every MMO that launches

2036
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:45,460
has this problem too, yeah, every single one of them, I mean, some difficulties, you know,

2037
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:50,500
a little bit of, you know, hiccups here and there are okay, I think, I kind of expected, but when

2038
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:56,420
it's just fucked up, you know, and we're not even talking, like, that their servers are being

2039
01:57:56,420 --> 01:58:02,580
overrun, it's just bad netcode, like the game just wasn't working very well, that's a little

2040
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:08,900
bit different, so hopefully they got that ironed out for the next game. All right, I think we have

2041
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:14,820
one more story here, and then we're gonna get to the mailbag and the FUs. All right, so game I

2042
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:19,300
didn't really get to play, but remember last week asking about, hey, whatever happened to Ridge

2043
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:25,940
Racer, and one of the games that, you know, they put out last was Ridge Racer Driftopia, well,

2044
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:32,020
apparently that didn't do too well, it was a free-to-play game that was on PlayStation 3 and PC,

2045
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:39,860
came out, I want to say, like, last year sometime, developed by Bugbear, and they had, like, an early

2046
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:45,860
access version of the game that came out in August 2013, it was like a beta, and never, I don't think,

2047
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:54,500
really left beta, but now it's being shut down. They're closing off the servers August 15th,

2048
01:58:55,140 --> 01:59:01,780
and so, yeah, so much for Ridge Racer. I don't know why the FU music started playing right there, but it

2049
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:07,700
would seem very well timed, but yeah, so unfortunately, you know, if you wanted to play

2050
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:13,460
Ridge Racer Driftopia, you might want to get into it now, before that, you know, they shut the

2051
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:18,500
servers down, but apparently it's not that great. Actdeft in our chat says, Driftopia was meh,

2052
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:27,620
so I want a real, like, I want a good, you know, PlayStation 4, Xbox One Ridge Racer game from

2053
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:34,660
Namco, like, it would be fantastic. Give me, like, a new, like, R4, you know, quality game.

2054
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:40,980
That's what I want to see. Actdeft is saying, it wasn't, like, bad, but god, it was pay-to-win,

2055
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:47,140
so that seems to be its issue. Yeah, they had, they really hoarded the last, was it the Ridge

2056
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:52,260
Racer game for Vita? I remember it just soured everything, kind of like, man, I was looking

2057
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:56,580
forward to the Vita Ridge Racer game, and then it's like, oh, it's 30 bucks, but you only get,

2058
01:59:56,580 --> 02:00:00,980
like, four tracks, and, you know, or four cars in, like, a few tracks, and you have to buy the

2059
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:08,820
rest, and it's like, you know, you guys suck. All right, well, let's go to the mailbag. Every week,

2060
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:14,900
you guys email us, mailbag at, excuse me, participate at orangeloungeradio.com. I mentioned

2061
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:18,260
it's 12 years old, and we had the same email address for 11 and a half of those years.

2062
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:24,580
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is a place to send us an email, and we read your emails here

2063
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:29,380
on the show. Usually DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and reads some of her favorite emails,

2064
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:35,540
but since she's not here, the task has fallen to me, and we have four emails tonight. But,

2065
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:38,580
look, you gotta respond to these two. Without DarkSakura here, I'm gonna need your help,

2066
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:42,740
all right? So, let's start with this first email, which comes from our pal, Critical Myth,

2067
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:47,700
one of the hosts, and I suppose the namesake of sorts behind the Critical Myth podcast,

2068
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:51,460
which airs Monday, Wednesday, Fridays at the Voice of the East Network, vognetwork.com.

2069
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:56,740
John from Critical Myth writes us and says, hey, OLR crew, I was listening to the commentary on

2070
02:00:56,740 --> 02:01:00,660
Ubisoft's fumble over the multiplayer co-op in Assassin's Creed Unity, and as a huge fan

2071
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:05,140
of the franchise, a few statements were made that I think were unfair or uninformed. First, Rob,

2072
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:09,060
at one point, you mentioned that the defense given in the written statement smacked of the,

2073
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:13,940
quote, I have a black friend trope. What maybe isn't apparent is that the statement made by

2074
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:17,700
Ubisoft is practically word for word the disclaimer presented at the start of every

2075
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:22,020
Assassin's Creed game. It was originally required because the first game is, after all,

2076
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:26,100
about Middle Eastern Arabs fighting and killing Christian Templars, and there was a bit of

2077
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:31,780
controversy over that at the time. In the larger context, who do we have as playable lead characters?

2078
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:38,340
Altair, Ezio, Connor, Aveline, Edward, Adewell, Arno, and Desmond. So, five out of eight are

2079
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:43,300
persons of color, or at least of prominently non-European descent. I don't think token

2080
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:47,460
representation is really an issue, especially when distinct cultural backgrounds are inherent

2081
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:52,100
to the plot and character development in the games they headline. I have a feeling, and I gotta

2082
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:55,460
go back to what I said last week, so I'm gonna be honest, I don't even remember, but I have a

2083
02:01:55,460 --> 02:02:00,660
feeling I wasn't trying to say that as a direct thing. I was trying to kind of say it as a

2084
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:06,900
comparison, but I did neglect the fact that this is a standard disclaimer that they've been using

2085
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:11,700
for a long time about the whole thing, but I'm sorry, that disclaimer doesn't really get them

2086
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:17,300
out of the hot water of the statement that they made about, you know, essentially it's too hard

2087
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:23,140
to put a woman in a video game, which is what it came off as. Whether they have this history or not,

2088
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:28,580
you know, perception is a huge chunk of it, right? And the way the message is delivered,

2089
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:34,580
and unfortunately the way Ubisoft's line came out was, you know, that, oh, we just, you know,

2090
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:39,620
we don't really have time for women. That's how it came across. You know what it really is? It's

2091
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:47,380
just the AI so good, this is gonna be totally gender... whatever. I don't care. It's very

2092
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:52,020
inappropriate of me to say this, but anyways, um, yeah, me of course. Well, let's be real,

2093
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:55,540
it won't be the first inappropriate thing you say on the show, so enjoy it while Jamie talks.

2094
02:02:55,540 --> 02:03:01,140
The AI is so good, it's just, she can't decide what to wear before she goes out and, you know,

2095
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:06,340
and assassinate people, and so unfortunately they just, they can't get the character out there.

2096
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:09,460
You're only saying this because you know if Dark Sakura were here, she'd chuck her

2097
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:14,340
shoe at you right now, and luckily she ain't here to kick your butt, so all right.

2098
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:19,060
And it's, it's only mildly funny, but no, seriously, it's just, they just made excuses.

2099
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:22,900
All right, at least you admit it's a cheap joke. All right, uh, okay, let's go back to the email

2100
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:27,460
here, uh, which brings me to my second point. When Aveline was mentioned as headlining

2101
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:32,020
Assassin's Creed Liberation, Jamie quickly dismissed her as, quote, token female character.

2102
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:36,500
This is gross misrepresentation of the situation. Aveline was the lead character in what was

2103
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:41,220
intended to be a triple-A flagship title for the Vita, a game that received significant promotion.

2104
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:45,540
The entire game was centered around a woman of mixed heritage living in colonial New Orleans.

2105
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:50,100
That's about as far from a, quote, token female character as it gets. In fact, it aligns far more

2106
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:54,180
with the positive elements you cited for Tomb Raider. What might not be apparent to those who

2107
02:03:54,180 --> 02:03:58,420
didn't play the games or follow the franchise is that players were able to choose female character

2108
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:03,140
models for multiplayer from the start. Even before that, one could recruit both male and

2109
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:08,180
female assassins to join the, quote, brotherhood. The intense criticisms of Ubisoft come not from

2110
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:13,220
the standpoint of, here we go again, but rather, why is this an issue now? It runs counter to the

2111
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:18,420
past several years or games of the franchise. I understand that, and I respect that, but I,

2112
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:21,860
I think, and Jamie's not here to really respond to this, unfortunately, so I'm gonna have to take

2113
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:28,900
my best guess and try to interpret her point here, but I don't think it was necessary that,

2114
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:35,620
necessarily, that Aveline was a token female character in that game, but when they were using

2115
02:04:35,620 --> 02:04:41,460
her as the defense, she suddenly felt like the token female character, because like, oh, oh,

2116
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:45,780
oh, but, but here, look, look at this over here, over here in this completely different game in

2117
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:51,620
the franchise. We did this, this whole other thing, but that still doesn't explain why you

2118
02:04:51,620 --> 02:04:59,060
said it would take all this money to create female in co-op mode and, and all the, the clothes and

2119
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:04,820
all this stuff, yet Sunset Overdrive shades you in literally less than a week after E3. You know

2120
02:05:04,820 --> 02:05:09,220
what I mean? It's just that's, that's the disconnect. And if we're going to do like,

2121
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:13,940
oh, well, it's motion capping and stuff like that. There's a pretty interesting movement going on in

2122
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:20,500
Sunset Overdrive. So, I don't know. Uh, on another topic, I would agree. Well,

2123
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:24,500
before we get to the other topic, I just want to say, you know, I, I hope even though we're

2124
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:28,980
continuing a debate here, I totally respect your viewpoint. And I understand there's a lot of fans

2125
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:34,740
of the Assassin's Creed series who are very frustrated by what's going on, but I'm not sure

2126
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:41,060
that's as much about the game itself as it is a commentary on the industry, because like I said,

2127
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:47,060
this whole dam has been waiting to burst. And unfortunately it took this pull quote and this

2128
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:50,820
circumstance for this. Oh, I shouldn't say unfortunately, because this needed to happen.

2129
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:55,780
It's just, if you're sitting in Ubisoft shoes or you're an Assassin's Creed fan right now,

2130
02:05:55,780 --> 02:06:00,420
it's kind of unfortunate. I will say this. I saw a demo of the game at E3 and it looks pretty

2131
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:04,980
darn good. I don't usually super get into these Assassin's Creed games, but Assassin's Creed

2132
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:08,260
Unity looked like it might be pretty sweet and some of the co-op stuff. Yeah, it looks pretty

2133
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:13,460
cool, but I can also see how it's frustrating where like, you know, if you're a female gamer

2134
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:19,140
that was hoping to be the female slashing people up, it's not there for you. And their reason why

2135
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:24,820
is kind of crappy. But anyway, I just want to say, I, I, I do respect the opinion and I understand

2136
02:06:24,820 --> 02:06:29,460
why Assassin's Creed's, uh, fan base is probably a little frustrated at why is this happening to

2137
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:35,300
my franchise? Why did you have to open your mouth? All right. On another topic, I would agree that

2138
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:39,620
Nintendo came out strong this E3. What I find regrettable is that many of the games sound great,

2139
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:43,300
especially the new Zelda, but then I remember that I would have to deal with those awful Wii

2140
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:48,100
controllers and my interest takes a nosedive. If the games were fully playable using classic

2141
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:52,660
controllers versus the game pad motion control nonsense, I'd be far more inclined to take the

2142
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:58,100
plunge. I think at least Smash Brothers, I mean, you can do the GameCube controller and all that,

2143
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:03,380
but as far as Zelda goes, they have like a Wii U pro controller that they sell and a lot of Nintendo's

2144
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:07,860
first party games, which is pretty much all that's on the Wii U supports that. Yeah. I think that

2145
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:11,540
would probably be more of a tradition, especially because if they're going to be using the game pad,

2146
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:16,420
it's gonna, it's gonna use that. They're not going to be using the Wii remote. They may have a mode

2147
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:20,420
if you want to do Wii remote and nunchuck, but I think it's probably going to be Mario Kart 8. You

2148
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:25,860
can do Wii remote nunchuck. Yeah. So I will say this. I mean, I, you know, everybody has their

2149
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:30,420
own opinion or whatever. I don't think the game pads as bad as a lot of people think it is. I

2150
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:35,300
mean, yeah, it's big, but when I'm holding it, it actually feels really comfortable. I prefer it

2151
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:40,100
to an Xbox 360 controller. That's for sure. That's the one I can't stand is a 360 controller. At

2152
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:46,980
least the D pad on the game pad works. Anyway, uh, one last thing I thought everyone knew that

2153
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:52,340
Rob's real name is Danny Fantastico. How dare you? How dare you out me on the show? All right,

2154
02:07:52,340 --> 02:07:56,900
here it is. John from Critical Myth, uh, sending us that first email. Let's get to the next email,

2155
02:07:56,900 --> 02:08:03,220
which the subject line is yo, which I can't help but think of that app that everybody's talking

2156
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:08,740
about this week. If you heard about the yo app, all you do is you said you said yo's to friends.

2157
02:08:08,740 --> 02:08:16,580
So it just pops up on the phone. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Wow. That's like only, only like a couple

2158
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:23,300
decades away from was it? It is serious. It's like the flappy bird of social networking apps

2159
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:29,540
right now. It's like, why out of all of the social network apps is this one? The one everybody's

2160
02:08:29,540 --> 02:08:36,100
talking about is it's stupid. And with all due respect to the creator of flappy bird,

2161
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:39,620
who I admire being just one person, but it's still like, why out of all the games

2162
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:47,060
on the marketplace are we fucking fixated on flappy bird? I don't know. All right. Anyhow,

2163
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:52,260
uh, this email is actually from serious turtle who sent us the subject of yo who says, I want

2164
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:57,140
to bring up two things. First, Jamie, good old games just had to the moon on sale for a dollar

2165
02:08:57,140 --> 02:09:02,660
99. I bought it solely on your strong recommendation and I need another game to make me cry.

2166
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:07,540
I don't play too many eight bit RPGs. So that's a testament to how convincing your sales pitch was.

2167
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:11,540
I'll let you know what I think when I play a few hours, we'll wait, we'll wait for the followup,

2168
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:15,700
which good thing there'll be a followup cause Jamie's not here tonight. And secondly, I wanted

2169
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:20,260
to let Shane know who also isn't here. Maybe he'll hear me. Maybe he's listening to the show. I don't

2170
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:24,900
know. But a serious turtle said, I want to let Shane know that I'm playing Pokemon X. This is

2171
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:29,780
my first Pokemon game ever. And it definitely took me four to five hours to start to get into it.

2172
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:34,340
But now that I'm 12 hours in, I'm really enjoying it. And even though Shane sounds like Eeyore from

2173
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:41,700
Winnie the Pooh, maybe it's a good thing he's not in the room. I still thought that he might crack

2174
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:47,300
a smile at a Pokemon noob joining the ranks as always love the show and depend on your Monday

2175
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:54,020
podcast to start my week off right. Well, no pressure. Your loyal turtle in Philly, serious

2176
02:09:54,020 --> 02:10:03,060
turtle. No pressure. I depend on your podcast. No weeks off for me. You better have a game plan

2177
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:12,020
come July. You better take the day off. All right. Next question from EA Skizy, who is taking the

2178
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:16,660
opportunity to turn our mailbag segment into like Ask Orange Lounge every week with his questions.

2179
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:22,500
But you know, I put the mailbag out there for everybody. And if Skizy is going to be one of

2180
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:28,500
four people. Oh no, Shane's listening to the show. Uh oh. Come here, Shane. Come here, come here.

2181
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:33,220
Shane just burst into the room saying, I do not sound like Eeyore. Did you hear that email?

2182
02:10:33,940 --> 02:10:39,460
Yes. And what would you like to say to the Pokemon noob who got into Pokemon X,

2183
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:43,300
even though he called you Eeyore? Congratulations. And you're an idiot.

2184
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:53,380
Could the mic pick that up when he literally came in the kitchen and screamed, I'm not Eeyore.

2185
02:10:53,380 --> 02:10:56,020
I don't know. I guess we'll find out. I guess we'll find out.

2186
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:01,860
All right. Anyhow, back to EA. The chat room's cracking up. All right.

2187
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:10,180
On to EA Skizy's email who says, hello, Orange Lounge guys and gal. If you could commit just

2188
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:16,260
one crime free of punishment, no matter the severity of the crime, what would it be and why?

2189
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:21,940
Jamie isn't allowed to rob any taco stands because seriously, those guys are working hard. They don't

2190
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:27,300
need that. Come on. Take it easy people. EA Skizy from Milwaukee. And they, by the way, they do say

2191
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:31,940
they did hear Shane yelling all the way over there on the stream. All right. There you go. Live radio.

2192
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:37,220
It's hilarious. Back to, um, back to Skizy's question. Uh, what is the one crime you would

2193
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:41,780
do if free of punishment? Well, sadly, Jamie's not here to say how she would rob a taco stand,

2194
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:45,220
but, uh, I'll ask Loki. What would you, what would you, what would be your crime

2195
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:48,340
free of punishment? Oh, something that gives me a lot of money, I guess.

2196
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:52,500
That's funny. Cause that's where my mind was. That is. I think the crime I would commit is

2197
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:57,220
robbing a bank. I wouldn't hurt anybody. I wouldn't hurt anybody. I just, I just want

2198
02:11:57,220 --> 02:12:03,300
the money. Thanks. You said free of punishment, right? I wouldn't even rob a bank, rob like the

2199
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:08,980
mint or something or like, you know, somehow get all the money that Comcast makes in a year or

2200
02:12:08,980 --> 02:12:12,740
something. I don't know. Just, well, I also, I don't know. I guess I really have to give this

2201
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:17,540
more thought because like I wouldn't want to take money from people. I want money that insurance

2202
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:21,780
will reimburse or something where the money doesn't directly come out of, you know, people's

2203
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:27,060
accounts. I got it. I got a crime. That'd be perfect. Michael Bay direct the next star Wars

2204
02:12:27,060 --> 02:12:36,500
film. There you go. There's a crime. That's the crime you commit of all the crimes.

2205
02:12:37,140 --> 02:12:41,780
That'd be hilarious. Just like, let me cast, let me like write the script or whatever for the next

2206
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:48,020
star Wars film. It won't make any fucking sense at all. It'll be awesome. No, I don't know. Money,

2207
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:53,140
of course. Cause you know. You have to remember guys, I'm coming off a 13 episode marathon of

2208
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:58,020
orange is the new black. I'm afraid to commit a crime right now. All right. I am not going to

2209
02:12:58,020 --> 02:13:03,860
prison ever cause they'd be crazy in prison. And I realized that was a woman's prison, but

2210
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:07,780
you know, men have just as much drama. If not more, I wonder if there'll be a spinoff series.

2211
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:17,460
All right. Anyway. Well, they, they had men in the first part of it was spoilers. OMG.

2212
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:24,500
I think the first episode of season two. All right. No, he didn't spoil anything. Don't worry.

2213
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:31,300
All right. Uh, last email tonight from dr. Noir who emails us, uh, uh, entitled gaming in Belgium.

2214
02:13:31,700 --> 02:13:37,300
Hmm. Uh, I'm going to totally mispronounce this first sentence. Uh, because that's what

2215
02:13:37,300 --> 02:13:43,300
happens when you send me, uh, non English words to open your emails, but born that night,

2216
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:50,100
madam at Mrs. Day orange lounge. Greetings from your globe trotting correspondent, dr. Noir.

2217
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:54,740
I just spent the last week in Brussels and I have to say, I am surprised by the absence of video

2218
02:13:54,740 --> 02:14:00,660
games in the country. I was at first encouraged by the presence of niche of PS four. Don't worry.

2219
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:05,460
They'll sprout up there eventually. PS four and Vita kiosks at the airport when I arrived,

2220
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:11,780
but if since to find so not so much as a poster or advert for any sort of video game during my stay,

2221
02:14:11,780 --> 02:14:17,540
not on TV print or billboards on the streets. This is surprising because even though I am,

2222
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:22,260
my travels often take me to business settings in much of Latin America and I don't do too much

2223
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:27,300
tourist exploring. I usually find some sort of video game shop at a mall or even a mom and pop

2224
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:33,540
store peddling use games here and there here. Zero zip nada. I wonder if this is just a fluke

2225
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:37,380
since I spent most of my time in the business and museum sectors, but I did go into one of the

2226
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:42,340
shopping districts and take the subway and buses several times and I usually see at least a poster

2227
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:46,900
or billboard there. Hopefully some of the local Belgian listeners can confirm. Yeah, we, I,

2228
02:14:46,900 --> 02:14:51,140
there's been at least two people from Belgium who have emailed us before, so maybe they can

2229
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:55,060
give perspective. Where are you hiding? Where are you all hiding? Is there, is there like a club

2230
02:14:55,060 --> 02:15:00,180
that you have to be in over there to find all the cool gaming stuff? I don't know. Anyway,

2231
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:04,660
Dr. Noir continues, in any case, what I did find is a good number of board games and even managed

2232
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:09,140
to pick up a variation on the standard memory games for my kids, which should provide lots of

2233
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:14,020
fun. It's called Shadow Monsters and the twist is that it includes three pairs of scary monsters in

2234
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:19,220
the deck and if any of them come up and you do not match them, hijinks ensue. One of them has,

2235
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:24,340
you pass your one stack to the right, another to the left, and the last, my favorite, shuffles the

2236
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:29,460
remaining tiles in play. Also, the game matches the monster's image with their shadow, so it

2237
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:36,020
makes the memorization a bit more difficult and suitable for adults or older kids. I also snagged

2238
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:40,260
a bunch of lead figures of Roman medieval and renaissance soldiers that will see great use in

2239
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:46,020
my D&D games in the near future. Anyhow, I should get to my gate now, so here's to, here's a salute

2240
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:53,140
before 10 hours of flight time. Have a great week. Well, interesting. You know, and, and we talk

2241
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:56,500
about that here on the show is that, you know, we're in a very interesting perspective with this

2242
02:15:56,500 --> 02:16:02,900
podcasting and radio or on the internet. You know, a lot of radio up until, you know, internet radio

2243
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:08,100
was born was confined to local news and local things, you know, but now that we have the, the

2244
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:12,900
power to reach the world, we really have to be mindful sometimes is that, you know, gaming in

2245
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:17,860
different parts of the world is so different than what it is here. So, so different and granted,

2246
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:22,580
although Dr. Noir, I mean, I would bet that, you know, these, our other Belgian listeners are going

2247
02:16:22,580 --> 02:16:26,260
to email us and just be all, he was just in the wrong place. It's everywhere. It's here and here

2248
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:30,260
and here. And you just, you just didn't see it, you know, that type of thing, but still, you know,

2249
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:34,660
in other countries, you know, it's very different, you know, the types of systems that are popular,

2250
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:39,700
the PlayStation 4, the Xbox one, they're not out everywhere. We know how Japan feels about

2251
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:43,940
Microsoft's products and we'll see if history is going to continue or what have you, you know,

2252
02:16:43,940 --> 02:16:49,620
it's very different. It would be nice to see them do okay, you know, in Japan stuff. I mean,

2253
02:16:49,620 --> 02:16:56,020
they can't, you can't fail like completely every time and they got to, you got to have a comeback

2254
02:16:56,020 --> 02:17:01,140
at some point, you would think. All right, well, that was it for the mailbag. If you want to

2255
02:17:01,140 --> 02:17:05,300
participate with the mailbag segment in a future week, send an email to participate

2256
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:12,820
at orange lounge radio.com. Let's get into the FUs of the week and get out whatever angst we

2257
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:16,020
might have tonight.

2258
02:17:29,620 --> 02:17:35,140
I'll start tonight cause rage nator and chat says, guy, your French needs work, dude. F you to rage

2259
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:40,900
nator. I didn't ask to speak French on the show. It was emailed. So out of respect to the listeners,

2260
02:17:40,900 --> 02:17:49,860
I gave it my best shot. Never had a lesson. No, I didn't. I sure did. Maybe, maybe I could learn

2261
02:17:49,860 --> 02:17:54,100
a thing or two playing assassin's creed unity or something since it's in France. Uh, anyway,

2262
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:59,620
in all seriousness, uh, F you the week goes to, um, I don't know. I actually don't,

2263
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:04,260
I don't have a whole lot of FUs things to be angsty about. Cause, um, there's a lot of good

2264
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:10,340
stuff coming up with days off work and stuff. So F you to just all the busy-ness that's happening

2265
02:18:10,340 --> 02:18:19,060
before two back to back long weekends. Yeah. Busy calendar. Loki. Um, just F you to, you know,

2266
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:23,620
game development stuff taking three times as long as it normally, you know, you think it would.

2267
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:26,980
And I'm kind of used to that now. Cause that seems to be everything, you know, everything I

2268
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:32,260
think that we get done at a certain time, it takes about three times as long because unforeseen

2269
02:18:32,260 --> 02:18:38,980
problems, you know, arise and that kind of thing. I just want to get to non game engine stuff. Not

2270
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:44,740
that it's not fun. It's just, uh, it'd be nice to build a show a little bit more like, you know,

2271
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:48,180
I can't really make a video of what I'm doing now because it's completely boring. You know,

2272
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:53,060
no one is a shit about, Oh, Hey look, you can fix your UV coordinates. Yeah. I'm excited about it

2273
02:18:53,060 --> 02:18:58,740
because I fixed my UV coordinates. You see, you see the big picture. Yeah. So I don't know. All

2274
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:02,420
right. Just a couple more stories for you guys. And then, uh, we're going to get to the Skype line

2275
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:07,060
at one eight seven seven Gamebo LR or username on Skype, orange lounge radio. But first Loki.

2276
02:19:07,140 --> 02:19:13,620
And speaking of unity, um, unity has officially come to PlayStation mobile. So if you, um,

2277
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:22,660
download the newest version of unity, which is like 4.6, 4.5, I think it's 4.5 something. Cause

2278
02:19:22,660 --> 02:19:27,460
4.6 is not yet. Cause 4.6 is the one I'm waiting for. That's the one that has the revamped, uh,

2279
02:19:27,460 --> 02:19:31,620
GUI, uh, infrastructure. So you can actually make menus and stuff cause right now it's a piece of

2280
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:39,860
shit. Um, but the new version, um, actually has unity for, um, PlayStation mobile and allows you

2281
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:46,740
to create, um, you know, games for that platform as well as easily port stuff from iPhone, iPad,

2282
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:52,340
Android devices to PlayStation mobile as well. And it allows you to kind of to publish on the

2283
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:57,140
Vita platform. Although if you're looking to publish on the actual PlayStation Vita,

2284
02:19:57,140 --> 02:20:03,540
like as part of their store, I think you got to get permission from, um, Sony for that. But to

2285
02:20:03,540 --> 02:20:09,060
get access to be able to, um, output to PlayStation mobile, you actually have to go to the PlayStation

2286
02:20:09,060 --> 02:20:17,220
mobile website. So psm.playsation.net slash portal. And, uh, once you go there, you sign up

2287
02:20:17,220 --> 02:20:23,860
and you get a link to download the version of unity that supports that. So that's pretty cool.

2288
02:20:23,860 --> 02:20:29,860
And shit right now they, I think, you know, I saw a little bit of the next beta, but I think

2289
02:20:29,860 --> 02:20:35,220
we support almost every single console platform right now on PC and stuff. So it's a pretty

2290
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:40,580
exciting. So once I do get to that point where I'm actually publishing something, maybe I will

2291
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:45,940
publish it on, it would be cool to see my game on a, on a Vita. I would be totally stoked by that.

2292
02:20:45,940 --> 02:20:51,380
So, um, one of the reasons why I chose you in the first place. So very excited.

2293
02:20:52,900 --> 02:20:56,340
All right. What platforms will your game be coming out on?

2294
02:20:57,300 --> 02:21:03,780
Um, well, PC for sure. And then the rest is just kind of whatever you can get, right?

2295
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:10,340
Well, um, like it's gonna, I've been trying to keep everything very simple for like mobile. I

2296
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:15,140
don't know if it's gonna, when it's done, I don't know how it's gonna run as far as mobile goes,

2297
02:21:15,140 --> 02:21:20,420
but I've been trying to keep everything very optimized. Um, so it's just gonna be testing

2298
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:24,340
to see, you know, I don't even know if it's the type of game that would work well with mobile, but

2299
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:29,140
I don't know. Consoles would be cool if I could do that. I just don't know what's involved with

2300
02:21:29,140 --> 02:21:36,500
like publishing to, you know, Wii U or, um, to the Vita. I mean, obviously PlayStation, um,

2301
02:21:37,380 --> 02:21:41,860
you know, mobile's a little different, but it's not as easy to find stuff. I don't know,

2302
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:45,620
it'd be interesting just to check it out. I seriously am probably going to run a Kickstarter

2303
02:21:45,620 --> 02:21:50,580
campaign at some point, but the thing is though, is if I'm going to do that, I want the game to be

2304
02:21:50,580 --> 02:21:56,340
fucking done or at least very, very, very, very, very extremely close to being done. Not this,

2305
02:21:56,340 --> 02:22:01,940
Oh, Hey, look, I got playable levels. Give me money. Cause you don't, I just don't, I don't

2306
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:07,620
trust myself, you know, to, you know, but, uh, it would be, it's good for getting exposure out

2307
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:11,780
there for your game. And also it helps with like the green light process and stuff like that to

2308
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:17,140
get people excited about something. All right. Well, something, uh, some folks might be getting

2309
02:22:17,140 --> 02:22:22,500
excited about is a new movie that's coming out all about video games. It's called video games,

2310
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:25,540
the movie, which was, uh, the result of a crowdfunding campaign. Actually,

2311
02:22:25,540 --> 02:22:30,580
speaking of all that stuff, it will be released at theaters in North America on July 18th,

2312
02:22:30,580 --> 02:22:35,460
but I wouldn't really expect it to see in every Cineplex across America. Um, but, uh,

2313
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:41,540
before the film is in theaters, the initial debut will be on July 15th via an iTunes exclusive

2314
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:45,380
release, which there's been a few movies recently that kind of dabbled in that. So I think it's

2315
02:22:45,380 --> 02:22:50,740
been kind of successful. Um, the movie is narrated by Sean Astin, who is one of the Goonies, uh,

2316
02:22:50,740 --> 02:22:55,860
also in the Lord of the Rings movies. Right. So he's done a few things there. Um, he, in the

2317
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:59,860
movie, it will be documenting the rise of the games industry from when it was, you know, just

2318
02:22:59,860 --> 02:23:05,380
the little pixels on the screen to basically the gigantic, bigger than bigger budgets than movies.

2319
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:11,060
They are today, uh, variants film president Dylan Marchetti in a statement said, quote,

2320
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:14,900
everybody loves a great video game. In recent years, they've evolved into something way beyond

2321
02:23:14,900 --> 02:23:18,980
what any of us who grew up playing an eight bit system could imagine. But regardless of whether

2322
02:23:18,980 --> 02:23:23,700
you're up gaming until 3 AM or haven't played a video game in decades, there's something for you

2323
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:28,100
in this film. And we think audiences will be delighted. Well, we'll see how well this does

2324
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:34,100
when it comes out in about a month. So, all right, by the way, there's, uh, some other people,

2325
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:37,140
I should mention some of the other people in this game. The film was also produced by Cliff

2326
02:23:37,140 --> 02:23:42,420
Pizinski, Cliffy B. Right. Uh, some of the people that are in the game, Zach Braff, Chris Hardwick,

2327
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:49,380
Wil Wheaton, Nolan Bushnell, Hideo Kojima, and, uh, Alison, Alison Haslis. Sorry. I always say

2328
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:53,540
her last name wrong. Sorry about that. But, uh, yep. There you go. Some of the people to, uh,

2329
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:59,220
expect in the movie. All right. That's it. We're done. We got through all the news.

2330
02:23:59,220 --> 02:24:03,940
So it's your turn. We're open up the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype,

2331
02:24:03,940 --> 02:24:10,420
Orange Lounge Radio. If you'd like to give us a call, uh, we will take your call and we'll leave

2332
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:14,260
the Skype line open for a little bit just to see if anybody's going to get through. Uh, in the

2333
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:18,100
meantime, while we wait for some calls, I don't know if Loki has any last minute stories. I think

2334
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:23,140
I have a couple Twitter topics I can pull up. I do have one thing. Uh, apparently the, uh,

2335
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:27,780
Dropbox account for CD Projekt Red was accidentally turned public,

2336
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:32,820
um, for a little bit. And, or it was, I think it was Dropbox or Google Drive or something like

2337
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:39,060
that. And people are able to grab the, um, uh, what was it? The build documents for,

2338
02:24:39,860 --> 02:24:45,220
uh, Witcher 3, including all the spoilers and everything. So watch yourself out there.

2339
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:50,100
Don't spoil or don't, uh, check out those spoilers. If you're trying to actually save,

2340
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:53,300
you know, I wonder if they'll change it. The game's not due till early next year.

2341
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:56,740
I wonder if they'll go back and change some key things. I doubt it. It might be too late to do

2342
02:24:56,740 --> 02:25:00,180
that. I don't know, but I'm sure some of the stuff will change because it's just a design doc, but,

2343
02:25:00,180 --> 02:25:08,420
um, uh, I want to say someone said 36 endings. So I don't know. All right, let's go to the phones.

2344
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:11,380
We do have calls coming in, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2345
02:25:12,020 --> 02:25:16,660
Legend of Zaku here. Hey, Zaku. How you doing, buddy? Uh, nothing much. Just killing,

2346
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:22,660
just killing a Sunday evening trying to, you know, uh, dull the loss. Well, not even loss,

2347
02:25:22,660 --> 02:25:28,980
but just like last minute draw of, uh, that soccer game. Yeah. You know, I don't do a lot of, well,

2348
02:25:28,980 --> 02:25:32,820
it's funny when I was younger, actually I played soccer for like five years when I was younger,

2349
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:36,420
if you can believe it, when I was in like grade school or whatever, but nowadays the only soccer

2350
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:43,620
I know is Mega Man. Yep. Well that, and right now I'm like, uh, playing flight simulator, trying to,

2351
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:49,140
you know, land, well, actually taxi a plane back to the gate. Do you get into a lot of

2352
02:25:49,140 --> 02:25:52,820
those simulator games? Is it just flight simulator or do you like to play like farm simulator and,

2353
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:59,220
and Europe flight simulator? As you can see, I bought myself a little choice, you know,

2354
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:04,020
little messy. He's showing us on webcam, by the way, you have a messy desk, young man.

2355
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:11,380
Yeah. I managed to put the plane on the ground without killing people. All right. Well,

2356
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:14,980
congrats on safely landing the plane. Do you have aspirations to fly in real life

2357
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:21,460
or is it just now just, just for games? What do you have aspirations to fly like IRL like

2358
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:25,540
in real life or now just, just computer simulations? It's just one of those things

2359
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:30,820
I've, you know, put off for so many years until I went to Micro Center one day and I saw for 30

2360
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:35,940
bucks. I said, what the hell? I just, you know, I bought it, bought, you know, went to Best Buy to

2361
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:42,180
get a cheap, uh, flight stick. And then that, you know, and then from there it's been snowballing.

2362
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:44,660
Well, you're not the, you're not the only one that feels that way because you don't

2363
02:26:44,660 --> 02:26:48,660
our chat room over at live dot com says flight SIM 10 is the best. I still play it.

2364
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:54,420
Yeah. I just, uh, I mean, I'm lucky. I still had, they still had box copies over there.

2365
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:57,540
Well, what's on your mind. Did you, did you want to talk to us about flight Sims or was

2366
02:26:57,540 --> 02:27:02,100
something else on your mind tonight? I guess, uh, mostly, um, the whole,

2367
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:08,260
I guess we'll see about E3 and how, you know, because I've been out of the loop for a while

2368
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:15,380
and the fact that, um, a lot of games such as, uh, Kingdom Hearts three, very tight-lipped

2369
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:21,860
to the point where, you know, they're really not, they really have a story down, but whether or not

2370
02:27:21,860 --> 02:27:26,500
Disney will actually let them use some of the more recently acquired properties just in time to make

2371
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:34,260
whatever deadline they have set forth for the game, it's yet to be seen. Like if, you know,

2372
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:40,420
possibility, like even the creator of Kingdom Hearts was, was stating that he would love to

2373
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:45,380
only if he was able to like whether or not Disney's, uh, willing to license anything

2374
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:49,620
in the realm of Marvel and, or Lucas or such a thing.

2375
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:54,580
I would love to see something like that come to fruition as I think a lot of people would,

2376
02:27:54,580 --> 02:27:58,660
but yeah, it just, especially with the Star Wars stuff, you know, Star Wars kind of has its own

2377
02:27:58,660 --> 02:28:02,420
video games and so does the Marvels. So I don't know, but then again, so there's tons of other

2378
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:06,980
types of Disney games. So I don't think anything's necessarily off the table. Um, I would think though

2379
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:10,580
that the creators of Kingdom Hearts kind of already know where they're going with the story

2380
02:28:10,580 --> 02:28:15,620
and have kind of already planned out what worlds are included, but it's not like they can't, um,

2381
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:20,740
they don't have access to rather like some of the Disney stuff that is coming out in the future.

2382
02:28:20,740 --> 02:28:26,340
I mean, Disney has their movies planned through like, I'm sure 2018 or 2019 at this point.

2383
02:28:26,340 --> 02:28:29,540
I would imagine they would have like a long-term roadmap.

2384
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:34,420
So I imagine, you know, uh, the folks at Square get privy to some of that information

2385
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:40,580
because like I think about like Tron, uh, not just the Tron, the 1985 Tron, but Tron Legacy

2386
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:45,540
was in the 3DS Tron game and that wasn't that long after the movie. So it's like, you know, it's,

2387
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:48,420
it is possible to get the newer stuff in there, even though the games might have

2388
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:49,460
a long development time.

2389
02:28:49,460 --> 02:28:55,540
You think also, uh, then you also run the risk of a scope creep and then whether or

2390
02:28:55,540 --> 02:29:01,940
not you're able to punt the release date further, even though you're aiming for quality,

2391
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:04,900
you pretty much, uh, you might get carried away.

2392
02:29:05,780 --> 02:29:09,460
Honestly though, Zaku, I think when it comes to these games, I think we'll be

2393
02:29:09,460 --> 02:29:15,540
lucky. We'll be very lucky if Final Fantasy 15 is next year. I honestly think at this point,

2394
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:20,420
I'm thinking more like March, April, 2016, like in time for the end of the fiscal year.

2395
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:24,900
I think that's when you're going to get a Final Fantasy 15. And honestly, Kingdom Hearts 3,

2396
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:29,780
not tell well after that. And like, I'm, I'm talking like 2017.

2397
02:29:31,220 --> 02:29:34,900
I mean, so far, sure. They even have demo footage right now.

2398
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:37,380
But is it playing?

2399
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:44,900
You know, completely knowing that Tokyo Game Show is like only a few months away.

2400
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:51,700
And, um, hopefully if anything, because the fact that Squeenix really didn't put out as

2401
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:58,340
much for E3, because they're really not at a point to actually, uh, divulge any of it.

2402
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:02,980
Hence the reason why they're trying to spread most of the news regarding, you know,

2403
02:30:02,980 --> 02:30:05,780
Kingdom Hearts and whatever other game they're going to come out.

2404
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:09,620
Don't get me wrong, Zaku, I would love to be wrong on that, but it's just kind of like,

2405
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:12,980
you know, these games take forever to develop and Final Fantasy 15,

2406
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:17,940
didn't, I mean, it's been in development since it was 13, uh, side story, whatever it was called.

2407
02:30:18,820 --> 02:30:20,260
Loki, what do you want to say on that?

2408
02:30:20,260 --> 02:30:23,540
I don't think, uh, I think Final Fantasy 15 would probably be,

2409
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:28,020
um, maybe, I think it's gonna be next year sometime,

2410
02:30:28,020 --> 02:30:30,660
because they've already had tons of footage of it and stuff.

2411
02:30:30,660 --> 02:30:33,380
Kingdom Hearts 3 though, there's hardly been anything for it,

2412
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:37,380
and I'm guessing we'll maybe see like a better reveal at Tokyo Game Show,

2413
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:39,860
but I would say maybe spring 2016.

2414
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:44,340
Yeah, yeah, that, well, as I said, it really depends on how far

2415
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:50,180
long they've gone in the process, whether or not A, they managed to make any, any front,

2416
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:52,740
you know, any progress on the actual development, and B,

2417
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:56,260
whether or not they have all the voice talents marshaled up and written scheduled.

2418
02:30:56,260 --> 02:30:57,300
It's all speculation.

2419
02:30:57,300 --> 02:31:01,940
One half is getting the game, you know, built out with all the assets and code.

2420
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:06,340
The other half, and the more important half, is essentially the acting.

2421
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:11,140
The fact that if they did decide to, you know, to go big and do like,

2422
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:14,740
you know, Star Wars or anything Marvel related,

2423
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:18,820
they have, they would have to at least schedule that well in advance.

2424
02:31:19,460 --> 02:31:21,940
Like if they pulled the trigger on this, knowing that they,

2425
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:25,700
that Disney pretty much gave them the permit, you know, authorization to do it,

2426
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:30,660
then yeah, they would, you know, assuming they got,

2427
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:35,220
you know, assuming they got it a lot, a lot earlier than what we're anticipating,

2428
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:38,100
they might have everything ready to, you know,

2429
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:40,900
if they're running it concurrently, they might have everything.

2430
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:44,580
I do think though, Zaku, I think you're onto something when you say the Tokyo Game

2431
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:46,100
Show is probably going to show us a little more.

2432
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:49,940
I kind of expect that would be, you know, when we'll get an update, if nothing else,

2433
02:31:49,940 --> 02:31:51,620
on at least 15.

2434
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:54,740
I don't necessarily know if Kingdom Hearts 3, they'll say much more on it.

2435
02:31:54,740 --> 02:31:58,180
I mean, maybe just little sprinklings, maybe a new trailer or something like that,

2436
02:31:58,180 --> 02:32:01,060
but I still kind of think they're pushing the 2.5 remix.

2437
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:08,900
So I bet at Tokyo Game Show, they give away that there's like a trailer

2438
02:32:08,900 --> 02:32:11,220
for the third game when you beat 2.5 remixers.

2439
02:32:11,220 --> 02:32:13,220
But see, that's the thing with 2.5 remixes.

2440
02:32:13,220 --> 02:32:17,940
I think when they're putting that out now, that the timing of that says that

2441
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:21,860
three's not too far behind, because it wouldn't make sense to me to put it out

2442
02:32:21,860 --> 02:32:25,700
that far away from three, because they've been doing one each year,

2443
02:32:25,700 --> 02:32:28,100
and that makes you think, well, maybe it's going to be next year.

2444
02:32:28,980 --> 02:32:30,660
But I think it's still too...

2445
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:36,980
Keep in mind, the remakes are essentially just mostly texture swaps,

2446
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:40,900
but more importantly, getting it to run on the PS3 architecture.

2447
02:32:40,900 --> 02:32:46,340
But you're right, those take at least upwards to a year and a half of dev cycles.

2448
02:32:46,340 --> 02:32:47,300
But either way...

2449
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:51,380
They're going to take you an entire year to understand anyway, so you know what?

2450
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:55,300
Either way, TGS or hell, even PAX East.

2451
02:32:55,540 --> 02:33:00,100
Squeenix has, out of all the other developers aside from Ubisoft and Microsoft,

2452
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:02,580
Squeenix still has some sort of presence.

2453
02:33:02,580 --> 02:33:05,940
That's whether or not they'll probably be the biggest ones.

2454
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:10,020
I still think PAX is really their time to push the MMOs too, though.

2455
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:11,060
Like 14, I think.

2456
02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:13,700
Because you know there'll be an expansion to support for that.

2457
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:15,220
I kind of see that as a factor.

2458
02:33:15,220 --> 02:33:18,660
They're probably going to push them 2.5 remix.

2459
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:20,500
And then they're going to save three.

2460
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:24,180
They're going to start teasing a lot more three in TGS.

2461
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:26,820
And hopefully PAX East.

2462
02:33:26,820 --> 02:33:28,260
I'm thinking PAX East.

2463
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:31,700
I don't know, it's kind of like a far-fetched, wily-eyed idea.

2464
02:33:31,700 --> 02:33:36,260
But think about the fact that there's not that many larger game devs in PAX East anymore.

2465
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:37,140
It's mostly indies.

2466
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:43,460
And you know, to a point, with the Squeenix being one of the very few,

2467
02:33:44,420 --> 02:33:47,220
who knows how much more space they might give them,

2468
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:49,540
especially if they have something exclusive like Kingdom Hearts.

2469
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:50,660
Who knows, Zaku?

2470
02:33:50,660 --> 02:33:51,220
Who knows?

2471
02:33:51,220 --> 02:33:54,820
Because we could speculate for another four hours, I'm sure.

2472
02:33:54,820 --> 02:33:56,820
But Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.

2473
02:33:56,820 --> 02:33:57,460
Thanks for the call.

2474
02:33:57,460 --> 02:33:58,660
Have fun flying.

2475
02:33:58,660 --> 02:33:59,460
Don't kill people.

2476
02:34:00,100 --> 02:34:01,220
I landed, all right?

2477
02:34:01,220 --> 02:34:02,580
Now I gotta shut off the engines.

2478
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:03,140
All right, bye.

2479
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:07,620
Don't hit the wrong switch and you know, collide the bla-

2480
02:34:07,620 --> 02:34:10,340
You know, like accidentally you think the thing's in park and it's in drive

2481
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:11,780
and you just go, boom, right in the terminal.

2482
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:13,380
All right, anyhow.

2483
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:14,660
Let's get to some more calls.

2484
02:34:14,660 --> 02:34:18,340
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2485
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:19,380
Let's go to another call.

2486
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:21,220
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

2487
02:34:21,220 --> 02:34:21,700
Who's this?

2488
02:34:24,820 --> 02:34:25,940
I thought we had the call.

2489
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:27,140
Let me try that again.

2490
02:34:27,140 --> 02:34:28,180
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

2491
02:34:28,180 --> 02:34:28,660
Who's this?

2492
02:34:30,580 --> 02:34:32,020
Hi, this is Raging Eater.

2493
02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:33,140
Hi, Raging Eater.

2494
02:34:33,140 --> 02:34:33,940
What's on your mind, buddy?

2495
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:39,940
Um, you know, one quick news story that wasn't covered in tonight's show.

2496
02:34:40,580 --> 02:34:46,420
Although Bobby Blackwell did touch on it slightly, you know, during his show earlier tonight.

2497
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:48,340
What, you're trying to say he's better than us?

2498
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:49,620
Is that what you're trying to come out here and say?

2499
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:50,100
Oh, no.

2500
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:53,380
I did not see anyone's bearing on the show.

2501
02:34:53,380 --> 02:34:55,780
I was just saying nobody wasn't covered.

2502
02:34:55,780 --> 02:34:56,100
Uh-huh.

2503
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:57,300
Them's fighting words.

2504
02:34:57,300 --> 02:34:57,620
Yeah.

2505
02:34:57,620 --> 02:34:58,180
I'm just kidding.

2506
02:34:58,180 --> 02:34:58,580
What's up?

2507
02:34:58,580 --> 02:34:58,900
What's up?

2508
02:34:59,940 --> 02:35:00,340
All right.

2509
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:08,500
As we have been rumbling and hearing rumblings for the past year or so that supposedly the

2510
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:18,660
Games for Windows was going to be, quote, unquote, shutting down July 1st of this year.

2511
02:35:19,220 --> 02:35:23,540
And we already started to see how that happened, too.

2512
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:27,220
Certainly being where we are in place.

2513
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:36,660
But I looked to Bobby earlier tonight, basically saying, Microsoft is saying,

2514
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:42,100
we're not going to take down the servers for Games for Windows.

2515
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:49,860
So you can continue to download what you already bought, play your games, so on and so forth.

2516
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:56,420
And personally speaking, I'll say this.

2517
02:35:56,420 --> 02:36:00,020
I didn't really like Games for Windows too much.

2518
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:04,180
But in a way, it's kind of a good thing to keep your service going.

2519
02:36:05,060 --> 02:36:12,340
If only because there's some content that I did buy through Games for Windows before

2520
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:14,260
I jumped ship to Steam.

2521
02:36:15,780 --> 02:36:28,420
Not only that, but even for those people that have long-term Steam users, there's probably

2522
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:30,900
some games that they've used for a long time.

2523
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:37,300
Users may have bought games for Windows in one capacity or another.

2524
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:48,020
For example, if you have the Lost Planet games, be it original or second one, or even

2525
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:55,940
Street Fighter Plus Tekken, all those games use Games for Windows, even though you may

2526
02:36:56,020 --> 02:36:58,660
have bought them on Steam.

2527
02:36:58,660 --> 02:37:04,180
It really seems to me like Microsoft is pretty much like they're just ending a lot of the

2528
02:37:04,180 --> 02:37:05,780
support for Games for Windows Live.

2529
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:08,100
But they're kind of like, we're not going to unplug the computer.

2530
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:11,700
But when it stops working, there's not exactly going to be anybody here to fix it either.

2531
02:37:13,380 --> 02:37:16,980
That's kind of the sense I get from the whole thing is that, okay, they're not pulling

2532
02:37:16,980 --> 02:37:17,780
it down.

2533
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:20,980
But they're not really investing another dime in it.

2534
02:37:21,700 --> 02:37:22,340
Yeah, true.

2535
02:37:22,900 --> 02:37:30,020
Yeah, I mean, I'm the first to admit that Games for Windows in and of itself as a service

2536
02:37:30,580 --> 02:37:34,660
kind of pales in comparison to Steam, quite likely.

2537
02:37:34,660 --> 02:37:38,740
I think no one's going to argue any differently.

2538
02:37:38,740 --> 02:37:43,460
You know, in Microsoft, oftentimes, it's not the first time, and they're not the first

2539
02:37:43,460 --> 02:37:49,140
company to do this either, who sees a good idea, like a marketplace for games like that,

2540
02:37:49,140 --> 02:37:51,700
and tries to build something their own and make it work.

2541
02:37:51,700 --> 02:37:53,060
And it doesn't always work.

2542
02:37:54,100 --> 02:37:59,060
I remember a time being a podcaster for so many years where Microsoft tried very hard

2543
02:37:59,060 --> 02:38:01,300
to make Zune cast a thing.

2544
02:38:01,300 --> 02:38:01,860
You remember that?

2545
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:03,140
Oh God.

2546
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:05,940
Or Major Nelson's blog cast.

2547
02:38:05,940 --> 02:38:10,340
They refused to call it a podcast because they were trying to make the Zune thing like

2548
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:10,820
happen, right?

2549
02:38:10,820 --> 02:38:12,100
Stop trying to make Zune happen.

2550
02:38:12,100 --> 02:38:15,620
Speaking of which, my wife got a hand-me-down phone.

2551
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:16,820
It's a Windows phone.

2552
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:19,700
What software do I have to use to put shit on the fucking phone?

2553
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:20,260
Zune.

2554
02:38:20,260 --> 02:38:20,760
Zune.

2555
02:38:21,380 --> 02:38:22,020
Fuck that.

2556
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:23,540
But here's the interesting thing.

2557
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:27,620
But you can sit here and point off all of Microsoft's failures, but sometimes they kind

2558
02:38:27,620 --> 02:38:31,300
of take an idea and they do pretty well with it, like the Xbox.

2559
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:36,180
So, you know, sometimes it's just a matter of trying these different ideas till they

2560
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:37,060
get one that works.

2561
02:38:37,060 --> 02:38:40,660
But at the end of the day, if it's not making money, if people aren't loving it, if people

2562
02:38:40,660 --> 02:38:44,180
aren't using it, then you wave your white flag of surrender defeat.

2563
02:38:44,340 --> 02:38:44,840
Yeah.

2564
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:49,540
Well, Peter does, in low-key kind of touch on it a little bit.

2565
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:52,980
Personally, I love the Zune.

2566
02:38:54,020 --> 02:38:55,380
Not so much the hardware.

2567
02:38:55,380 --> 02:39:04,260
I never owned the hardware itself, but I love the Zune software, you know, the software

2568
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:07,060
player in their marketplace.

2569
02:39:07,060 --> 02:39:16,180
I used it all the time before they shut that down and went strictly Xbox, 360, one, and

2570
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:17,780
Windows 8.

2571
02:39:18,660 --> 02:39:22,740
But, you know, as a result, I had to switch over to iTunes.

2572
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:24,740
But that's just me.

2573
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:26,660
I'm probably the minority there.

2574
02:39:26,660 --> 02:39:27,160
So.

2575
02:39:28,020 --> 02:39:33,460
Well, you know, there's going to come a time when even Steam is going to be gone for the

2576
02:39:33,460 --> 02:39:34,260
next big thing.

2577
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:36,980
You know, whatever is next in distribution.

2578
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:37,860
There will come a time.

2579
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:40,340
It's probably going to be a long ways away, but there will come a time, you know.

2580
02:39:40,340 --> 02:39:44,020
What I don't get it, though, just seriously talking about the Windows Phone 7 here that

2581
02:39:44,020 --> 02:39:44,980
my wife has.

2582
02:39:44,980 --> 02:39:49,860
It uses a standard USB cable to connect to the computer, but I have to use a fucking

2583
02:39:49,860 --> 02:39:52,100
program to put shit on it.

2584
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:56,100
Whereas an Android phone, I connect to it, and hey, look, it's a drive I can dump shit

2585
02:39:56,100 --> 02:39:56,420
on.

2586
02:39:56,420 --> 02:39:59,700
I don't have to fucking have, like, if I want to make a ringtone, I don't have to.

2587
02:39:59,700 --> 02:40:00,820
It has to be 40 seconds.

2588
02:40:00,820 --> 02:40:02,020
It has to be under a meg.

2589
02:40:02,020 --> 02:40:06,100
You have to tag the genre as ringtone for this shit to pop up.

2590
02:40:06,100 --> 02:40:07,060
It's stupid.

2591
02:40:08,420 --> 02:40:09,140
All right.

2592
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:09,940
Well, wow.

2593
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:12,660
Did somebody's computer crash with Loki's ring right there?

2594
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:13,780
All right.

2595
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:15,220
Rage in here, buddy.

2596
02:40:15,220 --> 02:40:18,020
I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call

2597
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:20,020
and I guess rest in peace, Gabe.

2598
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:23,140
But at least, hey, at least you can still play Game Room for now.

2599
02:40:23,140 --> 02:40:23,860
Oh, yeah.

2600
02:40:23,860 --> 02:40:27,620
I'm still, in fact, I was just playing that all day, actually, so.

2601
02:40:27,620 --> 02:40:28,180
Nice.

2602
02:40:28,180 --> 02:40:28,740
All right.

2603
02:40:28,740 --> 02:40:29,460
Take care, my friend.

2604
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:30,420
Yep.

2605
02:40:30,420 --> 02:40:31,140
Have a good one.

2606
02:40:31,140 --> 02:40:31,640
Later.

2607
02:40:32,020 --> 02:40:32,340
All right.

2608
02:40:32,340 --> 02:40:37,780
Well, I'll see if anybody else calls in 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio.

2609
02:40:37,780 --> 02:40:42,020
But meanwhile, I did see a few things on Twitter I wanted to make sure I got through.

2610
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:45,540
I just saw a tweet come in from Koopa Club, which I plugged at the top of the show.

2611
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:47,620
They just posted episode 52.

2612
02:40:47,620 --> 02:40:53,060
So if you need more of me after tonight's OLR, go download Koopa Club episode 52, which

2613
02:40:53,060 --> 02:40:55,140
is titled hashtag baby Jessica.

2614
02:40:55,940 --> 02:40:57,380
It'll make sense when you hear the show, okay?

2615
02:40:58,180 --> 02:41:00,900
Um, some tweets at the OLR accounts.

2616
02:41:00,900 --> 02:41:02,660
Twitter.com slash OLR.

2617
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:08,180
Superhulk1999 said, talk about great golf games.

2618
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:12,900
I've not played one since Outlaw Golf 2 on the first Xbox.

2619
02:41:12,900 --> 02:41:14,340
You a big golf game player?

2620
02:41:15,140 --> 02:41:17,140
No, I used to play a lot of mini golf games.

2621
02:41:17,140 --> 02:41:19,940
They used to be really big into 3D Ultra mini golf.

2622
02:41:19,940 --> 02:41:20,500
Yeah, I am.

2623
02:41:21,140 --> 02:41:22,500
I loved Kirby's Dream Course.

2624
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:24,820
I think I brought that game up like three weeks in a row now.

2625
02:41:24,820 --> 02:41:26,340
Like on Super Nintendo, I love that game.

2626
02:41:26,420 --> 02:41:28,820
But it's not like super authentic golf either.

2627
02:41:29,380 --> 02:41:33,540
I would be down for like, I mean, they've got hotshots golf and then they try to do

2628
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:34,180
a golf game.

2629
02:41:34,180 --> 02:41:36,180
I think there was one on Xbox one.

2630
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:37,380
I want to say that they put out one.

2631
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:41,140
I've heard the Mario golf game is pretty good.

2632
02:41:41,140 --> 02:41:44,420
I haven't played it myself yet, so I can't attest to that, but I've heard it's pretty

2633
02:41:44,420 --> 02:41:44,740
good.

2634
02:41:44,740 --> 02:41:47,700
Last golf thing I played was golf in Grand Theft Auto 5.

2635
02:41:50,260 --> 02:41:51,060
How about our chatters?

2636
02:41:51,060 --> 02:41:55,700
Do our chatters have any recommendations of really good golf games over at live.vognetwork.com?

2637
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:57,140
Help a fellow listener out.

2638
02:41:57,780 --> 02:42:01,140
S2 and Hunter Matt has tweeted us saying you have to give it up to the hackers.

2639
02:42:01,140 --> 02:42:06,020
Mario Kart 8 has been demade for Super Nintendo via a ROM hack.

2640
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:07,140
What?

2641
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:09,220
That fast?

2642
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:11,140
That was quick.

2643
02:42:11,780 --> 02:42:12,820
Where's that?

2644
02:42:12,820 --> 02:42:13,620
Apparently, I don't know.

2645
02:42:13,620 --> 02:42:20,100
He's linking me to a story at retrocollect.com where, let's see, there's a Mario Kart 8 demake

2646
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:21,780
for the Super Nintendo.

2647
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:28,260
Let's see, it says you can't do some of the things that the courses do in the game, but

2648
02:42:28,260 --> 02:42:32,580
the tracks from Mario Kart 8 have been brought over to Super Mario Kart as best possible.

2649
02:42:33,220 --> 02:42:37,940
The familiarity of the hit Nintendo Wii U's courses are present in the novelty ROM hack,

2650
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:41,540
one which gives the timeless Super Mario Kart another jolt of life.

2651
02:42:42,580 --> 02:42:43,140
Interesting.

2652
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:45,620
I want to see video.

2653
02:42:45,620 --> 02:42:46,740
Why is there no video?

2654
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:52,580
I mean, they have a patch, but they have the patch that you can download, but where's my

2655
02:42:52,580 --> 02:42:53,140
video?

2656
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:58,900
And apparently through the ZSNES emulator, you can play online and do online battle play

2657
02:42:58,900 --> 02:43:00,340
on old school Mario Kart.

2658
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:04,740
Does that mean that they act, because Super Mario Kart has, like, a good battle mode?

2659
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:07,220
Maybe that's a thing.

2660
02:43:07,220 --> 02:43:07,620
I don't know.

2661
02:43:08,740 --> 02:43:10,420
I'm sure there's a YouTube out there for them.

2662
02:43:11,380 --> 02:43:13,620
All right, let's see.

2663
02:43:13,620 --> 02:43:17,220
Act Def says I heard the Mario Golf 3DS games is good.

2664
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:18,820
Let's see.

2665
02:43:19,780 --> 02:43:23,700
Tiger class says you need to download Double Twist for desktop.

2666
02:43:23,700 --> 02:43:25,380
Is that game or is that another?

2667
02:43:25,380 --> 02:43:25,940
Oh, never mind.

2668
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:27,540
They're talking about something completely else.

2669
02:43:27,540 --> 02:43:28,820
It's like, what?

2670
02:43:28,820 --> 02:43:31,700
That is a program to sync music to Android phone.

2671
02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:32,980
There you go.

2672
02:43:32,980 --> 02:43:33,540
Sorry about that.

2673
02:43:34,980 --> 02:43:36,900
That was in the midst of golf game chatter.

2674
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:38,900
I thought that might have been some golf game I never heard of.

2675
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:43,300
Any other last minute stories, Logie?

2676
02:43:43,300 --> 02:43:45,140
I was going to mention, this was kind of a big thing.

2677
02:43:45,860 --> 02:43:53,220
They were, some modders found that the original shaders that were used in the E3 demo for

2678
02:43:53,780 --> 02:44:01,300
Watch Dogs were hidden inside the PC version of the game, and they enabled them, and it

2679
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:04,660
looks much better than it does now.

2680
02:44:04,660 --> 02:44:07,780
I heard, though, it runs into major performance issues in some places.

2681
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:08,740
It's not so bad.

2682
02:44:09,700 --> 02:44:14,580
From what I've seen, actually, they were saying that the performance is actually better, but

2683
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:16,340
it's a little bit buggy.

2684
02:44:16,340 --> 02:44:21,060
It's not perfect, but they're working to fix stuff in there from the shaders and everything.

2685
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:25,540
But it's still, once again, developers, if you're taking something out of a game and

2686
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:30,020
you really don't want people finding it, remove it completely from the game.

2687
02:44:30,020 --> 02:44:31,220
Do not reference it.

2688
02:44:31,220 --> 02:44:33,060
Do not keep the code in there.

2689
02:44:33,060 --> 02:44:34,260
Take it all out.

2690
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:37,300
All right.

2691
02:44:38,820 --> 02:44:43,540
Well, we're not getting any of the calls, so I guess this is where I close up the Skyline.

2692
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:45,460
We're done.

2693
02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:45,940
That's it.

2694
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:47,220
That brings us to the end of another show.

2695
02:44:47,220 --> 02:44:50,100
If you want to participate with the show, you didn't get a chance tonight, but maybe

2696
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:53,060
you're listening to us at work on a Monday or at some point throughout the week.

2697
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:56,340
First off, a big thank you guys who support the show.

2698
02:44:56,340 --> 02:45:00,580
Those of you that show up here live or those that listen on the podcast feed, however you

2699
02:45:00,580 --> 02:45:05,300
do it through iTunes, through Stitcher, through using Double Twist to get it from one place

2700
02:45:05,300 --> 02:45:06,580
to another, whatever it is you do.

2701
02:45:07,140 --> 02:45:08,900
Thank you guys very much for checking out our show.

2702
02:45:09,460 --> 02:45:12,260
If you liked what you hear, please consider leaving us a five-star review.

2703
02:45:12,260 --> 02:45:12,660
Oh, here we go.

2704
02:45:12,660 --> 02:45:13,620
Here's some pictures.

2705
02:45:13,620 --> 02:45:16,100
On iTunes or Stitcher or something like that.

2706
02:45:16,100 --> 02:45:17,620
We really appreciate it.

2707
02:45:17,620 --> 02:45:20,020
Quickly, Loki, you got some pictures?

2708
02:45:20,020 --> 02:45:20,180
Yeah.

2709
02:45:20,180 --> 02:45:25,380
If you click on the link on that story, it shows the pictures in robhacking.net.

2710
02:45:25,380 --> 02:45:29,940
And I mean, I can't really tell.

2711
02:45:29,940 --> 02:45:33,140
I mean, it's all right, I guess.

2712
02:45:33,140 --> 02:45:35,940
I just can't really tell because I've never played Mario Kart 8.

2713
02:45:36,900 --> 02:45:40,580
I can't really tell what these tracks are, but neat.

2714
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:42,340
I don't know.

2715
02:45:42,340 --> 02:45:45,540
I'm more interested in the hacks that they had for Mario Kart Wii.

2716
02:45:45,540 --> 02:45:51,380
They had lots of cool track hacks that you can do with just a SD card.

2717
02:45:51,380 --> 02:45:52,580
Yeah, that's cool.

2718
02:45:53,300 --> 02:45:53,860
All right.

2719
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:55,780
Well, that brings us to the end of another show.

2720
02:45:55,780 --> 02:46:00,180
So thanks again for downloading and tuning in and listening to it, however it is.

2721
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:03,860
We will be back, of course, next week with another episode.

2722
02:46:03,860 --> 02:46:06,340
We'll talk a little bit about 12 years of OLR.

2723
02:46:06,340 --> 02:46:09,780
And of course, take your calls and talk about whatever should happen in the news next week.

2724
02:46:09,780 --> 02:46:11,700
I'd imagine things are going to ramp up a little bit again

2725
02:46:12,260 --> 02:46:14,820
more and more as we get closer and closer to the holidays.

2726
02:46:15,860 --> 02:46:18,260
Loki, though, before we say good night to everybody,

2727
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:21,620
I got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2728
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:22,740
Loki, your final thought.

2729
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:27,940
My final thought is I'm building my primitives again in my game that I'm developing

2730
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:29,620
for hopefully the last time.

2731
02:46:30,180 --> 02:46:32,900
So once I'm at this and I get to learn how to write a shader.

2732
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:36,340
So all the things I didn't want to learn, I'm having to learn.

2733
02:46:38,180 --> 02:46:41,860
My final thought tonight is Mario Kart 8 was super fun today

2734
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:43,700
and I think we need to do more tournaments like that.

2735
02:46:43,700 --> 02:46:46,340
So we've got to do something with VOG, too.

2736
02:46:46,340 --> 02:46:48,660
I know, yes, I know there is one that has been set up,

2737
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:52,100
but we haven't done a very good job promoting that because E3 happened.

2738
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:55,300
So I think we do have to kind of have at least like a little VOG tournament

2739
02:46:55,300 --> 02:46:56,260
or something at some point.

2740
02:46:56,260 --> 02:47:01,380
And one of these weeks, I'm gonna have to go in and clean up the Minecraft server

2741
02:47:01,380 --> 02:47:04,980
and put the patches up and stuff because I don't think anyone's actually playing it.

2742
02:47:04,980 --> 02:47:06,580
I'm still paying for it, but no one's playing.

2743
02:47:06,580 --> 02:47:07,700
We haven't talked about it in a while.

2744
02:47:07,700 --> 02:47:10,580
So I think if you say, hey, something new is going on, we're gonna do something.

2745
02:47:10,580 --> 02:47:15,140
Minecraft server, I just have to update everything because I know that I have to.

2746
02:47:15,700 --> 02:47:16,420
It's been a while.

2747
02:47:16,420 --> 02:47:18,180
It's collecting dust.

2748
02:47:18,180 --> 02:47:18,500
All right.

2749
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:20,740
That's it, guys.

2750
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:24,500
Thanks again for downloading the show and checking it out and tuning in.

2751
02:47:26,820 --> 02:47:27,300
That's it.

2752
02:47:27,300 --> 02:47:27,940
We're done.

2753
02:47:27,940 --> 02:47:29,060
Did I give my final thought?

2754
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:31,220
I don't even remember what I said now if I did.

2755
02:47:31,220 --> 02:47:32,740
I'll give another final thought.

2756
02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:38,740
My final thought is I think I might actually play some more Final Fantasy XI tonight.

2757
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:41,140
Maybe I'll get to level my character to like 15 or something.

2758
02:47:41,140 --> 02:47:41,640
We'll see.

2759
02:47:42,500 --> 02:47:45,140
Or I'll get killed again in one hit like I did earlier today.

2760
02:47:45,140 --> 02:47:45,940
All right, that's it.

2761
02:47:45,940 --> 02:47:50,180
We'll be back here next week to say hooray for 12 years of OLR.

2762
02:47:50,180 --> 02:47:54,580
Thank you guys for downloading the show and tuning in and we'll see you next time.

2763
02:47:54,580 --> 02:47:54,820
Bye.

2764
02:48:20,180 --> 02:48:22,580
But you know they were all still true.

2765
02:48:25,620 --> 02:48:36,580
See you next week.

2766
02:48:50,180 --> 02:49:02,580
Bye.
