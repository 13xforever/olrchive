Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Did you hear? E3 happened. Thank you all for your participation, questions, updates, and feedback. Our predictions may not have come true, but it was still a very packed three and a half days. We are here to wrap up the news along with all the other goings on right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:56.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June the 15th, 2014 with the 556th episode of our show. And boy, how things can change in an entire week. I don't know how many of you guys listened to last week's show after E3 happened, but it's really funny to go back and listen to predictions.

00:56.000 --> 01:11.000
But anyway, we'll be tackling everything that happened at E3 and beyond with everything else that's going on in the gaming world. Yes, there is more than just E3, believe it or not. Over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts and with me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Hello Jamie Sommers. Now, something I never thought I would see happen here at Studio OLR with Jamie Sommers.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm not wearing it.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yes she is. She's wearing a Snuggie.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm not wearing it. If I were wearing it, my hands would be in the holes.

01:24.000 --> 01:34.000
She mentioned before the show that her legs were cold and I said, well, I have a Snuggie and she said, I'm not going to wear it. So just wrap it around your feet. I do it all the time. So she has it wrapped around her feet.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
She's not wearing it, but that's a technicality. Technicality. It's all right.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Humans are not meant to be worn by clothes. We are not the slave of our clothing.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
But you have to admit.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
You didn't watch Kill la Kill so you won't get it.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
You have to admit though, it's a nice blanket. I'm not paid off by them.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Turn on the check-ins, Rob.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
All right. I'll get to it in a minute. Jeez. Say hello as well to tech master, Loki.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Hi.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Hey, Loki. How you doing?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Doing okay.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Good. How's your game coming? I know you're working hard trying to program a game.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Were you too distracted with E3 this week?

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
No, I still worked on stuff at lunch and when I had time.

02:12.000 --> 02:26.000
I got my editor saving and loading and although I did find a small bug in my loading that it's not building all the objects with correct rotations in there so everything's all kind of screwed up.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
But it saves everything and I think the rotations are in there. I just have to figure out why it's not working.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
But it's close because I wanted to start building assets and I actually started doing that and then I put my computer in sleep mode and it crashed.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
I'm like, hmm, I should probably build the save function here so it doesn't do that again because I lost all my work there.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
So yeah, I just haven't really had a lot of time to work on.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
I was disappointed to see you didn't have a meeting room at E3 booking appointments to show off your creations.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah, I have nothing to show off. It's like, hey, here's nothing.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
If nothing else, does it give you perspective when it comes to critiquing games?

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
Because you know you have a bit of a reputation on this show for not being shy to show your anger and frustration sometimes with gaming.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Is this whole experience humbling you in any way?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
No. No, it's not.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
That's good to know. Some things are just never going to change, right?

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
It's not. I'm just learning how to do things and still trying to figure out why this isn't working.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Because I thought when I programmed it that it should work correctly.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
You put something in and you take that same something out and you do the work, right?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
You do the hokey pokey and you shake it all about.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
If I put an object in with a rotation of 90 and I save that rotation of 90 and then I should output it with a rotation of 90, it should be the exact same way.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
But no. In fact, I spawned an object or whatever and I'm like, okay, how would I fix this?

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
So I did 180 in one and it rotated in one way. And 180 on the other one, it rotated a different way.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
I'm like, wait, that doesn't work. That should be different. That should be the same, not different.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
You know what though, Loki? All joking aside, good for you for sticking with it, especially this long.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
And you do this too, as a lot of people I know do. You start projects and then you never finish them.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
I mean, I'm lucky if I finish building furniture from Ikea, but you've been really working on this game thing for several months now and sticking with it.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Because it's hopefully going to be more income and that's really important.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
That's what I need. I need money. So, you know, of course I'm going to keep working at it because I need to.

04:27.000 --> 04:38.000
That's right. All right. Anyhow, let's also introduce the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
And we do have our live chatters with us and you can chat along with us live.vognetwork.com.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
We do love our podcast listeners as well though, if you happen to be listening to us on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or TuneIn or any of the many, many podcast apps that are out there.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Just thanks for checking us out. I appreciate it, especially on a very busy week like this.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
Looking at the chatters and I have a lot of people yelling at me about the check-ins, which is why DarkSakra said something there.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
But just to remind you guys, you do get points for participating with our show at vognetwork.com.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
You can either check in when we're live throughout the three hours that we are live on Sunday nights or you can find a passphrase that's hidden somewhere within the show.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
And you type that passphrase on the main page once you're logged in at vognetwork.com and you will get points.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
And what does that point give you? E-peen.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
No, it's well, you know, we do have our own leaderboards at vognetwork.com, just like you would have on Foursquare or whatever, you know, those various sites.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
But once in a while, we also do raffles and every point that you earn on the site goes towards a raffle ticket if you choose to enter the raffle.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
We haven't said yet if we're doing one this month for June, probably we will. So stay tuned for that.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
We have more information coming up on that.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
SHA100Matt in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com also says, happy Father's Day, Loki.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
And yes, happy Father's Day to all the dads, father figures, pet fathers, everything, everybody out there.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Stepfathers, all the fathers of the spectrum, happy Father's Day to you.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
So I'm sure we have lots of gamer dads that listen to this program.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
As long as you're responsible and have done your job.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Yes.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Then you've earned the title.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
There you go. There you go. Which Loki certainly has. So happy Father's Day to you.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Did you get to do anything special for the day real quick before we get into all the big news of the week?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Grocery shopping. That's about it.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Did the kids behave on the grocery shopping trip? That would be a reward, right?

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
We had our parents watch him during the grocery shopping trip, but in the morning I tried.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
Okay, so Josh woke up at like 5.45. Nice.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
So I'm like, fine, I'll get you up and then I'll, because I have to kind of supervise you, I'm going to sleep on the couch.

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
So what did he do the entire like two and a half, actually it was, yeah, two and a half hours that I was out there.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
He kept trying to wake me up every time. He just kept like, he'd jump on the couch.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
He'd be like, you know, daddy, daddy, daddy, you know, this, this, this, you know, he's driving a car.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I mean, I'm like, stop. I'm just trying to sleep.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Alan does the same thing to me. Don't worry about it.

07:05.000 --> 07:12.000
All right. Anyway, uh, Mega Man X 400 in our chat room says, I definitely can't wait to hear Loki's E3 thoughts.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
Me neither. I have a different kickoff topic to get us there, but, but, but tease us here, Loki.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
One word, this year's E3 in one word, Loki. One word.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. Games.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Well, that's, I guess that's good because if you'd come out and said, you know, movies, I don't think that would have made people happy.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
So, all right. Well, technically, yes, there was lots of game trailers, so movies would be accurate.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
I say one word, one word. All right. Meanwhile, I'm actually going to go over to dark soccer for tonight's kickoff topic,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
because I think it's important to remember that I'm sure a lot of your favorite shows in the podcast you listen to throughout the week,

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
everybody's talking E3 this week because it is the big windfall of, you know,

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
this is what the rest of 2014 and most of 2015 is going to look like for video games.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
But there's other stuff that goes on in the world that involves video games this week.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
You know, there's conventions in some places like Jason, who's not here this week because he's driving back to Denver.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I know Denver, his town, they were doing a con, I think it was either this weekend or next weekend, you know, doing the thing.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
And dark soccer, you were here at an event in the Bay Area locally that was kind of a big deal, right?

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
Yes. I went to Atari party, which last year was in Davis.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
This year was in Sunnyvale, which is pretty much where Atari happened.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
I mean, if you want to be serious about it. It was really cool.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
We, as usual, brought up both of our Atari 5200 and actually another guy,

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
a couple guys here from here in Sacramento brought their 5200 and collection.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
And so they were right next to us. So we had the table of domination.

08:48.000 --> 08:58.000
Although there actually were other 5200s there because the guy who invented the Atari trackball brought his and T-shirts that I wanted.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
He gave us this really, really good speech.

09:03.000 --> 09:12.000
Dan Kramer was the inventor of the Atari trackball for the 5200.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
And also Al Alcorn was there, who was the guy who created Pong.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
And a few other folks from the industry, the guy that runs California Extreme, he was there.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Mark, really good guy.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
So it's important to note, you know, like Atari and early Activision, a lot of these companies, you know, I remember Epyx back in the day,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
a lot of these companies were based in the Bay Area, you know, in Sunnyvale.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
And that, you know, it's called Silicon Valley for a reason, right?

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
So a lot of those games that were written back in the day were born of that.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
So it sounds like this was a type of, I don't know if you want to say birthday party,

09:49.000 --> 09:57.000
but like maybe like a high school reunion of sorts in some ways for a lot of these folks that, you know, are the reason we have an E3 today.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
It's also the only place I will see more than one Jaguar in any one place.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
So there were a couple of, we had basically systems all across the board.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
I mean, I'm just pulling back up my photos because someone had one of the, not just, you know,

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
were there like Linksys and Atari 800 computers and the home consoles,

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
but there were other games that were by Atari that were on display on other systems.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
Like there's actually a Pong table there, a Pong cocktail table.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
One guy brought in his, I'll be having photos of these up within the week for the website.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Was this pretty much exclusively Atari stuff or did, you know, some of the other...

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
That's what I was getting to.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Oh, okay. Sorry.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
But I was telling you about the one, Mod, he did an ENCOM 2600 that had light cycles inside it.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
You know, ENCOM was the company in Tron, so he had it all Tron themed.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
But one of the other systems that I liked that was there was the Sega SG1000 Mark II.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
That was the precursor to the Master System and they just brought it.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
I mean, I don't think there were any Atari games in particular on it,

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
but next to that was a new style Famicom and there were a few of,

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
there was Mario Brothers being played on it, you know.

11:20.000 --> 11:27.000
But other than that, there was a person who brought in a lot of the Tengen games and just had those running.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
There, like I said, there were a few Jaguars, a lot of the different computers.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
There were some, there was a guy, and I ran into him a few years ago,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
and I wish I could find his card again because I'd love to have him on the show,

11:39.000 --> 11:48.000
who did a bunch of conversions of newer games for the Atari 800 and the 800 computer.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Like, one of them is Space Harrier. Fully playable, has voice, the music's pretty decent.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
You know, down res some, but it was really, really, really good.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Since we are talking about all things Atari, did anybody bring Driver 3?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Not that I saw.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It was worth a shot.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
I'm looking through my pictures. Yeah, there was Doom being played on a Jaguar.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
Had some playthroughs of Rayman.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
Which is one of the most beautiful, you know, 2D platformers from its day.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I'm looking through some more pictures.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
We tried to get Pango running, but it doesn't like our digital sticks that we had to replace the,

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
because Atari 5200s are really, really shitty controllers, and were notorious for breaking.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
So we tried to get Pango up and running, so all I could do was take a picture of Dan trying to play Pango.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.000
There was copious amounts of Tempest up on the screen, and there were four arcade machines.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Of course, one of the great Atari classes.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
So at the end of the day, is this just everybody with vaults like you and Dan have,

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
kind of bringing their Atari pieces of that all to one room, and it's like a show and tell type of thing?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Pretty much.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
It's like, hey, this stuff's cool, come play it.

13:01.000 --> 13:10.000
There were four arcade machines that were in the teen section of the library,

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
and one of them, well there was Star Wars, there was Asteroids, Centipede, and Tempest.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
So some of the greater machines there, and of course, for the folks who were on my Facebook,

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
I did post a lot of these pictures, but I'll be reposting them on the website before too long.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Just sort of a wrap up.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
And we had our copy of Jyris out, because that was one of the games we picked up,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
because we pick up a couple of reproductions or prototypes to bring in every year.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
So we had Jyris playing, and Dan had the trackball out, and we also have a prototype stick holder,

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
that sort of turns two controllers into twin sticks, for stuff like,

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
what game did he have that used that? I don't remember.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
But we had some Robotron going on, and I had to explain to some kid what Evil Otto was,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
because they were playing Berserk on the computer next to us.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Well, okay, speaking of talking to kids about maybe games they don't remember,

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
you know, why are events like this important? Why is the Atari and these old systems,

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
these old moldy antiques, why are they important, Dark Saga?

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
The whole point is that if you want to understand what the industry is now

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
and where it's going, you have to understand where it's been.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
It's the same with anything, really.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
If you don't know what led to what you have, you really don't appreciate it as well.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And sometimes people need to go back and play the old stuff to understand

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
why the way a game plays is more important than how it looks.

14:38.000 --> 14:45.000
I showed some girl, probably 19 or so, how to play Missile Command.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
And she's like, oh my god, this is actually really, really difficult once you get further on in it.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
I was showing someone how to play Kix, because that's one of my top games.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
And like, oh my god, this is so simple but so hard, the challenge.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
And they kept coming back and playing it because it was challenging.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
It's not the best, prettiest game in the universe ever, because damn it, Kix is annoying.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.000
But it's a really fun game. We have more people playing Qbert than anything I could think of.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
And they're like, oh, it's Qbert, he's cussing at us.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
It's just, really, that's the part that I think you can't get past.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
That you have to, you know, I've learned to appreciate the classics.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
A lot of comments on history in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Dungeon Buster says, history is important.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
WhatupG says, I wish more companies would look at the past.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
And Dungeon Buster also says, it makes me sad to know that there are people out there

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
that think Elder Scrolls started with Oblivion.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
And, you know, speaking of the past and maybe the not so bright side about it,

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
you know, I think sometimes people often forget the video game industry crashed and burned

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
in the, you know, early, mid-ish 80s, well, 84, right?

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
It was the big video game crash when, you know, we really transitioned from the Atari 2600

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
to the Japanese, you know, consoles of Nintendo and Sega that kind of finished out the 80s

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
and caused this revival that's still going.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
But, you know, this question comes up once every blue moon and sometimes gets laughed off.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
But, you know, we talk about knowing where we've been and how we got there and so forth.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
We always talk about, do you think there would ever be another video game crash?

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Do you think there's anything to learn there from some of these old games

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
about like how to not have another video game crash?

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
Well, there was a whole bunch of saturation in the 80s, especially as,

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
in fact, there's a really good series to watch that's like, I think it's just the history of video games

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
that's done by decade, not by decade, but done by year, starting with the 70s.

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
And there's some really famous video casters on there like the Angry Video Game Nerds on there,

16:55.000 --> 17:04.000
Pat the NES Punk, I think. There's just a few other, you know, really, really good video personalities,

17:04.000 --> 17:13.000
some that they've all put together. And they really went into how when one person would make an innovation

17:13.000 --> 17:19.000
with the type of game, there would be a million, million clones out there would get so saturated.

17:19.000 --> 17:25.000
Then you had all of these other little just no name consoles coming out, computers even.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
And this is actually a discussion I had with somebody when we were at Atari Party,

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
how you could have so many different kinds of computers, but you had to recode everything

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
or redo certain lines of code just because of certain incompatibilities.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
And it made it really difficult to mass market your game because of those inconsistencies

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
between different systems, different machines.

17:49.000 --> 17:57.000
I honestly think that we were overcoming some of the pitfalls that were around in the 80s,

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
but at the same time, we've lost some of the things that really helped it to grow,

18:03.000 --> 18:10.000
that at least kept it alive in the hearts of the enthusiasts even when the mass market crashed.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
You bring up a really great point in what you said there.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
And I know there's some people listening to this that are like, come on, get to the E3 talk and so forth.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
You know what? E3 can bite me.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Well, but hold on a minute because there's a very important parallel here.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
And I know we're going to get into this later in the show, but there were a few controversies that came out of E3.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
And the talk about how much does it cost to develop a game and how a lot of these are big budget productions.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Here's one I know is a fact but not something we're specifically getting into,

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
but Destiny, that game that's in alpha right now, what they're saying, $500 million going into that game.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
And it's this huge production, right? This is big to do.

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
But back in the day, back in Atari, those games, I mean, yes, there were certainly budgets.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
And yes, there were, you know, the marketing and everything that had to go into that.

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
But at the end of the day, one guy or gal or two made the game, start to finish.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
And were geniuses, in my opinion, in how to make it fit into the technology that they had.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
It was even as crappy as ET was. Keep in mind, he had six, what was it, six weeks to do it.

19:20.000 --> 19:27.000
And made a fully playable, barely playable game in six weeks.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
So, that's something to be said, you know.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
There's actually, and I was telling a couple people about this book while I was, while we were eating our Costco pizza.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Which, thank you, Judith, for the Costco pizza.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Judith is really cool, by the way. She's the director for the Digital Game Museum.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Really nice lady. And I'll be talking about them more later.

19:48.000 --> 19:56.000
But there's a book out there called You. And it's by a writer named Austin Grossman.

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
And it's about a guy who gets pulled into a development company as a game developer.

20:03.000 --> 20:10.000
As a, I think, as a story writer. And the lead game designer, that was it.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Just to design how the game was supposed to work.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Come up with assets for it and let the programmers worry about it.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
But he was talking about how, you know, his friend who created the engine that this company runs all of its games on.

20:21.000 --> 20:28.000
And how he and three other people, you know, were creating Rogue, you know, games based on Rogue back in the day.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
And, you know, it was sort of like a parallel for a lot of the early video games.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
You know, programming on an old Commodore computer or on an old Apple IIe.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
And talking about how all of that led up to the games now.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
And the guy has to play through all of the series of games on this engine as he's trying to find this one item hidden in the code.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
You know, using, because each of the games will continue off the last one even if they're in different genre or different eras.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
But it talks about how the games developed, what the styles were of the day, what the tastes were of the day.

20:59.000 --> 21:06.000
And it actually is a really, really good parallel between what people think of modern day gaming and its roots.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
And I was just getting a lot of that after having read that book and then going to Atari Party.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
I was really getting a lot of that just talking to people from the industry.

21:15.000 --> 21:23.000
And I don't think, just so I'm clear, I don't want people to think that I'm just saying that like big budget games are bad or this is bad and they're all bad.

21:23.000 --> 21:34.000
Not necessarily, but I do feel like some of the mistakes we're seeing made in where the industry is headed and some of the problems we're having right now with some of the foot in mouth syndrome we see coming out of some of these companies.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Like Ubisoft.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
You have to look to the past.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah.

21:38.000 --> 21:53.000
When, you know, it was no problem to make a character one gender versus another versus, you know, it wasn't something that like, oh well we got to think about the money, we got to think about the cost.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
But the closest thing I see now to, and the other point I want to make is the closest thing I see now to those days in the Atari stuff, I see coming out of the indie scene.

22:02.000 --> 22:11.000
Which really is one or two guys or gals with a passion project that, you know, make things from start to finish that, you know, they really put their name on.

22:11.000 --> 22:19.000
I got to say, you know, to lead us into the E3 talk here a little bit, some of my favorite things I saw at E3 were over at IndieCade in the indie booth.

22:19.000 --> 22:30.000
You know, where we could talk to game makers directly about these games that they're doing that, unfortunately, I think a lot of you guys haven't even heard of that are really some experiences that are really worth trying.

22:30.000 --> 22:41.000
I would really like to take a lot of focus off of, you know, quote the big three. You know, maybe mention their consoles because we're going to be able to play some of the indie games on them.

22:41.000 --> 22:51.000
But I would really think that people should be putting more focus on the indie gamers because more and more that's where you're seeing the quality.

22:51.000 --> 23:05.000
That's where you're seeing. And another reason why I brought up that book, too, is because a big point made in there is how, oh, well, we're abandoning storytelling for the sake of all the first person shooters that the mass market want, you know, all the, you know, initial payoff blood and gore.

23:05.000 --> 23:19.000
But we're seeing more and more, and I'm going to use quotey fingers and say true gamers who are wanting to go back to storytelling, wanting to go back to it being an effective way to evoke emotion, to have it actually been treated as art.

23:19.000 --> 23:34.000
I don't think of Call of Duty as art. I think of Dominique Pomplamoose as art. You know, that's the Stanley parable. Definitely, definitely an art form of its own. It's storytelling with a very, very fucking weird twist.

23:34.000 --> 23:44.000
You know, even Portal, you know, for being just how it was put together. It really tells a story in a very unique way and engages the mind.

23:44.000 --> 23:57.000
I don't think that necessarily Call of Duty isn't art, but I totally get what you're saying. But for me, it's like you have a Monet versus the Thomas Kincaid gallery at the local mall. You know what I mean?

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
And while Kincaid was talented, his work was meant to be commercialized.

24:01.000 --> 24:13.000
Yes, yes. So anyway, I do want to kind of transition us into E3 chatter, but real quick, if people want to attend our Atari party next year, I want more information because I'm trying to Google it. I'm finding like a Facebook page.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah, it's on Facebook.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Really?

24:16.000 --> 24:27.000
Yeah, the Atari party Facebook page. But I think they're going to be working again with Digital Game Museum, which you just go to digitalgamemuseum.org. Really, really great people.

24:28.000 --> 24:45.000
But yeah, just look up Atari party. And you'll find galleries, but the big advertisement is through the Facebook page. Although I honestly think that I might ask Bill if he wants a web page gifted.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Nice.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
And Bill's a really great guy, the guy who organizes it.

24:51.000 --> 24:59.000
It sounds like it's getting bigger and bigger every year, too. I saw Mel B made the newspaper, the Mercury News, playing at the Atari party.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Mel and Christine were both there on the cover.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Yeah, that's great.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
I ran into Neil, of course he was there, and ran into a few familiar faces.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
So not only do you play the old school video games, but you run into all the old school gamers.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
We had so many new friends. Also, everyone was pretty cool.

25:18.000 --> 25:26.000
We were joking upstairs, too, about how we should just shove a bunch of pizza in our mouth and not wash our hands, and then go play everything so it could feel like an arcade.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
And then we all stopped and thought about our own systems, like, no bad idea.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Bad idea.

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
Alright, well, hopefully it doesn't conflict with E3 next year so I can go, because I think that would be a blast.

25:41.000 --> 25:48.000
But we do have one conflict, because California Extreme, which is amazing, amazing, is the same weekend as GamerX.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Also amazing.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
So I made my apologies for not being able to go.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
You guys need to coordinate your calendars better, Bay Area convention people.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
There was a lot of talk about trying to schedule around certain other things.

26:01.000 --> 26:08.000
It was really cool, though. It was just kind of great. It was very casual, too.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Good.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Which is how it should be.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
Alright, well, we are going to get into some E3 chatter. I'm going to ask Loki to hit on some of the press conferences.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
I do want to do some housekeeping, though, real quick.

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
Speaking of GamerX, that's kind of the next big convention that I know I have my eye on, and Dark Sakura has hers on, too, because we will both be there.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
And this convention, of course, is running from July 11th through July 13th.

26:30.000 --> 26:37.000
And this is really cool, on Saturday at the convention there, July 12th, the podcast cross zone panel is going to be happening.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Myself, Dark Sakura, will be there live and in person.

26:40.000 --> 26:46.000
So if you are going to be at the GamerX convention, which is, of course, at the Intercontinental in San Francisco, come say hi on July 12th.

26:46.000 --> 26:53.000
We'll be there and talking with some of our indie podcast buddy friend pals about kind of the art of podcasting.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
And this last year was really about kind of trying to motivate people to do their own thing and get their voices out there.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
This year we're going to continue that, but also talk from a little bit of a tech side.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
We're going to demotivate you this year. It's too hard.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
Let me tell you about all the no comments I got at E3 this year. That will demotivate you.

27:12.000 --> 27:19.000
But we want to start to tackle some of the technical things as well as how do you promote yourself, how do you make yourself bigger.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
So we'll tackle all those issues this year.

27:21.000 --> 27:33.000
Speaking of Podcast Cross Zone, as a bit of a promotional thing leading up to that, we're going to be having an official, using my little quotey fingers, official Podcast Cross Zone tournament in Mario Kart 8.

27:33.000 --> 27:39.000
So Mario Kart 8 fans, get a pen and paper real quick or get ready to rewind the podcast so you can write this down.

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
But here's the details of the tournament. It's going to be next Sunday, June 22nd, before OLR.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
It's going to run from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
So for West Coast folks, that's 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Pacific time.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
And the tournament name is Podcast X Zone or Cross Zone.

27:57.000 --> 28:05.000
The winner will be determined from the best of 12 races. There will be a winner prize, a participation prize, and a booby prize.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
But we're not encouraging people to go for the booby prize. Don't do that.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Everybody's got to try.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
I've already got the booby prize.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
So we're not telling you what any of those prizes are until we get a little closer.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I don't know. Maybe some of the other shows will.

28:19.000 --> 28:27.000
So that's us, that's Koopa Club, that's Video Game Realness, that's GameBui.org, that's GameBar.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
That's... I know I'm going to be forgetting somebody and I'm going to really eat shit for this later.

28:31.000 --> 28:39.000
Us and Hoard House and all those fantastic shows that are going to be a part of Podcast X Zone.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
The rules are 100 cc, all vehicles, normal computer players will be involved.

28:44.000 --> 28:53.000
Here it is, the big code that you want. The big code 497714182468.

28:53.000 --> 29:01.000
Here's that code one more time to put into Mario Kart 8. That is 497714182468.

29:01.000 --> 29:09.000
And we will see you next Sunday and then live and in person at Podcast X Zone at GamerX on July the 12th.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
The good news is if you can't make it live in person, because I know we have listeners everywhere,

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
I'm almost positive they will tape everything and put it on YouTube like a month later, like they did last time.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
If you want to see the first podcast, Cross Zone Panel, that is up on YouTube.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
Just search for Podcast X Zone and you'll find it. So there you go.

29:25.000 --> 29:33.000
Since we will be at GamerX, there will be no OLR on July 13th.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
We will not be having a show that Sunday as Jamie and I will not be back from the con at that point.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
So just a heads up so y'all can have your calendars marked appropriately.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Okay, I think that's it for housekeeping.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Twitter.com slash OLR follow us.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio friend us.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Do whatever people do on Google Plus with us.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
That's like plus one us.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Yeah, plus one us and then forget about it.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
Alright, just kidding Google people.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Plus one feels like RSVP.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Plus one.

30:05.000 --> 30:12.000
Alright, so E3. I went. This is the first show I went to in probably about three years I think.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
But my first show was ten years ago.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
So I've been going to E3 off and on for about ten years.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
And I'm just going to tell you guys, overall it was a very different vibe this year than I felt in years past.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
You know, I think a lot of folks have the image in their head of like Penny Arcade.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
Basically a lot of people think E3 is Penny Arcade Expo and you know, it's not.

30:33.000 --> 30:40.000
Not every booth has just infamous lines of stations of games lined up waiting for people to play.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
In fact, some companies that kind of surprised me had no stations at all of games for people to play.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
One that comes to mind, Konami.

30:48.000 --> 30:54.000
A company that I know ten years ago, we used to be right there talking about DDR and Beatmania and all that stuff.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Konami wasn't showing anything.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
They don't have anything to show.

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah, well behind closed doors they had the soccer, Pro Evo Soccer, they had Metal Gear Solid 5.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
That's it. That's all they have on their slate. That's literally it on their slate.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
But I use that set as an example. Even a company like Warner Brothers obviously has a lot of big titles they have this year.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
I think they had maybe two stations where they had Batman that was playable.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
The rest of it, if you want to see Mortal Kombat X or Batman or all the other stuff,

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
you could wait in a big old line to get in a theater to watch somebody else playing the game.

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
And I think a big key word here about the E3 of 2014 versus the E3 of 2004 is control.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
It's a really controlled environment now.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
I'm kind of surprised they don't take measures to thin the crowds even more.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
I'm really surprised at some of the stuff I see at E3.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
But for me personally, one big reward I got out of this show this year was networking.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
I met a lot of great people at the show from a lot of great companies.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Not just the big ones that we're going to get into here shortly with the press conferences,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
but a lot of the second-tier developers.

32:00.000 --> 32:09.000
I'm really pleased to report to you guys I've got at least ten different game makers that want to come on OLR and other VoG shows to talk about their games.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
And that to me is the most exciting thing about E3.

32:11.000 --> 32:17.000
Like, okay, sure. There's a time and a place for a canned presentation,

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
of which I personally think Nintendo is doing a fantastic job at the canned presentation game right now

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
with what they did at this E3.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
There's a time and a place for that. That's great.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
But if I'm going to be there and I'm going to be there live and in person with all these people,

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
I don't want the same canned thing that everybody else is getting on the internet right now.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
That's the world we live in right now.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Why would I stand in line to watch a demo of somebody else playing Mortal Kombat X

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
when that's going to be up on YouTube and on Spike TV and all that stuff the day after the convention or during the convention?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
There's no value in that for me.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
I get far more value out of going over to Indiecade and talking to three game developers in the same amount of time

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
who are very passionate about some of the things they're working on.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
So that was kind of my attitude going into this E3 was that I wanted to go meet game makers.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
And I'm really happy to say we are going to get some of them coming on to OLR in the coming weeks.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Very, very happy about that.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
So, yeah. That was E3 in a nutshell for me.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
To answer some of the other questions that I always get coming out of E3,

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
Bobby, our pal Bobby Blackwell, who always comes on before us at the Voice of the East Network, he was at the convention.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
We did a lot of the show together, although we had our own separate appointments too.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I know he talked about some of this on his show.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
But, you know, the big questions always coming out of E3.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
Who won? Who won E3?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
No one.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
Dark Soccer, why do you think no one won E3?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Because it's not a fucking contest.

33:42.000 --> 33:48.000
It's not like they're racing and whoever gets to the end of the line wins everybody's money.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
It's networking. It's all it is.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
Maybe whoever got the most business cards won or something.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
But it's not really for the gamers. It's for the industry.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
So, no. There's no one fucking winning E3.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And to an extent, I agree with that.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
I mean, at the end of the day, you could say pre-orders and sales and all that.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
Maybe there's a game to be won with that.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
At the end of the day, it is about selling games.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
But if you were to ask me to grade all the press conferences and all that,

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
or who had the best press conference, my honest-to-god answer,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
who had the best press conference?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I thought they all did a fine job.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
Yes, there were high points. And yes, there were low points of each three.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
And I'll talk about those. At least the big three and then the other publishers as well.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
But I don't want to sit here and grade them.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
Haychida just did not get the point. No one won. It is not a contest.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
That's your opinion. That's what you liked better.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
That's not winning. That's your opinion.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Let me read the comment, though, that's being responded to.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
It's clear Sony and Nintendo won. Microsoft got a big F.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
I disagree. And opinion, opinion, whatever.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
But I don't think anybody failed.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
In the particular case of Microsoft, everybody after last year said,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Shut up about the movies and TV and show the games.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
And Microsoft came out. Game, game, game, game.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
That's what people wanted, right?

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
And I think there was an interesting mix of stuff that I do and I don't want to play

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
that were shown at that particular press conference.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
So I don't know. I don't really see that end of it.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Nobody won or lost E3.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
The other big question I get is, what was the game of the show?

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
What was the game of the show?

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
That is so hard to answer because half of them, more than half of them,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
three quarters of them aren't playable.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
They're canned demos. Control, remember?

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
I don't know. I still think I can think of at least one that was like my game of the show.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
There were definitely experiences that were great, but I don't think I...

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
Honestly, the game of the show for me was indies.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
I liked going over to Indiecade and talking to people directly about the games they were making.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
That was the game of the show to me.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
All this other stuff, whatever. See you in 2015.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
But I think overall, it's a great time to be a gamer.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Gamers won E3.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
There's a lot of great stuff to look forward to from all three companies this year

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
and certainly a big chunk next year as well.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
Anyhow, I went on a little bit of a tangent there.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
WhatupG in chat says, Loki's was Grand Theft Auto 5.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
No, it wasn't.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
No, it wasn't.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Nope.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Big surprise.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
Let's have you run down some of the big, big press conferences and some of the news that came out.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
Remember, our audience, just the way we like to approach this with you guys,

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
we know if you're listening to Orange Launch Radio,

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
you probably already have a pretty good general awareness of what went on at all the big press conferences,

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
but we're here to talk about it and discuss it and hit some of those key things that came up.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
So, Loki.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
So, the Microsoft conference.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
So, some of the stuff they kind of went over, they showed Call of Duty Advanced Warfare,

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
which I thought looked fantastic.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
I'm very excited about it because last year's Call of Duty The Ghost game was just kind of like,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
okay, something bad happened.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
It's a Call of Duty game.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
And before that, it was like Black Ops 2 was like, oh, hey, look at all this cool futuristic tech

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
and all this really interesting gameplay.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
And now that's kind of been brought back now in Advanced Warfare, so I'm pretty excited by that.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And I thought it looked pretty cool.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
Definitely looks next gen as opposed to Ghosted.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
Forza Horizon 2 looks fantastic, very exciting.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
So, that was something else that they showed.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
That's going to be on both Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
Assassin's Creed Unity, which we knew was going to be something that was going to be at E3,

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
looked fantastic and they kind of showed off a little bit of the gameplay there.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
One of the things that I thought was kind of funny, they announced DLC for Dead Rising 3,

37:59.000 --> 38:05.000
and it was the Super Ultra Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX Plus Alpha,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
which, you know, a little tongue in cheek, and that was out the same day.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
That was a funny moment.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
I like it when gaming companies can be a little bit self-deprecating

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
and kind of make fun of themselves a little bit.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
Nintendo did a lot of that too, but that Capcom's a great example of that at the Microsoft thing.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
They announced that they confirmed the Master Chief, or Halo the Master Chief collection,

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
which is on Xbox One, including all Halo 1 through 4.

38:32.000 --> 38:39.000
Also, I guess, access to the live-action Halo Nightfall, that was their TV show they're making,

38:39.000 --> 38:46.000
as well as a Halo 5 multiplayer beta, which people are pretty excited about as well.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Project Spark, they showed that Conker is going to be part of that,

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
which kind of had me scratching my head going,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Okay? That's...

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Yeah, I get what you're saying, because it's like one of those like,

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
Okay, that's cool, but like, why are you teasing me with this, and not like a Conker game?

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
Yeah, for sure. Oh, sweet, they're going to bring out a new Conker game.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
It's Project Spark, and I'm like, I don't care anymore!

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Yeah, that was kind of a moment where it's like,

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
We put all our assets in there so you can make your own Conker game.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
No, I want you to make a Conker game. If I wanted to make my own Conker game,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
we could have made a fan game a long-ass time ago.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Where the fuck do I want to make my own Conker game?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I want you to make a Conker game.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
They showed off some indie games, you know, Ori and the Blind Forest look pretty sweet.

39:31.000 --> 39:37.000
There's a new game by Playdead, which looks a little bit similar to Limbo again.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
New Tomb Raider game, Rise of the Tomb Raider, looked pretty awesome.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
What else?

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
Phantom Dust, they showed that they're redoing that, which I'm like,

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
That was a real out of left field announcement, wasn't it?

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
Yeah, I didn't understand. I've never played the original.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
Cool, I mean, they're doing a new one, I guess.

40:03.000 --> 40:11.000
Kudos to Microsoft for recognizing that this was a franchise that maybe deserved more than it got,

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
and so they're giving it another chance. Kudos in that department.

40:16.000 --> 40:23.000
They showed off some more of the Division, which, I don't know, it looks interesting, I guess,

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
but I just don't really know too much about it yet.

40:26.000 --> 40:33.000
Also, my most favorite thing about the whole conference, they showed Crackdown.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I was like, yes.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I could hear you cheering all the way from where I was at.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
Well, that looks awesome. I'd have to definitely pick it up if I got an Xbox One.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
What did you think Crackdown, a reboot, it sounds like, versus Crackdown 3?

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
I'm fine with that. I don't really know.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
I just wonder if they're going to have the same twist as the first Crackdown.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
It seemed to have a very different tone to me, Crackdown.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
It looks really impressive on a technical standpoint.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
They're showing off the engine and stuff and what it can do,

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
and you can literally destroy anything in there in completely original ways, so that's very interesting.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
I don't know, I think it looks like a pretty fun game.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Crackdown, I like the original Crackdown.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
Crackdown 2 is kind of lame, but the first one was fantastic,

41:15.000 --> 41:22.000
so I'm all down for a remake of that, or just even rebooting it with the same gangs in there.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
Take note, Saints Row, or Volition.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
This is what you could do with Saints Row.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
Reboot that shit with the same gangs and totally mix it up.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I'd be down for that.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I'd be down for that.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
What else? I think that was pretty much it.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
Let me mention some of the comments from our chatroom.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Oh, Scalebound. That was the other one.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Scalebound, the Platinum game that was coming.

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
It looks like a cross between How to Train Your Dragon and Pokemon and Monster Hunter.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
I don't know, interesting.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
And they showed another trailer for Sunset Overdrive, which looks fantastic.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah, they did just a trailer and some gameplay, right?

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Yeah, it looks really great.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
Just so you know, that was a big part of Microsoft's booth.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
That was probably one of the biggest chunks of their booth.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
It looks like a fantastic game.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
And their money marketing going into that, which is good, because that's a new IP.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
It's always nice to see that, getting that support.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
It looks great.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
It does.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Look at some of the comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Let's see.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
Some people saying the second Crackdown not so good.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
Dungeon Buster saying the second Crackdown was garbage.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
Kaijuto says people forgot how bad Crackdown 2 was.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Yeah, no, I didn't forget. It was crap.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
But we're far enough away from that now.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
You're not worried?

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Well, yeah, and they even kind of defended it.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
They're all, we didn't have enough time to...

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
I remember correctly, I'm not sure if it's the same team that made Crackdown 2 as Crackdown 1.

42:53.000 --> 42:59.000
And they're like, well, now we're doing all the things that we wanted to do in the original that we didn't have time to or something.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
I don't know if they had to rush out the game to get that Halo 3 beta out there.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
But I'm looking forward to it. I think it looks awesome.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
SSG100Matt in our chat says, Sunset Overdrive looked good.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Project Spark looks like it could still be something.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
Ori and the Blind Forest look like a fun platformer.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
I'm still impressed with the Division.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
So maybe to some there was nothing at Microsoft's presser.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
I found plenty to be interested in.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
And also Fable Legends.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
But I wasn't really impressed by that because I've been burned on all these Fable games.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
So I just didn't care.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
And I know that they announced, oh, you can be the bad guy.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
You can design your dungeon.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
I'm like, I don't care.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
It doesn't matter to me.

43:32.000 --> 43:38.000
Blender in chat saying, I think that since there is such a debate about who won E3, gamers win.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
Because the competition between the companies is so strong, they'll make better games.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
I think that's a really positive way of looking at it and I kind of hope you're right.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I did find it interesting that the tone of Microsoft.

43:48.000 --> 43:55.000
Obviously, it's no secret, Microsoft got pummeled last year when it came to E3.

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
They really got killed at E3 with all the policies and everything.

44:01.000 --> 44:07.000
But this was a new year, new tone, new guy at the head of the table, a chance to establish something new.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
And I did find it very interesting that this whole thing starts off.

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
We're excited to show you the future of gaming with our friends at Sony and Nintendo.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Very interesting kind of message, a tone there at the beginning.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
Where there could have been an opportunity to take a sucker punch at Sony or something.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
They didn't.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
They wanted to do.

44:26.000 --> 44:32.000
And then there was those random interludes as well with my favorite game or the first game I ever played.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Yeah, I didn't care about those.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
Well, I get what they do as far as transition or whatever.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
I thought it was going to lead up to something.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
I thought there was a big lead up to something at the very end that kind of didn't happen.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
So that was the only kind of surprise for me.

44:46.000 --> 44:54.000
Because I thought there would be some game from the past that was making a giant comeback or a game creation thing.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Maybe that was all going to lead into Project Spark and talking about game creation.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
Like, you know, these are all the games I grew up with and now I can make my own thing.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
You know, I thought it would kind of have a punch line, but it really didn't.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
So I think they served only as, here's a chance to put something on the TV so we can change something on the stage.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Or something like that. I don't know. It was a little strange.

45:12.000 --> 45:19.000
Pros and cons. I mean, especially Loki and Dark Soccer, feel free to jump on into this too if you want.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
You guys don't own Xbox Ones. I don't either for that matter.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
I already said I'll be getting an Xbox One eventually anyway because I certainly want Forza Horizon 2.

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
And I want, oh my god, name escapes me. Live Radio. Alan Wake made the new game.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Quantum Break.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
Thank you, Quantum Break, which wasn't to be seen at E3, which made me a little bit disappointed.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Yeah, that's probably holiday 2015.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Yeah, that's probably holiday 2015 at this point.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
But, you know, still, even the Halo collection looks very exciting to me and so forth.

45:50.000 --> 45:57.000
So, coming out of Microsoft's conference, did you see reasons to be an Xbox One owner?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that's the thing.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
And, you know, kind of, not to spoil my impressions, everything, I kind of saw that out of all three of them.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
It's like, okay, here's reasons to buy our systems and they all made a very valid point.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
And, yeah, there's definitely a lot of reasons now for me to have an Xbox One.

46:12.000 --> 46:18.000
You know, there's Forza Horizon 2, Sunset Overdrive, Crackdown, and even, you know, check out the Halo collection stuff.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
So, there's plenty out there, you know, for me to pick up now.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
They're showing me why, you know, where the games are, what you would want to buy.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
That's the problem though, now I have to get all three and that's, you know, it's expensive.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
And I don't know.

46:34.000 --> 46:41.000
For me, the pros and cons of Microsoft's event was the pros were that I think they gave exactly what people wanted.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
People wanted games. They showed a lot of games.

46:43.000 --> 46:50.000
And there was a lot of really, you know, even though I think a lot of it was expected in a way, and I'll get to that in a minute,

46:50.000 --> 46:55.000
there was a lot of really good looking things like the Tomb Raider sequel looked really good.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
The Halo collection sounds amazing, you know, especially for people that need to catch up on that series.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
Phantom Dust kind of coming back from the dead in a way is really exciting to see.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
So, a lot of that's very good.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
I think the one negative for me that comes out of Microsoft's press conference and the way I kind of left feeling after that,

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
I was like, this felt very par.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
This is a very expected press conference.

47:20.000 --> 47:27.000
Like, okay, yes, I got what I wanted, but I still have this unfulfilled feeling because where's that surprise out of Ether?

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
Where's that, where's that, it's out now or I was not expecting this.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
And you know, honestly, to be fair to Microsoft, it really sucks.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
And this just goes why secrecy is so important in the industry and so forth.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
It really sucks that the cover was blown for them on the Halo collection.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
Because that would have killed if they'd kept that a secret.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
That would have really killed.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
Well, that and like Crackdown and like all the stuff that people knew was coming, you know,

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
just kind of waiting for them to acknowledge it.

47:57.000 --> 48:08.000
Right. One thing that concerns me a little bit about Microsoft is that I was actually commenting as we were listening to the press conference,

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
as we were driving so we couldn't watch, we were listening to the press conference and I checked out some of the video after the fact.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
I was listening to it and I was commenting to Jason.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
I said, Jason, I don't think there's been a Japanese developer up on that stage yet.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
Now they let off with one last year with Konami and the Metal Gear Solid.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
The Xbox One is launching in Japan later this year.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
How are they going to sell the Xbox to Japanese gamers?

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
All they have is Platinum.

48:32.000 --> 48:39.000
Yeah. After I said that, after I said that came out of my mouth, that's when they brought Platinum Games on stage and showed this, you know, scale bound.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Which to be fair, looks great.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Platinum Games, we love them. They're great.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
But it's one.

48:45.000 --> 48:50.000
And you know, the other thing they showed was Capcom's DLC for a game that's already out there.

48:50.000 --> 48:56.000
And I know what a lot of you at home are saying. You're probably saying, Rob, what about Tokyo Game Show?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
They're just sitting on it for Tokyo Game Show.

48:58.000 --> 49:09.000
But in my opinion, why would you wait until Tokyo Game Show when the Xbox is set to launch in Japan like 30 days after that?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
You need a little more time to build hype.

49:11.000 --> 49:18.000
So I'm a little concerned that we're just going to have a repeat of the 360 in Japan when it comes to Xbox One.

49:18.000 --> 49:25.000
I'm not convinced that they've got that support in Japan that they desperately need.

49:25.000 --> 49:33.000
The other thing that kind of annoyed me a little bit about the whole Capcom DLC is they had all these banners and costumes and stuff for Power Stone.

49:33.000 --> 49:38.000
I was like, ah, I want a new Power Stone game. What the hell, Capcom?

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
That and all the Mega Man stuff, of course, but seriously, a new Power Stone game would be awesome.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
That's a series you need to reboot.

49:46.000 --> 49:56.000
Hey, you know what, Capcom? I mean, you could put out like a billion versions of Street Fighter 4 and stuff, but how about a new Power Stone game?

49:56.000 --> 50:04.000
Just saying. Or, hey, how about just bring Power Stone to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
How hard would that be?

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Power Stone all the things.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I agree with that.

50:09.000 --> 50:15.000
Akuma JP in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com who lives in Japan says, we don't care, Rob.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000
That's my point exactly. That concerns me a little bit because that means Sony is running unopposed practically in Japan.

50:21.000 --> 50:28.000
Yes, there's Nintendo, but we all know Sony's hardware is packing a bigger punch and Nintendo's marching to the beat of their own drums.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
So it's a very different sort of contest.

50:30.000 --> 50:36.000
So you're telling me that Xbox is a non-factor in Japan. I'm not sure how that helps Microsoft.

50:36.000 --> 50:45.000
You know what I mean? Isn't the competition supposed to be a good thing? I don't know. I feel like that's a hugely missed opportunity.

50:45.000 --> 50:51.000
And Akuma JP goes on to say, Xbox 360 is dead here in Japan, so why should we get another brick?

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
Microsoft needs to convince you to get another brick.

50:54.000 --> 51:00.000
Another negative-ish comment in our chat that I think is worth bringing up.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
SDG100Matt says, Microsoft failed when they made it painfully obvious that they've killed the Kinect.

51:05.000 --> 51:10.000
Has Microsoft killed the Kinect? I'll tell you on the show floor, they did demo over on the side.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
They had a big old Kinect station for Fantasia.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Yeah, that's right. They did bring that up.

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
And on the flip side, they had Dance Central, which, you know, they also...

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Oh, yeah, I forgot about Dance Central.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
They did bring out Alex Rogopoulos to talk about Dance Central, although it's a download game.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
I'm sure you caught that. It is not a retail game. It's a download game.

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
Weird because, and this was a very good question that was asked on our interactive coverage,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
that I unfortunately was not able to get the answer to this question,

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
but will it work with all my existing Dance Central songs?

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
Because I'm a little worried about a digital-only $10 title that only has 10 songs,

51:43.000 --> 51:50.000
because Konami did that on the 360, and its big drawback was that there wasn't really enough variety.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
There wasn't enough songs on it.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.000
I could see it. I don't know about it being able to transfer the songs that are actually on the disc,

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
but maybe DLC might be compatible with it. Maybe.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Perhaps. I hope.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
Harmonix is pretty good about getting that stuff to work, you know, together.

52:05.000 --> 52:12.000
They are, but my concern is the fact that we've gone from 360 to the 1, so that's my worry.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
That's probably not going to be compatible with it.

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
Is it going to be able to go into the store and know I've bought these songs, so it'll bring them in?

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
It should. Yeah, it should, but are they going to put the effort in?

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
They'll just use the excuse, well, the stores are separate, sort of. We can't do that.

52:26.000 --> 52:32.000
I did watch Dance Central for a little bit. I was not willing to walk in there and make a fool out of myself dancing

52:32.000 --> 52:38.000
in that very public environment, but I will say the game looked very similar to the previous Dance Central games,

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
except the backgrounds, instead of being like you're in one static subway or whatever,

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
it seemed to be a little more music video to me, where you'd be in a subway,

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
and then the background would kind of shift, and now it's like lasers and things like that.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
So it did feel like that little extra being in the 1 kind of let the visuals pop a little more,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
especially with what was going on in the background.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
But at its core, it really is that fundamental Dance Central game, which isn't a bad thing.

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
I mean, it's a great series for the Kinect, and the 1 will benefit from having it.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
I just worry about the whole digital-only thing, so we'll see.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
TigerClaw in our chat asking, did Harmonix show the new Amplitude at E3?

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
Not out on the floor where it was visible. I don't know if they had anything in a meeting room or something like that,

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
but I would think it's still too early. I mean, that thing just got funded,

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
and I think any concept stuff they had, they already put out there to get the Kickstarter funded,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
so I don't think there was really anything new to say.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
Well, that and they don't have a publisher for it, and I don't think Harmonix had their own booth,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
so where would it be?

53:36.000 --> 53:44.000
So yeah, those were my only things about Microsoft. Although I think, yes, there are games,

53:44.000 --> 53:50.000
I am motivated to get an Xbox One. I did play Forza Horizon 2 on the show floor, I should mention that as well,

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
which the only unfortunate thing about that demo is I wasn't able to turn the cheats on and off.

53:55.000 --> 54:01.000
That's the greatest thing about the first game is that if I suck at drifting, I'll just have the game drift for me.

54:01.000 --> 54:08.000
Well, I couldn't do that in the demo, so I was having some problems, but the soundtrack, awesome, which you'd expect.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
I do like the ability to be able to cut through anything.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
Yeah, lots of off-road, the races were going off the road and all that too.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
The weather effect was pretty cool, I gotta say, as you're racing and then all of a sudden it starts raining, it was nice.

54:21.000 --> 54:27.000
So yeah, I think, and I know there's plenty of Forza Horizon fans out there in OLR land,

54:27.000 --> 54:33.000
I think everything you guys are thinking it's going to be on Xbox One, you're going to get it, so that's exciting.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I hope they do some type of bundle for it.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
I think that's all I want to say about Microsoft.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
I want to check in with Dark Soccer, I don't know if there's anything we've been saying or whatever,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
but anything perk your ears with the Microsoft stuff?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Nope, still don't care.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Still don't care?

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Still don't care.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Why?

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
I just haven't seen anything that excites me.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
The stuff that I want is coming out on Wii U.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
Could that possibly be the point I made a minute ago about the lack of,

55:01.000 --> 55:06.000
because if I go into your vault, a lot of the games are imported from Japan,

55:06.000 --> 55:11.000
so could that tie into the fact that Microsoft seems to be ignoring the Japanese audience?

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Possibly.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
They're just not putting out the kind of games I give a shit about.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
I mean, really, I really am more into the quirky games.

55:19.000 --> 55:27.000
I like JRPGs, I like, I really, yeah, they're just not putting out anything they really care about.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I don't like Halo.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
That's fair.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I don't like Fable.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
I don't really like many car games.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
I don't like, you know, war games.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Well, that's...

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
So, no.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
That's fair, everybody's got what they like and what they don't, you're not alone.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
A system is only as interesting as the games I want to buy for it.

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
Somebody in chat gave him an F, so you're not the only one.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
They don't get an F, they get a big stinky poop.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
All right, well, I will say this, though, for better or for worse,

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
because I want to make sure this gets touched on before I let Loki go on to the next one.

56:03.000 --> 56:10.000
The games at their booth was not only the Sunset Overdrive, the Forza Horizon, and some of these things,

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
but they did have a big section for indie games.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
And there was certainly that push, you know, to show that there are the indie games,

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
and they had that moment during the show where they were talking about the X, not XNA,

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
but Project, what is that called on the Xbox?

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Project TNA.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
No, somebody will say it in the chat.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
No, I know what you're talking about.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
But their indie movement, right?

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Yeah.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
And so they had some things on the show floor, like Threes was one of the big ones,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
because obviously that's a big iPhone game.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
That is a head scratcher.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
I mean, yeah, I understand, you know, the big, the draw is that you can play it in a window or something like that.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Yeah.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
While you're watching TV.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Yeah.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Yeah.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Well, there you go.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
So I did appreciate, though, that they gave a lot of space to indies,

56:51.000 --> 57:00.000
but I honestly truly feel the reason for it is because they didn't have a lot of stuff they wanted to put out there on the show floor otherwise.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
So give the space to people that do want to be out there putting their games public facing.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Again, control, right?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Control.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
Okay, that's Microsoft.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
What's up next?

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
You know, speaking of Microsoft real quick, and actually this kind of goes with Sony, too,

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
is I'm surprised that, you know, their versions of Minecraft that they have for, like, you know, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
don't have some sort of, like, graphical, like, enhancement to it.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
Like, you know how they have the Sonic Ether shaders that look fucking amazing and stuff?

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
It's like you'd think they'd be able to pull that off to make it look a little bit shinier.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
They just say, eh, fuck it.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Yeah.

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
I mean, I understand part of the charm is that it's not.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
No, but I understand it still can look that way and look fantastic.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
No, I got you.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Whatever.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Maybe the next Minecraft 2 or whatever.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Sony.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
So Sony, they had some interesting stuff to show off first.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Of course, you know, talking a little bit about Destiny.

57:50.000 --> 57:57.000
They have a, you know, a Destiny bundle that's coming with a white PlayStation 4 in September with the launch of the game.

57:57.000 --> 58:04.000
Some DLC for Infamous Second Son that follows Abigail Walker.

58:04.000 --> 58:11.000
They also, surprisingly, showed off LittleBigPlanet 3, which I thought was pretty sweet.

58:12.000 --> 58:21.000
And not only is LittleBigPlanet 3 going to have Sackboy, but there was also other characters in there as well, which I thought looked very interesting.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
I did get to play LittleBigPlanet 3 on the show floor.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
And the demo, Bobby and I both played it.

58:26.000 --> 58:33.000
And the demo featured only one of the new characters, Toggle, who switches between a big fat guy and a tiny little thing.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
So, like, get it? Toggle. You go between the two.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
So that was kind of neat.

58:37.000 --> 58:42.000
I like how those new characters all add new mechanics to the game.

58:42.000 --> 58:48.000
Because you have to really consider the weight of the character is are you going to float or are you going to sink in water?

58:48.000 --> 58:53.000
Or are you going to cause, you know, a platform to sink to launch you in the air when you toggle?

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
Like, it did bring something new to LittleBigPlanet.

58:57.000 --> 59:03.000
I think if you already have your mind made up on this franchise, like, because I know some people that are like,

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
eh, I'm not into LittleBigPlanet as a platformer, it kind of controls weird to me.

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
I don't think what they're doing in LittleBigPlanet 3 is going to win you over.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
But I personally think LittleBigPlanet is fantastic.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
I think it's a solid platformer and I like this direction they're going in.

59:19.000 --> 59:26.000
Yeah, and it looks like the major difference from this game versus the other games aside from the other characters is that they have more depth in there now.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
They have a lot of stuff that goes in, you know, towards the background and everything.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
The camera can shift back there, so it looks a little different.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
And, you know, like one of the questions I asked, you know, is all the DLC available?

59:37.000 --> 59:45.000
And they even said that all the levels online are currently compatible with that and they're going to look even better, so I think that's pretty cool.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
So, of course, they have that.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
They showed off a new game from From Software, which is called Bloodborne, and that looked pretty sweet.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
You know, if you're a fan of Dead Rising, not Dead Rising.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Dark Souls.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Dark Souls, yes. I was thinking the other one.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Anyways, and then of course, let's see, Far Cry 4.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000
They showed a little bit of that during the conference and that looks amazing.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Of course, more of that was shown at the Ubisoft press conference, but that looks like a pretty impressive game.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
That's kind of a must-have for me, I think.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Also, they teased, what is it, Dead Island 2, which looks pretty awesome.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I think it's going to take place in California now, which is not an island, but whatever.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Technicalities?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
We actually went to a presentation for Dead Island 2 and got to see the game.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
We got to see the game, not just the trailer, but they showed us an early build of the graphic engine.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And you guys know I had my issues with Dead Island Riptide, so I have to really withhold judgment on Dead Island 2 until the game is actually out.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I will say, graphically, it looks like they've made that big step up, and I think that is because they're on Unreal 4 now.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
They changed their engine.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:09.000
But what we saw was a pretty cool, like, it's these guys in a car and the car is driving into the town and then they kind of go.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:20.000
They get in a war with other humans, so they have other humans and zombies that are both against you.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
So you can lure the zombies into killing the other humans that are the enemies.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It creates this very interesting kind of three-faction game, which I think is kind of part of the twist.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It sounds like Dead Rising, almost.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah, in a way. But the whole trick is that the town that they're in isn't quarantined, so it is an island, because it's been quarantined.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Or maybe California finally fell into the ocean.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Perhaps, but it's very a parody of Hollywood Hills and Santa Monica and all that stuff.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:00.000
They mentioned, of course, that there's going to be a re-release of Grim Fandango.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
That's something we've redone, I guess, for PlayStation 4 and Vita, which is pretty exciting.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:16.000
That's more than pretty exciting. That was a great example of a WTF OMG moment that I sadly didn't get so much at a Microsoft conference.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
That was great.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
They were talking about Disney Infinity 2.0, and they're going to have a collector's edition.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I guess it's going to have Hulk in there for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, which I guess is neat.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's something that separates them a little bit.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Of course, one of the more interesting things in there is that they finally did announce that, hey, guess what?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.000
PlayStation Vita TV is coming to North America as PlayStation TV, and I think also Europe.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Now it's just PlayStation TV. You can get it for $99 or $139, and it comes with the Lego Movie video game and a DualShock 3 controller for $139.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So that's pretty awesome. Not only that, but there is also going to be a Vita version of Disney Infinity, so you can buy that for that as well.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I don't know. That's kind of interesting. I'm kind of thinking of maybe getting one, because I like the Vita games, but I just don't really want a Vita.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I've heard a lot of people really upset that Sony dropped the Vita branding from that device. I find that very interesting.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Something, if you're one of those people that's upset about that, I want you to consider who Sony's competitor really is with that device.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Well, not only that.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's Apple.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Well, not only that, though, they're incorporating that PlayStation TV into other devices, including televisions. That's why they've dropped the Vita TV thing.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Right. And that thing is going to cost just as much as an Apple TV, so that's going to cause Apple to kind of have to step up their game in regards to the gaming on that device and so forth.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. I did get a chance to play Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls on a PlayStation 4, but through the TV.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:15.000
They had some of those systems set up where you were actually playing on the PlayStation TV, where it was streaming from a PlayStation 4 that was elsewhere.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Probably locked away under the thing, but still, streaming from one device to the other. It actually played pretty well.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You would see artifacting every few seconds. You would see that. The image is downsampled to 720, but I think most people don't even really notice.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Well, in artifacting, it could have been from all that Wi-Fi bouncing around in there, because there's a ton of fucking shit going on in there.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I know Bobby was playing Drive Club on the same setup, and he saw a lot more of the artifacting, but when you think of a high-speed racer, the signal there has got to be a lot more data going through than a dungeon crawler like Diablo, where the image doesn't change as often.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So I found the experience to be fine. I was like, okay, yeah. I just personally don't think I really have a need for one, because I don't have a family where more than one person is trying to use the devices or whatever.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:11.000
So I'm not sure I see the situation where I need one yet, but I think it's great for other people.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:21.000
There's a brand new game from Suda51 called Let It Die. That was another thing that was announced that they kind of showed off there.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Also, the game streaming stuff will be coming to YouTube, so they're going to have that option available at some point.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And then, what else? I'm trying to think. Oh, yeah, of course. They showed a trailer for Grand Theft Auto 5 for the next-gen console, which we knew was coming to me, and PC, so that was pretty exciting.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Also, of course, confirming The Last of Us Remastered, which will be coming out at the end of July for PlayStation 4.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:06.000
They have Ratchet and Clank Redux, which I guess is going to be a remade game for PlayStation 4, and also along with the movie that will be coming out as well.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And, of course, they announced Uncharted 4 A Thief's End, which will be coming to PlayStation 4 as well.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And then, my personal favorite out of the whole thing is they showed a new trailer for No Man's Sky, which looks amazing.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.000
That did look pretty sweet, and a lot of people were really into that. What's the why in there for you? Why did that look great to you?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Why? Because it's just the whole fact that it's such an immersive game. It's basically all this procedurally generated universe, and it's seamless, flying from one planet to space to another planet.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
It just seems really interesting, and just the tech behind it and everything.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:07:02.000
The way they've made it sound is it might be a little bit like a DayZ or Rust or something like that, where you're playing with other players, and so you may encounter people that are hostile, or people that help you out, and that kind of stuff.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So, it sounds interesting.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Yeah, I thought that game looked really good, too. I wish there had been more of it at the show. I'm thinking it's still going to be a while before that game is actually out, but it sounded really good.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Yeah.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Anything else you want to say about Sony's conference?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I missed the last half, so I had to watch it later on so I didn't get to see it live, but I thought they had, I guess, some good, like, hey, and some more stuff we're going to show off that was kind of exciting.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I'm a little disappointed that The Last Guardian wasn't shown, but people kind of assumed that it wasn't going to be shown since there was a whole controversy that had been cancelled, and then it wasn't.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Yep.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
So, I don't know.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Interesting as well that Square Enix was completely absent. I mean, I know that they came out and said they weren't going to do anything with Final Fantasy XV or Kingdom Hearts III this year, but you still couldn't help but feel like there was a loss.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Like, you just sort of expect that Square Enix is going to pop up at Sony's conference and show something.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I expect to see some more of that stuff probably for, um...

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Tokyo Game Show.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Tokyo Game Show, yeah.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Yeah.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
It is disappointing that we didn't see any more Final Fantasy XV gameplay. I would have liked to have seen that, but, um, whatever.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Yeah, I agree with you on that. That was too bad, but, yeah, it's kind of one of those.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Well, it's also disappointing, too, that it's not announced like, oh, it's coming out later this year or something like that, you know, because I was kind of hoping that either one of those would come out, but I guess not.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Especially, you know, Kingdom Hearts, you kind of figure it wouldn't since, you know, 2.5 Redux isn't coming out until December, so you're kind of like, eh, it's probably not coming out this year.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So, I had a great opportunity, and I must admit, in the first time in the ten years I've been going to E3, I was able to attend one of the press conferences live, and Sony was the press conference I was able to go to, so thanks to Sony for having us there.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It was pretty cool. Myself and Bobby and some of the other indie podcasters like NinjaSista from ElectricSistaHood and some of the people she travels with, we all kind of went in there and we went right into the place, and we just kept walking and walking, because they weren't, like, there was no roped off areas or whatever,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:15.000
so we walked all the way down onto the floor, and I was, like, in the thirteenth row, so it was really cool to, like, kind of just be there and see it all kind of in person and, you know, just kind of experience all that.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I still walked out of there, though, certainly with pros and cons. The pros that I have is that I really think there was a great variety of games. I thought there was a lot of stuff being shown that's like, yes, I want that, yes, I want that.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I love that they brought up VibRibbon, but they showed, okay, but this was so, they showed VibRibbon, right, when they were introducing that one guy who's, like, you know, and then they went nowhere with it.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I was, like, they were hyping up how great VibRibbon was, and remember this classic and da-da-da, and then I was expecting them to say...

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
It didn't come out over here, really.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Exactly, right, and I was expecting them to say, and you should check this out on PlayStation Store today. Ah, it didn't happen.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So it's, like, don't tease me like that. I was mean. I was very mean to VibRibbon fans everywhere, Jamie. I had a sad for everybody with that.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:19.000
One of my favorite moments of the entire press conference was the game Entwined, which I think was the third game that they showed, that was that whole, this game is out right now on the Sony Store.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:32.000
What I loved about it, they were all students, fresh out of college, you know, they gave that whole, like, background about how they were all just fresh out of their master's program, and they basically started this new studio that's under Sony's wings.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Half of the individuals on the stage were women, which was very refreshing to see. They were playing the game. It was a good mix of everybody.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:51.000
So it had a great story. Indie, out today, surprise, going for that art thing that maybe Sony's worried they might be losing with that game company thing this year.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So that was definitely a moment that I liked. I did check out the game when I got home. I'm still formulating my thoughts on it, so I'll talk about it at a later show.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I think the game itself is kind of, it needs some more exposition in some parts. Like, I was having a very hard time understanding the why in some parts of the game, but hopefully it's one of those games like Journey where maybe it's kind of explained better at the end.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And you get to go to a concert.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
What's that?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And you get to go to a concert. Sorry, I was thinking of The Other Journey.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The Other Journey. But anyway, all that aside, the presentation at the conference, I still liked an awful lot, and I liked how they did that.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And that kind of leads me to say that one of the cons for the Sony conference for me, I thought the first half was way stronger than the second half, which isn't the way things are supposed to be.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:56.000
You're supposed to have all your stuff at the end, but I thought the first half was better. And I'm going to be honest, that whole presentation where the guy came out to talk about the Playstation TV show that just got greenlit brought everything to a screeching halt.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And you could feel it in the room. And you could feel like all the people around me were kind of like, okay, I mean it's like one of those games, we like this guy, we respect this guy, this is cool sounding, but everybody's just like, get on with it. This isn't going anywhere.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Oh yeah, it was, was it Powers or something?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Powers, yeah. The problem with Powers is that they had nothing to show. Not only did they do the TV thing that Microsoft got crucified for a year ago, you know, and even the people I was sitting with were like, oh yeah, sure, Microsoft's going to get an earful over when they talk about TV, but Sony's not going to get an earful over this.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Nope, Sony got an earful about it because a lot of people didn't like that. What was most disappointing to me about that, although I understand that Sony wanted to make the point about, yay, we have this TV show, yay, it's coming, they had nothing to show for it, but concept art.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Hey, here's a wonderful idea. How about you announce something like that at, I don't know, Comic Con that's coming up, you know, in like a month. I mean, why now? Yeah. And he talked way too long about it.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Uh, Black Wolf is correcting me in chat saying it's not indie, it's a Sony owned studio. So I apologize I misspoke because I thought I did say it was a Sony owned studio that is Sony kind of backing it.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:18.000
So it isn't indie in that regard, but it still had that kind of indie cred feel to it is what I meant because it was all these students that they were really taking right under the wing and bringing into this. And again, a very diverse group that was on the stage.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
That was great to see.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Wait, that was Bendis on stage, was it?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Uh, during the Powers thing, yeah.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah, he's awesome.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Yes, but unfortunately in this context, he brought everything to a screeching halt.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
See, that's something I would have done as a separate announcement.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Yeah, or just tighten it up a little. Tighten it up a little. It went on too long. So that was a little bit of a minus for me. But otherwise, there was a lot of stuff I kind of walked out being really jazzed about. Maybe I'll roll this over to part B, but I want to talk about the Morpheus for sure later on.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And also, the other thing was PlayStation Now going into beta on July 31st.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Which I got a code for that, so I checked that out this week too, and it plays pretty well.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:14.000
There's not a lot of... the games on there right now is not a lot of stuff I think you'd be like, yay, I really want to play this game. But it's enough on there to test the service and see how it responds.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And it works pretty well, I got to say.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Anything else on Sony's conference?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Nope, that's it.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Loki, I'm going to ask you the same question I asked you before. Dark Soccer, if you want to jump in too, did it sell you on a PlayStation 4? I already have one, so I can't answer this question.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I already wanted a PlayStation 4, and see, that's the thing. I'd want a PlayStation 4 for games that are maybe on both systems, but there wasn't anything that they showed at that conference that was exclusively PlayStation 4 that I must have.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000
That was the thing. So, no, not really. They didn't really sell me on anything with what they had.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And that's the thing, maybe I'll hold off on a PlayStation 4 and just get an Xbox One first or something, which is kind of the complete opposite of what I was thinking.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:06.000
But it's, where are the games that I want to play? Are they on one system or the other system? So I'll pick whatever platform the games are on.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:16.000
But then again, I don't really have to have that stuff right away, because, you know, Forza Horizon 2 is kind of the only thing that's coming, I guess that and Sunset Overdrive.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:27.000
But yeah, PlayStation, there wasn't really anything that I have to have to have, although it would be nice to be able to play all that stuff I have on my backlog as far as, you know, PlayStation Plus stuff.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:37.000
And then, you know, I'd be interested to see what, they're supposed to have something exclusive for Grand Theft Auto 5 on PlayStation 4, so I'd be interested to see what that is.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But really, there wasn't anything exclusive, because I don't play Uncharted. Little Big Planet, I'm kind of done with that series just because I didn't play 2, and I don't know.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
You might miss out. What about The Order or some of those other stuff?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Order I don't give a shit about. I don't know. It's just, there wasn't really anything that was must-have, I think, for me.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Jamie, quick thoughts?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I'm really still unimpressed. I mean, actually, I am really interested in Powers, because I, alright, Bendis wrote one of my favorite comic series ever, which was Alias.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It has nothing to do with the TV show Alias and The Pulse, which I will, to this day, rant about. So I really enjoy his writing, and I'd like to see more from him.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Okay.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Other than that, I kind of don't care. For me, it's, I'm gonna wait and wait till the games are out and maybe play them and then decide if that's worth spending money on.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
But I've already decided what it is I want to get out of the season, so.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Okay. I will say this to Sony's credit. I want to also mention at their booth, they also had a large chunk of indie games, actual indie games.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:58.000
They had a big chunk of them there, and I was very impressed. One of the games I got my hands on, because I saw this at the booth, and Xtafer always, my buddy over at Horde House, he always talks about this game on Twitter and how much he loves Assault Android Cactus.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Well, it's coming to PlayStation 4. It's like a, it's a Smash TV-esque kind of game, but it has, you know, different elements. It's, you know, polygon and space, and you have these things where you can switch weapons, and you do a jump dodge when you switch weapons.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000
That helps you get out of things. You have flamethrowers and stuff. So, fun little game. I liked it. I enjoyed it, and I was very impressed that the guy was asking me,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Oh, what do you think? You know, what do you think of the game and so forth? And I noticed he had an Australian accent, and he mentioned, Oh yeah, this game was developed in Australia. I'm one of the guys who worked on it.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:38.000
So I thought that was really cool that Sony not only had the indie games on display in their booth, they had some of the guys who made them there to be the ones demoing them.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And if you listen to what I said earlier, that's what I loved most out of E3 this year, is when the people that made the games were actually there, kind of demoing them and showing that passion they have for the games.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:56.000
So I was very excited about that, and hopefully getting them on a future edition of the show when the game gets a little closer to launch on PlayStation 4, because it was a lot of fun.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And it's something that is on Steam right now, but I think obviously PlayStation 4 will open it up to a different audience.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:10.000
But yeah, very impressed with the number of indies in Sony's booth as well. That's it for Sony.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Should we jump ahead to Nintendo then?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yeah, sure, why not. Nintendo, they of course have a press conference, but they have their live video direct thing, which started off really strange.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Not typical for Nintendo. They started off with animations by Robot Chicken, which I thought was very unique.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And they had also this thing where there was a fight between Reggie and Iwata. I thought that was pretty cool.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000
They were having fun with it, and that's kind of the vibe.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Are you saying you kind of enjoyed Nintendo's presentation?

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Yeah, I enjoyed it. Some of the stuff I still don't get. They showed off their miniature figures, and seriously, what the fuck is up with Nintendo and naming shit?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Amiibo is the dumbest fucking name for... I mean, it's different, but yeah, it's just... what?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I thought it was supposed to be a play on the word Amigo, like the Spanish word for friend. I thought that's what it was.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:32.000
But maybe it was just me. I don't know. That's what I got out of it. And certainly me being in the title was important too.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Yes. So they have these figures now that are going to tie in with Smash Brothers. They're called Amiibo.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And what they basically are is you use them with your tablet, and it creates this computer-controlled character that you can fight with, fight against, fight for you.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And you train it like I guess you would Pokemon or something. It levels up, and you can use it in other games, I guess.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.000
And one of the games that it's going to be patched into later on is Mario Kart 8. They're supposed to have support for that there.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I don't really know how that's going to work, but okay.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Of course, they showed a little bit about Smash Brothers. The 3DS version they announced the date for, so October 3rd for that, which is not really in the window that they originally had, which was summer, but okay, whatever.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:31.000
They showed off Yoshi's Woolly World, which is the kind of Yarn Yoshi game that's going to be for Wii U. That's not coming out until next year.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, which is coming out for the Wii U this holiday.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:50.000
They showed off Hyrule Warriors, which is going to be September. A little trailer for Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby, which I guess was in November.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Bayonetta 2 for Wii U. They confirmed that it will be out this year in October, and not only that, but it will be coming with the original Bayonetta game as well, so that's pretty exciting.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:10.000
That was a good wow moment, because how I was supposed to get into Bayonetta 2 if I've never played one. That's great that they did that.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Kirby's Rainbow Curse. They announced that that's kind of a claymation looking game coming to the Wii U. That's 2015 as well.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:38.000
A brand new franchise, or I guess IP they announced, which is Splatoon, which is kind of interesting. It was Miyamoto's game, and it's a four on four third person shooter game,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:47.000
but it has these school girl looking things that are actually like squids. They transform into this little girl, and they're running around shooting ink.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:57.000
When you're in your own ink, you move faster, and you can transform into a squid and move faster. The whole object of the game is who can cover more of the map with your own color.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:04.000
It's a shooter in that sense, and it was pretty interesting. I watched a lot of that during their live coverage, and it looks like an interesting game.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It's multiplayer only, which is definitely, knowing Nintendo's track record, different.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Wouldn't that be something? That is the whole online shebang and everything too, which I believe, because I think they talked about what voice chat is supposed to be, right?

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I know that's a title that Nintendo fans are getting really excited about because it's a shooter game that's not all the stuff that comes with a shooter game.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000
It's Nintendo's very definite spin on that idea, which is pretty cool.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:45.000
They confirmed Mario Maker, which is for the Wii U, and you'll be able to make your own Super Mario Bros. levels, both original and new Super Mario Bros. U style.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Act F is jumping in in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, saying Splatoon isn't made by Miyamoto. It's actually made by the Animal Crossing guy, if I recall correctly.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
It's under his supervision.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Miyamoto, they're stretching him really thin, it sounds like right now.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Just some other quick comments about Nintendo, because I want to make sure we're getting our chatters to listen here.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Tigerclaw says, the Captain Toad game is really interesting. Nintendo literally took one of the highlights of Super Mario 3D World and turned it into a full game.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:20.000
You have to kind of wonder if that was the plan the whole time. It was a backdoor pilot, as they call it in television. I don't know, it's very interesting.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Dark Tetsuya is saying, I'm curious about the integration of Mario Kart 8 with those figures. So, some of the comments there.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Well, I'm sure it's just going to be AI Racers is what it's going to be.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I personally, not to backtrack, but I wasn't completely convinced what those figures are really supposed to do.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:49.000
That's exactly my thing. I don't know why they would have been better off having a Wii U Pokemon game that had Pokemon amiibos or whatever.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And then that would have been like, oh, sweet, I can trade my Pokemon.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:00.000
But, there's still that part of me that's like, sweet, official Nintendo figures that I can have up on the shelf. I'm kind of excited about that.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I think that they're supposed to work with Swap Force or somehow it's got some compatibility with Swap Force in there as well.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I don't know if you're going to be able to play as Mario in Swap Force or something like that on the Wii U.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
That might be a stretch, but we'll see.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Anyways, they showed off Xenoblade Chronicles X or Cross or whatever you're going to call it, and that's coming out in 2015.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And of course, they announced that Paulina from Kid Icarus is going to be a playable character as well.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And then, of course, the big hopefully expected surprise was they showed off the new Zelda game release.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
They showed off a trailer for it, and it looks fucking amazing.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Seriously, that's going to sell me a Wii U for sure.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Because it's what I wanted. It's a cel-shaded, Wind Waker-like game that looks like the fucking universe from Link to the Past.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
That's what I wanted. That was my Zelda game right there. There you go. There it was.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
So when that comes out, I'll have to get a Wii U. But until then, maybe not.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:09.000
But still, to hear you come on this show, I think a lot of people were waiting for you to get all revved up and go off on Nintendo tonight as you have some years past.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
You're much more reserved tonight. You seem like a satisfied gamer after Nintendo's conference. Is that correct?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
It looks impressive. They're saying it's going to be an open world Zelda game.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
They're like, okay, see those mountains back there? You can go to those mountains if you want.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:35.000
It just looks really impressive. If, and this is the big if, if they can pull off, because it is supposed to be in-engine, but if they can pull off in their final game, what was in that trailer, then cool.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Then yeah, that sells out on me. If it's not quite that cool, then we'll see. But it looks really good.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Act F wants me to correct you. It's Palutena, not Paletta.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Whatever, I don't give a shit. I really don't.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Hey, I'm happy to see the Kid Icarus love, to be honest.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:00.000
And then of course, you know, that was only what was in the Direct. They had a ton of shit that didn't even make it in the Direct.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Like hardly any 3DS stuff in the Direct, and they were kind of spilling that out, like the Advanced Wars-esque game.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Yeah, Project Steam. They had Professor Layton versus Phoenix Wright was going to be coming out.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:25.000
They had this Fantasy Life game that looks like Harvest Moon. On the Wii U, Mario Party 8, or Mario Party 10, I'm sorry, which is kind of like Bowser Party or something.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Not really shown there, but they're working on a new Star Fox game, so there's that.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Shit, I'm trying to remember what else was in there. They had a new Mario Minis game.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Was it Mario versus Donkey Kong or something like that? March of the Minis type thing.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Lots of stuff.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:57.000
So let's ask the question, you know, what were the pros and cons, and is this what Nintendo needed to sell more Wii U's, which they need to do?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Your thoughts, Loki?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Well, I like the way that they presented everything and had that livestream where they had gameplay footage and stuff throughout the whole thing, so you can kind of get in-depth looks at everything.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Do you think Nintendo might be ahead of the times with this, that E3 might end up going this direction for everybody in the near future?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I think it was a great idea, because coming out of it, because I watched it for most of the three days, and I got a better understanding of what they're coming out with versus some of these other...

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Cool, I know what Mortal Kombat is, but I didn't really get to see any footage of it.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I'm sure I could have watched one of those Spike TV shows or whatever that was doing streaming and stuff, but I ended up watching that most of the time.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:51.000
And watching the Smash Bros. tournament, man, watching everybody get so excited about it, it's gonna be huge, I think.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I kind of agree. I think that we're a few years away from Sony and Microsoft going this route.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And I think it's gonna r- I mean, some people may not agree with me, and that's fine, but I think this is really turning into something that's really working well for Nintendo.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:15.000
And I think if Sony and Microsoft can look at it and go, wow, we could really save a shit ton of money by going this route and still keep our fans happy and engaged.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I kind of think they're gonna go that way, and this could be very interesting for E3 as a show.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Here's the problem, though, with Sony and Microsoft doing something like that.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Right now, they've made a point with all these Nintendo Directs to make their president and stuff very much a face and just kind of a spokesperson of their products and everything, like Reggie and Miyamoto and all that stuff.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:44.000
You kind of expect them to come out and talk about all this stuff, whereas Microsoft, I don't really expect the head of Microsoft to come out and start talking about new Xbox games.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
It just doesn't seem-

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Well, I think Phil Spencer's-

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Yeah, he's okay.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:58.000
He's getting into that role. He'll be good. And Sony, if Jack Trenton were still there, would certainly have the guy that was capable of doing it. They'll groom somebody else to do it.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I guess Major Nelson could do that.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Sure. Finding that face isn't that-

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And if it went in doubt, go to a third party. And Nintendo even did that by integrating the robot chicken and the very tongue-in-cheek, poking fun at themselves stuff that really-

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I mean, that guy in the audience with the press badge saying, where's Mother 3, losers? And then Reggie's setting him on fire.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
That was a pretty awesome moment, although-

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Well, at the same time, though, they were saying, oh yeah, we're going to have this special announcement for a brand new 3DS game and stuff. I was like, oh man, you watch this, it's going to be Mother 3.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And instead it was Project Steam. I was like, eh, I don't fucking care. But I don't know. It was okay. I think that they have a decent lineup.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:53.000
My worry still, though, is they don't have the third party support. And even though they have these great games, and some that are going to be real- I mean, Zelda is going to sell a ton of fucking systems, but it's not until 2015.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000
And most likely holiday 2015. That's a lot of time for them to lose market share.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I painfully agree. There's a lot that I really love about what Nintendo's doing, and I think a lot of these games sound great, but it's like, when you spread these games out between now and holiday 2015, which is the reality of the library we're seeing, only the Wii U stuff. 3DS is a whole other thing.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
3DS is fine.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:30.000
It's fine. When you look at the Wii U specifically, I have that same reservation. You know, last week I talked on the show about what's the Hail Mary play going to be, and for better or worse, Nintendo didn't make one.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.000
They're sticking to their guns, so they could reveal more, peel back the onion a little more at Tokyo Game Show.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
There's still- was it Gamescom that they could announce more stuff, but I just-

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Here's the thing at the end of the day. I think it's great that they've got Miyamoto working on these gamepad-heavy games that really are going to show the console.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:07.000
It would have- and I love Miyamoto, guys, don't get me wrong, but it would have had five times more the impact if it had been, here is Ubisoft showing us how they are going to use the gamepads on their games.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Insert whatever third party you want there in that example I just gave. I would have been a little more excited about that, because that would be more games to fill in these long gaps we're going to have between the Splatoon, the Mario Maker, and so on.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Well, that's the thing too, it's like- not getting Miyamoto, but the stuff that they were showing, like his project robot, big robot game or whatever, kind of like dumb.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Like, I just didn't get it. It looked like something like, okay, cool, that's going to be another minigame that's on the next Nintendo Land or something like that.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So, it just wasn't doing it for me. I'm not excited about that. It wasn't like, here's this really unique idea for a game that we came up with, but now it's like, here's this game, it's a robot fighting game.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:01.000
It seriously reminded me of Tank! Tank! Tank! I'm like, well, I was kind of excited about that and it came out and it really sucked.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of this giant robot fighting thing that you're- I think you're wasting time on this, you know? It's what it makes me feel like.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:20.000
There is a lot to get excited about with Nintendo, don't get me wrong, and I have to admit, I kind of walked out of it going, they make a great argument for being the second console in your house.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:35.000
They make an amazing argument for being the second console in your house, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, I think Nintendo would be in a great position if every household had a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One and a Wii U, right?

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:45.000
That would be a great- that's kind of what the Wii was for a lot of people, was a lot of the gamers' second console, but it's just really about kind of convincing that, you know, people need to get one already.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Also, some of their- like, I've got to knock Reggie a little bit for some of his comments he made regarding like questions, you know, hey, are you guys gonna, you know, start supporting, you know, Twitch streaming or something like that on your console?

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And, you know, instead of maybe- I guess it would be wrong for him to say that the hardware's not powerful enough to support Twitch streaming because that's probably the situation, but, you know, he's like, well, it's just not fun.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Twitch streaming's just not fun, so that's why we don't have it included in the console. And the same thing with VR. He's like, well, VR's just not ready yet, so, you know, when it is, you know, Nintendo will be there, but I think-

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
But you'll be there late with that attitude. That's the problem.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.000
It's like, yeah, you're finally getting online now, but how many years late are you? By the time you get there, it's just gonna be too late.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:39.000
The Twitch TV thing reeked of an excuse to me because he says that, yet they did all that streaming through Twitch for all three days.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I get that there's a difference between a packaged Nintendo presentation that runs a little more like a TV show versus Joe Schmo in his apartment streaming games.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:57.000
But that con- I mean, I don't know. Don't Bite the Hand that Feeds You is kind of what I'm saying with that. I sort of felt that comment did feel really out of touch to me.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And if they didn't think the Twitch streaming was fun, then why include some sort of option in Mario Kart 8 to export your race highlights if they didn't think that was fun?

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:16.000
He had an answer for that. He had an answer for that. That's where he invoked Angry Luigi and all that, you know, and he had an answer for it, but it did feel a little bit more like an excuse.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Let's be real, guys. The Wii U isn't technologically capable of doing the Twitch streaming. That's what it really boils down to, so we have to say, oh, well, gamers don't really want that.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:34.000
That's a little bit of smoke and mirrors, in my opinion. Good thing you don't need them to integrate it on the console to actually be able to do it, right?

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.000
You can get a capture card and do it that way. You don't necessarily need them to do that.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Some comments on the third-party thing. Act deft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Sky, the thing is that third parties aren't going to save the console, and Nintendo has realized this.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:55.000
WhatupG says, people mainly get a Nintendo console for Nintendo. The days of the Nintendo slash Super Nintendo are long gone.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:04.000
AkumaJP says, my absolutely honest opinion, Miyamoto is out of touch. They need to get a new leader.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:14.000
That's a very strong comment. I don't know if I would necessarily 100% agree in that, but I do see some of my own feeling in what he's saying.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Maybe it's not that... I certainly respect Miyamoto. He's done amazing things for gaming. Maybe my concern is I'm getting a little burned out on him.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Does that make sense? Because it's always the same faces at Nintendo. It's always the same people rolling out the games.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And don't get me wrong, they make great games, but I want to see what other people do, too.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Maybe, like to use the analogy of Dance Dance Revolution, maybe it's like he's like Naoki.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Naoki, his songs were pretty awesome at first. And then you hear the fifth iteration of Brilliant 2U in another game, and you're just like, you know what?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.000
It sounds about the same. I'm kind of getting a little tired of it. It's not really that unique anymore.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:03.000
For me, it's just... I don't know. The stuff that he's doing doesn't seem as innovative as it used to be like.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Well, I see again. I don't know how to go that far. But it's not necessarily everything he touches is gold. He's not the gaming prophet.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Because what's the sub-game that went free-to-play on 3DS? That was all him, wasn't it?

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:29.000
It's not that good. Sorry to say. But again, don't get me wrong. Gaming, we have so much to owe to him and so forth.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:37.000
There's, I'm sure, a lot of great things still to come from him. But there's a lot of other great innovators out there, too.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:46.000
And it really sucks. Nintendo can't convince them to make a game for their console. Still. That's my concern.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I think at this point, what Nintendo needs to do is really get on board with getting those indies on there.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Because that's really what's going to come down to, I think. It's so EA and Ubisoft. Ubisoft has been pretty good still supporting them even though their games have been selling that well.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Although they are holding back some titles because there's not a lot of consoles out there.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:14.000
But at least they still have the support for the Wii U. EA, of course, not supporting them at all.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
But I think if they got a lot more exclusive indie titles and stuff, that might help.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Because at least that way, right now I know there's a pretty decent barrier to entry for indies to get on the console.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:31.000
And Nintendo could really streamline that and make it a lot more easier like Sony seems to be doing.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I think that would be beneficial for them.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Alright, so any other final thoughts on Nintendo? DarkSakura, you've been quiet, but I know you had some thoughts on Nintendo.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Want?

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So whereas the other two, you were a fan of what you saw with Nintendo.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Yeah, I mean Dan and I actually legitimately talked about getting a Wii U.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Talking about which one we're going to get. Probably the one that comes with Mario Kart and the extra stuff.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000
If it's still available, I don't know if it is anymore.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
We have ways.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Well let me ask you this though, you know I'm going to ask this. Why? Why were you sold on Nintendo where you weren't with the others?

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Stuff that actually looks fucking fun. I mean seriously, it has stuff that looks fun. It has stuff I care about.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.000
That's why I want it. The other stuff didn't look very fun to me, so I didn't care.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
What? What? I mean just-

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I want Hyrule Warriors by the way.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
So those are the types of games that look fun.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Yeah, I want that. I want Smash Brothers. I want, um. Yeah, I want Hyrule Warriors and Smash Brothers.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Oh, that's right. That was the other announcement is your Mii can now be in Smash Brothers, which I thought was interesting.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I like their little splash, like iced tea pours on the heat or something like that. That was funny.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And Tiger Claw about the Mass Effect mentioned during EA.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
We'll get there. We'll get there.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
I'm just saying, no.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
We'll get there.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Alright, so Wunt from Dark Sakura. It does seem like ever since Mario Kart 8 came out and leading into E3, it is kind of like you see them accelerating.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
To make a little pun on the kart game, they're definitely getting into accelerating mode right now.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Maybe they stalled out for a little while, but you definitely see that acceleration coming.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000
We'll just have to see if it keeps them sailing through the holidays because that would be the important stuff.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Yeah.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Alright. That is it for Nintendo. I think at this point, since we're about an hour and a half into the show, let me roll over the other two into Part B to kind of start to cover some of our news there.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Because I want to make sure we cut on some of our other segments as well here, including release dates.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.000
We need to travel around the world and check out what games are coming out to a store near you next week, if anything.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I'm not sure there's an awful lot, but we'll check it out anyway.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Next week is pretty much EA Sports UFC, so you can play Bruce Lee there.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and then on PC, Tropico 5. That is it.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Alright. Well, heading over to Japan and checking out the releases over there.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:09.000
It is a little different because their games are on a different type of release schedule.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Trying to bring up those dates right now.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Looking at the PlayStation 4 this week, there's nothing until the 26th.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000
On the 26th, they get Watch Dogs, but that's not now.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
On the PlayStation 3, there's CV Casting Voice.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
No idea what that is, but that's from Bandai Namco. It's coming out.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Nothing on the 360 either in Japan.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Going to the Vita, there's a couple things.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
There's Sengoku Hime 4, which is coming out.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:43.000
There's also Hotaru no Niki is coming out from Nippon Ichi.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
That is all on the Vita this week.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000
And the Wii U does not have anything this week either, so it's also a slow week over in Japan.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.000
3DS, Pacworld, Pokemon Art Academy is probably the big release this week.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Konchuu Monster Super Battle, so 3DS seems to be having the biggest week in Japan.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
There's some stuff. What's coming out is on...

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Great, and it reloads.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.000
On the 17th, we have EA Sports UFC.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
On the 18th, the Walking Dead Game of the Year edition.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000
And... what's the end of the week?

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Oh yes, the 21st, sorry.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
On the 19th, we have God of Fire, Rise of Prometheus, Pool Box World.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
And on the 20th, Atelier Rosa Plus.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000
And... what are you doing?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000
And a few other things. Sorry, my iPad has decided to go crazy on me.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And Divinity, Original Sin. There we go.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, drink.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Alright, I want to touch on one other thing here before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
And you know, this is a controversy that came out of E3.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And I did want to touch on this. We've referenced this a little bit earlier in the show, but I think it is important to bring this up.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:14.000
And yes, I'm going to go there with the whole Assassin's Creed Unity and the comment that was definitely heard around the industry about the female players.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
And why is there not a female assassin in the multiplayer mode?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:27.000
And in an interview with Polygon, Creative Director Alex Amancio said, in response to Why Aren't There Female Avatars,

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000
quote, it's double the animations, it's double the voices, all that stuff, and double the visual assets.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Especially because we have customizable assassins. It was really a lot of extra production work.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.000
The common denominator was Arno. It's not like we could cut out our main characters.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:46.000
So the only logical option, the only option we had was to cut the female avatar.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Apparently originally they were going to do a female avatar, but they ended up dropping said avatar.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Which obviously had a lot of people very upset.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:03.000
A lot of people making the point that it doesn't seem to be a problem for Nintendo to have an extensive line of female characters in their games.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
But yet it does seem to be a problem for Ubisoft.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Naturally, Ubisoft had to do a little bit of damage control and company spokesman Michael Beadle came out later in the week and said,

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:18.000
we recognize the valid concern around diversity in video game narrative.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Assassin's Creed is developed by a multicultural team of various faiths and beliefs.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And we hope this attention to diversity is reflected in the settings of our games and our characters.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Whoopty shit.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:36.000
That, I hope this comment doesn't come off as crass, but that very much strikes me as I have a black friend.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Yeah, no, it's, and I am very, very, very angry at them because first of all, it's actually not that difficult.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Let me finish, I will absolutely let you have your retort.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Assassin's Creed Unity is focused on the story of the lead character Arno.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Whether playing by yourself or with a co-op shared experience, you as the gamer will always be playing as Arno.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Complete with his broad range of gear and skill sets that will make you feel unique.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.000
With regard to diversity in our playable assassins, we featured Aveline, Connor, Adewell, and Altair in Assassin's Creed games.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
And we continue to looking at showcasing diverse characters.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
We look forward to introducing you to some of the strong female characters in Assassin's Creed Unity.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
As soon as we finish making them.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I added that last part myself.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Go ahead, Darcyra.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:31.000
It's just them trying to sugarcoat, you know, oh, we fucked up, let's try to make this look like we're actually not the assholes that we are.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
No.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:40.000
They did have a female assassin in the PlayStation Vita version, which then also came out on, uh...

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Token female character?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
She was a slave, I mean.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Here's the thing. I kind of think the problem is, obviously this whole issue has been a dam waiting to burst.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:02.000
In my opinion, Ubisoft is just the one who put their foot in their mouth, but it was going to happen to somebody.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Yeah.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
This is not a reflection.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
It's been needing to come out.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I don't think this is a reflection on Ubisoft as much as it is the industry, believe it or not.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I mean, I almost... I don't know how much I... I almost feel bad for this guy.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Don't quote me on that.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000
But the reason why I'm saying that is because I think what...

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:32.000
The problem is, this guy was responding to a very tough question, and he said something he really, really, really shouldn't have said.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:40.000
He was trying to make an excuse for something that, you know, is a problem much bigger than him and his game.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Does that make sense what I'm saying, Jamie?

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I don't know. At the same time, like, I understand why people want female playable characters in games,

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:54.000
but at the same time, I don't think anybody should be forced to have to make female playable characters in every single game.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
That's what I'm saying. You know, if their choice was, we want to have, you know, male characters in this game,

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
and they come up with four male assassins or whatever, fine, that's their choice.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
And say, you know what? These are the characters we decided to go with.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
That's fine. Don't make any excuses. Oh, it was too hard.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:17.000
The problem is that when you have maybe ten developers taking that same excuse,

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:23.000
and one here or there that's like, yeah, we're inclusive, we're making it equal footing.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:30.000
You know, I mean, even, you know, BioWare, you know, they put in a female shepherd as an afterthought, I think, for the first Mass Effect.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:41.000
And then later when they found that, yeah, people actually enjoyed the character, then they made something a little bit more, you know, open, but still.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
For me, it wasn't necessarily what was said, but it was how it was said that was the problem.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I mean, that's what it really was bound to, because here's the thing.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:55.000
If he had just come out and said, okay, you know, this is, we don't envision that the player is playing themselves.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:03.000
This is a story that's told through Arno's eyes, and in multiplayer, honestly, it's just copies of Arno. That's it.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:11.000
And then the developer immediately followed it with, but we do have strong females in, you know, Assassin's Creed Unity that are here and here and here,

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:18.000
and gave examples instead of, we'll show you later, you know, and had examples ready to give.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I think the reception would have been a lot different.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:28.000
The whole thing about saying that, you know, that, you know, like I was going back to the ten developers who were saying,

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:34.000
oh, well, why should we have to, you know, put a female in the character just for the sake of doing it, that makes you part of the problem.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:45.000
It's because you were saying it's for the sake of doing it instead of, you know what, it's a good idea to have a female character, because it shouldn't matter, gender.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Instead of, we're throwing a bone to, oh, here, just put a female character in it because we have to.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:48:00.000
No, that's not how it is at all. We need to see more strong, independent female characters that are created for their own purpose and not just because they're female.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:11.000
They just happen to be female. I don't know if that makes sense, but imagine, imagine, and I'm trying to think of something, you know,

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:17.000
if you have a character that's put in just because they're gay. Oh, we need to have a gay character in every game.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:29.000
It's more tokenism at that point instead of, oh, and by the way, you know, I am this other sexuality. It doesn't have anything to do with my job, you know.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I think that if you're going to have a female character…

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Last of Us was a great example of that done right.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Yeah.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Like the character wasn't like token, it was just like, oh, he just, you know, this is part of the story, part of the narrative.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Or like in Tomb Raider is one that did it right. I mean, the last Tomb Raider that came out, I'm saying, instead of, you know, massive wrack Laura.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I'm saying the fact that she was thrust into the situation, she, you know, it could have been a boy stuck on the ship.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:02.000
You could have been, you know, her stuck on the ship. The fact is that you had a person thrust in the situation and they used their skills to persevere,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:10.000
has nothing to do with her being female or whatever she was or whatever subplot with her loving her friend or whatever people are shipping them.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.000
That has nothing to do with it. The fact is that the character was able to persevere in that type of environment. Does not matter about gender.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Right.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
And that's what we need more characters like.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Right.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I would like to see more female characters that I can identify with, but I don't agree with we have to put a female in here because people are going to be mad if we don't.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
No, that makes you part of the problem.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:39.000
So with that being said, because I was about ready to walk out of this story going, I think this is a good thing for the industry at the end of the day.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:54.000
I think we needed to get pissed off. I think as gaming fans and so forth, this is a dialogue that needs to happen within the game industry that yes, there are a lot of female gamers too that would like to see themselves represented a little better in games.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Some people are doing it right, but some not aren't necessarily doing it right. You know, Nintendo, we just talked about how it does a great job of intermixing all types of characters.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Then again, of course, they floundered a bit when it came to the sexuality issue. They've done a good job with men and women don't have the greatest track record when it comes to, you know, the sexuality spectrum.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.000
But, you know, as far as this issue goes, they're doing well so far and making progress on the other things too.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Also, and I understand it's probably more teasing IKUMA GPS, you know, what's wrong with the big rack? And I said, a woman is worth more than her body.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:36.000
But boobs are nice, but they don't have to be. But I think it's important to know women come in all shapes and sizes.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:51.000
But imagine having this lump of fat and glands on your chest and trying to run in a t-shirt and bra. That's not very, that's the same reason I disagree with the boob cup armor, you know what I mean, Rob? Like the bull bras?

01:50:51.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Because you actually need to strap the girls down to be effective in battle rather than having them, you know, move painfully or being stabbed through them maybe or falling the wrong way and having that cup go into your sternum, for example.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000
You know, fucking men. Don't let men design armor.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
So do you think that-

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
And you know what I mean by fucking men.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Do you think that this ultimately was something that needed to happen to our soccer or are you afraid that it's going to result in tokenism?

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I think it's going to have to be approached very carefully. And the whole problem is that if it hadn't been all this patriarchal bullshit in the first place, we wouldn't have to have this discussion.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.000
So really, I blame a few thousand years worth of male dominated history for this.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
But we can't change the past. We can only change the future.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Exactly. And that means learning from it. Learning what happens when you deal with degrading somebody into a token place, making them there out of pity rather than giving them a true and honest place within that framework.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:03.000
And so that's going to have to be the approach to be taken. How can we do this respectfully instead of just throwing a bone?

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.000
All right. I'm sure this discussion could take up a whole three hours on its own, but we have a busy show tonight. So I invite your feedback.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Participate at orangeontradio.com or we'll be taking some calls a little later in the show.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000
One thing. There was a question asked about man boobs.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:31.000
I've never seen them make boob cups on male armor unless it's Batman. So not an issue. Strap it down.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:37.000
If you want to see a great job of armor that objectifies men, go play Final Fantasy 14.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Amen. Or actually, and I was watching because I don't watch Watch Once Upon a Time, but I've been looking, trying to get into it.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:50.000
You see an example of female armor done right. Look at Mulan. Just saying.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:58.000
All right. Let's take a trip down memory lane to a time when, you know, it was a strong female.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
We took off our armor and ran around in bikinis.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:14.000
All right. We're going to take a time when things were a little simpler and maybe a little more innocent in the gaming industry with a classic video game where Dark Soccer is going to go into the gaming archives and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking out this game.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:19.000
It's the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer. What have you picked this week?

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Ninja Golf. Because Ninja Golf is fucking amazing.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Ninja Golf is an Atari 7800 game.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Sorry. That was loud. Sorry, guys.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Good luck finding a 7800 that has a working power supply because ours is dead.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Anyway, it's a beat them up with golf.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.000
It's just so freaking weird, but it's a fun little game.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Basically, you start off with your hole, you aim the ball and shoot for the green, and then you run toward the ball like a side scroller fighting different enemies, which include other ninja gophers because I guess Caddyshack or some reason.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Birds, giant frogs, sharks and all kinds of crap, which I think it's funny that when you get to a sand trap, it plays like an Arabian Nights theme.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000
It's kind of funny, but the enemies depend on the environment they're in.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:19.000
So like there's water hazards with snakes and, you know, you get underwater fighting and all kinds of stuff.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
And then you have to fight a dragon before you get to each hole.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.000
It's just a fucking weird game. I don't really know what else to say about it, except that is a fucking weird game.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Have you ever played Ninja Golf?

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I had never heard of it until you picked it for tonight's classic game of the week.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I thought I'd seen everything.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
No, I've never heard of it.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000
It really is just crazy. I mean, there's really nothing else to say about it.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:53.000
I don't even know if it was that popular of a game, but it's just, I mean, it's like you get, you have a health bar.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000
How many golf games do you know have a health bar, by the way? Just saying.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Did Kirby's Golf have a health bar? It might have.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I don't know. But you can die on the field. You have different music playing. Most of it's just sound effects.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
I just really can't say anything else about this game. It's weird.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000
I don't think it's ever had any kind of re-release.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Although I think there was a nod made to it for Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
So I don't know.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
What the shit is this game? Now he's like fighting a dragon.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
I told you, you fight a dragon when you get to the hole.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
This has nothing to do with golf.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Are you sure? How much golf have you played?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
You know what, if this was-

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I'm missing something. If this is what was on TV, I'd watch it every day.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:46.000
If this was golf, I would fucking play it. I would be a caddy as long as I get lots of realistic armor.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000
And according to our resident Kirby expert, Akdeft, Kirby's Dream Course did have a health bar.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Ha. So we have Ninja Golf to thank for Kirby's Dream Course, clearly. Clearly.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Mmm.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000
What the hell, DarkSakura? What the hell? There it is.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Your classic game of the week, Ninja Golf.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Which I had played yesterday. Fucking weird game.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And the whole time you were like, what?

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I'm like, what am I playing? Oh my god, what am I playing? Is that a gopher? Do they get this from Caddyshack?

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Oh my god.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
That's pretty fantastic.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Isn't that awesome? And I love how you can actually see the little green in the bottom corner.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
You can watch where you're going.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Check out that multi-layer scrolling going on in the background.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
And see where your balls are.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
You can.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Hey, stop objectifying men.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I'm not objectifying men. I'm talking about golf balls.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Oh, okay.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Are you a ball washer, Rob? Have you ever worked as a second job as a ball washer?

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Um, no comment.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week, Ninja Golf on the Atari 7800.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I like that. That was a good pick.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Alright, there it is. We're going to be back though. We have plenty more show to come.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
We still have two press conferences we've got to get.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Dark Soccer's got a few things to say about EA's press conference.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Loki wants to talk about Ubisoft's press conference.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
We've got a whole lot of rapid-fire news as well.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.000
And I still have to talk about Project Morpheus at some point and that whole thing.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:17.000
So we will try to make time for that as well as your calls and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio. Episode number 556 of our show for this June 15th.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000
In progress here with part B starting off right now.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.000
And we are running awfully long because of all the news tonight.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
You know, it's kind of a big week in gaming.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
So we do want to get right back into things.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000
But I do want to just quickly say on the show next week, this is tentative.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000
I'm not going to guarantee that these guys are going to be here because we're still trying to work out this deal.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:53.000
But tentatively on the show next week, we'll have an interview with a representative from the game Marvel Heroes.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.000
The free-to-play game that some are saying is Diablo-esque.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
So stay tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook for all the details.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
They are arranging to be here live so you guys can ask your questions about the game.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio or Twitter.com slash OLR.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Also, our 12th birthday is coming up. It is on the 23rd so we will be celebrating it on the 29th.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
June 29th coming up. The 12th anniversary of OLR.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
I thought it was 13.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000
No, we started in... Oh god, it is 13, isn't it?

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
13.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I forgot my... This show is so old, I forgot its age.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I thought it was 12. I thought we started in 2002.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
No, we did. You're right. We started in 2002.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
I don't know... That's how you know you're old.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Here's how I know that.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
And because I was talking to someone about that the other day saying,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Oh yeah, I've been doing this for like 12 years.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000
It was 2002.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000
It was because I had the newspaper articles still on my desk and so I'm like...

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000
It says we started in 2002.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I remember in 2001 I was living somewhere very, very, very, very different from where I was in 2002.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
This show would not have happened with where I was living in 2001.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Yeah, it was definitely 2002. So it is our 12th birthday.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
But yeah, that's how you know you're getting old.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000
The show is almost in height.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Oh, wait. Shane's making a cameo on the show.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Hi, Shane. How's it going?

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Fine.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Yeah, that's right. What did you say about the show?

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
It's almost in high school.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
It is junior high this year.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Yeah, it's going to get beat up.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Why? Why would you beat up our show?

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Because it's such a nerd.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
All right, wait. Real quick though, Shane.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Now the nerd kids are cool though.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Real quick, Shane. Tonight is all about E3.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
So real, real quick thoughts on the show.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Just to be honest, I was a little bored with it.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
There were a few surprises that were awesome.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I think I expected more, especially after last year was just kind of like a blowout.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:49.000
This year seemed really tame and they just played it a little conservatively for my taste.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:54.000
And Konami having two games at their booth, two? That's just sad.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I mean, my roots, they hurt right now.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
I know, I know. All right. Anyhow, thanks for popping in there.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
We have so much more news to get to, so we need to get to it.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Let's start off with some rapid fire news. Loki.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:15.000
All right, so starting things off, not only did they announce, was it Rise of the Tomb Raider,

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:25.000
but they also had Lorecroft and the Temple of Osiris, which is a brand new game

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
kind of along the lines of the Guardian of Light.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I don't know if it's an exact sequel to it. I guess it is a sequel.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000
It's going to be available, I want to say, probably on the digital storefronts.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
And basically saying, hey, you know what?

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
We got a lot of positive reception regarding Guardian of Light.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000
And we figured, let's go ahead and create another one.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.000
And not really sure what they've changed.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I guess a four-player co-op now, so that's kind of cool, because I think the first one was only two.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:03.000
And yeah, no real time frame, though, when it's expected out, though.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I'm guessing since everything seems to have been 2015, that that's probably going to be 2015.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Because right now, they are saying the release date is coming soon.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
That's a safe assumption, then.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Although, to be fair, if it is going to be ready relatively soon,

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.000
they could do it as part of the summer of Arcade that they do every year.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:29.000
So maybe if it's close to being done, it could be coming out in the early part of August.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I guess we'll have to wait and see, then.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Also, Alienware, they had a console that they were showing off.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
It's not necessarily a console, more it was originally going to be a Steam box.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000
But now that that whole delay on the Steam controllers being available,

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:55.000
they've kind of converted it into its own PC that hooks up next to your TV.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
It's going to cost $550.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:07.000
It comes with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, as well as a fourth-generation Intel Core i3, as well as CPU.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:15.000
They're saying that it's going to have a custom NVIDIA Maxwell GPU with 2GB of RAM,

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:27.000
500GB SATA3 hard drive, Bluetooth, Ethernet, and it's going to have Windows 8.1, as well.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:31.000
HDMI, all that fun stuff.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:37.000
I don't know how powerful that is, but for $549, that's pretty reasonable, at least.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
But, I don't know, I wouldn't buy one.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I'd rather build my own. It'd probably be a lot cheaper, anyways.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
All right. Well, speaking of Steam consoles, guess what?

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Civilization V is now available for Steam OS, as well as Linux.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:58.000
So, you know, I love me some Civ games, and Civilization V is now available on those platforms.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.000
It's also on sale, up to 75% off some of the other bundles as well, even though those bundles don't necessarily work.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I got that bundle. Was it the Humble Bundle that they had, the E3 Ticket one?

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
They had a bunch of random shit in it, but it has Civ III in there.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Oh, does it? That's pretty cool.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Except Civ III, in my opinion, is the weakest one out of the whole series.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Yeah, whatever. I only paid a dollar. I didn't want to get the Mortal Kombat arcade collection.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.000
It's still like ice cream. It's still pretty good, even if it's a bad flavor.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
All right. Also, I just wanted to quickly give a shout-out. At some point in the show,

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:37.000
we were able to see a presentation involving Civilization Beyond Earth at E3,

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
and I gotta say, I'm really liking how that game's shaping up.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:45.000
It looks really good. I mean, it's running on a high-end PC, which has come a long way since Civ V was first developed.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
So yeah, I'm really excited about that.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
They have some new little features there, like some squares will have poison gas.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
The tech tree's very different looking.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.000
You can launch satellites that will change how some squares in a certain area react,

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.000
like giving combat bonuses or being able to see different things.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:07.000
So yeah, I'm definitely interested in picking up Civ Beyond Earth.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
That was pretty cool to see at E3.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Also, one thing that is not so cool to happen after E3 is getting laid off.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Now, luckily, we all are invested in this very company that we do our program on,

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000
so we don't have to worry about things like that. We also all have our own individual day jobs.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000
But for some people to make a living off of video game media, this is a pretty shitty time to get laid off,

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
the day after E3.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:40.000
And yep, three-quarters of the staff, they're saying, at game trailers were laid off.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:46.000
This is because digital content distributor Defy Media acquired some of these companies from Viacom,

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
and now three-quarters of them have been laid off.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Various tweets going off from some of the staff who have been let go.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Best of luck to you guys as you find employment elsewhere.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
That is a really shitty time to do that.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Thanks for all your hard work during E3. Here's your severance check.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Womp, womp.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
DarkSagra.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Well, on other news, there have been some announcements made for Final Fantasy XIV.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
That is super happy stuff.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:21.000
First of these are job classes coming out. One of them is Rogue, which, super cute, especially with the kitty girls.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000
The other one is Ninja, which, duh.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Although, I didn't see anything about the gun class that we kept hearing about.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Did you see anything about that?

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Not at this time.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Another thing is that marriage is coming up, well, not marriage, eternal bonding ceremonies.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:42.000
But it can go, it's not bound by race, creed, or gender.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:50.000
So, you can get hitched to whoever you want to and have a messy divorce just like everyone else.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:57.000
It should be noted that was a change in policy from what was originally stated for Final Fantasy XIV,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000
that the marriage would be limited to the opposite gender.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:05.000
And, you know, very cool shift in what they did there.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Kudos.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Also, about personal housing, they're supposed to be coming through in 2.3.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Well, the personal chambers will be introduced in 2.3, but the housing will come in 2.3.8.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
And more emotes, like slapping people.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Yay. Come over here so I can slash slap you.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
And you know what? How about-

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Slash bite me.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
I want a bite me emote where you just smack your butt.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Bite my ass.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:39.000
And then, um, this one's stupid.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
They're doing Final Fantasy VII G-Bike.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.000
And I watched some of it and, you know, that was actually my least favorite part of Final Fantasy VII,

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000
was when you race the bike and play Road Rash.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I don't like Road Rash. That's Dan's game.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I'm like, the fuck, Cloud? I don't- No!

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000
No, stop. And I don't want to play a whole game of nothing but that crap.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Just give me a remake.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Well, what if I do want to play a whole game full of that crap?

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Well, you can play a whole game full of that crap. It's coming.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I don't have to waste my money on it.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Fair enough.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:13.000
No crap for me, thank you.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Alright. Well, let's get to some, hopefully, non-crap answers in our Fugu Question of the Week.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
It's not here, Google.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Like you guys would ever give crappy answers. Come on, you guys are great.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Alright, we are going to get to the Fugu Question of the Week, where we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:38.000
You take those words, you throw them together, you get Fugu.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Alright, here it is. And, of course, we asked about E3.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.000
What is the one piece of news you were most excited about this week and why?

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
I tried to keep things positive.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
You know, there's a lot of people that sit there and go,

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Oh, fuck E3. Fuck all these trailers. I'm fucking bored.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000
F- to everybody. This year sucks. Gaming sucks.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
And there's some people I kind of look at and go,

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Why are you playing video games? Video games are supposed to be fun.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Clearly, they're not fun for you. Please leave.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Go do something fun. Maybe camping is fun for you. I don't know.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:14.000
But anyway, so to keep things positive, I wanted to know what were people getting excited about with E3 this year.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
So, let's go to Google Plus first tonight.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:22.000
ActDeaf says, This might come as a surprise to all of you, but I was really excited to see the new Kirby game.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000
What? Huh? Get out.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Yeah, ActDeaf, excited about a Kirby game.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Seriously, though, Kirby Canvas Curse is one of my favorite of the series,

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.000
and seeing its successor is quite great, especially for the Wii U.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Flaco Jones says, The one game I was most excited to see was LittleBigPlanet 3,

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000
but the company who surprised me most was Nintendo,

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000
and the number of titles they announced was Splatoon and the Yoshi game topping my list.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Travis H. replied and said, Uncharted 4, A Thief's End, FTW.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000
That means for the win, just in case you didn't know.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Fabrice A. replied over on Facebook and said,

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.000
I like the surprise Rainbow Six Siege game Ubisoft showed at the end of their conference.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Looked like a decent, solid game. Simple, but with a lot of tactics involved.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.000
KJ replied and said, I was interested in what Nintendo had to say in their announcements,

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.000
and wow did they deliver. Every game announced is exclusive to Nintendo hardware.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Andy R. said, Final Fantasy Type Zero. Kinda wish it was on Vita.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Feels like it should have been since it was originally a PSP game, but I'll buy it regardless.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Redertainment said, Given that US Open is currently being held and my history playing the franchise,

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.000
I was most excited by the news about EA Sports PGA Tour.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Given the development of the golf club and the failure to deliver on a product this year,

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
I'll be watching the development of this game very closely.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Yes, Redertainment, but does it have Ninja Golf?

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Does it? Do you fight a dragon when you get to the hole? Do you? Do you?

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Alright, uh...

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:53.000
It's possible that you might in like the next EA... was it PGA Tour game?

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Why would they do that? You never know.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.000
They have like fantasy courses in there. There was one they showed off that was Battlefield.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.000
They had like an aircraft carrier crashing into an island, so yeah maybe.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
When was the last time we had like an Uber like miniature golf game?

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I like miniature golf games.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
We need to do the Golfland Tour.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I... I...

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:20.000
No seriously, we do the courses in Roseville, then we move on to Milpitas, then we move on to Sunnyvale, then you know...

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
And then we have a sad at how they've all deteriorated over the past ten years.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.000
We go find where Arcade Infinity used to be and cry.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:31.000
We'll try to play what's left of the courses at the mine shaft.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Like a furniture store.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:38.000
And the place that's like that horrible little hole in the wall that's tucked away.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Oh, the Sunrise one? Yeah, it's like where they store police swap vehicles now.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
That place closed.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
But they had a Para Para machine for the longest time.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000
I'm not gonna let it stop me.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
That place closed like four years ago. Where have you guys been?

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Yeah, but they had a Para Para machine.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
That's exactly it. They did.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
And they'd be like, how'd you learn how to do them dances?

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000
But if the holes are still there, then you can play golf.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Alright, moving on to other comments.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Our pal Jeremy from Koopa Club says,

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I'm most excited for everything Nintendo announced, plus a few standouts from Xbox One,

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Sunset Overdrive and the Halo Collection, and the indies, Abzu and No Man's Sky.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Jeremy, I said one thing, not five. No, I'm kidding.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Our pal Captain Spike from Game Buoys said,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Phantom Dust, the return of an incredibly underrated, superbly designed game.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I hope this time it finds the audience it deserves.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Haters are unstylish and poorly educated.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Did you like that, Jamie? Are you gonna use that in a sentence?

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Haters are unstylish and poorly educated.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Yes.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Our pal Ian, also from Koopa Club, said,

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Zelda having more of a spotlight than the mainstay series.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.000
A lot of talk about the character shown in the Zelda,

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000
because some people thought it was actually Zelda as the hero,

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000
but in fact, it is Link. Just a very different looking Link.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
It looked exactly like Link. I don't know what p-

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000
They just don't remember what Link looked like.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
It's been so long.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.000
It's like, dude, that is totally Link. I don't understand how you can mistake that.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:11.000
He looks so fan of him, though. Yes, he always has. So, come on.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Ronnie B says, I guess knowing Mirror's Edge is still alive and seems well invested in.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Dar Tetsuya says, a toss-up between Zelda, which sounds like it'll be epic,

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Devil's Third, which sounds like a crazy fun action shooter with online multiplayer,

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000
and Splatoon, more multiplayer but with a neat new twist.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000
AZHP says, my favorite part of E3 was when Aisha Tyler took the stage

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
in the first five minutes of the Ubisoft conference and said,

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000
it's 4.20 up in this bitch, and the whole audience cheered.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Apparently, everyone in the games industry is super excited for weed.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I don't know about everybody, but certainly there's a-

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Some of the imagination in your games comes in cigarette form.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Anyhow, Tigerclaw says, I thought Nintendo had a pretty good presentation for E3.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000
There was no way anyone can top Robot Chicken after that.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.000
I was excited that they finally announced a new Star Fox for Wii U.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Captain Toad was a bit of a surprise,

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000
turning one of the best moments of Super Mario 3D World into a full game.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Splatoon looks like a third-person shooter that would be fun to play online.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Codename Steam looks like it could be a really cool game to play on the 3DS.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Awesome Unicorn says, I really enjoyed the presentation of Yoshi's Wooly World.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.000
The inclusion of the yarn store and someone crocheting the prototype Amigurumi

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.000
made the entire thing feel so thoughtfully and lovingly designed.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.000
I like that presentation, too. I love that they were in a yard store.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Or a yard store. A yarn store.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000
What? What?

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:41.000
At yard stores, do they have yard sales?

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.000
I'm going to kick you out into the yard, and good luck,

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
because it's like Jumanji in our backyard right now.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.000
All right.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Ospher says, the reveal of No Man's Sky at Sony's conference.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000
The game looks so beautiful, especially once you took off in the ship

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000
to get lost in a galactic dogfight before exploring other worlds.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.000
It's new and unique, just what I was looking for at this year's E3.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Last but not least, Raginator says, the reveal that you can build decks from scratch

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:10.000
in constructed format in Magic 2015, which is a feature that people have been clamoring for.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Thanks for all the answers, guys.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Very interesting to see. It does seem like across the board.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Again, I don't like to pick winners and losers for E3,

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.000
but considering the situation Nintendo's been in for the last few months sales-wise,

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000
you definitely are seeing a lot of love for Nintendo coming out of this E3.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I mean, hell, even Loki was pretty positive about Nintendo coming out of the show this year.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.000
So, you know, props to them on a good showing.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
But again, I don't think anybody else was bad.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:40.000
I just think everybody had room for improvement,

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
but everybody did what they needed to do as well.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000
So it was an exciting year to be a gamer, I think.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.000
All right, I am going to let Loki touch on the other two conferences,

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
but can we go back to Sony a moment?

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Because I want to talk about, I got to play Project Morpheus,

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
and it was a very kind of chance thing.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.000
And I got to say, I'm going to be honest with you guys and up front about something,

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
you know, kind of peel back the curtain a little bit.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I try very hard in the commentating I do on video games.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.000
I don't know if I like to call myself a games journalist because I don't get paid to do this.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
This is really a hobby, but we love to commentate.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
But even so, I try very hard to make sure I'm impartial.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:24.000
And, you know, I do call companies out sometimes in a constructive manner when I feel it's needed,

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
and I try to do that equally for everybody.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.000
But I also fanboy a lot over a lot of stuff from a variety of different companies

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
because I love video gaming.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:37.000
But I got to say, coming out of this E3, the Lord is testing me.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Because to put things into perspective, I had kind of a mixed thing with Nintendo.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000
I met some very nice people that worked in Nintendo, and that was really cool.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:48.000
But at the same time, I know Bobby was trying to get some answers to questions,

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.000
and they gave him a very like, no, you're not media.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
You need to have an appointment to ask these questions.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:57.000
You know, you need to stop asking questions and, you know, so this whole thing.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Whereas some of the questions that our users were answering,

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Nintendo had no problem answering for other outlets just a day or two later.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.000
So that was a little irritating there.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Microsoft, we were just flat out told we weren't a big enough thing

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
to be able to ask the questions that we were asking.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Gee, thanks, guys.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Meanwhile, Sony, thanks to a twist of fate and, you know, kind of some of that networking

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.000
and meeting some of the guys at a VR mixer that we did,

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:27.000
they invited us upstairs for a private session to take a look at Project Morpheus

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
off the show floor in the upstairs area.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Like I said, I'm being really, really tested.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
This is in addition to only being invited to the Sony conference.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
I was being really tested this year.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
But I still come out.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
There's things I love and things I think can be better

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
about all the companies across the board.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
So that all being said, yes, we did meet some of the guys

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
that are actually some of the engineers on Project Morpheus,

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.000
one of the VR mixers, and they invited us.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
And I want to give a shout out to Reverend Kyle,

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
who does a lot of work in the VR community

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.000
and has his own like VR podcast that he works with and so forth,

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000
was very instrumental in helping us to meet them

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000
and invite us upstairs with him to check out Project Morpheus.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000
And when we got up there, I noticed the room was pretty empty,

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:11.000
and all they had was they had some TVs around the room

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
and some things set up.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.000
One thing they were demoing was kind of like a medieval-type game,

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
and I think you guys saw this in the trailer,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
where there was like archery and there was a dragon

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
and they had a PlayStation Move set up.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.000
But the one that caught my eye was a game they actually weren't showing on the floor.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
It was a game called Street Luge, or it was a demo more than anything.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
You guys know the luge in the Winter Olympics, right?

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
When those sledders go flying down like...

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Street luges.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Yeah. Well, they also have like street luges, right,

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
where you go down the street in the middle of traffic.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
So here's how they set it up.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
They had me lie down sort of in this bean bag.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
They had a bean bag on the floor.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Imagine when you sit in a bean bag, what does your body do?

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Your feet go out, but your back goes back slightly,

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
so it feels like you're in a luge, right?

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
So then they put the helmet on and they fit the helmet on me,

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.000
and you control the luge by moving your head left and right.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
And as you move your head left and right,

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
your thing goes to the left and it goes to the right.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
But you are going through...

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Now imagine, you know, again, you've got the VR glasses on,

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
traffic, and you're going into oncoming traffic,

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
and the whole thing is you want to get behind a car

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000
just long enough to catch its drift to increase your mileage,

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
but then you want to get out of the way

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
because you don't want to hit the car.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000
And then there are certain trucks that you can actually luge under them

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
and get even more speed that way.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
And then at the very end of the course,

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.000
you like are in oncoming traffic.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
But you don't die or anything when you get hit.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
You just lose a lot of speed.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I got to tell you, that whole sensation of lying in the beanbag with my feet out,

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:39.000
doing this luge thing with the VR headset was pretty fucking cool.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000
And this is just one tech demo.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I mean, it was like a two-minute tech...

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
It wasn't like a full-fleshed game.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000
I don't see this as something that's going to be like $50,

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
a thing that moves the Morpheus.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.000
But this is definitely a mini-game in Wii Sports.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
And if the Morpheus is going to succeed,

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
it needs its Wii Sports, right?

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Not exactly Wii Sports, but you know what I mean.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.000
It needs its definitive game that tells people they need a Morpheus.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Watch him get an X Games license.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000
The other kind of neat thing about the Morpheus,

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
and I think a lot of people aren't really talking about this,

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000
but it's some of the behind-the-scenes things that happen

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.000
because it's not just the glasses that talk to the PlayStation camera,

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
although that's a big part of it.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
That's how it knew if I was moving my head left or right, right?

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Because the glasses emit the light, and the camera sees that light,

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000
so I can see that.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:34.000
But what's cool is that the glasses tie into a separate box.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:39.000
That box has a separate GPU and a separate processing,

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.000
so that it actually isn't taking all that oomph away from the PlayStation 4,

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.000
because what that means is that what's being shown on the screen,

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000
on the television, is what I'm seeing in glasses,

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
just in the TV format.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.000
So other people sitting in the room see exactly what I'm seeing,

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.000
just I'm seeing it in a very different, very real manner.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:02.000
And I've got to say, that feeling of going the 100 miles an hour

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.000
as you're gaining speed or whatever in the street,

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
it was really, really cool.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:09.000
It was an effective freaking demo, I've got to say.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
So, yeah, I got to try Oculus, too.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I played a game called Eve Valkyrie with the Oculus,

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
and that was a cool experience, too.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
VR is coming, you guys.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.000
This is all about what is going to be that game.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:27.000
If Sony can find its Wii Sports,

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
it's going to have a heck of a package here in this thing.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Because, yeah, I mean, you could pass around this glasses or whatever

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
at parties, and people can kind of take their turns doing things,

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
and everybody can watch them do their thing,

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000
because the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to render it on the screen

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.000
while this little box controls what's being rendered on the Morpheus.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.000
And?

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:46.000
It's not that whole split image thing you see when you see Oculus streams.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
And you'll be able to stream it, because?

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Yes, that's a huge thing, too.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:52.000
You'll be able to stream it, because the PlayStation 4 streams to Twitch.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:56.000
I don't know if the camera can shoot you and do the detection.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.000
I mean, I didn't ask that question.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Probably could.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
I don't see why it couldn't.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000
So you'll be able to watch live streams of people on Twitch

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
playing these VR Morpheus games and getting all into it and stuff.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
It's going to be interesting.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
But, again, what is that game?

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
These tech demos are cool and all,

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:16.000
but tech demo, you know, a $200, $300 accessory.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
I'm making those numbers up. I have nothing to go off of.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:21.000
I'm wondering if we'll see this next holiday, 2015.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
I don't know. I don't know.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.000
I mean, obviously, if they're showing it at E3 now,

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
they're getting closer and closer.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:35.000
And, you know, these demos could be mini games in a larger collection.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.000
So that was my, I mean, I got to play the street luge thing twice.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I got to kind of see the archery thing and the fighting the dragon

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:47.000
and the cool thing with the move where you would swing the controller

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
around in a circle above your head,

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
and that's the mace that you're spinning around

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000
getting ready to attack the dummy with, like really neat little things like that.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:58.000
But, again, is that going to be a game that convinces the soccer mom

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:03.000
to buy a $300 PlayStation 4 accessory for her family

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:06.000
or, you know, gamer dad to buy one for his family

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.000
or college kid to save up the money and buy one for his dorm room?

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000
You know, is it going to have that game? I don't know.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
But I got to say, as far as the technology goes,

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000
you cannot, I'm sorry to say, you cannot judge these VR things

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:23.000
until you've tried them. You have to try them.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Whether it be Morpheus, whether it be Oculus, whether it be whatever,

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
you got to try this for yourself.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000
It's a really neat sensation.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
So that was my time with the Morpheus,

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.000
and big thanks to the guys at Sony for inviting us up there to take a look,

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:38.000
even though we might be a small company.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:41.000
All right. Let's see.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Oh, I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:50.000
SSJ100Matt says, the real losers of E3 were our bank accounts and wallets.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Oh, yeah, sort of.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:56.000
SSJ100Matt says, so I have to ask, Rift versus Morpheus,

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
which parts of each did you like?

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Ooh, that is such a tough question.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:05.000
You know, now that we know Facebook is acquiring Oculus,

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.000
I don't know if it's going to be just for games.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I think games are going to be a big feature and an important feature,

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.000
but I think they're going to do a lot of other stuff with it, too,

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:19.000
whereas with the Morpheus, you know, you have all that dedicating,

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
processing stuff for games.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
It is a gaming device.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:27.000
I don't see them doing necessarily a lot of other stuff with this.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:32.000
It is like PC versus console.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Many households have both.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
There's room for both in the industry,

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
and I kind of think that's what it boils down to.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:43.000
As far as the whole, like, how did it look, they looked very similar to me.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I mean, the look inside, that whole part didn't really change.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:51.000
What was different were the types of demos I was playing.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:54.000
So it's just going to be very interesting to see what the different,

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:57.000
you know, console versus PC can bring to the table.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I think it's too soon.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Excuse me.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.000
I have the hiccups.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Live Radio Guy's worst nightmare.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:08.000
It's too soon to tell a little bit what these consoles are really going to do

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:09.000
to distinguish themselves,

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
but I definitely see the room for them both to grow in their own different ways.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Anyway, I need to take a drink of water.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
So, Loki, why don't you take us back to press conferences.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.000
All right.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:23.000
So, yeah, the press conference we had next, I believe, was EA.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
I think they were first.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Yeah, EA was first.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:30.000
And so they had, you know, they showed EA Sports PGA Tour,

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000
which, like I mentioned, it's Frostbite 3,

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.000
and this time, you know, Tiger Woods being dropped from the cover.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.000
And they're going to have some fantasy courses in there as well,

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
including one that they teased that was based off of Battlefield.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.000
So they had, like, this giant aircraft carrier crashing into an island.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I don't know.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Whatever.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Cool.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.000
And it's supposed to be, I think, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
I'm guessing early next year.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000
The Sims 4 coming out September 2,

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.000
and they were showing off some of the new emotions, I guess, in the game,

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
and you can even kill somebody with emotions.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
So, neat, I guess.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Criterion teased a new game that they didn't really have a title for yet,

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:23.000
but it was kind of this off-road, like an off-road extreme sports type thing.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:28.000
They've got, like, ATVs and jet skis and wing suits and helicopters

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000
and stuff like that.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Looked really cool.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Kind of like a new, I don't know if it's going to be a burnout game,

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
but I'm pretty excited about anything they make.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Battlefield Hardline, they showed that a little bit.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.000
That's that brand-new Battlefield game that's all about, you know,

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
kind of bank heists and stuff,

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.000
where you're going to have, you know, the criminals and the police

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
and the whole thing along with that.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.000
And, you know, Levolution stuff is still, you know, in there.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
They showed off Mirror's Edge a little bit.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.000
They kind of did, like, I don't really know.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
It's more concept art and concept gameplay.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.000
They didn't really show off anything, you know, final.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.000
They teased a little bit of Star Wars Battlefront, you know,

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.000
and did a little bit of the concept art for that.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.000
They showed, you know, concept art and stuff for Mass Effect,

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
you know, the next Mass Effect game.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
They haven't really said much about it.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:26.000
And then, you know, showed off trailers for NHL 15 and FIFA 15,

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
which looked pretty nice.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
And those are both out in September.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Now, Dark Soccer, I'm sure you have some opinions

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.000
on the BioWare portion of this press conference.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Thank you for showing us your tech demo,

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.000
which, I mean, at this point I didn't expect them to have anything,

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.000
oh, playable this, okay, yeah, you have a Krogan yelling.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Yeah, you've given us the same lines you gave us for Mass Effect 3.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.000
And also they had some, you know, footage of Dragon Age Inquisition.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Oh.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Now that I'm excited about.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
So, I think the reality just has to set in, though, Dark Soccer,

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.000
that Mass Effect is looking more and more like a spring 2016 title.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Yeah.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Fine.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
They do have that other new IP they're working on,

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
which, you know, we knew that was happening,

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000
but we didn't know a lot about it, except that it's contemporary, apparently,

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
is the only thing that was really slipped in there.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Yeah.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000
So, yeah.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.000
It's too soon to tell.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Like, that whole seemed to be like a bone, not so much for the gamers,

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
but maybe, I guess, investors or something like that.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
It's being worked on.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
What was it I told you before the show?

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Promises or lies until they happen?

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000
That's right.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.000
If wishes and musts were clusters of nuts, we'd all have a bowl of granola.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Well, and there's also The Sims, where, you know,

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
I was seeing some of the stuff about moving houses around,

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:54.000
and, you know, apparently, woohoo is a skill.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Okay.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Interesting.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
It's more of the same.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.000
I'm probably gonna play it once the modding community catches up

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.000
and makes everything pretty, and not just that crappy, weird style

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000
that all The Sims stuff does.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:13.000
You know, this is the problem I have with EA and The Sims,

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:17.000
and I guess whatever's left of Maxis, you know, behind it.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:24.000
If the fan community is doing this, why don't you do that, too,

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.000
and make it look like, apparently, how the fan community wants it to?

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:34.000
You can get really, really, really good textures if you put some effort into it.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
The game will run it.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Try it out.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.000
I just wonder what songs are gonna be ruined in Simlish.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Can't wait to see that.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
I don't know. Some of the Simlish ones are funny.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000
All right.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Anything else on EA's conference, guys?

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Mirror's Edge.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
That's pretty much it, I think.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
I mean, Battlefield Hardline looks interesting.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.000
It looks more exciting than what they've got for Grand Theft Auto V's heists.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
So, I don't know. It'll be interesting.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Although, I'm a little hesitant, just because of all the crappy netcode

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:11.000
that they had for Battlefield 4.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
You know, it's gonna be one of those wait-and-see things.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Right.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000
I hope they learn their lesson.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Tigerclaw, the point of The Sims is not to be fucking realistic.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
The point of The Sims is to have them die.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Well, now, wait a minute, Dark Soccer.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Everybody plays the game differently.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000
What if somebody wants to see a realistic representation of themselves in the game?

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Then don't play The Sims.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
I mean, you can have a job as a ghost catcher.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
You can have a job as a ghost catcher.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.000
The Sims is-

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.000
You can have alien babies.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.000
The Sims is similar to Tomodachi Life in that regard for me,

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:52.000
where it's like, here's the fan fiction version of your life.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Does that make sense?

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.000
This is your fan fiction life.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Eating watermelons does not guarantee a boy.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Apparently, if you eat a certain fruit, like right before you're about to give birth,

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:09.000
then you have a baby of a particular gender.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I had no idea.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:15.000
I wanna know if I eat a watermelon-apple hybrid, if I will have a hermaphrodite.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Maybe.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:19.000
That would be awesome, and then my kid could just decide to be whatever.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.000
There you go.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Moving on.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Anything else for EA's conference?

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000
No.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Alright.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000
One more to do.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000
How about Ubi?

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Ubisoft.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Of course, they had Aisha Tyler hosting again.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:36.000
They showed off some more footage for games that were in other conferences,

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:37.000
including The Division.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000
They showed off more Assassin's Creed Unity.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
They showed The Crew, which looks interesting.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
That's actually coming out this year now.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:48.000
They're gonna have a closed beta, I guess, July 23rd,

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:55.000
and it reminds me a little bit of that one game, Fuel,

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:59.000
where you can drive across country, except not as boring,

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:04.000
but you're apparently gonna drive from the east coast to the west coast.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Granted, it's not an exact representation of the entire United States.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
It's very kind of summarized.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.000
But they've got that where you can play that.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Almost looks a little bit like Forza Horizon in that sense,

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
where you can kind of just drive wherever you want.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
So very cool looking.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:27.000
They showed off some stuff for Just Dance 2015.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:33.000
They also announced this Just Dance Now app that's gonna be available for smartphones.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:37.000
And the way it works is if you have a device that's like a smart device

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:42.000
that you can stream content to, apparently you pull up a certain website,

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:47.000
link it with your phone, and then you pick your song on your phone,

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:50.000
and you kind of dance with what's on the screen,

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
and your phone picks up the movements,

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
and you can actually play Just Dance that way.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I thought the tech was interesting.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Not necessarily a game I'd play, but it's a neat idea.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
So I give them credit there.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:04.000
They have a new fitness game called Shape Up,

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:07.000
which looked like kind of a bunch of, like a cross between,

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:14.000
like a Kinect sports type game and the Wii Fit stuff,

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:17.000
where it's a bunch of mini games that get you exercising.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
They are kind of goofy.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
And then the last little tease that they had,

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:25.000
oh, they showed some more Far Cry gameplay,

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:29.000
including that you can do co-op in it,

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:32.000
and at least on PlayStation 4.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I'm not sure if it's on Xbox One or the other systems,

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:38.000
but if you have a friend that doesn't have a copy of the game,

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
they still will be able to play co-op with you

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
without owning a copy of the game.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
I forgot about that little tidbit.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
That was quite a neat little piece of information, wasn't it?

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:49.000
That's like something we haven't seen since like the DS.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000
You know, where you can like beam Mario Kart to your friend,

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000
but they can only play a Shy Guy type of thing?

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Yeah, so it was interesting.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:02.000
And then the last little tease that they had was Rainbow Six Siege,

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:05.000
which is, I guess, a brand new,

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
I'm not really sure what the premise of it is,

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:11.000
other than like SWAT teams are rescuing hostages and stuff like that.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
And so they had, you know, the mode they're shown.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:16.000
One person, you know, one team was the hostage takers,

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.000
and the other ones were, you know, kind of the SWAT team.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:23.000
And very dynamic as far as like you can blow holes in the walls

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
and stuff like that in the house,

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:28.000
and you kind of attack from different entry points and stuff.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Looked interesting. I don't know.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
A little bit different for Rainbow Six series.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.000
TigerClaw says, you know what was missing at the Ubisoft press conference?

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
They didn't announce a new Rayman game.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.000
You know, that's a good point.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:43.000
There was a lot of rumble about a Prince of Persia game

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
that was supposed to use the Rayman.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
That didn't come to light.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Well, they also have that World War II game.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Oh, yeah, there was that.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.000
The Ubi artist thing.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
I don't remember what it was called, though,

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
but it had the dog in it before.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
I think it was World War II or World War I.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
It looked kind of interesting.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Yeah, kind of got the feels going at the conference.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:07.000
So they had that, and then they did have some rabid stuff that they didn't show.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:11.000
They have an interactive TV show that's supposed to be coming out,

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:14.000
along with, I think, their TV show that they have currently.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
I'm not really sure.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:19.000
They didn't really announce too much about that.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:22.000
So overall thoughts on Ubi's conference?

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:25.000
They have some good games coming.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
There wasn't anything that really...

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000
The last few years, Ubisoft seemed to have the best...

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Valiant Hearts.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Thank you.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Ubisoft had the strongest conference, I thought, the last couple of years.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
They showed off some really impressive games,

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000
but they didn't show off too much new stuff this year.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:47.000
I think maybe some of that is because they showed it off at other...

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:51.000
The other three had stuff from them,

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
so maybe it wasn't that big of a deal.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
But I don't know.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000
They have some pretty strong games coming.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:57.000
Far Cry looks awesome.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Assassin's Creed looks awesome.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:03.000
I'm kind of interested in the crew game.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Rainbow Six Siege might be interesting.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
And definitely The Vision looks neat.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
So they have some pretty cool games coming,

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:14.000
but there wasn't anything really surprising.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
The only thing that was annoying, though,

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:20.000
was how long they went on with some of the things like the Shape-Up demo.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:24.000
The Shape-Up demo was so long.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.000
It just drug on and on.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
That was the problem with some of these demos.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
It's like, okay, we get it.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Okay, we get it.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Stop.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
All right.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Well, there it is.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.000
That's all the big press conferences

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:41.000
and kind of our little take on it and you guys in our chat room.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Again, if you have further thoughts on something maybe we didn't touch on,

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
be sure to email us for a future show.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Speaking of emails, I think now is a good time to get into the mail bag.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
So we'll have Dark Soccer open up that mail bag,

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.000
and then we'll close out maybe, Loki,

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000
if there's a couple other things you want to touch on news-wise

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
that maybe doesn't have to do with any of the press conferences,

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
we can talk about some of those.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:03.000
So let's get to it.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000
And then we'll open up for some calls at 1-877-GAMELR

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:12.000
But let's have Dark Soccer dive into the email bag.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Every week you guys send us emails to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
because you want to participate, right?

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
and Dark Soccer will pick out some emails that she enjoys

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:25.000
or that she hates and wants to call you out on air.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Dark Soccer, what's in the mail bag tonight?

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
First one. There's four of them.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
What's up, Orange Lounge?

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
What's up?

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.000
I was just responding in kind.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000
The 555 show is great. Lots of good E3 prep. Thanks much.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000
This person really likes ellipses.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.000
This week's question is a little different and definitely silly.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.000
If you could get down and dirty with any one superhero from the Marvel Universe,

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
who would it be and how would you ask them out?

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Make sure Allen knows this question is posed specifically for hypothetical single Rob,

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
so Allen can't get mad.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Take it easy, gang. EA skeezy.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Allen wouldn't care. He thinks this question.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Allen's in the kitchen right now and probably thinks this question is funny.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Oh, here he comes. Uh-oh. Uh-oh, here comes Allen.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
You want to say something to this emailer?

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
It's Marvel, right? Yeah.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.000
If Chris Evans' Steve Rogers asked you out, I'd be like,

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
I'm not. I wouldn't even be mad.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
You'd go on right ahead.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Like, yeah.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Getting jealous or angry? No.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Not when it's Chris Evans.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:30.000
See? Nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Good answer, by the way. Can I just take that answer?

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Don't sleep with Quicksilver because it'll be over really fast.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.000
No.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:43.000
While I really have no leanings,

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.000
I'd actually have to go with Wolverine for one reason.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Experience. Lots and lots of experience.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:55.000
How about Colossus from X-Men?

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
In Ultimate Universe, he is gay.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Oh, that's right. Perfect.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Loki? I have no idea. I don't even follow comics anymore, so

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
I don't fucking know who anybody is.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
I can't even think of like...

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.000
X-Men? Is he? No, I don't watch the X-Men movies now.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Alright, alright. I don't know.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
Any of the slutty looking ones.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:18.000
I'll pick any of them. I mean, honestly, I don't even think it's...

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.000
As long as it's maybe not She-Hulk because that could be weird, but like, you know,

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
it doesn't really matter.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Maybe not like Rogue because I don't want to die, but you know,

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.000
anybody else, you know, I'm sure.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
I'm pretty impartial of it. It doesn't matter.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
I do have a number two, by the way.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
That would be Carol Danvers.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Because, oh my god. Hot.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Thank you for your question.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Weirdo.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Next email.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Yeah.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Hey, OLR peeps.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.000
I hope you're all doing well, especially after all your running around at E3.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000
I came across the VOG Network after starting my new job late last year

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
and have been hooked ever since.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Orange Challenge Radio, the Bobby Black Wolf Show, and Horde House

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
are, in my opinion, the best castes out there,

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.000
so I thought I'd make an effort to write in and let you know

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.000
how much your listeners appreciate what you do.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Thank you.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Yes, thanks.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Anyway, the last week you were chatting about listeners around the world,

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
so it seemed like the right time to give you a shout-out

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:18.000
from the land Titanfall forgot, South Africa.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Not that that stopped most of us from playing Titanfall, anyway.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Pausing here. We need a map of the world

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.000
so we can start pinning where we're getting calls from.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:32.000
You know, Miss Victoria was here yesterday.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
I can't remember if she was on the show before.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
I think she was on one episode of OLR a long time ago,

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
and she said there's a blank spot in our new studio right there.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000
There is.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
So I think we should get a map of the world.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
And corkboard.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.000
As a rental, you don't want to put holes in the wall.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Well, you should see one of our bedrooms because there's holes everywhere.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
But anyway, yeah, you're right.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:54.000
We'll get a corkboard map of the world thing and put the little pins in it,

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
and so we'll put one in South Africa.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Okay. But we didn't know. We didn't get what town.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
I mean, I could just assume it's Johannesburg

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:03.000
because that's the only town, you know, but maybe somewhere else.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
There is more to South Africa than Johannesburg.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:08.000
I know, but that's the only one I ever hear about.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.000
Being a South African online, you wouldn't believe the comments

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
I get from other foreign players.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.000
So I'm going as far as asking if we have electricity down here in South Africa,

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:21.000
to which I can only facepalm and tell them the only story they'd believe,

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:24.000
that we have lions running on a treadmill somewhere to power everything.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:30.000
My mind goes to Mean Girls and that scene.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.000
But if you're from Africa, why are you white?

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.000
You just can't ask people.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.000
You just can't ask people why they're white.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
I haven't even seen that movie and I know that line.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:46.000
You don't have to see Mean Girls to be able to quote it effectively.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I need to see it though.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Do they have Mean Girls in South Africa?

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
You should ask the lion to generate that for you.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Tell us what part.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Actually though, I watched a good number of series about what people go through

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
in some of the poorer parts of South Africa.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
It's actually pretty crazy.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.000
Even while things have been supposed to be improved after apartheid ended,

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:09.000
there's some places that really I think could use some charitable touches.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
So anyway, moving forward.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.000
I've heard a lot of these comments in my day online.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Things like, do you ride elephants to school?

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Are all of you black?

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Do you have a pet lion? And so on.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000
I was wondering if any of you had to deal with an online stereotypes

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:27.000
or if you believe in online stereotypes and if so, what are they?

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:30.000
All the best and keep up the good work, Screeze.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Well, I'm a woman so I got told to get off the radio and make a sandwich

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
by some shit on Digg.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Well, what was the last time Digg has been brought up?

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
I think that just wrapped itself up there.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Exactly.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Although that wasn't, to be fair, it wasn't the site's fault.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
It was some jackass commenter.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Well, being a gay gamer certainly comes with stereotypes of its own, right?

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Like I think some people expect me to come out here and go,

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.000
oh my God, it's E3.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:04.000
You know, that whole, you know, okay, Hante mama, yes.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
You know, no.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.000
I like RuPaul's Drag Race. Don't get me wrong. It doesn't mean I live it.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:13.000
So certainly there's those stereotypes.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Loki, what's your...

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Do you sit in your underwear and scratch your butt while playing Battlefield?

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Yeah, I was going to say, Loki, as a straight white male waspy guy

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.000
who plays video games, what stereotypes do you face?

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
I don't face any stereotypes.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.000
I am the stereotype.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:34.000
I just saw the best conversation in chat, by the way.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Was that?

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Bobby Singh, people assume my race based off my gamertag,

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.000
and Kaijuto asks, they think you're a wolf?

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.000
I think it's Native American is what he's getting at.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Well, as far as Black Wolf's name goes.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:50.000
But I still thought they'd think...

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
We actually had that conversation over this week.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:55.000
Something about gamertags, and I said something about your,

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.000
it sounds, your name, Bobby Black Wolf, sounds like it's Native American.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
But as you guys know, that's not his real name,

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:04.000
just as Rob Roberts is not my real name, shock and awe.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
So, anyway.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
And Jamie Summers isn't her real name either.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
I'm really not the Bionic Woman, y'all.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
And guess what? Loki isn't his real name.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:15.000
But, true facts, I was named after the Bionic Woman.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
I know. That's an awesome story.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Was that it for the South Africa email?

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:20.000
Oh, yeah. For that one, yeah.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Thank you for the email. That was very nice.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Yes, thank you.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:26.000
We're going to get a map in.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Tell us where you're from so we can put a pin,

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:31.000
other than South Africa, because that's really generic.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Hey, OLR crew.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Last week you all put out for the call for people who went to the event

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.000
to watch Sony's E3 press conference in a movie theater.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.000
We did? Oh, yeah.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:42.000
We did.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
We went and figured I'd give some impressions

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
and an email for Dark Sakura to wade through.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Oh, thank you.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Ooh, gold star for this person already.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
You get a stale Twinkie.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
A gold Twinkie award.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
We bronzed a Twinkie for you.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000
It's been in the deep fryer.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:04.000
By the way, one of our, the guy who was behind Atari Party,

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
his Jaguar died.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:07.000
So he's like, I don't know what I should do with it.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
I was like, bronze it.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.000
You can then be the only person to have a bronze Jaguar.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Anyway.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Got there and was given a badge with a code on the back

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:21.000
that ended up being good for Destiny and Battlefield betas

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
plus $5 a PSN credit.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
On the plus side of the event it was awesome

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:28.000
to get to see some of the trailers on the big screen.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Some of the more cinematic trailers like the Phantom Pain trailer

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000
during the conference were great on the big screen

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:36.000
and with the full sound system.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
There's also some extra content after the normal stream,

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:42.000
mostly consisting of developer interviews focused on Destiny and No Man's Sky.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.000
On the down side, it may have just been my theater.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
The internet connection was on and off.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
We had some serious artifacting on the stream

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
and the stream dropped once or twice.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
The sound system was bad for non-trailer stuff.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Audio, such as normal speech from the presenters,

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:59.000
was not really geared to the theater sound systems.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Another downside was not being able to tweet snarky comments during it.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:07.000
I didn't want to be the ass with his phone out in the dark theater.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Well, I appreciate you. Thank you.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:14.000
PS is a side note about all the journalism and Twitter comments I'm reading during E3.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Can we stop caring about who did or didn't win E3?

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Thank you. Oh my god, thank you.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
You get two Twinkies.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Gamers won E3. One of them isn't stale, by the way.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
It's deep fried.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
Gamers won E3, in my opinion.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000
As a PS4 Wii U Vita 3DS owner,

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.000
I saw games that I want to play coming on all those platforms.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
That's all I care about.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:41.000
And I'm going to say that's from Andrew R.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Well, a gold Twinkie for you.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
That was a very good report. Thank you.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
You know what's funny, and let me tell you some differences

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:50.000
between what I'm reading or hearing from your email

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.000
and the experience of actually being there in the actual facility

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
where the conference was taking place.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:00.000
The artifacting happened during the Batman thing.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:03.000
That actually happened in the theater for us too.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
And we thought, or at least I did at first,

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.000
and the guy sitting next to me thought it was intentional

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.000
because of the whole way the Scarecrow broke in right after that.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
I thought, oh.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
In the theater, we all kind of did that whole,

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
oh shit, it broke, oh shit.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
But then the Scarecrow came up and we were like,

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
oh, okay, oh, get it, oh, I get it.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
That was a joke. Oh, okay.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
But it sounds like that actually wasn't supposed to happen.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:30.000
It just happened at, I guess, a decent time to kind of get away with it.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:33.000
But yeah, so they had some problems there in the theater as well.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
But all the sound was fine for us.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:38.000
I will say this though, you guys got all that stuff,

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:43.000
like the VIP badge and the PlayStation Now codes and all that stuff.

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
They didn't give that out of the conference.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:46.000
We didn't get any of that stuff.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:49.000
So you guys got some extra stuff in the theater.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
To be fair though, they did hand out the PlayStation Now codes

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:55.000
at E3 on the floor, so we did get our chance eventually.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Yeah, none of this other stuff you're talking about.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Was that it for e-mails, Star Sakura? Was that four?

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:02.000
There's one more.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:03.000
Oh, one more.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:04.000
I'm just making up names for everybody.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Oh, okay.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Like, I said Agduff's name is Fernando.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
And Tigerclaw's Ivan.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Because I said so.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:14.000
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.000
I almost bought Sing Star Abba last night because it was five bucks.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Buying Sing Star Abba is always the right thing to do.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
But I didn't because I bought a book instead.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
And Dan got his multi-card.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Fuck your book.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:26.000
You know what?

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Read a fucking book and maybe you're-

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Listen to some Abba.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Read a fucking book and your vocabulary will be more than 2,000 words, Rob.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Listen to some-

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
They consist of fuck shit cock.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Listen to some Abba and you'll be more glamorous, Star Sakura.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Bitch, I'm fabulous.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
All right, I got nothing. Next e-mail.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Dear OLR Gang,

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Although I'm not generally vocal about social justice in video games-

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Oh, next. No, kidding.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:57.000
I have been attempting to watch the industry with a more critical eye

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:02.000
since these issues are being more openly discussed with campaigns such as

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
One Reason Why or Mii Quality

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.000
and videos such as Tropes vs. Women in video games.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:12.000
As a result, I couldn't help but notice Nintendo's strong public showing this past week at E3

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.000
not only in regards to my personal opinion of the entire event

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
but also in regards to the female representation

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:21.000
both in their games and the human presenters, developers, and game players.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:24.000
As far as games go, both Super Smash Brothers and Hyrule Warriors

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.000
presented a wide array of playable female characters

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:31.000
plus who prominently featured the female inklings in their promotions

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:35.000
and for better or for worse, Bayonetta is a game featuring not only a powerful female protagonist

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:42.000
who I snarkily imagine is a woman who is so much harder to animate than any female

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Ubisoft refuses to put effort into animating

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:48.000
but also exclusively featuring a female on its box art.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Also, onto the flesh and blood side of things

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:54.000
the Treehouse presenters appeared to be made up of a sizable number of women

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:59.000
there were female developers featured demoing during the Treehouse streaming round tables

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:02.000
and the Super Smash Brothers Invitational Tournament featured

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:06.000
a nearly equal amount of female players and celebrity guests to male.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:11.000
I want to know your opinions on Nintendo's current and potential future treatment of women in games and gaming

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:17.000
considering their most iconic series is very frequently featured the exact type of treatment of women

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
that is now being criticized.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:24.000
I am especially interested in your opinion on Nintendo's intention to target young female gamers

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
in the next demographic.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Thank you for the great show each week.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Sincerely, Awesome Unicorn.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Well, Nintendo, I mean, that was a lot of questions at the end.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
That's okay though.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Nintendo does a great job, I think I can answer this one real quickly.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Nintendo does a great job of showing how easy it really is.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
It's not that hard, people.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
It's not that hard.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:49.000
And Nintendo does do a really good job of creating great characters.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.000
And it took them a while to get there, I mean, right?

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.000
You go to some of the early Nintendo games and it still kind of fell into that rub

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.000
but you really have seen where Nintendo's kind of grown in.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Yes, we want to reach all types of gamers including the young females

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:06.000
so we have a lot of strong characters from all over the spectrum.

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:09.000
I would still argue, like I said earlier in the show,

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.000
they have some things to learn when it comes to sexuality and so forth

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
but they're moving in the right direction

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:18.000
so okay, I'm not going to get all Tumblr on you.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
I like that you said that.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Anyway, the whole other thing too

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:28.000
is that they really are getting away from the damsel in distress trope.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Like, I mean, just look at Twilight Princess.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:36.000
While, yes, the character of Midna, not my cat,

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:42.000
was in a position where she needed to ask help of the main character,

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:46.000
she was also right along there with him and did her part.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:52.000
She was weakened because of something, not because of being a woman.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:57.000
And so that was pretty rad to me.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:10.000
I do like that they're bringing in some of the various princesses, goddesses, and Smash Brothers

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:13.000
and having them still be pretty and kicking ass

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:16.000
but I think we need to see more.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:23.000
If they want to target the young girls, it should be in a role that isn't necessarily frilly or cutesy or pretty.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.000
It needs to be in a role of capability.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Bayonetta?

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Well, no, that's not for young girls.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Very true, very true.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:40.000
But I'm saying, cooking mama's great, but mama needs to also have some other jobs.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Well, she gardens.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:46.000
That's gardening grandma.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:50.000
You guys need to see the stare I just got from Darzaka in the studio.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:52:01.000
But anyway, to answer the question, the discussion of targeting certain people is really weird to me.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
It's always been a weird thing in this industry to me.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
I'm just kind of like, put things out there for the people.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:12.000
But I also understand that the young girls, if we are to stereotype and generalize,

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:15.000
which I suppose you have to do when you talk targeting,

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:22.000
there's probably a lot that get really put off by the severed heads and blood and guns.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:27.000
So in that regard, Nintendo, to target them, is smart.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.000
That's just smart business at the end of the day.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:37.000
Because when the rest of the gaming industry isn't speaking to them, we might be making games that are in a regard.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:42.000
That's not to say there aren't some young women out there that would like to sever some heads and play the blood and gore games.

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:43.000
There's certainly plenty.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:44.000
I love beheadings.

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
I'm not the one receiving them.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Did you see that Assassin's Creed Unity thing where the guy got beheaded and you see it through his eyes?

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
I could just hear my mother, Rob!

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
This is gross!

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
You went to LA for this?

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
You spent all your money going to Disneyland.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
You should be saving money.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
This is gross.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
This is gross.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Anyway.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:23.000
But to generalize again, or what you have to do when you're talking targeting, I understand that Nintendo is trying to make games for people that might feel left out otherwise.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
And that's just smart.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:30.000
You know what I hear when I think of demographics and targeting groups and everything?

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:36.000
I'm thinking you're reducing us to numbers and not respecting your customers.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:41.000
That's how the market works, but that's also...

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Don't get me started. That's going to be a big socio-political economic rant, so I won't go there.

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:51.000
We're already past midnight on the East Coast, so we've got to keep it moving.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Was that it for email, Zoe?

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:54.000
That was it.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:54:00.000
If you want to send something to the mailbag, participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send us an email.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Loki, any other E3 tidbits you want to touch on real quick?

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.000
I'm going to pull up my notes and see if there's any other games I want to talk to you about.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:15.000
I don't remember if we mentioned this or not, but Devil's Third is now a Wii U exclusive.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:24.000
The game is originally going to die a slow death, and Nintendo has decided to go the route of Bayonetta 2 where they're funding the release of it.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
So that's kind of cool.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
Let's see. What else?

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:37.000
I guess they had a portable Steam machine or someone that was shown off a prototype of.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:42.000
It actually looks like a portable device that's built into a Steam controller.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:46.000
They call it the Steam Boy.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Apparently, he's going to have a quad-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of built-in storage.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:58.000
I'm not sure if they'd be able to run a lot of games on it, but you need a guess. I don't know.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:08.000
One demo I saw at E3, an invite presentation, and I got to say this was not a game that was on my radar, but it is now.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:12.000
I was very impressed with the preview we had for The Witcher 3.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:17.000
I'm going to be honest, I haven't really played the first two games, so this was really my introduction to the series.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:20.000
I definitely saw a lot of Skyrim-esque elements in it.

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:26.000
My understanding is that some of the combat in the first two games is really hard.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
For that reason, it might not be accessible.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:33.000
I didn't get a lot of answers to those concerns in the presentation we were getting.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Which, of course, when the game makers are playing the game, they make combat look easy.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
But I will say it looked cool.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:45.000
I'm going to tell you what really struck me about The Witcher 3 was that the art direction was really good.

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:53.000
We saw this scene where you had an older lady that was communicating to these spirits in this tapestry.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:56.000
And she would put her hand up to the tapestry and she got possessed.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:02.000
And that whole thing where her eyes would turn white and she's speaking of the three women in the tapestry through her own voice and all that.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:05.000
And just the direction of that scene felt very movie-like to me.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:09.000
The whole presentation of the game felt like cinema.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
And that was really cool to watch.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:19.000
I hope the game is as smooth for me, who might not be as good at those types of games, offhand, as it was for the person demoing it.

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:27.000
If so, I think there could be a really great game here for the Skyrim fans with no Fallout being announced this year either.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:30.000
That could be a huge thing to fill in the gap for them.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:39.000
Yeah, I was kind of surprised that they didn't have anything announced from Bethesda really, aside from their free-to-play game and then they had Doom.

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:44.000
But it's kind of hoping for Fallout 4.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:48.000
Bethesda had a couple games that were shown off that we were able to get our hands on.

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.000
I did not get to play Battlecry, but I know Bobby did.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:55.000
He was a little iffy on it because it was more of a first-person shooter.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
But here's the thing about Battlecry.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:02.000
It's not Team Fortress 3, but it's Team Fortress 3.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:09.000
It's very heavily, it's got a lot of those types of elements in it.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
Bethesda would probably frown on me saying that.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
But I'm just saying, when I'm looking at it, I mean that's not a bad thing.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:16.000
I love Team Fortress 2. I would love to play another game like that.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:20.000
I'm kind of looking at it going, this really sounds like it's just Team Fortress 3.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
But it looked really good.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:25.000
But while he was playing Battlecry, I got to go play The Evil Within.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:32.000
And they had that all set up with the dark room, with the headphones, and it's a scary game.

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:38.000
If you like your scary games, and it's another one of those games where my mother will not be happy that I'm playing it because it's very gross.

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:44.000
I was lighting things on fire, and you know, it was a trip.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:47.000
But yeah, if you guys like your Silent Hill and Resident Evil, this game's right up your alley.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:50.000
I'm also disappointed that there wasn't a new Silent Hill game.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Well, Konami's got nothing. I'm telling you, somebody's going to buy them to get those IPs.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Wait.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Anything else you want to share?

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:05.000
This is kind of a little funny thing. Apparently there's a brand new commercial, I actually checked it out.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:09.000
A brand new commercial starring Aaron Paul from Breaking Bad.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:17.000
That is turning on people's Xbox Ones, because in the commercial he is using the voice commands for the Xbox One.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:24.000
And if you happen to be watching TV near your Xbox One that has the Kinect enabled on it, it is turning your system on.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:28.000
And maybe possibly launching Titanfall, because that's what they do in the commercials.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:31.000
It's kind of annoying people.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:35.000
Yeah, I can imagine. Did you know the PlayStation has those voice commands too?

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:39.000
I didn't realize that until Jason was over the other day and I'm doing something on the PlayStation.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:42.000
He starts fucking with me by giving those commands.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:45.000
PlayStation! It comes up.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
Stop it!

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
I don't know. I thought that was funny.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
Yep.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
And then...

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
What was it?

02:58:55.000 --> 02:59:02.000
Mojang has released a new EULA regarding, I guess, monetization.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:12.000
Basically, frowning upon private Minecraft servers that charge for in-game items or XP boosts or stuff like that.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:22.000
Because you can do some plugins for Bucket and Forge and stuff where you have people donate money or something to your server and you give them perks.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
That type of thing.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
Well, apparently Mojang doesn't like that.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:33.000
They call it free-to-play, even though it's not really free-to-play, because you can buy a copy of it.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:38.000
But besides any of the updates, all that stuff is supposed to be free.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:50.000
So apparently they are putting that into the EULA to prevent that, but basically frown upon it, I guess.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:57.000
I definitely need to shout out some more indie games here, because I did talk about a lot of great ones around the show.

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:00.000
And I want to give this one a shout out, because I kind of think this one is going to be huge.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
And you'll never guess where I saw this one, Loki.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:06.000
In the corner of IndieCade, Ouya was there, really pushing a lot of the indie games.

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
And this was one of the games that was on Ouya.

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:11.000
So very interesting to see how they're kind of starting...

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
They're probably trying to think about...

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:19.000
They're probably getting a lot of the feedback from gamers like you who don't really see where the future is in the Ouya.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:25.000
So it really seems like they're really trying to partner up with a lot of the indie developers to get things on Ouya and PC.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:28.000
You know, really have an easy publishing platform.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
And I've got to say, this game looked really good.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:34.000
One of them that I saw, which is called Neverending Nightmares, was a game that I saw.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:38.000
It's coming out Fall 2014, Windows, Macs, Linux, Ouya.

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:46.000
And if you guys look up this game, which you can, over NeverendingNightmares.com, the art style in this is very unique.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
And it is a psychological horror game.

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:51.000
And it's based on the developer's struggle with mental illness.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:54.000
And I actually talked to the guy who had made this game.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:58.000
I'm hoping to get him on a future episode of OLR when the game is a little closer to release.

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:02.000
You know, it was really fascinating to talk to him and kind of hear about the game.

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:09.000
And kind of what caused him to make this game to help him kind of deal with what he was going through with this.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:13.000
I thought that was very brave of him to basically make that,

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:17.000
yes, this is what the game is about. This was how I coped with mental illness.

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:21.000
So, I thought that was really cool. And I think this one's going to, I kind of think this one's going to blow up.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:24.000
So, keep an eye on that one. Neverending Nightmares.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
So, that was a very cool game.

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Any other thoughts? Loki, Dark Sakura?

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:36.000
Let me, I'm going to go ahead and open up Skypline. 1877 Game OLR.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
Or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:42.000
If you want to call and talk to us about E3, I'm going to try to make it brief tonight because we are running long.

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Which, you know, usually this week does.

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:48.000
But if you do have a comment or something you want to say about the show, we invite your phone calls.

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
Please let us know. 1877 Game OLR.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
Or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.000
I did have a tiny thing to mention. Not that it's E3 related, but it's a neat looking mod.

03:01:56.000 --> 03:02:01.000
It's a mod for Skyrim called Vendain. V-E-N-D-A-Y-N.

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:05.000
That basically turns the landscape into pure evil.

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:11.000
It just looks like this near apocalypse, medieval world. It's pretty cool.

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
So just thought I would mention it.

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
Very cool. Are you going to check that out?

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:18.000
I might. If I get around to playing anything.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:21.000
You will, you will. Alright, let's get to some calls.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:24.000
We do have a call coming in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
Hey, hey, it's Rama. How is everyone doing tonight?

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
It wouldn't be a show without you, Rama. What's up, buddy?

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:34.000
But of course. I kind of want to get into this whole Ubisoft thing really quick.

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:38.000
Because this was something a few of my friends were talking about.

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:44.000
Let me just say this. I apologize now if I ruffle any feathers.

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
It's not meant to be.

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:52.000
The views and opinions expressed on the show do not necessarily reflect those of VoG or OLR Studios. Sure, go ahead.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
Thank you, good sir.

03:02:54.000 --> 03:03:00.000
I believe if you sit there and you look at a game, if it has great gameplay value,

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:06.000
great story, graphics, replay, all of that, great storyline.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:17.000
But if the main hero of the story and the game is not a minority or this race or that creed, so on and so forth,

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:23.000
I don't see that as a big deal. If that's how the storyline plays, that's fine.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:31.000
You've got to accept that. You just can't turn off the entire game or entire franchise because of that one thing.

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:36.000
Now, if the people behind this game say something along the lines of,

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:39.000
and you know this is what they said,

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:44.000
yeah, we were just too cheap to add in all these extra features so you can change your character and so forth.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:48.000
That's when it's wrong. That's when it's not fair.

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:52.000
The fact that you can spend this much time to create the character,

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:59.000
you mean to tell me that the French do not have an extra million francs or however the currency is

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:07.000
to add in the feature or add in the ability to make your hero a heroine or this or that.

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:10.000
They can't do that.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:15.000
I think the difference here between what you start your story with,

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:20.000
where you have that narrative that's like reading a book or watching a movie that's about a particular character,

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:24.000
that you're confined to that narrative, whatever it is.

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:31.000
Although one could make the argument that when you see the same type of person in that narrative over and over and over again,

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:37.000
we might be making progress a little bit in the gaming industry, but we have a long way to go, right?

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:41.000
But the real issue here was because it was the multiplayer element, I think, that came into it.

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:46.000
It was a little interesting that you just saw the four people who all looked the same.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:51.000
That was, I think, where people kind of looked at that and went, but all people don't look all the same.

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:54.000
So why did you do that? Why isn't there a woman up there?

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:57.000
And then that was the answer we got. Well, it would be too expensive.

03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:02.000
That was what it really boiled down to.

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:07.000
Yeah, pretty much, because the fact of the matter is I'm not surprised that Ubisoft said this,

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:13.000
because then again, we did have to wait about two years for DLC for Scott Pilgrim vs. The World of the Game.

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:16.000
Meanwhile, they were too busy working on Assassin's Creed.

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:17.000
Yeah.

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:21.000
So, I mean, I understand where everybody's coming from.

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:25.000
I mean, at that point, if you want to turn your back on the series, that's fine.

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:30.000
But the sad part is there's so many people that are up in arms about this.

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:34.000
If 100 people are up in arms saying they're not going to buy the game because of this,

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:38.000
another 100 people are going to roll right in and just buy the game.

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Well, and you know that there's people out there that say they're not going to buy it,

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:45.000
but they were never really intending on buying it in the first place.

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:49.000
Yeah, they were just saying it, you know, to throw their voice out there, to support it.

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
Like, yeah, I'm down with that too, I'm down with that.

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
Hello, game stuff? Yeah, let me get a pre-order on that, thanks.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:57.000
Yeah, that all being said, though, I kind of go back to what I said earlier.

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:58.000
This is a dialogue.

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:04.000
This is one piece of a greater dialogue that's been needing to happen in the gaming industry for some time.

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:09.000
And I think as these younger gamer girls that Nintendo's targeted, as we talked about earlier,

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:13.000
are starting to grow up and get older, a lot of them are looking back going,

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:14.000
this is some bullshit.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:15.000
Mm-hmm.

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:21.000
And I think this is a dialogue that's been brewing for some time,

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:24.000
so it's not going to end with this E3 story.

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:29.000
Yeah, on a side note, and I'm going to get out of here,

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:34.000
a friend of mine worked for a gaming company and part of her job was translating games,

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:37.000
and one of the companies she translated against was a French company.

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:42.000
And she had to go through and tell them what was acceptable and what was not acceptable.

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:46.000
Now, in the game, they had a giant portable stereo.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:49.000
Now, we know them as boomboxes, right?

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Mm-hmm.

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:55.000
When they translated the game for detailing the change, what was acceptable was not acceptable,

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:59.000
they called the boombox a ghetto blaster.

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:03.000
Yeah.

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:07.000
I heard that term in, like, the 80s.

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:11.000
Yeah, but nowadays you don't want to say ghetto blaster.

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
Things have changed, right?

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
So, you know, those are words, yeah.

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:22.000
Yeah, so it's like, I think Ubisoft and a few other countries need to kind of get on the ball

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:25.000
to understand that there are certain things you can't say

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:29.000
and there are certain things you don't say in order to get your point across

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:33.000
and kind of make the people happy, you know?

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:37.000
And with all the money that that series has made,

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:42.000
I don't see a big issue of dropping another million euros to them, but you know what?

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:45.000
Make it a complete multiplayer, complete character customization, all this, all that.

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
I don't see the problem.

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:50.000
All right, well, Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls,

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:54.000
but any quick other, quick, quick, quick thoughts before we let you go?

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:57.000
Mighty No. 9, Xbox One.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:08:01.000
Oh, heck yeah. When's that out? Does that have a release date yet?

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:06.000
I don't know, but that might just be worth it for me to go down and get my Xbox One, because, yeah.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:10.000
I think it's out on everything, though, like PC, and it's coming out a bunch of places.

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
It's not exclusive to Xbox One.

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
I hope not.

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy.

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
All right, you too, bro.

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:21.000
All right, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:24.000
Lots of people trying to get in tonight, so we'll try to get to them all.

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:27.000
Hey, what's up, guys? This is Kai Judo.

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
Hey, Kai Judo. What's on your mind?

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:32.000
Not much. I'm just going to... Wait, let me see if I can hear you. Say something again.

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
Hi, Kai Judo. You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:39.000
I'm just going to put my two cents in to what the previous caller just mentioned.

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:42.000
I'm going to make this quick so you can get to new calls.

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
I like that this is happening.

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:50.000
This is a great time in gaming that people are finally getting their voices out there

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:53.000
and telling these developers what they really want.

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:59.000
I think the main problem is that I don't think minority...

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:06.000
I'm a minority as well, so I'm not saying minority like you or other people or whatever.

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:12.000
I think that a lot of minorities, a lot of female gamers, they just don't see a balance out there.

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.000
It's not that they want to change every game.

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:21.000
It's not like they want to go in there and change current games into females or black males or Puerto Ricans or whatever.

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:26.000
We want to see games that have diversity and we want to see a balance

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:30.000
because right now it's just a flood of the same old stuff that's coming through.

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:33.000
I think that's the main issue there and that's what really needs to be addressed.

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:39.000
I do want to see different types of games come out with female characters, minority characters.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
It can't just be Rockstar doing all this.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:44.000
We've got to have other developers involved.

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:47.000
I like this. I like what's going on here.

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
I agree. I think this is good, this conversation being had.

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
I want to read this comment in chat.

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
It's from our pal Bobby Black Wolf.

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:56.000
I don't know if this is a tongue-in-cheek thing or what, but let me just read what's here in chat.

03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:01.000
Black Wolf says, James Bond needs to be a black female in the next movie.

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:05.000
It makes me actually feel like I shouldn't do anything in life anymore since I'm a straight white male.

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:09.000
If I'm doing something, I'm taking that opportunity away from a minority.

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:18.000
Well, to clarify, I don't think anyone's saying eliminate the straight white male or let's rid games of straight white males.

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:20.000
The key word is diversity.

03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:22.000
They can show some of that spotlight.

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:28.000
Nobody's saying, get rid of Nathan Drake, he sucks, or replace Nathan Drake.

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:33.000
But I think it's a lot of people saying, but it sure is refreshing when we get a Lara Croft as well.

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:39.000
Right. Like I was just saying earlier, we don't want to change what's currently there.

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:45.000
I don't want to change Bond into a black woman or a Chinese woman or anything like that.

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:48.000
It's just that we want to see variety in there.

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:55.000
I think that the same way movies are supposed to somewhat reflect what goes on in life and society,

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
I think games should also reflect that.

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000
There's a lot of diverse gamers.

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:03.000
I get on Xbox Live, and I'm not just talking to a straight white guy.

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:07.000
I'm talking to a gay African guy.

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:12.000
I'm talking to a lesbian Russian girl.

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000
It's all different types of people out there playing.

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:17.000
I think that games really need to reflect that.

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:23.000
There was that statistic out there that it's like, what was the headline?

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:29.000
Something like, there were more beheadings in the press conferences than there were women on stage.

03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:34.000
I know you laugh, but it's kind of one of those things.

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000
It's a sad reality.

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:40.000
Again, I'm not saying eliminate the men, make it all women.

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:44.000
I'm just saying, I thought half of the population is women.

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:45.000
More than half, actually.

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:48.000
Why aren't we getting a little closer to half?

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:58.000
I believe that actually the last census, or combination of census, that women actually made up 52% of the overall population.

03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:02.000
Guys, you're the minority.

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:07.000
Again, I don't wish to devalue or whatever.

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:11.000
The gal that's the head of 343 Studios is a great person and so forth.

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:15.000
It's not like they're invisible, gone, not there.

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:22.000
But you kind of look at it and you go, yeah, this industry does seem to go one way or another.

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:23.000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:31.000
Wasn't there a woman as the lead for the whole Assassin's Creed series?

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:34.000
Not that I'm saying a playable character, but the actual woman that's developing it,

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:40.000
the head of the entire team for the Assassin's Creed games, I thought was a woman at one time.

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000
Yeah, that was the first one.

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:43.000
She stepped down or whatever.

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000
The very first one, apparently.

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000
Only the first one, I thought it was still the same.

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:50.000
And that's just what I wanted to mention.

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:53.000
Another thing that we have to address, I'm not sure if it was that woman.

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000
I'm pretty sure it was her.

03:12:55.000 --> 03:13:00.000
But that first E3 that she had prepared in where she was talking about Assassin's Creed,

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:06.000
she got so much hate from these, I mean, we got to assume that they were guy gamers,

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:09.000
but we really can't say for sure because they were hiding behind screen names.

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000
But they gave her so much hate.

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:16.000
There was so much negative stuff thrown at her and a lot of other women that developed video games.

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:20.000
I can't remember when it was, but it was actually when I first started listening to all games.

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:24.000
I think it was Scott Rubin was doing a show and he had some guy on there

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:28.000
and he was the biggest douchebag prick I've ever heard.

03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:30.000
I literally wanted to call him because he was such an asshole.

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:37.000
He was promoting some type of a comic that someone did where they were jizzing all over this girl.

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000
You guys remember that?

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:42.000
I don't and I guess in that regard, I'm kind of glad I don't.

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:44.000
With all due respect to our friends over there.

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:46.000
It was awful.

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:48.000
He kind of chuckled about it and I'm like,

03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:52.000
how can you even let us come back like this on the air?

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:55.000
I forgot what the full argument was.

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000
You'd have to ask him about that.

03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000
It was awful, man.

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000
Just to clarify from the chat room,

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:07.000
Jade Raymond was the developer there that did Assassin's Creed 1 and 2.

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:10.000
Thank you to the folks there in chat speaking up there.

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:16.000
Well, Kaijuto, a conversation that will be continuing in the industry for years to come, I'm sure.

03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:18.000
Take care, my friend.

03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:19.000
Alright, thanks.

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000
Bye.

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:24.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR.

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:27.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000
Any other quickie three thoughts, Loki?

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:30.000
I'll check in with you.

03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:31.000
No.

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:32.000
Alright.

03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:33.000
Wrap this stuff up.

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:37.000
We'll do one other quick, quick, quick call and try to end things.

03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:41.000
S2100 Matt asked in chat, did you guys meet up with Scott and try his ice cream?

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000
We actually looked.

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:46.000
We found the truck and we went over there, but he wasn't there.

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:47.000
We weren't able to say hi.

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000
I guess he was on a break or gone or something, but we tried.

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:50.000
We tried to go say hi.

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:52.000
Alright, let's go to the phones.

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:53.000
We do have another call coming in.

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:54.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:55.000
Who's this?

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:56.000
Hi, this is Reginator.

03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:57.000
Hey, Reginator.

03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:58.000
How you doing?

03:14:58.000 --> 03:14:59.000
I'm pretty good.

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:00.000
How about yourself?

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:01.000
Good.

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:03.000
I see you're trying to send video, but for whatever reason, we're not receiving, which

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:07.000
is a bummer, but I'm sure you look fabulous, as does your kitty.

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:10.000
Quickly, we don't have a lot of time left.

03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:23.000
I know E3 is a big news topic of the week, rightfully so, but one topic that hasn't been

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:37.000
touched yet is the upcoming steam sale, presumably starting tomorrow at roughly 10 a.m. Pacific.

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:42.000
Because my wallet is crying out in pain that a steam sale could possibly be incoming, but

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000
yeah, there are those rumors out there.

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:48.000
Well, it's not really rumor because steam pretty regularly has done these summer sales,

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:49.000
right?

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:55.000
Well, it was confirmed there was a foreign advertisement that had the steam sale dates

03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:56.000
or something there.

03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:57.000
Oh, boy.

03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000
It was like June 19th, I think.

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:13.000
And in fact, a badge has shown up in everyone's profiles, well, under profiles that's called

03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:14.000
Mystery Badge.

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:15.000
Oh, interesting.

03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:18.000
So, put two and two together.

03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:19.000
It's coming.

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.000
But anyway, two part question.

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:22.000
Okay.

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:28.000
You kind of sort of answered part of the question.

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:32.000
A, are you and your wallet ready for the sale?

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:41.000
And also, is there anything that you're kind of sort of hoping would go on sale?

03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:46.000
And if so, what is that game or games?

03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:47.000
Good question.

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:49.000
I open it up to my lovely co-host as well.

03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:56.000
Is there something that you hope goes on sale that you would like to buy?

03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:58.000
And are you ready for a steam sale?

03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:00.000
I have to look at my list.

03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:01.000
I'm always ready for a steam sale.

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:02.000
Yeah.

03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:05.000
I'd have to pull up my wish list, but I know there's some other indie games that are on

03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:06.000
my list ready to go.

03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:07.000
I just haven't picked them up yet.

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000
I'm just kind of waiting for a sale.

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000
Things like UnEpic and yeah.

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:12.000
Indie games.

03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:15.000
I will probably load the crap up on indie games.

03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:18.000
Those are the ones that tend to go really cheap, like two, three bucks.

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:21.000
I'll probably load up on some of those.

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:26.000
I actually found that the steam tags is a really good way to find a lot of new games.

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:28.000
Just to kind of throw that out there.

03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:30.000
My wish list won't load.

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:31.000
Your wish list won't load?

03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.000
Apparently I can't have it.

03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:35.000
It says that I've got GamerX to save my money for.

03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:36.000
Yeah, it was.

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:41.000
The dates were leaked by a banner for pay safe card.

03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:42.000
It's a website.

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:45.000
I guess they have their electronic payment company or something.

03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:49.000
It says summer sale the 19th through the 30th of June.

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:50.000
There we go.

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:52.000
I want The Cat Lady.

03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:53.000
That's a thing.

03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:55.000
Yeah, it's a game called The Cat Lady.

03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:58.000
I want the Adventure Time game.

03:17:58.000 --> 03:17:59.000
And Blockland.

03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:01.000
And I want the BloodRayne game.

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:04.000
Steamworld Dig, I forgot is something I wanted.

03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:06.000
Dark Souls, I still don't have.

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:08.000
So that is absolutely something I want.

03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:11.000
And I forgot there's some Telltale things I want too.

03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:16.000
Which, by the way, got to see a sneak peek of Tales from the Borderlands and a play through of the first few minutes.

03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:22.000
I'm not even super into Borderlands, but that was a fun demo that they showed at the first little bit of the game there.

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:25.000
But Wolf Among Us, I still definitely need to check out.

03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:28.000
And my MMO side wants The Secret World.

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:30.000
By the way, I have The Secret World.

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:31.000
Do you?

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.000
It's not bad. I bought it when it went on sale last time.

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:34.000
Oh, nice.

03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:35.000
It was pretty good.

03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:37.000
I should start playing it again.

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:40.000
But now the big ones on my list is The Cat Lady.

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:42.000
And I want the Adventure Time game.

03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:45.000
I got, what's the other big one on my list?

03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:47.000
Blockland, an epic.

03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:50.000
The new BloodRayne game that's actually a side-scroller.

03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:52.000
It looks pretty fun, actually.

03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:53.000
Nice.

03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:56.000
And Dream and Child of Light and Jazzpunk.

03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:57.000
Okay.

03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000
All right. Well, Rageinator, I love the question.

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000
I got to let you go, though. We're way past time.

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:03.000
I got to wrap up for the night.

03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:04.000
But good luck.

03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:05.000
All right, here we go.

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:06.000
All right, bye.

03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:09.000
Hope you make it through a Steam sale unscathed.

03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:10.000
I've got to wrap up, you guys.

03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:12.000
We are running way long tonight.

03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:14.000
But thank you very much for those that did get through.

03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:16.000
If you did not get a chance to get through tonight,

03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:18.000
please don't forget you can send your thoughts.

03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:21.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:24.000
And it's time to wrap up another very busy episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:26.000
But hey, this is it.

03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:28.000
2014 in gaming. You're looking at it.

03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:30.000
So despite some of the little surprises here and there,

03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:34.000
we have a lot to look forward to for the rest of the year.

03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:38.000
Thank you guys very much for downloading our show and checking out the show.

03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:40.000
Whether you're listening live or you're listening on the podcast feed,

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.000
thank you very much for your support.

03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:44.000
If you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:46.000
Help us spread the word of mouth.

03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:49.000
And then maybe someday Microsoft will answer our question

03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.000
if we tell enough people about the show.

03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:53.000
No, they won't. They're Microsoft. Trust me.

03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.000
If they have a Microsoft way of doing things,

03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:57.000
even dealing with them on the retail side,

03:19:57.000 --> 03:20:01.000
it's just like there's a vibe you get.

03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:02.000
It's hard to describe.

03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:05.000
Just saying, when you stop listening to Community,

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:07.000
that's when you get the E3 like you did last year.

03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:10.000
I'm just saying, here's the reality.

03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:13.000
My question didn't get to which I'm, when I say me,

03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:16.000
I'm speaking on behalf of independent media in general.

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:18.000
I know we are not the only ones fighting this battle.

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:21.000
But when I don't get my question answered

03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:24.000
so that the guy from the L.A. Times can go into the presentation

03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:30.000
and then write his headline about how Nintendo is bringing the PlayStation 4 out this year,

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:34.000
okay, those are the people you want to invite to talk about your games.

03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:37.000
Okay. Just remember that headline, folks.

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:40.000
They hardly ever go off script.

03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:43.000
Well, they went off script on that one.

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:45.000
Somebody went off script.

03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000
All right, anyway, so yes, spread the word.

03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:50.000
Please tell a friend or two about the show or leave us a nice review.

03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:52.000
We really appreciate reviews on iTunes.

03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.000
Stitcher is a huge one too.

03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:56.000
We've gotten a lot of support from Stitcher.

03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:58.000
I want to thank folks who listen to us over there.

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:01.000
And yeah, we've been pretty consistently top 25 show in gaming.

03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.000
It's really awesome.

03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.000
We're not telling you what to do.

03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.000
We would never, but we would really appreciate it.

03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:08.000
Yes.

03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:09.000
All right.

03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:10.000
That's it. We're going to wrap up.

03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:12.000
Let's go around to everybody's final thoughts for the night.

03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:13.000
Loki, you're ready to get out of here.

03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:14.000
Sorry for holding you late.

03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:15.000
No, no big deal.

03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:18.000
My final thought is I fixed my problem that was in my game.

03:21:18.000 --> 03:21:20.000
I fixed the bug.

03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:22.000
That works, I think.

03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:24.000
It works in the editor.

03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:25.000
I'm just worried.

03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:27.000
I think I can implement it in the regular game.

03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:29.000
Well, good luck to you.

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:32.000
My final thought tonight is it's time to go get about five more trophies

03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:35.000
and entwined because that thing is a trophy pinata.

03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000
And a pretty decent game.

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:39.000
I'll tell you more thoughts on it next week.

03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:41.000
Last but not least, Dark Sakura.

03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:42.000
I think I'm going to go home and go to bed.

03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:43.000
I'm tired.

03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:44.000
Sleep is good.

03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:50.000
But for those listening live, I did a little treat for the old school.

03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:53.000
Just for the live folks, huh?

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:57.000
For those that are listening on podcast, you got to be here live sometime.

03:21:57.000 --> 03:21:58.000
All right.

03:21:58.000 --> 03:21:59.000
Thank you guys very much for being here tonight.

03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:04.000
Next week, episode 557 with hopefully, fingers crossed, holding my breath,

03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:06.000
Marvel Heroes next week.

03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:08.000
And of course, the latest and greatest, the E3 Fallout

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:11.000
and whatever else comes up in gaming news next week.

03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:12.000
We'll do it all over again.

03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:13.000
Thanks for tuning in.

03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:14.000
Have fun.

03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:15.000
Bye.

03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:18.000
