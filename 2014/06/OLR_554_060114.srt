Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Since the last show, Amplitude was funded, but it's not all good news as Harmonix denounced a random layoff shortly following the campaign's end. In this final week before E3, Nintendo breathes new life into GameCube controllers. Get out your way, birds, and join us for the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio with this our 554th episode for June the 1st of 2014.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host back after a week off. We'll get into that in a little bit. Say hello once again to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How are you? DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm okay, or well.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're well? Good. Did you have a good week off last week?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It was alright.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah? Good Memorial Day weekend as a whole?

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It was alright.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It was very restful.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There were too many people at my house on Monday.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, did you guys have like a barbecue pinball-a-thon?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, I hid.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Aww. Did you least get Midna? Pick up Midna and run in the other room?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Middles and I hung out for a bit, but it reiterated my pleasure at my barrenness. I'm glad I don't have kids. I'm glad I will never have kids. And I'm glad that other people can take their kids and leave.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's okay to love kids for other people's kids, or your own, whatever you're into.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't ever want one.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, that's fair.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I have been spending the week in gratitude.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But there are mothers and fathers to pets out there, which I think you certainly fall in that category.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Midna doesn't talk back. She meows and begs for food. She doesn't run around knocking over my expensive Japanese dolls, nor does she walk around saying that things belong to her when they don't.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The worst thing she does is sometimes sheds on the bed and claws Dan's chair. That's it.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Speaking of pinball, I see Bobby in the chatroom, our old pal Bobby Blackwolf, over at live.vognetwork.com. Blackwolf says,

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Jamie, I played a Metallica pinball table last week. It was euphoric.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm glad you like it.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I haven't played Metallica pinball. That sounds awesome.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It was pretty fun. I played it at California Extreme last year.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Good times.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It was really good. Very loud.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All right. Also say hello, everybody, to Techmaster Loki.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hello.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How are you doing, Loki?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Fine.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Playing pinball lately?

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What have you been up to?

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Programming.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We're having a conversation in the chatroom about the music in Watch Dogs.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And seriously, some perfect songs that were just missed out in licensing in the game.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Apparently it has really terrible licensed music.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But I said, hey, they should have totally licensed who let the dogs out.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because that would have been appropriate for that.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And then that was followed up with, you know, Dungewell said, sorry, not even Rockwell, somebody's watching me.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was just going to say somebody's watching me.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That would be awesome. But no, apparently, no, we don't have any humor that would contribute to the game.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Some of the songs might be a little bit more expensive, too.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sure if the soundtrack on subpar, it was probably some cheap licenses. Who knows?

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But if they can afford the license who let the dogs out for every single Disney movie that features a dog,

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm pretty sure, you know, recent Disney movies that feature a dog, I'm pretty sure that they could, you know, do this.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All right.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Also say hello, folks in studio, joining us once again, filling up the fourth chair as he does for a few weeks at a time.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He leaves a few weeks at a time. He's back a few weeks at a time.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Say hello, everybody, to Jason.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Throw your wave buttons in the air.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wave them round like you just don't care.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thirteen years old, ladies and gentlemen.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Melee and the birth of the GameCube controller being significant happened thirteen years ago.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And we're going to probably get another five years at least out of them with the recent announcement.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Which we will cover later.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Of course, of course. So you've been breaking out the GameCube and getting down with some GameCube games lately?

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't own a GameCube. I actually never did.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What?

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I missed that one outright.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What?

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think I have an extra you can borrow.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I was going to say, I think we have two as well. You missed out.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, I didn't. I just didn't. I didn't play it at home. I just played it at other people's houses and whatnot.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I still to this day think Animal Crossing on GameCube was the best one because it had the free virtual console, essentially.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There's like twenty old school games tucked away in that game. That's a powerful little disc.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Also F-Zero.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes, F-Zero GX.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
F-Zero GX just kind of stands on its own.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So flipping good.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know, there's all these rumors as we're ramping up to E3 week.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There's all these rumors that, you know, GameCube games may become backwards compatible on the Wii U, at least the whole virtual console or whatever.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Anything you would want to check out if that should happen?

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't know that there's anything that I...

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
There's nothing that I know I have missed out on and have not had an opportunity to play.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But it's still a Wii inside there. GameCubes. Like the pins in the 3DS, I think it was, the GameCube lockout is a technical band-aid and not a true compatibility issue.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Anything like that.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
People have unlocked the ability to play GameCube in the Wii channel.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, that's true.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I think there's some fud about, oh, the slot loader isn't geared for the smaller GameCube discs, which is technically true, maybe?

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think there's an email on this a little later on that we'll get into as well.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, then I'll shut my mouth for another hour and a half.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No, it's fine. A little teaser there before we get into the email segment.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But I was going to say, there was certainly a lot of GameCube games that could be kind of rediscovered again.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And I would think with the impending Smash Brothers game coming out, there's the old Smash Brothers from GameCube that many people still consider the best one that they've done so far.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think a lot of people would be very thrilled to kind of play all over again, so to speak.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Especially if they somehow tweaked online into it.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Which, you know, I know we kind of go, LOL Nintendo and online.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But Mario Kart this week, and we'll get into this a little later, Mario Kart this week kind of showed like, alright, we can do this.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's do it.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Have classic games actually been changed when they've been brought into the Virtual Console?

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Not a lot. And when it happens, it's really like weird and obscure.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
One that comes to mind is the Genesis version of Street Fighter II, apparently had it on the Wii.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And it's because, and I didn't even realize this, I guess the Genesis Street Fighter II had code in it for the whole modem thing.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So they kind of leveraged that to work online.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't even know all the details since I never bought it.

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But apparently, yes, some of them have been altered in that way.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And, you know, I know Nintendo did like the Dr. Luigi, which you can play online.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And kind of taken some of the old classics and buffed them up like that.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So it's just a matter of resources. How many resources is Nintendo willing to allocate to that to make it happen?

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Interesting.

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because I haven't bought into the Wii U yet, there's just a lot of details that I just don't get firsthand.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And it's all, you know, I'm going to get one eventually.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Like I mentioned on a previous show, I'm going to step into new consoles eventually.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And just, my life has changed and money is different nowadays.

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And especially when you're not even home for more than two months at a time.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Something to consider since we're talking about the whole Nintendo and online and all this.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You know, and we'll talk a little more about Mario Kart 8 in our gaming weeks.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
At least I know I want to talk a lot about that.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But with Mario Kart 8 coming out, you know, it's an online game and online is a pretty big component.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because once you've kind of unlocked everything and done the single player and unlocked everything you can there,

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
there's really not a lot left except to go online and race your friends and things like that, right?

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's kind of amazing if you think about it.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Almost every game that comes out that has an online component just craps out on day one.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mario Kart 8 is working. It's still working. It worked all weekend. It's great.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Now I know some of you are going to say, oh, but the Club Nintendo Redemptions, that whole thing crapped out.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Even I, not being a Mario Kart player or Wii U or even I saw that the Club Nintendo was screwed up this weekend.

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But to be fair, you know, you still have like what, 60 days to redeem.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you have a long time to redeem those codes, it's fine. That'll resolve itself out.

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And that's honestly not the most important thing.

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I would think. I don't know. Maybe for some people it is.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I was able to redeem my free game just persistent.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I just kept trying and trying and trying and trying and eventually it worked.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But I would imagine if you bought Mario Kart 8 because you really wanted to play free Zelda,

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
then you would have just bought free, or you would have bought Zelda, right?

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So I'm thinking, no, because if you buy a game that you, it's the, oh, we had this discussion a couple of weeks ago.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It was the Halo 3 argument. A lot more people bought Crackdown to try Halo.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because Crackdown was a good game. It was an interesting game.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But the people that were devoutly interested in Halo got Crackdown for Halo.

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes, I'm with you to a point, like I get that point.

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And Mario Kart is a very good game if you're even remotely into racing games.

142
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And they will, but people will buy a game that they personally are okay with to get a free game they really want.

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But I would argue that Mario Kart 8 is easily better than any of those games they're giving away. Easily.

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's probably the second best game out on the Wii U right now.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, there's new, I mean, new Super Mario Brothers is bad.

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No, not at all. Not at all. But Mario, again, Mario Kart 8 is the second best game out on the Wii U right now,

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and the best Wii U game that is out right now is not one of the ones they're giving away.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And that's Super Mario 3D World. So...

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It depends on what you're into.

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah, I guess so. But my point was, before we got on that tangent, my point was,

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
you know, for all practical purposes, where I feel it's the most important, the online functionality of the game,

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
it's working and it's working well.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It uses friend codes if you want to actually join us.

154
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I was hearing something.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The tournaments use codes, but that's one way to get into them.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can also get into tournaments through, I think, like, you can have them be public, searchable, friends only, but the codes are...

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Private, private rooms you need an identifier for.

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You have to realize the term friend code gives a lot of people PTSD.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In all fairness, Nintendo's making steps forwards, not backwards.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, hold on.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
With online.

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay, yes.

164
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
With online.

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Huge step forward.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
With online.

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And this could have been the perfect Mario Kart game, except for one really stupid oversight.

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I have a feeling. Alright, what is it?

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What the fuck were they thinking with Battle Mode?

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, I knew it. I knew it.

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Seriously, it's like, how fucking hard is it just to follow the pattern it's established in every single Mario Kart game?

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hey, let's try something different.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Nobody fucking wants different.

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They want Battle Mode arenas, not Battle Mode.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm too fucking lazy to make a new track, so I'm just gonna make this old track into a Battle Mode.

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's stupid.

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have a feeling it came down to, and I'm not excusing it, because Battle Mode is a weak point in Mario Kart 8,

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and it's part of the reason I'm not saying it's the best Wii U game, although it is a great Wii U game and an absolute reason to own a Wii U right now.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But, in all fairness, the Battle Mode is a step backwards compared to the previous games.

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I wonder if it didn't come down to performance.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Not that I'm excusing that, but I noticed there were some other interesting decisions made in the game that seemed to come down to a performance issue,

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
where it had to run HD really smooth, really pushing that hardware.

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I wonder if, for some reason, the Battle Mode that we all want wasn't possible.

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But then again, it might show up as DLC later. Who knows?

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I just don't buy that. I think because those tracks are really small, I mean, if they want it...

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I mean, look at how they had Battle Mode on the Nintendo 64.

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I mean, those tracks were pretty simple, and there wasn't much going on.

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They don't really have to make it too flashy and glitzy and stuff.

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Just make it a fucking track that's fun to play.

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hell, you could take the old retro things and just kind of go with that.

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The boxes with the lanes and all those kind of things.

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Or just, hey, you want to do something really cool?

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like, have a Mobius strip-type arena or something like that.

194
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Lots of comments from our chatroom on what Loki's saying here.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And Dark Tetsuya starting things off saying, oh, here comes Loki.

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And yes, all these comments coming from our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com,

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
because we do tape Orange Long's Radio Live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Tigerclaw saying, Mario Kart is the type of game that you can bring in people who never played a racing game in their life into the genre and have fun.

201
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You don't have to be a pro to enjoy Mario Kart.

202
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I agree. That's part of the reason why I like Mario Kart and Forza Horizon and some of the more arcade-y blur I thought was a hugely underrated title.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
A lot of those arcade-y style races I think are a lot of fun.

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Gene in chat says, I haven't played a battle mode since Nintendo 64, and that was for about 10 minutes.

205
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Weiland says, how else will they justify Battle Arena DLC?

206
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
ActDef wonders, do people play battle mode extensively?

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
DarkTetsuya says, I'll give it to Loki on battle mode, but I don't really play the mode myself, so it's not something I'll miss.

208
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And ActDef saying, most of the time I play Mario Kart with friends is races.

209
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I used to play battle mode like crazy, so that's the thing.

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I have to admit, when it came to, especially the Super Nintendo and N64 versions, battle mode was played way more than the races.

211
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, the racing is fun, and that's fine. They have the racing built in there, but here's the thing.

212
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't include it then if you're not going to put effort into it.

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If it's just something you want to do, just omit it, then people will get pissed off.

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But still, it's better than just half-assing it.

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I still think what they've got is a little better than that, but I agree that it is a little bit missed that classic battle mode isn't there.

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But for me, honestly, Loki, it's a small blemish on an otherwise great game.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because when it comes down to it, those races are fantastic.

218
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, I don't doubt that they are, but that's the problem.

219
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
They could have easily had it perfect, but they half-assed that part.

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And that's what's really sad. I don't know if it's a timed thing or what.

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We'll come back to Mario Kart 8 later, because I want to talk about this during my gaming week.

222
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We'll talk about all the other games the folks here in the studio have been playing.

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But we weren't here last week, and I do want to apologize, because usually I try to warn you guys in advance if we're going to not have a show.

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I didn't do that a couple weeks ago. That's because the cancellation of last week's show was a little bit more sporadic.

225
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I ended up taking a last-minute road trip for Memorial Day, and it was something very spur-of-the-moment.

226
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And to be honest, I don't really regret it, because it was a great break, and I needed it, and I hope everybody got a great break last week.

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And when you really kind of go back and look at it, three-day weekends...

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Except Bobby. We love you for holding the fort.

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes, we do. We do. But three-day weekends, and Bobby would probably agree with this.

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Three-day weekends are usually our lowest participating times, because between Labor Day and Memorial Day...

231
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And we probably won't have a show Labor Day weekend either, but that has more to do with Dragon Con.

232
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But three-day weekends, people are either out of town, and then we have a lot of people that listen to the show on Monday at work.

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Well, there was no Monday at work for many people last week, so I'm sure some of you were looking forward to it and missed it.

234
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Honestly, I was looking into it. The last time we took a show off was when I went to BlizzCon in November.

235
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So, one week, you guys. One week. Every once in a while is alright.

236
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Game of Thrones does, what, ten episodes a year? Are you all obsessed?

237
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I think it's okay that we take one week off, because trust me, guys, a lot goes into this show, not just what you hear.

238
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So take a week off is nice.

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But I hope my co-hosts and everybody else had a great Memorial Day weekend.

240
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But we are back this week to talk about what's going on in gaming news.

241
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Now, since we haven't had a week off in a while, we haven't gotten to do this segment in a while, but the news still goes, even when we don't have a show.

242
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So it's time to do last week's news set to Holik.

243
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So let's do last week in gaming news.

244
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Last week in gaming news.

245
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Some more information on Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U, including the return of Ike to the game.

246
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Also, a new GameCube-style controller ended up being announced for the system, which we'll get into a little more later.

247
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Because I think last week it was more rumor, this week it became fact.

248
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Not necessarily. The one that they're talking about is the one from PDP that works like a classic controller.

249
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It plugs into the bottom of a Wii remote.

250
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well, that thing got blown out of the water this week. We'll get into more of that later.

251
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Also, some news on Hyrule Warriors. Team Ninja is helping out with the game, and Japan is going to be getting the game on August 14th.

252
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Some of the characters for Hyrule Warriors were displayed, and let's just say it's obvious that Team Ninja is having a part in the game.

253
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There's a Nintendo patent out there that some folks speculate is Wii Music 2.

254
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't know why, but that's apparently going to be a thing, so we'll see what happens.

255
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Also, the Amplitude Kickstarter, it happened. It was funded last week. They made $844,000 plus.

256
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This was thanks to support from Insomniac and other gaming companies. They announced some other artists in the game as well.

257
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Also, Night Trap HD, a thing that might be in the works.

258
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The Gauntlet game dated September 3rd, and the Oculus Rift coming to Chuck E. Cheese, apparently.

259
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes, a virtual ticket grab redemption thing. Oculus Rift and Chuck E. Cheese coming together to bring that.

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
We were talking about that a little bit before the show. So we were saying it's Futurama coming to life. Was that you, Jason, saying it's Futurama's happening?

261
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah, there was a second or third season where they went to, I believe it was the moon. It may have been Mars.

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But the cast of crew was walking through the arcade, and there was Steve Ball.

263
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's the very first episode. Or no, second episode.

264
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Was it? Seriously?

265
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It was the second episode. The very first delivery that they went was to the moon. He got all excited about it because he was going to go to the moon.

266
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It was a theme park.

267
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So they had skee-ball, they had virtual skee-ball, and virtual virtual skee-ball.

268
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We're only one step away.

269
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's an interesting development for the Oculus technology. There's a part of me that's like,

270
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
but nothing compares to standing in that little tornado room and trying to grab all the money.

271
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Usually it was like Monopoly money or tickets or whatever, and grabbing all that you can. That's a fun experience.

272
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It seems like the Oculus would really kind of take away from that, but at the same time, because it is new technology,

273
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
not a lot of people have really got to explore yet, it does sound kind of neat in that regard.

274
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Is the Oculus technology safe for kids, though? I know I'm probably going to get side-eye for suggesting that.

275
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The reason why I ask that is that I know the 3DS contains all these warnings for kids.

276
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So is Oculus okay?

277
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Do you really want to have that kind of expensive technology at a place where kids have pizza smeared all over their face?

278
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Can you imagine how clean that Rift thing is going to be?

279
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Remember when they had the Beachhead 2000 machines at Golf Land and stuff like that,

280
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
where you could lower that thing under your head and the Sumo and all these weird...

281
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I kind of think...

282
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The Sumo, what was that?

283
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That was the giant Pokeball you would sit in. I don't know why that came to mind, but it did.

284
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But anyway, my thought is it might be like a Beachhead 2000 machine,

285
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
where it's more like you lower this big helmet onto your head that would have the Oculus technology.

286
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's not going to be like a loose thing. Come on, they'd lose that in an instant.

287
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm pretty sure it's going to be part of a larger machine.

288
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I just don't think it's going to be a big draw, the Chuck E. Cheese.

289
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Honestly, the ticket machine thing is just kind of...

290
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It is what it is. The little kids get excited about it.

291
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
How old are you really going to be to have a party at Chuck E. Cheese?

292
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You're not going to be that old.

293
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They don't even let adults in there by themselves. You have to be there for a birthday party.

294
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You have to have a child as your chaperone.

295
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, you have to have a chaperone child. That's a real thing.

296
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's how they do it at Fairytale Town.

297
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah, there's a lot of kid-oriented places that do that.

298
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Which I understand there's creepers that they want to keep out,

299
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
but what about those of us that just want to act like a kid?

300
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
We used to love to go to Chuck E. Cheese in college.

301
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So that's when I'll borrow Julian.

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let's put it this way.

303
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Can we borrow one of your kids, Loki, to go to Chuck E. Cheese?

304
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Josh likes going to Chuck E. Cheese.

305
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Loki's like, fuck yeah, take him off my hands.

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Here's the thing. The only thing that's good about Chuck E. Cheese is,

307
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and I assume this is all of them, but they made it really simple.

308
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Now everything is one token to play. Any arcade game is one token.

309
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's good.

310
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It really sucks that they don't have any dancing games because that would be fucking...

311
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I would be there all day. One token? Fuck yeah.

312
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'd be here for a long time.

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You know what's really ironic about that?

314
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The barcade out in Denver, the one-up. Same exact principle.

315
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You know, I noticed it was interesting.

316
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I was talking a lot about Scandia here in Sacramento the past couple of weeks

317
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
because they got all these music games and I suddenly took interest in going to Scandia.

318
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And actually, like the 2DX machine, two tokens. Popping music, two tokens.

319
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I was like, wow, this is really on the cheap compared to what I remember 10 years ago.

320
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I wish they had those nickel arcades still. Remember when they used to have those?

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Like Nickel City and stuff?

322
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You know what's funny? Nickel Mania, one of those places that they used to have out in Roseville.

323
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's like a golf cart shopping store now, if it's even still there.

324
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
For all I know, they bulldozed it and built a freaking Walmart on top of it or something.

325
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But this place called Nickel Mania had one of those machines that you got in and you grabbed as much Monopoly money as possible.

326
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And I don't remember why. I guess they had a ticket counter or something.

327
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But I also remember they had Mortal Kombat. We used to go there to play Mortal Kombat all the time.

328
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Really terrible combination with the ticket grabber and Mortal Kombat inside there at the same time.

329
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I applaud their creativity.

330
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That was also the only place I ever got to play Time Killers.

331
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Was that what it was? Where you had the buttons like head, limb limb limb limb.

332
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And like you would keep hitting limb limb limb over and over and you'd like hack off the person's limb.

333
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Is that what the game was called?

334
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't know, it sounds about right.

335
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It was like Time Killers or something like that.

336
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Because all the characters were from different, like somebody in chat will know.

337
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But yeah, I used to play that in Nickel Mania all the time.

338
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Those Nickel arcades are awesome.

339
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't they still have some of those in the Bay Area? I think they do.

340
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
They used to have them in the Bay Area.

341
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We actually had one, the last one I remember was up in Old Zack actually.

342
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
They had one there.

343
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And they had a pump it up machine there.

344
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But that was about it.

345
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And it was really lame because I went there right when they opened and it was just like,

346
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and they just have a pump and that's it.

347
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
There's like a few games I'll play and it was just pump.

348
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But that was the first time I played pump so that was pretty fun.

349
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Good times, good times.

350
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Alright, let's get into an Alan Alchemy confirming what I was thinking in chat.

351
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Agreeing yes, that is Time Killers. Thank you.

352
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I just remember there was a guy in it that kind of looked like he was a character from Golden Axe.

353
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Like the little guy that actually had the Golden Axe.

354
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Like there was a guy like him in it and you'd like lob off people's arms and stuff.

355
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It was gross but it was fun.

356
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It was all cartoony so it wasn't like real life like Mortal Kombat was.

357
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So what you're saying is Thrill Kill got reclaimed into an arcade cabinet and was completely under the radar.

358
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And since it was a cartoon it was okay.

359
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You know I think we should, since we're talking about fighting games,

360
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
we should commission the folks behind Dominique Pomplamoose to do a new Clay Fighters game.

361
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And honestly, and I gotta be honest here, I have no expectations for characters.

362
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So if you want to do like Blob of Clay 1 and Blob of Clay 2, I'm totally fine with that.

363
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Well let's call Sega up and see what he thinks.

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Exactly.

365
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I know he didn't program it but he's got connections, why not?

366
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
He has a claim. I don't know who owns the rights to that game anymore so who knows.

367
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Clay Fighters? Who did make that game?

368
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The claim did it.

369
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yeah, claim.

370
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So I don't know who has it now.

371
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Somebody probably bought it on auction for nickels and dimes so I don't know, maybe.

372
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Change that they had from a nickel arcade.

373
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Who knows, who knows.

374
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

375
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
One more note.

376
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Oh yeah.

377
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
In July 2010, WeGo Interactive in Seoul, Korea purchased all IP related with...

378
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh actually no, that's not everything.

379
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Throwback Entertainment in Canada. Seems like a likely candidate to own Clay Fighter anymore.

380
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Well I thought for Clay Fighters or like all of the claim stuff, because I know that Warner has a lot of the claim stuff.

381
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Most but not all.

382
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
They have Mortal Combat and Gauntlet.

383
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But that's midway. Nevermind.

384
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Get my companies mixed up again.

385
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Didn't a claim just publish it or...

386
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh it was an interplay, that's right.

387
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah.

388
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah it was.

389
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Whatever, developers, publishers, I can't remember.

390
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I mean that shit was so fucking old. At least they got half of it right.

391
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And you never know which one of them really owned it either.

392
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah.

393
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Because sometimes the developers have to find the publishers, sometimes the publishers contract developer, you know it just depends.

394
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
These were screens that I just kind of glazed over while I was waiting for the theme song to kick in.

395
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Do you have fond memories of Clay Fighters?

396
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I know you were a fighting game girl. Did you ever play Clay Fighters?

397
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah, I did.

398
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I would always play...

399
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Bad Mr. Frosty.

400
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yes.

401
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And Helga were my two.

402
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I always liked Bad Mr. Frosty just because I liked hearing you say, Bad Mr. Frosty.

403
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Like the blob.

404
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You've been a very bad Mr. Frosty.

405
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Alright this might be it guys.

406
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It is live radio so I have to do live YouTubes but...

407
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It was Ocean huh?

408
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
This also could be a Europe art piece of art we're seeing here.

409
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That says the right music.

410
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I was going to say I don't remember vocals but then again I also don't remember music in the game at all.

411
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I remember the vocals.

412
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That's what I want to see. I want to see the treatment that...

413
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The Super Nintendo version had the vocals in it. That's part of what made it so awesome.

414
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Like that Killer Instinct had like you know like I think in Killer Instinct it was just this

415
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah, yeah, woo hoo hoo.

416
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You know an orchids theme but you know it's still it was still like something you didn't hear on Super Nintendo at the time.

417
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Graham Norgate re-released that soundtrack on Bandcamp.

418
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Oh yeah?

419
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah and has like slightly extended versions and a couple remixes that kind of stuff.

420
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Grahamnorgate.bandcamp.com that and Timesplitters and I don't remember the other ones.

421
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
There's a lot of really good stuff on his page.

422
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Alright well we could reminisce about fighting games all night and we just might but we're going to start with our gaming week.

423
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
StarSagra, how was your gaming week?

424
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's been kind of uneventful just because it's been kind of a weird week for me.

425
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I've had a lot going on. I have sadly not gotten a chance to play any more Bravely Default.

426
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I did play more Animal Crossing because it's easy to do during lunch.

427
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I played some Final Fantasy 14 and finally got to go on a treasure hunt that I could contribute to.

428
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Instead of just tagging along and getting you know maybe casting a spell here or there and then maybe getting a little bit of XP out of it.

429
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
But yeah. So I still though need someone to run me through whatever that one that I can never remember the name of but I call it the double D's.

430
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Dazmiel Darkholme.

431
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah. I still need someone to run me through that one because I'm trying to pull the same thing I did with my WoW character.

432
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And that's you know not pug a damn thing until I'm ready to start pugging things after I've already hit endgame.

433
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Okay.

434
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I didn't pug anything until I tried to earn a pug.

435
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The nice thing is in 14 it's really and you know WoW really kind of fixed itself too to be fair.

436
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
A lot of MMOs are kind of going this direction where yes they're massively multiplayer online games.

437
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But you know some people do kind of want to do their own thing and then have the chat room with swords on the side which is a perfectly acceptable play style.

438
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So the nice thing about 14 is that yeah I mean you can group up to do those things and you know it sounds like you want to touch each thing once.

439
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But you can get through a lot of it just by doing leaves and you know at least leveling.

440
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Now yeah you're not going to get through the main story unless you do some of the group up content.

441
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But at least you can do that once in a while.

442
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I've got about maybe a fifth of my current level to go and then I can start doing story quests again.

443
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Because I actually really like the story in the game.

444
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It gets really good at the end too.

445
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And I'm almost at 46 which is where my next story bit is.

446
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You get into the really good stuff. The only problem is you start getting these big level gaps where it's like now you can't do anything until 48.

447
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Dear game bite my ass.

448
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah that part's going to suck.

449
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Sincerely me.

450
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But the story's great.

451
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
PS give me a taco.

452
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
No I had tacos last week by the way.

453
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Congrats.

454
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
They were amazing.

455
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I did though and we will be touching on this later.

456
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I did buy the RPG Humble Bundle.

457
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Because I had been looking for a way to do RPG style comics.

458
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You know like RPG text.

459
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And I think instead of going the flash route so that they are playable on an iOS device.

460
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Is I'm going to program them into RPG Maker.

461
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And then record them.

462
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Nice.

463
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So that they are just teeny movies.

464
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That's a neat use of it.

465
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Because I didn't really think about oh you can do other things than just make games necessarily.

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah but I have ideas for something.

467
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It's right now kind of in the idea phase.

468
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So hopefully I'll have time for it.

469
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
At least you've got your canvas now.

470
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
At least I have my canvas exactly.

471
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
There you go. Awesome.

472
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Alright well let's move on over to Loki.

473
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Who is speaking of canvas.

474
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I think he's been busy working on his new games.

475
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't know if you've played anything else but what's up Loki?

476
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah I did play one thing.

477
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I played No Brakes Valet last night.

478
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Because I bought that for my Android.

479
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Just because I was trying to show.

480
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Josh was looking at.

481
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
There was like some cars or something in this book we were looking at.

482
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And I'm like yeah it reminds me of this game like No Brakes Valet.

483
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm all you totally love it.

484
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's cars crashing into each other.

485
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So I'm like okay watch this.

486
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And so I downloaded it.

487
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Well first off I was surprised that they had it for Android.

488
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And they have it and it's actually way better than the Wii U version.

489
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Although I don't know if they updated it with the Wii U version.

490
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But it's got more tracks and different cars.

491
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And it's a lot fancier.

492
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But still fun and a good time waste.

493
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So I played that.

494
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But that was pretty much all I played this week.

495
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm still working on game stuff.

496
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Because I've been trying to optimize some of my models in the game.

497
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And I tried it one way and it didn't work like I wanted it to.

498
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So I'm trying it another way now.

499
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And hopefully that one will work.

500
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Although I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to do it.

501
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Because it gets complicated with rotations and stuff.

502
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Anyways so I'm trying to get past all that stuff.

503
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So I can get to actually making some models.

504
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because that will be fun.

505
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And that was pretty much it.

506
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I got a copy of Watch Dogs but I haven't played it yet.

507
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So they gave me one for doing something at work.

508
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Quickly.

509
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
He's like I need a favor for you if you do this I'll give you a Watch Dog.

510
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'm like okay cool.

511
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

512
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But it looks fun.

513
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm not sure if I want to start it.

514
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Because I only have so much free time.

515
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I kind of want to focus on programming stuff and not playing games right now.

516
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We'll see.

517
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Alright.

518
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Jason why don't you go next.

519
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
How was your gaming week?

520
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It was actually pretty interesting.

521
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
My office now also has a Wii U.

522
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
They got it principally for Mario Kart.

523
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But at the same time for some reason it didn't come in on Friday.

524
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So I suppose I'll be playing it this coming week instead.

525
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But there was New Super Mario Brothers Wii U and Super Mario 3D World.

526
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So I actually got to sit down and I played the entire first world of that game.

527
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And then more Titanfall as well.

528
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And I think that's pretty much it at a high level.

529
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But there was something kind of funny.

530
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
A coworker had just finished setting up, playing the Wii U, updating and all that kind of stuff.

531
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And he was playing New Super Mario Brothers U.

532
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And I was playing Titanfall.

533
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And I just kind of looked over at the other TV.

534
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And the Wii U's graphics were rich, vibrant, colorful, primary and just fun.

535
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And then I turned back to Titanfall and it's dark, mechanic, gritty.

536
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It was, you know, there was of course a granularity argument.

537
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Because I was playing a first person shooter and comparing it to a 2D platformer.

538
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
2D side-scrolling game.

539
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But it was just like, we all know this kind of thing.

540
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But it just really smacked me because the two TVs are side by side right there.

541
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And I just kind of take even a second to look over.

542
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's like, that's really warm and inviting.

543
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Well I guess I have to go shoot this guy over here.

544
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah, it was just an odd comparison because I don't usually see those situations of things being side by side like that.

545
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
As invariably a lot of you have seen me posting about on Twitter.

546
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I have like 30 clips from Titanfall that are relatively interesting to me.

547
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And I really want to hold on to them.

548
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But going through and uploading them one by one is a pain in the ass.

549
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And it's hilarious to me because I snarked about why when the PS4, the most recent console update happened.

550
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I said, why would you want to copy your footage off to a USB drive when you have a capable editor on the PS4?

551
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Well, now I want to be able to copy my footage off the Xbox One.

552
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And I don't think there's a way to do that unless I manually pick a clip, don't do anything to it.

553
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But I have to name it, send it to my OneDrive and just, oh God.

554
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah, I very much want to extract my videos off of that.

555
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But I don't think I'm going to be able to. And it's very unfortunate.

556
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I wonder if that's something they'll end up patching in.

557
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Just because especially when, you know, I talked a few weeks ago about PlayStation 4 share factory.

558
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And how, you know, for a free download, it's a pretty rad little thing.

559
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And you can just yoink things right over to your USB drive.

560
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And it made me realize you could take any of your videos and put them on USB drive very easy.

561
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And upload studio is great. It is powerful, but it's fucking slow.

562
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And I want to just take what I have and be able to, I should try plugging in a mouse and keyboard to the one.

563
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's not going to change anything because like the transition from screen to screen is slow.

564
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And because I have to go one clip at a time to preserve each individual clip.

565
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But sometimes you want to edit them your way. You don't necessarily want to edit it, you know, Microsoft's way.

566
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Absolutely.

567
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You know, when I was, you know, again, I have to relate things to share factory because I don't have a one.

568
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I have a PlayStation 4, but I know a share factory.

569
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
One of my things I said might be a drawback is that there are only like four or five templates in the thing.

570
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So you're going to see the same damn thing over and over unless game companies or Sony starts releasing DLC either free or small premium expansions to it.

571
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So I could see where there's a desire for people to want to just give me the files and I'll do it on Premiere my way or I'll do it on the thing my way.

572
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You know, hopefully, you know, as gaming on YouTube and Twitch and all that gets even bigger and bigger, we'll probably see easier ways to do that.

573
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:21,000
There is actually one last thing I've been playing through more and more of Rusty's Real Deal Baseball, which is for a, you know, for an initially free game.

574
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But the fact that you can get all the content for about nine dollars.

575
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
No, probably more like 12 because they're all they range.

576
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
If you if you do it right, everything's just under two dollars.

577
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But for a 15 dollar game, they do whoever like specifically developed that game is a genius because they are taking every single fundamental of baseball and drilling into it.

578
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So low level, like so deep into just the specific mechanics of it.

579
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And it's it's damn near like rote memorization.

580
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But it's really strangely fun.

581
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I only have like three of them so far.

582
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Umpire Simulator, swinging practice, catching practice.

583
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm going to get Fielding next.

584
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's really massive amounts of fun.

585
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It is surprisingly fun.

586
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
All right. Nice.

587
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
All right. Is that it for game week?

588
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I think so.

589
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
All right. Let's talk about my gaming week.

590
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I actually have had my hands on a few games this week.

591
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
The first one I want to talk about, which I'm going to full disclosure possible conflict of interest here.

592
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I do a show called Hoard House with my buddy.

593
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What? Why can you figure me?

594
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
OK, I do I do a show called Hoard House with my buddy Ecstifer and his partner is a designer on this game.

595
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So but they've been telling me I've got to play this for forever.

596
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So finally this week I played Rocksmith 2014.

597
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So I'm not really going to review the game, but I'm just going to say I have been playing it.

598
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And I was pretty impressed at the I don't know the first goddamn thing about playing the guitar.

599
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Right.

600
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But the neat thing about Rocksmith 2014 is that it made it look more like rock band, where instead of maybe pressing buttons, it was.

601
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Here is a picture of the entire guitar.

602
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
What do they call the neck or the entire length of the guitar, the neck, the frets.

603
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Then then I think it's the neck and the frets are the individual sections.

604
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
OK, so like it might zoom in and show you like three frets and then start to zoom out if you have to go to a different one.

605
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And you kind of learn that the dots are sort of placement on the guitar, like because, you know, it's it's a real guitar.

606
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And yeah, like it I found that I was able to play something like Foo Fighters Everlong.

607
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Now, I wasn't able to play the whole thing like it's a real guitar.

608
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But when you first start, it's like, OK, you'll play like one note here, one note here, one note here.

609
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And then the game kind of learns. All right. You did pretty good on that.

610
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
In fact, you've probably mastered about eight percent of the song.

611
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So the next time you play it, we're going to balance it for you.

612
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And it adds a few more notes in. So you learn to play a little more and then a little more.

613
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You know, so that's kind of the approach in Rocksmith.

614
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So I was really surprised that it actually does kind of work because I was a little bit like a little bit apprehensive.

615
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Like, is Rocksmith really going to be able to kind of like teach me real guitar without these boring lessons that I sit through and all that?

616
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But they definitely have developed a way to do it.

617
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So, you know, and whether you want to believe me or not, because of what I just told you, that's fine.

618
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But I just would say I was I was pretty impressed with it.

619
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So if you have an interest in learning how to play the real guitar, this definitely seems to be a way to do it if you're a gamer.

620
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
My only my only thing was that and I'm going to be on the song list.

621
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
There was a lot of stuff in there I didn't recognize, but I also don't listen to a lot of rock music.

622
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm sure if you guys listen to more of that, you'd see more of that in there.

623
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But I wouldn't have to fix that.

624
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I know, right? It's just weird. It's just kind of what I do.

625
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But most stuff I listen to tends to be more like synth.

626
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
In fact, if they had a Rocksmith for like piano or keyboard, I would be all over that.

627
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'll be all over that. So I'm kind of kind of secretly hoping that's where they go next with it.

628
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But anyway, with with Rocksmith or whatever, I didn't know like a whole lot of songs.

629
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But when I went into the shop, the DLC, I was like, oh shit, Smashing Pumpkins.

630
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I know that. Oh shit. Garbage. I know that. Oh shit. Maroon 5.

631
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Like there was all these songs in the store I knew.

632
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I was like, oh, well, I got to spend all that money if I want to get it.

633
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But there you go. So I liked I liked Rocksmith.

634
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Other games I played this week. I played Zelda The Wind Waker on HD on the Wii U

635
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
because that was the free game I got with Mario Kart 8.

636
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I did not play a lot of this on the GameCube, to be honest.

637
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I was living with Loki at the time that game came out. I remember.

638
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And I watched Loki play it. And so I never really got hands on it myself.

639
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I just watched Loki play some of it.

640
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I have a copy somewhere. I think it's my sister's storage.

641
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Because I asked her, I'm like, I want my GameCube back. Because I want to play that.

642
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And then she's like, it's in storage. I'm like...

643
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
All these years later. Yeah. But when it first came out, I seem to remember watching you play it.

644
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And I was always a little put off by like, oh, it's like there's no world.

645
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's all these little islands. And it's just all this freaking water to get everywhere.

646
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But I don't know. Revisiting it on the Wii U, I'm like super into it.

647
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I don't know why. I can't really put my finger on it.

648
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But I'm just like, it's something that the game does look really good.

649
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Because, you know, even though the Wii U isn't necessarily the same oomph as the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One, excuse me,

650
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
it can do the cartoony looks very, very, very well.

651
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Which obviously Wind Waker's style is all in that.

652
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And it is really nice having that item screen on your gamepad so you don't have to keep flipping back and forth all the time.

653
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Same thing with the maps and all that. So even that integration alone is worth it.

654
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The whole...

655
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm not saying I would be totally down for a toon shaded Zelda game that's like Link to the Past or something.

656
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That would be amazing if they did a new game like that where it's just Hyrule with all the exploration and stuff in there.

657
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
That would be awesome.

658
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Also, I'm looking in chat with some other comments here. Sorry, there's some comments on Rocksmith I want to go back to real quick.

659
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Dark Tetsuya says, maybe they could call it Rock Synth? Talking about the keyboard game. That would be amazing.

660
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Akuma JP says, Skye, was it fun enough to keep you playing Rocksmith?

661
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes, I want to go back and play more, actually. If I can put down some of these other games.

662
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Did you play the arcade stuff?

663
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
No, I didn't. I only played the learning the songs. There's still stuff in the game I haven't even looked at yet.

664
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
That's another reason why I didn't really want to review it. I'm just really giving you impressions.

665
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Like these are my thoughts. My stream of consciousness thoughts of the game as I usually do.

666
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So yeah, Wind Waker, I'm having a lot of fun revisiting it.

667
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
The Miiverse integration stuff is a little silly, in my opinion.

668
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You can take these little selfies and attach them to Miiverse notes and they show up in other people's games.

669
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
If you set your games so that you can get the little messages in a bottle.

670
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I mean, I'm not knocking on it. It's cute.

671
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
But it's definitely one small little dip in the grander scheme of things.

672
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's still a fun Zelda game that I'm having fun exploring all over again.

673
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But let's be real. This week has been all about Mario Kart 8.

674
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
That's all anybody's talking about this weekend, it seems.

675
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's interesting because Watch Dogs just came out on Tuesday.

676
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And if my Twitter feeds any indication, everybody already forgot and is playing Mario Kart 8.

677
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
No offense to you Watch Dogs fans out there, which I'm sure there are many.

678
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But it really seems like Mario Kart 8 has really taken over the conversation the past couple days.

679
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And that's probably a really good thing for Nintendo.

680
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Because I can't remember the last time the Wii U has been dominating the conversation since it launched.

681
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Not even Mario 3D World over the holiday really got that same level of conversation.

682
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Well, there's been a lot of conversations, but none of it's been positive.

683
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Fair enough. But you know what I mean. The type of buzz Nintendo wants.

684
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So, yes, Mario Kart 8 is out.

685
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And let me talk about the good, and I'll talk about the not so good.

686
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I did mention earlier, I believe this is the second best game that the Wii U has at this time.

687
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It's that good. The first being Mario 3D World.

688
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I don't think it's as good as that, but I think it's still really, really, really, really damn good.

689
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Especially for you fans of Mario Kart.

690
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I think it's probably the strongest Mario Kart game in quite a while.

691
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Quite a while.

692
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Unless you're a huge fan of Battle Mode like Loki.

693
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And I will say that is definitely one of the minuses.

694
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Is that Battle Mode, it isn't really what you remember.

695
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Instead, it's let's go opposite directions.

696
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Because you know you're going to unlock all the courses backwards.

697
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Because that happens in Mario Kart games.

698
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So it's let's race on the course in both directions.

699
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And when we pass each other, we'll kill each other.

700
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's kind of, so it's yeah.

701
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Anyway.

702
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Other things though I want to talk about Mario Kart 8.

703
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
The good.

704
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Track design is great.

705
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Some of the courses, gorgeous to look at.

706
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
The game looks so good on the Wii U.

707
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You know, again it goes for that cartoony look.

708
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And I was playing the game and even Shane commented and I had to agree.

709
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
He's watching me play and he goes, why did Mario 3D World look this good?

710
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Why didn't they use some of these textures in Mario 3D World?

711
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And I kind of had to say like, yeah that's a good point.

712
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I don't know why some of the other Wii U games we see don't look quite as good as Mario Kart.

713
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But it looks great.

714
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's gorgeous.

715
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Like some of the stages are pretty amazing too.

716
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Like there's this twisted mansion.

717
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Like which is basically like the boo house that you go through.

718
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And depending on if you go left or right, you'll either be on the ceiling or on the floor.

719
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And you kind of race.

720
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So you might be like literally have people above you as you're racing.

721
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And you know all those shortcuts.

722
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I think one of the most impressive courses in the game is Bowser's Castle.

723
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Because there's this room where you go by a giant Bowser.

724
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And he punches the sides of the track.

725
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So he'll punch the left side.

726
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Then he'll punch the right side.

727
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And as he punches it, it twists and turns.

728
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Because you know the whole big thing in Mario Kart 8 is anti-grav, right?

729
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And your car is suddenly turned into Tron when you run over certain parts of the track.

730
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And you're like going up walls and shit.

731
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It's crazy.

732
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So the track design, and they do this stuff on the old tracks too.

733
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Like they actually found ways to put anti-grav on the old tracks.

734
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And sometimes it's, hey look it's Mario Kart Circuit from the Super Nintendo.

735
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Except now we've elevated part of the course.

736
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And instead of going around a loop, it now is a vertical loop that you go up and around.

737
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's really crazy, stuff like that.

738
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But really impressive to look at from a graphical part.

739
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Now actdeftinchat says, Mario 3D World looks great.

740
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I do agree actdeft. Mario 3D World does look great.

741
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I wouldn't have called it my favorite Wii U game if I thought it looked like crap.

742
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But I'm just saying, Mario Kart 8 feels like the bar has gone even higher.

743
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You know what I mean?

744
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Like in a very short amount of time.

745
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So this is very interesting.

746
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Also good.

747
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
For all the LOL Nintendo and online and Nintendo doesn't get online and all this stuff we talk about.

748
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Online works really fucking well.

749
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I didn't get any hiccups when I played.

750
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Didn't see any lag.

751
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
There is lag. The game is accommodating for it somehow.

752
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I don't know how, but it's doing it.

753
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I played a couple online races.

754
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
One with a friend that lives in South Carolina.

755
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
One random match I had a whole bunch of people join.

756
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Like some over California, some in other places.

757
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And they all ran really well.

758
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yes, there is voice chat. It works only in the lobby.

759
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But because your Wii U gamepad has the microphone built in, you just talk and the Wii U gamepad picks it up.

760
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And you hear everybody else.

761
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
There's a little bit of a delay.

762
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's instantaneous, but I don't think Xbox Live or Playstation Network are any different in that regard.

763
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
So sometimes you'll hear a little bit of echoing, but all things considered.

764
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I'm voice chatting on a Nintendo online game.

765
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Oh my god, party like it's 2004.

766
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So that's only in the lobby and not in the races?

767
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It is only in the lobby and not in the races.

768
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
That's one, and it's only when you're with friends, not with strangers.

769
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
They have the whole text, the pre-determined phrases that they have for those other times.

770
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Which is fine, whatever. It gets the job done.

771
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I don't want to hear strangers anyway.

772
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I was a little disappointed it doesn't exist in the races.

773
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But I also find that during the races, I'm focused on the race.

774
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And it's probably for the best that other people can't hear the things I'm calling them.

775
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It would be fun though that if you could have those phrase bubbles or whatever on your gamepad and come by like,

776
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Loser!

777
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And also, I thought there was a really good variation of cart mods.

778
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Which the earlier Mario karts, the last couple have had this too.

779
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But there is definitely a variety.

780
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And the variety also extends to the character roster.

781
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
There's 30 characters you can play as.

782
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And I think the addition of the Koopa Kids actually was a really smart add to the game.

783
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It really helped diversify the roster.

784
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
However, one small drawback I have with the game is that

785
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Some of the characters they have on the roster are a pretty big stretch.

786
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And I get why they do it. They're trying to have these different weight classes.

787
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Because all three characters, they're all over the spectrum in weights.

788
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You don't just have light, medium, heavy anymore. They're all over.

789
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
But some of the characters are a little dippy.

790
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I mean, really? Who's looking forward to playing as Baby Rosalina?

791
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Or Pink Gold Peach?

792
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Or for that matter, Metal Mario, who I think is a little bit of a ridiculous character as well.

793
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Or some of these other characters in the game, you just kind of look at it and go,

794
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
No. Couldn't we have put another character in the game instead?

795
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And I think Shane or Alan or somebody was saying this the other night.

796
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
If you want another heavy class, why have we never seen Wart from Mario Bros. 2

797
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
ever show up in another Mario game ever?

798
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Like, Wart would have been an awesome heavy racer that could be there instead of Metal Mario.

799
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Because he technically wasn't a Mario enemy.

800
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah, but neither were the Shy Guys and they show up.

801
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I mean, if we go with that logic, then there's other Mario 2 inspired movies.

802
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
The Shy Guys have shown up in other Mario games.

803
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Didn't Wart show up later on in something else? I thought he did.

804
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I didn't think so.

805
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Hmm. Still, I mean...

806
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
But my point is that Birdo made the transition.

807
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Originally debuted in 2 and has been prolific in the universe.

808
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Good point. I didn't even think of Birdo. Birdo doesn't show up in the game as a racer.

809
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
That's very disappointing. I would have taken Birdo over Toadette.

810
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
That's for sure.

811
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Because they have to diversify.

812
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:23,000
If my brother's playing Metal Mario, then sister needs to play Metal Peach or whatever.

813
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
They're just trying to even it out that way.

814
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Let's see. Tigerclaw says, Here's the thing.

815
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Nintendo added all seven Koopalings to the roster. Why not include Bowser Jr.?

816
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Because they have... Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Baby Rosalina.

817
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Do they really need Baby Bowser on top of all that?

818
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Or they could have put Dixie Kong, Diddy Kong.

819
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Yeah. Why not Dixie Kong?

820
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Oh, because it doesn't really fall into the whole Mario Brothers thing.

821
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Donkey Kong Jr. There you go.

822
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I do think it's great that Mario Kart does have a really good balance of male and female racers.

823
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I think that's really good and a good thing for the industry as a whole.

824
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
One thing Nintendo does very well is that they always have a lot of good male and female characters.

825
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But when you're kind of stretching it, literally Peach is playable three different ways.

826
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And so is Mario for that matter.

827
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
But like you said, Dixie Kong.

828
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I don't think they should have had any of the baby characters.

829
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I don't think that they should have had the metal characters.

830
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Even the Koopalings are kind of like...

831
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Don't knock it till you've tried it. The Koopalings are pretty diverse.

832
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It just seems like they're trying to pad that roster in to make it even bigger than it is.

833
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I think that's okay.

834
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
But I think what it is, Loki.

835
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I think what people are really clamoring for is they want Nintendo Kart, not Mario Kart.

836
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Because then we start to say, well, why not have Zelda?

837
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Why not have Link? Why not have...

838
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I think that would have been a great idea because they could have been a little bit fresh with their tracks.

839
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Don't get me wrong. I like the retro tracks in there.

840
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
But I think that as of late, they've been getting kind of lazy with having a lot of retro tracks in there.

841
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Granted, this is the one they did updated.

842
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That's what they do in Mario Kart games.

843
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Every single Mario Kart game has half new, half old.

844
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And that's part of the charm.

845
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I totally disagree with you there.

846
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I look forward to seeing what retro tracks are available and how they've messed with it.

847
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Because there's some really cool tracks that have come back.

848
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Well, I'm sure we'll see DLC.

849
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I hope so.

850
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
If Sonic can have a Zelda course in it, I'm sure we'll have a Sonic course.

851
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I hope so.

852
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
The character roster thing, though, is honestly only a very minor bitch.

853
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Because I get that they want to have all these selectable and customizable things.

854
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And that's a good thing, but it's just like, really?

855
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And Weiland's telling me to shut up because he plays Baby Rosalina.

856
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Sorry, but it's just, you know, I had to pick on somebody.

857
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Alright.

858
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
The only other thing that I think is a drawback about the game and an otherwise fantastic game is that

859
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I thought it was really weird that in two-player mode, you could not have one person on the screen and one on the gamepad.

860
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed did that.

861
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Why can't Mario Kart do that?

862
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You have to have the split screen side by side.

863
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And I understand the answer might be it was a performance issue.

864
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
When you do that, you have the frame skip.

865
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And I go, okay, well that's an explanation, but it doesn't make it feel any less like, why can't you do that?

866
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I mean, you guys have to understand, although you might say, oh well the reason is because of technology.

867
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Well then the technology needs to be better or something because it seems really weird.

868
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Or at least give me the option.

869
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
If I play that way and I don't like the frame rate skip, then I go back and play the other way.

870
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Or maybe what they used to do in the F-Zero game that was on GameCube.

871
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I don't know if you guys noticed in the game, but they would actually take some graphical liberties with the tracks.

872
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And when you had four players playing at once, the tracks weren't as graphically involved so that it could get that performance out of it.

873
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And I would have liked to see something like that.

874
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I thought it was so weird that I couldn't have one on the gamepad, one on the screen, when one of the launch titles racing games had that.

875
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And yes, the performance suffers a little bit, but it's not awful.

876
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It's not anywhere near awful.

877
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
But that Sonic racing game, as fun as it is, it's just not in the same club as Mario Kart.

878
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
But anyway, so yes.

879
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Well they have Danica Patrick.

880
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Which actually, knock that all you want, but she's a lot of fun to play in that game, so whatever.

881
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Whatever with you.

882
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Let's see.

883
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Let's see.

884
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah, Loki, the classic tracks don't even feel like classic tracks. They feel new.

885
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Granted, they screwed up Rainbow Road.

886
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah, they took Rainbow Road from the Nintendo 64, and although it looks gorgeous in the game, because Rainbow Road on Nintendo 64 was so long, right?

887
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
They just made it a one-lap race that they split into three parts.

888
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Yeah, Loki's rolling his eyes over there.

889
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
But you know what? It's not that big a deal.

890
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I really don't think it's that big a deal.

891
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Yeah, that's dumb.

892
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I still think that Rainbow Road is better than the new one they put in there. I don't like the new Rainbow Road at all.

893
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But, there's like a dance club level.

894
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I don't even, the Electrodome, I think it's called.

895
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:20,000
That level is badass. That's like a little dance club, and you see these big monitors where shy guys and Koopas are getting down, dancing on the sides as you're racing through.

896
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And then as you're racing on the track, the little neon lights light up on the track as you're racing.

897
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And then as you do the skids, the neon lights change color.

898
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And it's such just a subtly awesome effect.

899
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Anyway, I didn't even get into the online stuff.

900
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And the whole like, yes it puts together these highlight reels and you can upload them to YouTube.

901
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And it's a really creative way to kind of try to match what PlayStation 4's got going on with the share button.

902
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I sort of think these YouTube clips are going to be a dime a dozen and they're going to lose their effectiveness really fast.

903
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:57,000
But for those, like if you have a lot of people over and you want to relive those epic moments like when somebody got hit with a red shell right before they were about to cross the finish line.

904
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Those highlight reels serve a pretty good function and I think is an interesting addition to the game.

905
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So, anyway.

906
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Alright, that's it. That's all I'm going to say about Mario Kart 8. I've said plenty.

907
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But overall, even though it sounds like I had a lot of negatives, the positives far outweigh the negatives.

908
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And it's a must own game if you are a Wii U owner.

909
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And if you're not a Wii U owner, I think this one's going to tip it a lot of ways.

910
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I have heard of several people on Twitter went out and got the Mario Kart bundle for the Wii U.

911
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Thought about it.

912
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Even Loki. Even Loki thought about it.

913
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I like Mario Kart, but I had to say, listen, am I going to pay $300 for Mario Kart?

914
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And I was just like, you know, I don't know. Not right now maybe.

915
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It would be Mario Kart and Zelda because you still get the freebie or whatever.

916
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I probably wouldn't do Zelda actually.

917
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Or Mario U or whatever you want to get.

918
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I don't know, but I just, I don't know. We'll see.

919
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
It's like if I got it, you know.

920
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I think there's a lot of people teetering and now is going to be a great time.

921
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I don't think it's going to happen at E3, but I think by the holiday comes around.

922
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Well yeah, there's still time too.

923
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You have now between now and was it the end of July to kind of decide whether you want to do that or not?

924
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So, wait for E3, see what announcements they have.

925
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You know, then that might be worth it.

926
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I still think come the holiday after that promotion is over, I think Nintendo might come out and finally say,

927
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
alright, $50 off. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see.

928
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I think a lot of us think that that kind of thing has to happen sooner rather than later though.

929
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Even going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

930
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Rababa says, you made it sound more positive than negative.

931
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Oh good. I don't like to be the negative gamer, but I am going to point out issues I have with the game.

932
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You know, but overall it's so good.

933
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
SonicM88 in chat says, I just bought my bundle today, but it was mainly for Wind Waker.

934
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Interesting. I guess there are a lot of people that are getting into that Wind Waker.

935
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So, alright.

936
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Anyhow, that's it. We are going to get into some gaming news, but I want to do housekeeping real quick.

937
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Do add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and also we are on Google Plus,

938
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, and Twitter, twitter.com slash olr.

939
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
A few things coming up as of note.

940
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Speaking of Mario Kart, some other podcast frenzies of mine and I and us here at OLR

941
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
are going to get together for a Mario Kart tournament on the 22nd,

942
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
which happens to also be a big night for us because that's going to be our big birthday show.

943
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
So, plan on the podcast cross zone tournament happening on June 22nd.

944
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And the details are being finalized right now, so I'll have more info for you probably next week.

945
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But just kind of set aside some time there to participate in that tournament.

946
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I think we're going to give away a game, and it's all in celebration of podcast cross zone.

947
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
There's going to be a panel at GamerX again this year with myself, the guys from Koopa Club,

948
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:04,000
the guys from Game Buoy, the guys from Game Bar, that's G-A-Y-M-E-B-A-R, and Video Game Realness.

949
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm not sure if they're actually attending in person, but they'll be there in spirit because they're awesome too.

950
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
They're going to be there as well, and I feel like I'm leaving somebody out and I'm feeling horrible.

951
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Probably because there's OLR and Horde House.

952
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Shit, if I'm leaving somebody out, then I'm really, really, really sorry, but I think that's it.

953
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:29,000
But all those groups are getting together to bring you the podcast cross zone tournament on the 22nd, so stay tuned for more information on that.

954
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
That'll be a lot of fun.

955
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And then there's going to be, we'll do something with VOG as well.

956
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Like I know, especially when Mario Kart 7 first came out, we were playing all the time on breaks and things like that,

957
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,000
so we'll look at doing something similar to that for those of you guys that are really into Mario Kart and want to race online and all that.

958
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Also, I want to give a quick shout out to another podcast that was kind enough to have me on their program this week.

959
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,000
The podcast is called Killer Queens from Outer Space, and it's episode 13 that I was on.

960
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
The interesting thing is that it actually is no video game talk from me on this particular show,

961
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:11,000
because this is a podcast about movies, focusing a lot on scary movies, which I'm not usually super into,

962
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
but this particular week was on musical and cult scary movies, which is the stuff I do.

963
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So we talked Rocky Horror, we talked Repo, the genetic opera, and because I guess the Blu-ray just came out,

964
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
this movie came up, and I'm a big fan of this scary movie, Sleepaway Camp.

965
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Which if you've never seen Sleepaway Camp, don't spoil it.

966
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
You've got to go into this movie not knowing anything about it.

967
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It's like a really cheesy thriller from the 80s, and if you don't know the ending...

968
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Didn't they remake that? I thought they were talking about remaking that.

969
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I think they did another sequel, like a Sleepaway Camp 4 or something that came out not that long ago.

970
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
But do you know what I learned on Killer Queens from Outer Space?

971
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,000
This has nothing to do with video games, but I have to share this. I learned this on Killer Queens from Outer Space.

972
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Did you know that in the flashback scenes, there's a little boy, right? In the flashback scenes that you see, right?

973
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
That little boy is the situation from Jersey Shore's brother.

974
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Because apparently that guy was at some screening that one of the hosts on this show went to, and I was like, get the hell out.

975
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I scoffed, and then I chuckled.

976
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:26,000
That was the situation's brother was in Sleepaway Camp, and that makes it like ten times funnier if you know what the ending is.

977
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
But I'm not going to say anything.

978
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And SSG100Matt is like, oh god, Sleepaway Camp is on Blu-ray? Yep.

979
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
We'll talk all about it on that show, so check that out. That was episode 13 of Killer Queens from Outer Space.

980
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
They're on iTunes and all that good stuff, Twitter. Just Google it, you'll find it.

981
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Alright, now we can get into some news.

982
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
A little bit of gaming news this week. A little lighter leading up to E3 week.

983
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Next week I think is going to be a ton of news, and then of course in two weeks there's a ton.

984
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Speaking of E3, I should get this out. I was going to talk about this at the beginning of part B, but I guess I'll say this quickly now.

985
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
VOG will be at E3 2014, just like we were last year, except there's more of us going this year.

986
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Last year Bobby had to do it by himself. This year myself, Bobby, and Jason all going to E3.

987
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And we will be participating in the interactive coverage.

988
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
If you want to check this out, just go to E3.vognetwork.com.

989
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I think for the next couple days you're still going to see 2013's coverage, but I'll give you a taste of what it is.

990
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But Bobby's going to flip the switch to turn it to 2014 at some point this week.

991
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
In a nutshell, we do not want to be the first place that you go to for E3 news.

992
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Because we can't be that. We're not going to be delusional.

993
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You're going to watch streams online. You're going to watch the TV stations.

994
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
You're going to look at the Twitch, or you're going to go to these big corporate sites because they always get the exclusives.

995
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And that's fine. We understand we can't compete with that.

996
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
So we don't want to be the first. We want to be the second.

997
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Now that you're armed with all the script information, because they're just reading all the bullet points and script.

998
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Now that you're armed with what all those first sites are giving you, what is it you really want to know about the games?

999
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
That's what we're after at the Voice of Geeks Network is letting your voices be heard on the floor at E3.

1000
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So you can actually post questions to our board by clicking on an interactive site map of the E3 show floor.

1001
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Let's say you have a question for Konami. You can click on Konami's booth.

1002
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Let's say, heaven forbid, they announce a new DDR game at E3 or something.

1003
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
You can click on Konami's booth and you can ask a question like, is Sandstorm going to be in it?

1004
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
We will try to find out that answer for you.

1005
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Keep in mind, some companies, not as forthcoming as others.

1006
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
We will try our best, I guarantee it.

1007
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
But usually the bigger the company at E3, the tighter the script.

1008
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
And they don't really like to deviate from that.

1009
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,000
If they talk about Kingdom Hearts 3 at E3, probably they're not going to take questions on it.

1010
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Nobody's probably going to be talking about it because they're just not ready to.

1011
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:07,000
But if you like games from those developers that are a little bit, not maybe the first tier, triple A developers,

1012
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
but maybe the A minus B plus developers, they tend to send their creators to E3.

1013
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
They'll talk a lot more about their games and if you have questions about them, we will do our darndest to find answers.

1014
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And we got some great answers last year.

1015
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
We had some chat with the folks behind The Witcher 3, which I think we're seeing them again this year.

1016
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I remember Disney Infinity.

1017
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
We were the ones to break the news on the price of the figures for Disney Infinity,

1018
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
and that was all because of your question.

1019
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So that's the type of stuff we're looking to bring you in this next year.

1020
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So check it out, E3.vognetwork.com.

1021
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And we'll be able to ask two times.

1022
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Bobby, I think he said he answered over 100 questions last year.

1023
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Does that count the ones he zonked out?

1024
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Because that seems like so many, but I would believe it.

1025
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So I guess our goal is 200 this year. We'll see.

1026
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
All right.

1027
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
250.

1028
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
250. That's right. Set the bar high.

1029
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
All right. Let's get to it. Let's get into gaming news.

1030
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And leading into E3, what is going on? Loki.

1031
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So you may remember that there was a whole lot of issues with Let's Players and Nintendo games

1032
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,000
that they were finding that they're not only getting content ID hits,

1033
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
but also that revenue was going to Nintendo for the ads and stuff.

1034
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Well, now Nintendo is going to be offering an affiliate program

1035
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
with basically it's going to be like a rev-share model

1036
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:34,000
where Google, Nintendo, and the video creators will be able to share the revenue from their ads.

1037
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And I guess they've already been tagging recent YouTube videos of Nintendo games

1038
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
and Nintendo ads are appearing on those videos.

1039
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I guess before, because they were just kind of taking all the revenue

1040
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
or at least splitting it between Google and themselves,

1041
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:01,000
but I guess now they're saying, hey, we're going to share it with people that want to make money off of it as well.

1042
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And their comment, of course,

1043
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Nintendo has been permitting the use of Nintendo copyright materials

1044
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
in videos on YouTube under appropriate circumstances.

1045
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Advertisements may accompany those videos and keep you on previous policy

1046
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
that revenue is shared between YouTube and Nintendo.

1047
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
In addition, for those who wish to use the material more proactively,

1048
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
we are preparing an affiliate program which portions of the advertising profit is given to the creator.

1049
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Details about this affiliate program will be announced in the future.

1050
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I don't know.

1051
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I mean, yeah, it's well within the right to do that, but it kind of seems like a dick move anyways.

1052
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I don't know why they should even make revenue off of creative content made with their stuff.

1053
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I just don't understand why they would do that.

1054
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I mean, yeah, it's free advertising.

1055
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Yeah, they may not want the free advertising,

1056
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
but it's kind of lame when there's so many other developers out there

1057
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
that just don't give a shit about people making money off of their content

1058
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,000
and people are more inclined to show that kind of content versus, you know,

1059
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I don't know a lot of people that would be dedicated to, say, a Nintendo-only channel or something

1060
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and now they're making even less revenue per view or whatever from YouTube

1061
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
than they would with another game.

1062
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And ad per view anyways nowadays, it's not that much to begin with, so I don't know.

1063
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I'm going to be honest.

1064
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
This might not be the popular opinion, but sometimes I don't have the popular opinion.

1065
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I kind of think it's fair for Nintendo to take a piece of it, and I am a YouTube content creator myself,

1066
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and I think if Nintendo, the game developer themselves, wants to have a piece of the pie,

1067
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
you know what, they do make the games that we're broadcasting over.

1068
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And I realize some people do commentary and some people do the jokes and things,

1069
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
but guys, you can say that all you want, but the reality is you wouldn't have any of that

1070
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
if you didn't have the game to go with it.

1071
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Like, let's be real, you guys. Come on.

1072
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
You would not have that commentary if it wasn't for the game.

1073
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And if you want to do that type of stuff without the game imagery and without the game music

1074
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
and all that stuff that goes into making a game, you can do that,

1075
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
and then you can have all the profits or whatever,

1076
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,000
but I think if you are going to try to make a living, so to speak,

1077
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
off of all these clips that Nintendo had a hand in,

1078
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
you know what, Nintendo has a right to some of the money.

1079
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
However, that being said, now, where do we draw the line?

1080
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Because I think if you're going to be reviewing a Nintendo product

1081
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and you use clips from Nintendo games in your review,

1082
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I question if it's ethical for Nintendo to be taking a share of that,

1083
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:53,000
because those reviews are supposed to be something that is supposed to give that light to Nintendo and so forth,

1084
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
but I'm not talking like five-minute let's plays being reviews.

1085
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I'm talking like 30-second clips of the game being in reviews.

1086
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I'm not so sure Nintendo should be entitled in those types of situations,

1087
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
but that's the problem with something like this is it's complicated,

1088
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:15,000
and YouTube wants to make these blanket decisions that don't always make sense,

1089
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
and where I get really pissed off is I get really pissed off

1090
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,000
with non-Nintendo companies, third parties that aren't even involved with the game making,

1091
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
making copyright claims against things that are out there publicly as

1092
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
you can make this content and you can make money off this content.

1093
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Like I mentioned a couple weeks ago on the show, Super Hexagon.

1094
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I had a copyright claim on one of those, and I was really pissed,

1095
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and I want to know where's the strike against them for doing those claims,

1096
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
and we got into it last week about the whole which side are they on,

1097
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
the consumer themselves and so forth, and I'm not trying to rehash that argument,

1098
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:00,000
but I'm just saying that this is why there's really a concern about this whole Nintendo thing is

1099
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:08,000
is Nintendo going to start to claim on things that maybe they really don't actually have business making money off of?

1100
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
It's a complicated situation, and I know they're also talking about this whole like,

1101
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,000
oh, well, you have to get permission first and all this, but if you're making it that easy to upload YouTube clips

1102
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
or upload clips to YouTube of Mario Kart and all this other stuff, then you know what?

1103
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Signing up as a revenue sharing partner needs to be just as easy.

1104
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I shouldn't have to fill out a 20-step form and wait 30 days or whatever it is.

1105
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Or just make it automatic. If you monetize it, Nintendo's going to get cut as well.

1106
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Just have that disclaimer there. This content's owned by Nintendo. Nintendo's taking a cut of it.

1107
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I think people will be okay with that, and that's fine. Now this is out there,

1108
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
so it gives people that do the Let's Play videos an option.

1109
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
If you want to make a video using Nintendo products, just know that you're going to be making less money,

1110
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
which I guess is better than no money that was the situation before.

1111
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Exactly, but Loki, my point is, and I know not everybody's going to agree with me,

1112
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
because people want to say, oh, fair use and all this stuff, but the harsh reality is,

1113
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
if you didn't have those games to begin with, then you wouldn't have had a revenue to begin with.

1114
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
But they would have a different game. They'd be using a different game then.

1115
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Unless all game companies went down this road.

1116
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Not all game companies are going to go down that road, though.

1117
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Some of the bigger ones might.

1118
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
But some of the bigger ones aren't as big a deal nowadays.

1119
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It's a lot of indie uprising now, whereas these big game companies,

1120
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
not a lot of people care about doing Let's Plays on them.

1121
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I don't know. You have your options. That's what it is, I guess.

1122
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
All this being said, Loki, I know you don't do a lot of YouTube, but let's say you did.

1123
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Would you make videos featuring Nintendo comment knowing this, or would you say,

1124
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
you know what, no, I'm not going to do this?

1125
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I'd probably be more inclined, if I'm going to put the effort into making a Let's Play video

1126
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
that's of a significant length in the amount of effort it takes to make the video,

1127
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I'd probably be more inclined to do a title that I'd be making more money off of.

1128
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Because why would I spend the effort to make a video that I'm getting a fraction of

1129
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
what I could be getting from another game?

1130
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:33,000
All right. Well, what I want to do is I actually want to go and I want to actually ask our listeners.

1131
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
We haven't done this in a while, but I want to ask our listeners about what they think on this topic.

1132
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
You know what's funny? You want to hear something funny related to YouTube and all this?

1133
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So I used to have a YouTube of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Ask the audience music that I'd always play in the background.

1134
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I just tried to bring it up for this. It's gone. Talk about ironic.

1135
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Let me see if this one works. Let me see if this one works.

1136
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
All right. Good enough. All right. So we're going to go ask our VoG network participants right now.

1137
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And if you are actually on live.vognetwork.com, you should see this question pop up on your screen shortly here.

1138
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And I'm going to make this very simple.

1139
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Is Nintendo's new revenue sharing policy on YouTube fair? Yes or no?

1140
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,000
And I realize there's a lot of in-betweens on this, and I'm actually trying to discourage that.

1141
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I really want to know, as this information is being presented, do you believe it's fair? Yes or no?

1142
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Should Nintendo be allowed to take a cut? So it's up there right now.

1143
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We'll have that open for a little bit and check in on your results in just a minute.

1144
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Live.vognetwork.com.

1145
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,000
DarkSakura, I know you've been a little bit quiet tonight, but I know you've been participating in chat and chatting with all of them.

1146
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:51,000
But you have a good sense of judgment with some of this stuff when it comes to these legal things sometimes.

1147
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm really curious. What do you think? Is Nintendo entitled to a cut?

1148
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:05,000
If it's their product, then yes, they're entitled to a cut. However, as far as implementing it fairly, that is a different story.

1149
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
But yeah, I think they're entitled. Very base level.

1150
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
If they own the original product, they should get a little bit of something out of it.

1151
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,000
It sounds like you and I are on a very similar page here, because I also have that hesitation where it's like, in theory, yes.

1152
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
If what Nintendo is doing is where the industry went, then yes, I would be fine with that.

1153
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And I'm a content creator myself, and I'm fine with that. But the reality is, are they going to do it right?

1154
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Probably not. And that's what I'm considering. Judging on these other things I'm seeing happening on YouTube, probably not.

1155
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:49,000
But the hope is that since Nintendo likes to do things differently, they may have a different solution. We just don't know what it is.

1156
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Alright. Alright.

1157
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
They do like to sort of drop shit on us from, you know, orbit when we least expect it.

1158
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Alright, let's leave the question up just a little bit while we go into this next story, and then we'll get into the results here in a moment.

1159
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:12,000
But I'm going to say right now, it's overwhelmingly yes. So we'll see. We'll see here in a minute, though, where things shake out.

1160
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:19,000
In the meantime, while we wait for the votes to finalize on that, speaking of Nintendo, and I actually dipped into this a little bit with last week's news,

1161
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,000
but Loki was clarifying the difference, that there was like a third-party GameCube adapter that was going to be coming last week.

1162
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Well, Nintendo just...

1163
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It's not even an adapter. It's just a controller that's shaped like a GameCube.

1164
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Well, Nintendo just crapped on that this week by announcing that they're going to be putting out an adapter that you can actually plug your GameCube controller into this adapter,

1165
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
and you plug it into Wii U. You'll be able to use the GameCube controller in Smash Bros. Wii U.

1166
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
This was actually tucked away in a Smash Bros. announcement. Jason, you touched on this earlier in the show as well.

1167
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Throw your Wavebirds in the air!

1168
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You excited about this?

1169
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I still have my Wavebird. I was actually going through a tub of something, looking for some stuff a couple weeks ago before I came out here, and I found my Wavebird, and I would love to put it to use.

1170
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Using the Wiimote with Brawl was okay. Using the Nunchuck didn't. I didn't really get used to that.

1171
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:21,000
But yeah, for stuff like this, anything that's a full-handed controller is great, and the Wavebird fit my hands really fucking well.

1172
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

1173
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Yeah, the GameCube controller. You and I were talking a little bit before the show, too, as you were kind of saying, like, what other controllers lasted 13-plus years?

1174
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And I tried to argue a little bit, well, the DualShock really hasn't changed that much, especially from PS1 to PS2 to PS3.

1175
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Now, granted, PS4, I would say, they've changed enough to make it a different controller, but it's still...

1176
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:50,000
The thing about the PlayStation 4 controller and why it's still a great controller is it still kind of keeps everything that the DualShock does right.

1177
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Yep.

1178
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:03,000
But anyway, I totally get your point, is that here we are, we're now having an adapter two life cycles later to use these old controllers, because people are that attached to them. It's really something.

1179
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And controllers, you know, the button reconfiguration is actually a bit of a sordid issue, where the Wii U Pro Controller and Classic Controller...

1180
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:28,000
No, I'm sorry, the Wii Pro Controller and Classic Controller went back to the standard cross-action buttons, where the GameCube, like the N64, both of those controllers had very specific differences that really made a difference in the game as you played them.

1181
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:45,000
There is no controller that has lasted this long cross-systems. The Wii had four native GameCube ports in the side of the machine. This accessory looks identical. You plug it in once and it's the full array.

1182
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And who's to say that they're not going to revitalize old GameCube controllers again, but if you have them, then you get to put them used.

1183
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Yeah, there's nice save slots in there.

1184
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Oh, I didn't even think about that. Well, you don't need to.

1185
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:14,000
But if we're going to go down the route of that there's a possibility for GameCube Virtual Console games, wouldn't it be awesome to be able to load up your save from the GameCube and play it on the GameCube Virtual Console version?

1186
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Just saying.

1187
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
GameCubes are too hard to come by.

1188
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Some folks in chat are talking about this. Rama in our chat asks, will it be PC compatible? And you know what, it should be noted that because the Wii U takes these things via USB, that yes, this GameCube adapter is a USB.

1189
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So I would think it's only a matter of time before somebody makes a driver for it.

1190
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Official or hacked?

1191
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Official or hacked?

1192
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Official or hacked?

1193
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Official or hacked? Interesting.

1194
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I made this point a number of months ago. I have paired my PS4 controller with my computer, but it seems to not work so well with Steam, so I have to use it physically. I have to use it hardwired.

1195
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:05,000
But we've also talked about the PlayStation 4 direct input translator thing, so games that support what the Xbox controller winds up doing, you can do with the PS4.

1196
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Yeah, because if you can plug it into a computer, people can write something to work with it. Period. End of discussion.

1197
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Now of course, this is starting all the rumors about, is Nintendo going to announce GameCube Virtual Console games at E3? What do you guys think with that?

1198
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I mean, it does seem like a really logical next step. You know, a lot of people missed out on the GameCube, although a lot of people are missing out on the Wii U as well, but you still are probably going to have a good bunch of people who do have a Wii U who didn't have a GameCube, and I think, you know, it seems logical, doesn't it?

1199
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:56,000
We make the point that Nintendo is very good at getting you to buy the same game, exactly the same game, three times. A decade later. So, yeah. If they are capable of doing so, why not? It seems inevitable, I don't see why not.

1200
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:04,000
It's really interesting how much press this news has gotten too, considering it was really a footnote in a larger discussion on Smash Brothers, so it's just kind of neat.

1201
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Big deal with the FGC.

1202
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Well, especially if you take this stuff really seriously, which even Nintendo is, by having this official Smash Brothers tournament, this E3, I mean, Smash Brothers is their bread and butter this holiday season, and yes, I know there's Bayonetta 2, and yes, I know there's the X and all this other stuff, but let's be real, Nintendo is putting all their eggs in Smash Brothers Basket, and with good reason.

1203
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Now that Mario Kart finally came out.

1204
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Now that Mario Kart's finally out.

1205
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And Zelda, kind of, and Mario World.

1206
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Alright, let's go to the results of our poll.

1207
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Again, we asked you guys live, is Nintendo's new revenue sharing policy on YouTube fair?

1208
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And get this, roughly 85% of you guys, that's 84.62%, said yes, it's fair.

1209
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Interesting. That's an overwhelming majority. Like, that's not even close.

1210
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Now, granted, there were some of you that said no, and I hope to hear from you guys later in the program, if not, you know, via email, or via the Skype line, at, of course, you can always send this email, participate at orangelandsready.com.

1211
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
If you get it in now, it's probably not going to make it for tonight, but I would be really curious to hear from some of you no's.

1212
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Not in a combative way. I mean, I might have said that yes, I believe it's fair, but I expressed my hesitations, so I actually do want to hear.

1213
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I want to see if you guys can maybe rip that open a little more, and kind of, I'm really curious about your guys' thoughts.

1214
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So, maybe, maybe hear from some more of you guys a little later in the show, but yeah, 84.62% said yes, 15.38% said no.

1215
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So, thank you guys for participating. We haven't done a live poll in forever. I need to bring those back, because it's a lot of fun to do.

1216
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
See what the audience thinks right as we're listening. Love it.

1217
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Alright, let's move on. Away from Nintendo, finally, this week.

1218
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Darstokker, what do you have for us?

1219
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Well, for fans of Bioshock, which I know we have quite a number of them, Take-Two has stated that there is a new Red Dead Redemption game on the way, and that Bioshock is not dead.

1220
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Of course, you know, we still have the whole, you know, story being told now being concluded through the season pass for Bioshock Infinite.

1221
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:15,000
But they're saying that there may be a bit more to handle, a bit more going on in the future of the Bioshock series.

1222
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:27,000
But, yeah, there's definitely, though, we're going to see some more items, some Red Dead Redemption, more Borderlands, and, of course, the NBA games.

1223
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And they, this isn't new news for Bioshock, even after the, whoo, completely forgot his name, after, like, the series, the series developer, the series creator.

1224
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Ken Levine?

1225
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Yeah, when Ken Levine was retasked, they said that Bioshock wasn't done, it's just not something that he's going to be continuing to spearhead anymore.

1226
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:55,000
What that means isn't so much of a surprise, but, obviously, this is quite good news for the rest of the series to continue on their universes, continue on their story.

1227
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Alright. Well, I mean, a lot of this, I mean, I'm not really surprised to hear any of this, but it's nice to have the official confirmation, especially in the Department of Red Dead Redemption.

1228
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Because I know we've had some rumors on that, and so it's really neat to kind of see that really gaining steam.

1229
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
So, alright, moving on, Loki.

1230
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Alright. So, this is pretty cool. But, apparently, I don't know.

1231
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Apparently, there's going to be some more games announced this year, because some of the major ones that they announced at E3 last year have been delayed to 2015.

1232
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:40,000
So, the Order 1886 was something that, actually, they had an event recently where they had shown off quite a bit of gameplay for it.

1233
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
It is now expected to be coming out early 2015.

1234
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:54,000
So, that kind of sucks on the PlayStation 4, but, equally so, Quantum Break is going to be coming out in 2015 as well.

1235
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
And, apparently, they're going to reveal that at Gamescom.

1236
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
So, we're, I don't know.

1237
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
So, that means that there's got to be something coming out in the fourth quarter.

1238
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Because, right now, at least on the Xbox side, Halo and Quantum Break are now next year, and the Order is next year.

1239
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
So, what's fourth quarter? I don't know.

1240
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
We know that maybe there's another Forza Horizon game coming, so maybe that.

1241
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
But, aside from that, I don't know.

1242
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:34,000
There could be surprises. I think there's surprises still in the back pocket. There usually is at E3.

1243
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
There'll be some type of surprise. It's like, this is this year.

1244
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Well, we had the rumble a couple weeks ago when we had the show.

1245
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I know the Halo rumors were spinning really big about the Xbox One might have this Halo collection, which could sway me.

1246
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I mean, honestly, Quantum Break was what I was waiting for to get the Xbox One.

1247
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
So, hearing that it's 2015 is making me kind of make a...

1248
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Sunset Overdrive looks pretty good. That's supposed to be coming out this year.

1249
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Forza Horizon 2 would sure sweeten the pot over there. That's probably a game that would make me finally take the plunge, too.

1250
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
But, yeah, I don't know. It'd be interesting.

1251
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Of course, I'm disappointed to hear about the Order going to 2015, but especially after seeing some of the previews in the past week.

1252
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I know that was the week we were off, but they did a pretty extensive preview of the Order that showed what the game looked like, and it looks hot.

1253
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's a neat look, and I'm not even really good at those type of shooter games, but why not?

1254
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:34,000
But, considering the way the Order looked last year at E3, I kind of always in my mind thought, this game is way out.

1255
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
This is one of those way out games.

1256
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:45,000
It was never something I was really anticipating in 2014, so I'm actually not as disappointed to hear about that.

1257
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I didn't realize that was such a huge thing for people this year. I always thought it was next year.

1258
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I wasn't that excited about it when they showed it. I was like, eh, it's alright.

1259
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I'm not a super huge fan of steampunk. I think it's cool, but it's not going to get me the bi game.

1260
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I still wonder if Sony isn't going to come out and say, hey, remember The Last Guardian? PlayStation 4 and this year?

1261
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:17,000
That's kind of the sleeping giant that Sony's got. That could be it.

1262
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Also, you know another thing that's surprising? LittleBigPlanet? Where'd that go?

1263
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I know Media Molecules moved on to other things, but I can't imagine Sony's let that franchise go.

1264
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Somebody else did the Vita version, and the Vita version came out fine.

1265
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:36,000
So I imagine somebody's developing LittleBigPlanet on PlayStation 4, and we haven't seen anything on that.

1266
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So that could be another little surprise holiday title. That seems very likely.

1267
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Since we're going to go down this path here, because they've had different LittleBigPlanet-type games and stuff.

1268
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Wouldn't it be kind of cool? A LittleBigPlanet-type game crossed with Animal Crossing or something?

1269
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Where you build up your own town, literally build it up out of stuff. That'd be pretty cool.

1270
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,000
You'd be able to share that kind of environment and build your own theme, park rides or something like that.

1271
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:15,000
LittleBigPlanet Cardio was pretty cool, and that was done by a completely different developer.

1272
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I'd be interested to see anything.

1273
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Dungeonbuster in our chat says, I'm not holding my breath for Last Guardian. If it arrives, it arrives.

1274
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And our pal Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm all over an Xbox One Forza Horizon. All over in Act F degrees.

1275
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
If that gets announced for Xbox One, I'll be getting one. And Forza 5 as well.

1276
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
See, I'm not as big on the main Forza series, because those are the types of racers I'm really not good at.

1277
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Same thing with Gran Turismo. I'm really shitty at those games.

1278
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I don't really have as interested in them as I do the Burnouts, the Mario Karts, the Forza Horizons, the more arcadey-style games.

1279
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Oh man, a new Burnout game.

1280
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yeah, where'd that go?

1281
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Criterion's now making fucking terrible Need for Speed games.

1282
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
What? They're not making one this year. There's no Need for Speed this year.

1283
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Crossing my fingers that the reason there is no Need for Speed this year is because they're making a Burnout game.

1284
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Oh god, I hope so.

1285
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Blender's in chat pointing out that LittleBigPlanet 2 is still putting out DLC.

1286
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And where the fuck is the free-to-play LittleBigPlanet game that they were supposed to have?

1287
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Oh, I forgot that that was supposed to be a thing.

1288
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Yeah, exactly. Everybody did. Where the fuck is it?

1289
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Loki. Maybe it's PlayStation 4 now. There's other free-to-play stuff on PlayStation 4. Who knows?

1290
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But seriously, a new Burnout game, I would be all over it.

1291
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Well, here's the good news. In literally one week and one day, we'll know.

1292
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I'll be watching all those conferences, but yeah.

1293
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
We'll know. Here's the crazy thing too. I don't even know if I told you guys. You might be finding this out for the first time.

1294
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Bobby and I are fortunate enough. We are going to Sony's conference.

1295
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Yeah, I already knew that.

1296
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I'm excited. It's fun. I've actually never been to one of the big press conferences. This is the first year I'm going to one.

1297
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
So this will be a lot of fun.

1298
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Anyway, but here's the thing. Here's my question. What can I do for you guys at the conference?

1299
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Because y'all are going to be watching it, so I'd be an idiot to say like,

1300
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Oh, I'll be sure to break all the news for you guys. Like, come on. You're all going to be watching it.

1301
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
You're all going to know. You all have an internet.

1302
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
It's all part of E3. It's going to roll into the coverage that you were already planning on anyway.

1303
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I will try to keep my eyes and ears open, like around, and see what else.

1304
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Especially like what types of promo things might they have there, and what they seem to be pushing.

1305
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
In a really quiet moment where they're announcing something that's really kind of ho-hum, you've got to yell,

1306
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
WOOOO!

1307
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
And we'll know.

1308
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I'm not going to promise anything because I'd like to be invited back in the future, but...

1309
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
But they would invite back because of your enthusiasm.

1310
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I mean, if boring shit like that is getting you that hyped up, they're going to watch you there every year.

1311
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
We'll see. We'll see.

1312
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
This year it's coming out white. WOOOO! White!

1313
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,000
No, I love the sentiment, guys. ActDeaf says, yell VOG RULES.

1314
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I appreciate the sentiment, but again, I'd like to be asked back in a future year, so that's one way to not get asked back.

1315
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So, yeah. Anyway, I doubt they have many mics on that portion of the audience anyway.

1316
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Alright, moving on, Jason.

1317
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:29,000
As everyone heard, I expect that was following this game even remotely, Amplitude's Kickstarter succeeded.

1318
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Their original goal of 750,000 in an 18-day span was finished.

1319
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Harmonix did a lot of live broadcasting. Telethon style was their claim.

1320
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I missed all of it for some reason. Apparently I was really busy.

1321
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I kind of don't remember why, to be honest.

1322
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:54,000
But they did a lot of really fun, engaging community stuff in the lead up to the end of the Kickstarter, and they pulled it out.

1323
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
They exceeded it by about 100,000 when it all winds down, which is great.

1324
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I don't think that covered any of the stretch goals, but the game is funded and they're going to do their damnedest.

1325
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
This is good news considering what the two weeks lead up was.

1326
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:21,000
It is not all good news. Within a week, I believe, of that even closing, one of the first backer updates was talking about the fact that Harmonix is laying off 37 members of staff.

1327
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:30,000
A spokesperson says, Harmonix is in the process of restructuring our organization to bring it into alignment with our current and future product development plans.

1328
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Unfortunately, this means making the difficult decision to reduce the number of full-time staff.

1329
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
We sincerely appreciate the work of each and every one of these employees.

1330
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Harmonix is working to ensure that those affected are well taken care of as we make this change.

1331
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:50,000
And that these changes will not affect their current plans for Amplitude and Disney Fantasia Music Evolved.

1332
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I am very opinionated on this right now.

1333
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So the first thing that you keep in mind is that Harmonix, any company, does not discuss personal specifics.

1334
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
They use the time full-time jobs, which usually means that it should have been core staff.

1335
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
But you know what also wound down when Amplitude finished?

1336
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Chroma.

1337
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
They don't need system administrators to run their servers.

1338
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
They don't need as much engineering effort to fix issues.

1339
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,000
They don't need creative designers to add new content to the game as quickly as when the game was running.

1340
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
This is not like...

1341
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
The way that I see this, the way that I see these layoffs, is that...

1342
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Can you back up a minute? What the fuck happened to Chroma?

1343
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Because Chroma was...

1344
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,000
It was Alpha. It was in Beta. It was not supposed to just be playable until the release.

1345
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Right.

1346
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
They've got the information that they want. They are going to refine the game and go to step B.

1347
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Huh.

1348
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
It was a limited public demo of which they've never done before.

1349
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
A lot of people were thinking this would lead to Beta leads to full release.

1350
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
And they broke the mold.

1351
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
That's weird.

1352
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Which is good because that game has a lot of edges that need to be filled out.

1353
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
And I'm looking forward to them being able to do that.

1354
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
So I saw this announcement, and it sucked.

1355
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
As we always say, nobody wants to hear about lost jobs. Period.

1356
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,000
There was a lot of really weird stuff about people that were equally as snarky about the Kickstarter.

1357
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
How about you use some of that $800,000 and help the people that lost their job?

1358
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
They did.

1359
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Yeah, I mean...

1360
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I wouldn't call myself a snarky person about the Kickstarter, but I presented my reasons and everything.

1361
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
The really scary kind of element here is that that whole Kickstarter...

1362
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I mean, literally, it's very obvious now, was literally a last-ditch effort by this company to save jobs.

1363
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Because now you see why it was that 18-day window.

1364
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Which even I was one of those people that was like, you're shooting yourself in the foot by giving yourself only 18 days.

1365
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Well, somebody up above knew, come the end of May, I'm gonna have to lose 65 people or something like that.

1366
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Unless I can raise three-quarters of a million dollars, like literally pull this money out of my ass to save at least half the jobs.

1367
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
How can I pull money out of my ass? Let's go to Kickstarter!

1368
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But it's true. This number invariably would have been bigger had Kickstarter not finished.

1369
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever.

1370
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And they did what they could to secure the workforce that they need to be able to complete their jobs.

1371
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
To complete the game, rather, and fulfill their jobs.

1372
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I think that had they made stretch goals, they would have been able to keep another five people, maybe.

1373
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I think the $1 million tier was simultaneous multiplayer, where right now the game is only anticipated on being offline.

1374
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Offline local multiplayer.

1375
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:51,000
But they don't necessarily need everybody's specialties, or they just don't need that extra engineering effort.

1376
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:59,000
So, some people that may have been a part of this project, ultimately, invariably, ultimately, in theory, got let down at the conclusion of it.

1377
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:04,000
But I have to think that number has shrunk by at least a dozen, if not more.

1378
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:13,000
You know what's really interesting, though, is that if some of those stretch goals had been hit, probably with each stretch goal they hit, that would have been like two, three more jobs it would have saved.

1379
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,000
But it was, this was going to happen, everybody knew about it, as you just said.

1380
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:27,000
That time window was, one, it was a great period of time to let those people be able to find other things, other places to go, other things to do.

1381
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And then they rescued, they held onto as many of them as they could.

1382
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I gotta say, you all know how I felt about the Kickstarter, and the industry is the industry the way that it is, it doesn't change my opinion or anything I said a few weeks ago or whatever.

1383
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But I gotta say, you know, for better or for worse, this is one of the most desperate things I've ever seen a game company do.

1384
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:55,000
In the years, in the twelve years we've been doing this show, this is one of the most desperate maneuvers I've ever seen happen.

1385
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:09,000
And that's, I mean, it's kind of sad, I wish it wasn't happening to Harmonix, because I do believe overall they make really good stuff, and it just kind of sucks that they're really sometimes at the mercy of a fickle music industry, so to speak.

1386
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:16,000
You know, the gaming industry and so forth, but what a desperate move that Kickstarter was now in retrospect.

1387
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Did you actually wind up backing it?

1388
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I did not.

1389
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Loki?

1390
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Nope.

1391
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Jamie?

1392
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I'm not a huge fan of Amplitude.

1393
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
No.

1394
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I did.

1395
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I did not until after it passed, which I'm still very mixed about, but as soon as it was obvious that it was gonna hit the home stretch with still a good twenty hours remaining, I threw mine in and I'll be good in the game.

1396
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:52,000
You know, and I still stand by everything I said before. I mean, with all this information, it kind of sucks and so forth, but this thing happens in the industry all the time at the same time.

1397
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:04,000
You know, and those guys will move on and hopefully be able to get in at another studio, or maybe sometimes these people start new studios, and the ebb and flow will continue of these development cycles.

1398
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:16,000
But yeah, again, I personally don't believe in paying for a game a year and a half before it's out with no investor perks. But that's me. Poop on me.

1399
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
No, you are good with your reasoning and you stuck by it.

1400
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:35,000
But I'll tell you this. I will abso-frickin'-lutely check this game out when the demo's out there, when some of my backer friends have the game, and if I like it, which I'm 95% sure I will, then I'll buy it when it's out. Why won't I? Absolutely. I love music games.

1401
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:43,000
You know, there is actually some more news regarding this that I don't think was in the show role. There's actually been a lot of really good announcements about it.

1402
01:37:44,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Danny Baranowski is going to be on the soundtrack, the author, the composer of Super Meat Boy soundtrack, and Dungeon Defenders most recently, I think, and a number, Biden of Isaac, and a number of other incredibly noteworthy games in just the last year and a half or two years.

1403
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:23,000
And there were a couple of other people, Onomatoguchi and C4118, which is interesting. Did you notice that when they announced that, that was really the start of the upswing of the Kickstarter?

1404
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:31,000
But again, I don't think they necessarily had those people signed on the dotted line until they announced it.

1405
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
They couldn't afford to pay them until the game was looking to be solidified.

1406
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:43,000
This is all, it's looking more and more like this was literally, they made it up as they went along. I think in some ways.

1407
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:49,000
You have to establish the game before you can establish the details. So as soon as they were finally able to do that, the news kept rolling.

1408
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura has some news about money spending.

1409
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Well, I mentioned this at the start of the show, but I put money towards the Humble Weekly Bundle.

1410
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And it's actually a big RPG Maker fest, which I've been wanting to get my hands on some of them, but they were a little too pricey for me.

1411
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:24,000
So I have RPG Maker in this, like two of the different builds of RPG Maker, several DLC bundles that have music and graphic assets.

1412
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:33,000
You also get Skyborne, Sweet Lily Dreams. There are also a few other homebrew titles thrown in there.

1413
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It comes also with Deadly Sin 2 and To The Moon, which is a game that I absolutely, absolutely love.

1414
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:54,000
So, I say it's worth getting. $6 gets you all of the goodies, and so I put $10 towards it.

1415
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And right now, they're saying if you pay more than $12, you get everything in there, plus you get DLC bundle number 3 and Legionwood 2, Rise of Eternals Realm.

1416
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:15,000
The money's going to, in part, to indicate Foundation and Child's Play. So, it's only Windows right now, but get it. Just do it.

1417
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Do it and play To The Moon and you'll thank me. I've had parts of that game that made me sob.

1418
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Yeah. Was To The Moon done in this RPG Maker?

1419
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I don't recall.

1420
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Yes. All the games that are part of this are done in the RPG Maker.

1421
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Wow. I didn't realize that.

1422
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Yeah, you can publish games with it.

1423
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I didn't realize it was that powerful. That's amazing. I have played a little bit of To The Moon, but just enough to go through some of the intro sequences.

1424
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Not to get into any of the emotional parts you guys are talking about.

1425
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
The very beginning of the game is emotional to me.

1426
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Well, yeah. A little bit. Yeah, a little bit. There's definitely some feels in the very beginning moments of the game, but, you know.

1427
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:59,000
And before anyone asks, I've already passed on my bonus To The Moon. I've gifted it to a friend.

1428
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

1429
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Because I've already played it. But, if somebody is really nice to me, I might just consider getting it for them.

1430
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I might pick it up as well.

1431
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I thought you already had it.

1432
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I do not have RPG Maker, believe it or not.

1433
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I meant To The Moon.

1434
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Oh, no. I have To The Moon. But, I was thinking about picking up this bundle.

1435
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I thought about doing it, too. But, see, then again, once again, it's distractions. But, it is nice to have stuff that I may use eventually.

1436
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,000
But, I would really encourage you guys. You know, the one thing. I mean, it's one thing to, you know, give codes away to friends and stuff.

1437
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
But, I've said this before about Humble Bundles. Like, you guys really should just, if you're interested in this, go check it.

1438
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
It's a Humble Bundle. You can pay whatever you want. And, it's all for charity.

1439
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Like, it's, you know. Don't be too much of a hard-ass like I am with Kickstarter.

1440
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Go check out the Humble Bundles.

1441
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Alright. Let us travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1442
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:55,000
And, look at some games coming to a, maybe, retail store near you. Maybe not the Humble Store.

1443
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
But, maybe the Humble Store. We'll see. Loki.

1444
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Let's see. Not a whole ton of stuff coming out of this week.

1445
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Pretty much just Murdered Soul Suspect, which is out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, and Xbox 360, actually.

1446
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Then, also, I want to say, I think it's this week. On Friday is the...

1447
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
What was that?

1448
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I didn't have all this stuff screwed up here.

1449
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Okay. Anyways. The...

1450
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
No, actually, no. That was it. I'm sorry. Murdered Soul Suspect. That is the game of the week.

1451
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I would be surprised if it's an awfully slow week.

1452
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Oh, nope. I'm sorry. There's one that is snuck in here.

1453
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Damn, Loki. Sorry.

1454
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I forgot. They added this last minute. Hyperdimension Neptunia PP for Vita.

1455
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Oh, wow.

1456
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
It's coming out. I mean, they've had it.

1457
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
And then, oh, I guess it was this Friday. I think it was the Friday after.

1458
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
But, apparently, Tomodachi Life on 3DS.

1459
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Oh, yeah.

1460
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
And Wildstar on PC.

1461
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Rob, you would know this. What is this Wildstar weekend thing that I've been seeing everybody talk about?

1462
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I believe the game soft-launched over the weekend. You know, I've got to be honest. It's not an MMO I've been following very closely.

1463
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I have a lot of friends that have been following it.

1464
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
But, I believe...

1465
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I hated it.

1466
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
You didn't like it?

1467
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
No.

1468
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Shane was saying some good things about it. I haven't even really looked at it at all.

1469
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
It was way too cartoony and way too motiony and it just made me feel sick.

1470
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I didn't like it.

1471
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
See, I hear some people are really into the cartoony look, though.

1472
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
So, just kind of like... I know Sil, who's from Girls Gone Wild here at VoG and has been on Horde House a couple times.

1473
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
She was really into it and I think was doing the launch weekend.

1474
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
So, you know, it just kind of depends what you're into.

1475
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:47,000
But, yeah. The game, I believe, had its early launch or whatever happened this weekend.

1476
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
And, of course, the whole thing is...

1477
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Seen a lot of streamers talking about it.

1478
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
It shit the bed the minute it launched.

1479
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
As these online games tend to do.

1480
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:01,000
That does explain why some people were playing it at 4 AM their time when I know that they don't usually play it out late. At least not publicly.

1481
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Probably the only time they could get on.

1482
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Just like anything else, when you have enough of an established fan base and everybody has to connect to a central service.

1483
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Gasp! It falls over.

1484
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Gasp! But, again, Mario Kart 8 did alright.

1485
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Alright, moving along. In Japan, let's check out what's happening with the Japanese releases.

1486
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,000
On the PlayStation 4 this week, Japan's actually getting a bundle that contains FIFA 14.

1487
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
They're getting a little bundle that has that.

1488
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,000
There's also a bundle that comes with FIFA 14 and the camera.

1489
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
So, you can get all the kit and kaboodle there in Japan this week.

1490
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,000
As far as games go, though, on the PlayStation 4 this week, the New Order Wolfenstein is out.

1491
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
So, if you want to check that out in Japan, you can.

1492
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I believe that game had just come out here in this past week or two.

1493
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:50,000
In fact, just talking about recent releases, I see in chat that Code Man is asking about Transistor.

1494
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:56,000
You know, I missed talking about that game in my gaming week because that's the game I would have talked about had there been a show last week.

1495
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
But I'll just quickly say, I liked it.

1496
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
And I am liking that game.

1497
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:07,000
That's a pretty cool little, like, I love how you shift between, like, if you want to do an action-y type of game, you can do that.

1498
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Or you can hit the button and do a more tactical type of game.

1499
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Like, I love that. Like, switch back and forth. That's a really neat mechanic.

1500
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
It's like a combination of Parasite-even tactics.

1501
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Yeah, I'll have to talk more about Transistor at some point later on, maybe at the top of the next segment.

1502
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
But we're running long for now, so let me get back to these releases.

1503
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:28,000
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Reign also Wolfenstein The New Order on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

1504
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,000
On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, yes, there is stuff on the Xbox 360.

1505
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Because Wolfenstein The New Order is also on the 360.

1506
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
As well as Ken no Machi no Ihujin Shiro no Okyuu comes out.

1507
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
That's the first print edition there.

1508
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,000
You want to hear a fun fact about Wolfenstein on 360?

1509
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
It's four discs.

1510
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Thank you, idtech5 or whatever that is.

1511
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Wow, I didn't realize that.

1512
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
On the PlayStation Vita, Tokaiden comes out this week.

1513
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
That's a price reduction, however. That moves into the best on the Vita.

1514
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,000
And on the Wii U this week in Japan, nothing.

1515
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,000
But next week we'll see the release of One Piece Unlimited World.

1516
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And lastly but not leastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth.

1517
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
That is such a big game, it's getting its own 3DS XL set.

1518
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Aww, that is a big release on Nintendo 3DS this week.

1519
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
There's also a game called Card Fight Vanguard Lock on Victory.

1520
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Let's travel to the UK with Dark Sakura.

1521
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Well, coming out on the 3rd is 1001 Spikes for Mac and PC and WildStar for PC.

1522
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:44,000
On the 4th, PlayStation Vita Pets, Tango Fiesta for PC, Ultra Street Fighter IV for PS3 and Xbox 360.

1523
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:50,000
On the 6th is Hyperdimension Idol Neptunia PP, Tomodachi Life,

1524
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Murdered Soul Suspect on Damn Near Everything, and that's it.

1525
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then Dark Sakura will give us the classic game of the week.

1526
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
But first, Loki.

1527
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Alright, so you may remember as of recent, they have been doing a lot of tweaks to some of the stuff on Xbox Live and with the Xbox One, that kind of thing.

1528
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Well, one of the things now they get tweaked is the Games with Gold program.

1529
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:26,000
You may remember they were doing two games per month, and you get those for free for your gold number.

1530
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Plus, you get to basically keep them forever once you have downloaded those.

1531
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Now, they're going kind of the route of the PlayStation Plus program, where instead of two games per month, now they're going to give away five games, at least in June.

1532
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Three of those this time are actually going to be on Xbox 360, and then the other two are going to be on Xbox One.

1533
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:02,000
So for Xbox One in June, you're getting Max the Curse of Brotherhood and Halo Spartan Assault.

1534
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:10,000
And then on 360, Charlie Murder, Dark Souls, and Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition.

1535
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
So those are going to be available.

1536
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,000
But the difference now, though, is you have to be a member of Xbox Live Gold in order to have access to those games.

1537
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,000
If you, for whatever reason, let your account lapse, you will not be able to play those anymore.

1538
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I know people are upset to hear that, but at the same time, that's what Sony's done this whole time, and we were all just waiting for Microsoft to follow suit.

1539
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
They didn't want to give them away. They had to.

1540
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Well, I'll get into why I think they're doing that in just a second here.

1541
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
PlayStation Plus also having a little bit of a tweak as well.

1542
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Unlike previous, where the InstaGame collection, they will add a few titles each month, and those will kind of roll on for several months before they finally kind of expire and take them off there.

1543
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Now they're going to be rotating those through every month.

1544
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:04,000
So it's going to be six games every month, two on PlayStation 4, two on PlayStation 3, and two on Vita.

1545
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:15,000
And I guess they're saying starting in July, they announced those titles already, I guess, oh, I'm sorry, for June.

1546
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Okay, so June, they're going to have Trine 2, The Complete Story, Pixel Junk Shooter Ultimate, that's for PlayStation 4, PS3, you get NBA 2K14 and Sly Cooper, Thieves in Time, and Vita, Terraria, and Mutant Mudds Deluxe.

1547
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:41,000
So that's pretty cool. And also, I guess Sly Cooper, Thieves in Time is a cross-buy game, so you technically also get that if you play PlayStation 3 as well.

1548
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:53,000
The reason why I think they're doing it this way now, not only to get more games in there, it's harder for them to negotiate a game to be free for several months versus just one month.

1549
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:04,000
And I think that's why it should be able to get more titles in there. That's why I think Microsoft's had trouble getting decent titles in there because now they're basically saying, oh, you get them for free, forever.

1550
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Now if they limit it to just one month and have it where it expires and stuff that they're able to negotiate, maybe it'll be cheaper for them to get that free title instead of having to pay for downloads for six months versus a month.

1551
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
That makes sense.

1552
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
At least that's my thought. I don't know.

1553
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
It's perfectly logical.

1554
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:35,000
By the way, since you brought up the whole PlayStation Plus thing as well, I want to make sure I brought this up at some point because this came up in the chat room when I was talking about the whole Sony press conference, but for some reason it didn't make our show roll, but this is pretty big news.

1555
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I don't know if you guys heard, but Sony is actually putting their press conference, not just where you can watch it live on the internet in a tiny little browser window, they're putting it on movie screens.

1556
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:55,000
You can actually go to movie theaters. There's certain ones around the country, not all of them, but think of it like one of those Fathom events or something when they do the Metropolitan Opera or something on the big screen.

1557
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Basically, Sony is taking that type of thing over for a night and presenting their press conference in theaters.

1558
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I know you can snatch up the tickets online. I imagine a lot of them are already gone, but I thought that was a pretty interesting little way.

1559
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Is it free?

1560
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Yeah, totally free.

1561
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,000
And they're saying that there might even be little giveaways. I imagine there'll probably be some type of Sony representative.

1562
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
They probably have retail reps around the country, so they probably have a representative at each of these showings.

1563
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Probably just trying to get people jazzed up, talking about Sony.

1564
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Why not create these mob mentality environments where people are going to get really psyched for these games?

1565
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:39,000
I thought it was a pretty clever little idea, and putting a lot of these trailers for high, high definition, high frame rate games on a movie screen is going to be interesting.

1566
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:44,000
So it's like going to your friend's house who has the big screen TV only. This is a really big screen TV.

1567
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Well, hold on a second. You just said something really silly.

1568
01:51:49,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Yes, the resolution in a movie theater is better, but when projectors stream at 24 frames per second versus our 60 frames per second monitors?

1569
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
True, but is that how fast the high def is?

1570
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I admittedly don't know if they do things different for live.

1571
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
They don't stream at 60 frames per second from those events.

1572
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I thought they made a big freaking deal about the whole Lord of the Rings was in this ultra high frame rate.

1573
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
48.

1574
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
But that's still slower than 60 hertz freaking TV.

1575
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
It's still probably going to be better than it'll look over the internet.

1576
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Not according to what everybody thought of The Hobbit.

1577
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Let's be real here.

1578
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Movie theaters are 24. I don't know if they do things differently for non-film studio master, that kind of stuff.

1579
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
But that was just a silly statement.

1580
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Well, they've tried doing 48 for video game high school last season.

1581
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Whenever it was in the video game, they doubled the frame rate on it.

1582
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Actually, the whole thing was shot in 48.

1583
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:05,000
The whole thing, they had it in a 48 frames per second format, but they doubled each frame for the 24 portions.

1584
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:11,000
But they have actually, I think, built their own player to do that because it wasn't something that you can stream.

1585
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
So I don't think that you're going to really miss anything.

1586
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, screw.

1587
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Alright, well let's move on.

1588
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
This is something you might see at the Sony press conference, or you might see it at the Microsoft one.

1589
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Or, neither one, but it'll probably be on the show floor at E3 somewhere.

1590
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
And that is the rumblings of a new Mortal Kombat game.

1591
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:39,000
And thanks to a poster that was spotted on Reddit, there was a whole little thing that says, who's next?

1592
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,000
And it showed the Mortal Kombat dragon logo and the cracked bones of a spine.

1593
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:50,000
And you might remember that the last Mortal Kombat game in 2011 had the whole x-ray maneuvers and things like that.

1594
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:57,000
So, you know, that would probably be in character that if there is a Mortal Kombat 2 coming, which is really Mortal Kombat 10?

1595
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Nine? Ten?

1596
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Ten.

1597
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
God, I'm losing count.

1598
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:06,000
So, wherever they're at, this would probably be a part of it, the whole x-ray thing.

1599
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
This in addition to, by the way, that Ed Boon, who is with NetherRealm Studios, who made the last Mortal Kombat game,

1600
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,000
who is also a co-creator of the game, has been posting all these cryptic messages on Twitter.

1601
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:20,000
So, I think it's a given that we're getting Mortal Kombat, it's just a matter of when they choose to announce it.

1602
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Although, one of the countdown clocks that he's been running on Twitter ends tomorrow.

1603
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
So, they'll probably be a little bit of that hype leading up to E3.

1604
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:33,000
So, looks like that's one of the things you're going to see coming out of E3 is a new Mortal Kombat game.

1605
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Very curious to see where they go with it.

1606
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
The last Mortal Kombat game was very good, and so I'm excited to see one.

1607
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I imagine if there is a Mortal Kombat 2, I'm using my quote-y fingers, if there's a Mortal Kombat 2, it's going to be on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.

1608
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:52,000
It's going to look, you know, even better, and it's probably going to have a roster that's pretty impressive.

1609
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
So, I'm very curious to see.

1610
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
And I want to see if Freddy Krueger comes back.

1611
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
So, all right.

1612
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Anyhow, let's go back to a time when gaming was a little simpler.

1613
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:10,000
And you know what, you didn't have a roster of like 40 characters in your fighting game, plus 10 DLC characters featuring Freddy Krueger.

1614
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
You had like 12, and you liked it.

1615
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1616
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:25,000
We're going to take a trip down memory lane with Dark Sakura as she explores, in this case it looks like a fighting game, similar to Mortal Kombat, that is a classic.

1617
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Dark Sakura, dive in the gaming vault and find a game that the kids should be playing this week.

1618
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
The game I picked this week is Galaxy Fight Universal Warriors.

1619
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I don't know if anyone's ever remembered Galaxy Fight.

1620
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
It was kind of an interesting game.

1621
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
It was done by Sunsoft for the Neo Geo MVS.

1622
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:51,000
It was their second fighting game that came out after the Super Famicom spinoff of the Heberike series, the Sugoi Heberike.

1623
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And this one is their first sideways 2D fighting game.

1624
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:04,000
They also did another fighting game after this called Waku Waku 7. Do you remember that?

1625
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
That might sound more familiar?

1626
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
No. You know what's funny is I think I've actually seen this one.

1627
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:19,000
After that in 1998, they worked with a company called Santa Claus to do Astro Superstars, another fighting game.

1628
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
But Galaxy Fight was just a really interesting fighting game.

1629
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
It sort of serves as a prequel to Waku Waku 7.

1630
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:34,000
They use the same engine and they have a few things in common, including their mid-boss bonus-kun.

1631
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:46,000
You play as one of eight characters and you go throughout the solar system to defeat opponents that inhabit each of the planets before fighting Theldin to settle their score.

1632
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
It's a four-button layout. Of course, it's a Neo Geo game.

1633
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:55,000
The first three are used for striking attacks and the fourth is a taunt.

1634
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:59,000
But using the buttons together, of course, they're special moves.

1635
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:10,000
It doesn't have anything extra, including new Superbars or anything, as other games that came out around that time had Superbars.

1636
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:16,000
This is pretty much an old-school fighting game, just one of the last old-school fighting games for the Neo Geo.

1637
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:21,000
You have all kinds of different characters. You have your bruisers, you have your quick ones.

1638
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:30,000
The names are Alvin, you have Bonus-kun, who I just mentioned, who's actually a parody of you from Street Fighter.

1639
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Gunder, you have Theldin, I think it's Jidan, Juri, Kazuma, Musafar, who is a robot, Rolf, Rumi, Ro, and Yakopu, who is a pet rabbit.

1640
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:56,000
So yeah, it did come out on the AES home console system. It also did have a Neo Geo CD version.

1641
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,000
There was arranged music for the AES version, too, though that was pretty cool.

1642
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:07,000
It was ported to the Sega Saturn. It came out on PlayStation only in Japan.

1643
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:19,000
In 2008, the Neo Geo CD version of Galaxy Fight was included with Waku Waku 7 in the Neo Geo Online collection that came out on PS2.

1644
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:28,000
There were all kinds of different versions that came out. And now, Galaxy Fight.

1645
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:37,000
I laughed at this girl, Rumi, her little victory pose. She looks like she's wearing these gigantic mitts.

1646
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:43,000
She just did a big victory pose where she puts one hand in the air and the other hand in the air, and then her boobs are way too big and they jiggle.

1647
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
It's that typical 90s fighting game girl thing.

1648
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:56,000
At any rate, the AES version of this was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on March 23, 2010.

1649
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
The soundtrack was released by Pony Canyon on March 17, 1995.

1650
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,000
It has all the background music, sound effects, and voice samples from the arcade version.

1651
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Music was composed by Masato Arakawa and Takuya Sasaki, and performed by Jun Kojimae.

1652
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
So, there you go.

1653
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Galaxy Fight. It's a weird game. With boobs.

1654
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
With boobs, for sure.

1655
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
And playing as a rabbit.

1656
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I like these cute little characters in the background who bounce up and down.

1657
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
It's kind of old school, though, isn't it?

1658
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
It is. It's a very, you know, neo-geo fighting game. That's all you have to say. It's a neo-geo fighting game.

1659
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:49,000
It is. And I'm not going to say there's anything super special about it, you know, but it's a fun little fighting game.

1660
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Well, then isn't that what games are supposed to be?

1661
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Yeah, I guess.

1662
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Alright.

1663
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Ew! God, what the hell are you making me look at, chat room?

1664
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
What did they do?

1665
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Flamin' Hot Cheetos Burrito?

1666
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Oh, lord. Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

1667
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Act up. That is gross. Stop it.

1668
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Your classic game of the week. Less gross. Galaxy fight on the neo-geo.

1669
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Alright, wow. This is a long show tonight. I guess we just broke two hours for part A.

1670
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
We have to make up for lost time from last week, don't we, kids?

1671
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
So, anyway, we will be right back. We're going to take a quick break.

1672
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:26,000
And when we come back, there's rapid-fire news, the FUGO Question of the Week, and plenty more show right after this quick break

1673
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,000
when we're back with more of Orange Lawn's radio.

1674
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this June 1st, 2014, with the 554th episode of our show.

1675
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I hope you guys will also come back next week, because next week, of course, June 8th, will be 555.

1676
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Or, as Dark Soccer, I believe, called it a couple weeks ago, the Previl show, because it's 555.

1677
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:01,000
So, we'll be having that, but that is actually our pre-E3 show.

1678
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:07,000
And, you know, every pre-E3, we've got to bring back Listless to do our official E3 predictions.

1679
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
So, count on that for next week. You're going to be here, right, Jason?

1680
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1681
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Good. We'll have a...

1682
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:17,000
There are certain occasions where I will make YouTube videos fancy again.

1683
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Listless is going to be one of them.

1684
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:25,000
We haven't been doing the OLR Games as much lately. There's just been a lot of other news and other things to clearly fill time.

1685
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:30,000
We're way over time tonight, and I've got to keep things moving here, but Listless is always a good one to bring back.

1686
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,000
We had to do Match Game again eventually, too, and come up with some new OLR Games.

1687
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,000
What was the last time we played Beat the Host? That was like 200 episodes ago, probably.

1688
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
That's a side show game.

1689
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I think it started there. Well, actually, a lot of people don't know this.

1690
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Listless actually started on, well, to be fair, it was actually ripped off another TV show.

1691
02:01:51,000 --> 02:02:00,000
But we started doing it on my college radio show back in 90... God, what year would that have been?

1692
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
About 97, 98, when we were doing it. That's when Listless was born.

1693
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Let me put it this way, Jason. Do you know who came up with the name Listless? My ex-girlfriend.

1694
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,000
That says a lot.

1695
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Is Jason... Oh, no, Jason's muted. I'm sorry, Jason.

1696
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Well, they missed my reveal, but that's okay. I haven't said anything meaningful.

1697
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Oh, no, I did. I was just going to say that, fret not, people who keep up with YouTube,

1698
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,000
there are certain occasions where I will put work into having everything visualized,

1699
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
and Listless is going to be a big one, because it is very, very notable.

1700
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Sorry for the dead area, guys. You've got to enjoy live radio.

1701
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Womp womp.

1702
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Yeah, my mixing board over here is kind of crappy, because one of the ports I don't think really works,

1703
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:49,000
so I have to kind of do things in a jig-jag pattern, and if I mess it up, then somebody's mic doesn't get turned on.

1704
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,000
I've done it to Jamie. I've done it to Jason. I hate it, so...

1705
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Rude.

1706
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Sorry, didn't mean to do that.

1707
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Rude.

1708
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:01,000
So, yeah, where was I anyway? Oh, yes, I was talking about my ex-girlfriend was the one that came up with the name Listless,

1709
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,000
and we're actually still good friends today. She does Rocky Horror stuff like I do.

1710
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
She does it all in the Bay Area. She's also the one that got me into that.

1711
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:15,000
So, yeah, it's just funny, but that's how old that whole segment is, so we'll be playing that again next week, something to look forward to.

1712
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:23,000
All right, let us get into some rapid-fire news. We've still got plenty of show to go, so let's get to it. Loki.

1713
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:31,000
All right, so, let's see, starting off here, we've got ARMA 3. Now, this is kind of funny.

1714
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,000
They had a little bit of, like, I don't know if this was back from April Fools. Oh, it was April Fools.

1715
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I do remember seeing this now because they did a parody of that Jean-Claude Van Damme, you know, the split video thing.

1716
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:50,000
But ARMA Carts is now real DLC, so now they have kart racing in ARMA 3, so you can check that out if you want.

1717
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:57,000
It's at $1.99 for that expansion, and they have, I guess, a number of track objectives and checkpoint races.

1718
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:04,000
And then, of course, I guess they're saying that they're going to launch a major gameplay expansion for ARMA by late 2015.

1719
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:16,000
And as of right now, they have sold one million copies to date, so not bad. Kind of interesting to check out kart racing.

1720
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I'm kind of excited about this. You know, I've talked a lot about Goat Simulator, but they're doing their big 1.1 patch, which is coming on June 3rd.

1721
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Now, it's not just a patch for the game. They add a ton of stuff to this. They have a brand new map in the game.

1722
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:40,000
They've got a bunch of new goats in there as well. Split-screen multiplayer for up to four people. Goat Parkour.

1723
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:50,000
And they even have, what they're teasing now, is a Minecraft-like goat that allows you to build grass blocks by the looks of it.

1724
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:56,000
So that's going to be in there as well, and it's just going to be one glitchy, fun game.

1725
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:03,000
The best part about it? It's free. It's a free patch. So you'll be getting all that content starting June 3rd.

1726
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:10,000
And last but not least, Watch Dogs. They've broken Ubisoft's day one sales record.

1727
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Definitely a lot of people were waiting for the game. In fact, several months, because it was supposed to be out in November.

1728
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:23,000
12.5 million copies within the first five months of release was the original record.

1729
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:31,000
That was held by Assassin's Creed 3. Apparently, though, Watch Dogs did say what they actually sold.

1730
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:37,000
No, it hasn't said what they've sold exactly, but it sold more copies than Assassin's Creed 3.

1731
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait for the NPD numbers to get the actual number of copies sold.

1732
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see if it keeps momentum, too, because it definitely seemed like a lot of people were really excited about Watch Dogs.

1733
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,000
And then, you know, obviously Mario Kart 8 has been dominating the conversation over the weekend.

1734
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,000
But now that those games will both be out, it'll be interesting to see kind of that longevity factor.

1735
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Because the Watch Dogs reviews seem to be a little tepid to me.

1736
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Seems like there was a lot more hype behind that game than where people actually ended up kind of feeling about it.

1737
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
I have a feeling there's going to be, granted, a lot of 5 DLC announcements probably at E3.

1738
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Yeah.

1739
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Because they've been prepping a major story DLC in there. I mean, they're slowly adding things in each patch to kind of prep it for the new stuff.

1740
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Things have been kind of quiet on the Grand Theft Auto front.

1741
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:28,000
So, I think we're going to see a lot from that. Although, that might put a little bit of a damper there.

1742
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:34,000
But, again, not to say that Ubisoft doesn't have any DLC plans. They have a season passing available for Watch Dogs.

1743
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Pre-summer is a good time to release a game because there's not a whole ton coming out during the summer.

1744
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Jason, what do you have for us?

1745
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:52,000
A bunch of quick, fun little things as the reason why we call this rapid fire news.

1746
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Rapid fire news?

1747
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Yeah, that's the second time my brain decided to just stop. That's wonderful.

1748
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
You could just make a name up and we'd probably believe you.

1749
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,000
I was thinking lightning something? Shit.

1750
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:07,000
If you said quick fire news, I'd probably look at you funny, but I'd be like, okay, just roll with it.

1751
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I also usually don't do this segment, so that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.

1752
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Anyways, NES Remix 2. Some individuals are not able to actually unlock all of the titles in the game.

1753
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:23,000
The remix producer Hayashida posted an entry to Miiverse in practically every language, too.

1754
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:30,000
That was denoting that there is a secret code to unlock all the titles you have not yet or if you just want to do it from the start.

1755
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
The hint is star, test, clear.

1756
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:41,000
And if you're not going to look at the comments and just look it up, the secret is it is an anagram for start, select, R, A.

1757
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Start the game, hold start, select, R, press A.

1758
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Boom. Game starts, you have all the titles unlocked and you can go crazy with playing the rest of the challenges involved in each of them.

1759
02:07:52,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Capcom, quite notably, finally disbanded Mega Man Legends 3 and there's a bit of hemming and hawing about whether or not that game is actually going to happen.

1760
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
The producer wants it to, but well, he's not with Capcom anymore.

1761
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:19,000
So when Capcom fails, fans unite and a team of people under the name of Jisaku-3 has the goal of creating a prototype version of Mega Man Legends 3 in Unity.

1762
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:30,000
It is being based off the media that has been released in footage so far and there is a video available out there looking for Mega Man Legends 3 Unity prototype.

1763
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:41,000
They're going to give it a shot and we'll see what the internet bicker fest holds to see should this actually come to fruition and the team of people being capable enough to actually create something.

1764
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Snark aside, this sounds like a really fun thing.

1765
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I did not get very far in Legends 2. Legends 1 I absolutely adored. I would love to see the series continue in some way.

1766
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:58,000
There is a lot of fun, friendliness, mechanics, that kind of stuff in this game that I would like to see again.

1767
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Last but not least, a museum in New Mexico has identified 700 copies of all of the copies of E.T. that were unearthed last month.

1768
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
It was already a month ago, Jesus Christ.

1769
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:18,000
As of the dig last month, 700 copies have been identified as capable of being sold.

1770
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:28,000
They are going to be appraised and handed over to a museum for curation, displaying, and selling because they are now artifacts.

1771
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Artifacts of a day gone by and urban legends aplenty and everything that was talked about in the lead up to that movie.

1772
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Exactly.

1773
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I can't help but think, how much is one of these really worth?

1774
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
No prices announced yet.

1775
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Yes, I realize they have 700 or whatever, but you know there's thousands more still in the ground.

1776
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
You're essentially buying garbage.

1777
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Thank you, you are buying garbage.

1778
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:02,000
But they will be appraised, they will be invariably cleaned up superficially, just ground dirt.

1779
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Great, so you're going to get garbage that isn't garbage anymore.

1780
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
With a certificate of authenticity.

1781
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
More garbage.

1782
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
We authenticate this garbage as garbage.

1783
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:17,000
That's what artifacts are though. You're buying into a memory.

1784
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
You're buying into a story.

1785
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Why would you buy into a memory of terrible?

1786
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I remember this game being shit.

1787
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
I bought it, it's shit.

1788
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:31,000
And it sat with shit for 20 years.

1789
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Oh my god, I'm sorry. People will buy it.

1790
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Well if there's less snark from you guys, then they will be available.

1791
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
There's a part of me that's like, maybe for 20 bucks I'd do it.

1792
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Good luck.

1793
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
20 bucks buys you one of the ones they couldn't restore.

1794
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
20 bucks buys me the dog shit that it sat next to.

1795
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
It actually probably buys you 20 of them that they wouldn't be willing to sell.

1796
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Probably more like 200 if that, probably even more, we'll see.

1797
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Alright, DarkSaga.

1798
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Oh yeah, stuff.

1799
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Yes. Not just garbage.

1800
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Well, Mario Kart 8 is going to be bringing some DLC in Japan at any rate.

1801
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
They've got apparently a deal with Mercedes.

1802
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:21,000
So Mario will be driving around a teeny little Mercedes kart.

1803
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Yeah, whatever.

1804
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Hey, I'm excited that DLC is going to be a thing for this Mario Kart.

1805
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Even if, whatever, free Mercedes kart, I'm hoping this means tracks.

1806
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Yes? Tracks? Tracks? Nintendo? Tracks? Hello? Tracks? Anybody? Tracks?

1807
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Maybe.

1808
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Alright, tracks.

1809
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Wasn't that a bad game or something?

1810
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Actual battle mode tracks and not shit? Just saying.

1811
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
An ET track?

1812
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Battle mode on the Nintendo 64? I think the Wii U is more powerful than the Nintendo 64.

1813
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Alright, we can sit here and bitch all night. Sorry, JB.

1814
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:08,000
At any rate, there is going to be a Famicom game coming out to the west.

1815
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Finally, it will be on, actually, the European 3DS virtual console on May 29th.

1816
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:21,000
I don't see anything on a US date for this, but it's the mysterious Muramase Castle.

1817
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:27,000
It's the game that Nintendo Land's attraction, Takamaru's Ninja Castle, is based off of.

1818
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:37,000
But it will be coming out for 4.49 in pounds for 4.99 euro.

1819
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:45,000
And then, last but not least, as soon as it loads,

1820
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
we can say goodbye to Mythic Entertainment.

1821
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Depressing.

1822
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Quite. The article still won't load, sorry.

1823
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
That's alright.

1824
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
That's pretty much all there is to say.

1825
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:02,000
EA closes yet another studio, and these are the guys that brought you Dark Ages of Camelot,

1826
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,000
and Warhammer Online, which I understand was not the big success they wanted it to be,

1827
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:12,000
but EA fucks up another studio, I thought.

1828
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Good job. Thumbs up.

1829
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
That's my reaction.

1830
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Yeah.

1831
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Well, I mean, to be fair, though, Mythic didn't have a grand slam in their last couple releases,

1832
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,000
but there's a lot of fans of the Camelot game that was very upset, which I can understand.

1833
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,000
So, sorry to hear it, to those that work there.

1834
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Alright, let's go to the Fookle Question of the Week.

1835
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:38,000
In happier news, we talk to you guys every week in a statement we call the Fookle Question of the Week.

1836
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:43,000
You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam it together, and you get one hell of a social network.

1837
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:50,000
It's very uncomfortable.

1838
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Here's what we asked the Fooklers this week.

1839
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
That's my new name, the Fooklers.

1840
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Meet the Fooklers, starring Neil Patrick Harris.

1841
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,000
We are back this week after a week off, and did you hear?

1842
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,000
There's some nice sales on RPG Maker on the Humble Bundle and Steam this week.

1843
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:12,000
I forgot to mention, the Steam weekend sale was RPG Maker 4, so they kind of got in on this, too.

1844
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Between that and Loki's talk about game building and my stories about the love of ZZT, an early game maker game,

1845
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
this question is all about creation.

1846
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Have you ever created a game, be it big or small?

1847
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
What was it about and what inspired you to do it?

1848
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:33,000
So, when we talk about game making, we sadly don't have a lot of answers, but we'll read what we got.

1849
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Now, Jonko, one of our buddies from Koopa Club, answered the question.

1850
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
I don't know if this is a game he actually made, or if he thought this question was,

1851
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
what is a game you'd like to see made, but we'll roll with it.

1852
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
We'll just pretend Jonko made this game in his head.

1853
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,000
He said, well, we already have first person shooters and third person shooters,

1854
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
but what about a second person shooter?

1855
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:56,000
You play as a blind assassin who has the power to possess the eyesight of others.

1856
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Your objective is to possess the eyesight of your enemy,

1857
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:02,000
and then hunt down and kill that person while seeing from their perspective.

1858
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Or would a second person shooter just be a game about shooting yourself in the head?

1859
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Damn, Atlus already beat me to that one with Persona 3.

1860
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I feel like that is a game.

1861
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:20,000
There was a game that consisted of, you had sight into zombie creatures or something of the sort,

1862
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,000
and you could look into their eyes and figure out where the safe path is,

1863
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,000
what they can and can't see based off your route.

1864
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I don't suppose it sounds familiar to anyone.

1865
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,000
It was on the PlayStation 2, I remember, but for the life of me, I can't think of the other game.

1866
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
I'm sure the chat will jump. That's why I love having a live chat room,

1867
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
because they think of that stuff when we don't.

1868
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Japanese, 1400s, classic Japanese kind of game.

1869
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
It was in that sort of mythos.

1870
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Kaijuta says, call it Eye of the Beholder.

1871
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Already exists.

1872
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Does it? Wow.

1873
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Yeah.

1874
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
It's a D&D license.

1875
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Oh, yeah. It was also a movie, I think, with Ashley Judd,

1876
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
which I'm sure the two have nothing in common.

1877
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
But they should. Ashley Judd's kind of awesome.

1878
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
What was the PS3? Eye of Judgment, never mind.

1879
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
MXC says Siren.

1880
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Joosten says Geist.

1881
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Bonds006 says Geist.

1882
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Geist sounds familiar.

1883
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Yeah, it does.

1884
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
It does.

1885
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
I think that's it.

1886
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
I know of Siren, but I don't think that's it.

1887
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Oh, look it up.

1888
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Look it up, look it up.

1889
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
To the wiki.

1890
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Meanwhile, while he looks that up,

1891
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
going to our buddy Rene from Koopa Club,

1892
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,000
who says, yes, I have, but it was a vampire LARP,

1893
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
or live action roleplay,

1894
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
which has the additional factor of players doing the weirdest

1895
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
and most random shit you could think of,

1896
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
but when people told you how much they enjoyed the game

1897
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
and chasing down a zombie gorilla,

1898
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
it makes it all worthwhile.

1899
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
So your game involved zombie gorillas. Tell me more.

1900
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
I LARPed.

1901
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Yeah. I never did LARP, but I did D&D.

1902
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,000
I did vampire LARP, which is the nerdiest of LARPing ever.

1903
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:53,000
All those games, roleplaying, be it table, live action, whatever,

1904
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
involved imagination and creating.

1905
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Dude, I'm still playing D&D on Saturdays.

1906
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Nice.

1907
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
I had to order more dice.

1908
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
All right. Moving on.

1909
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Andy R. says, I made some small games in high school.

1910
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Took a web design course that ended up being pretty much

1911
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
just flash in our biweekly projects.

1912
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I made a couple of games.

1913
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Most of them were terrible clones.

1914
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Sly Red Panda says,

1915
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I made a Flappy Bird clone with Ornacia from RuPaul's Drag Race.

1916
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
I saw that game on Twitter.

1917
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Did RuPaul's Drag Race or Vivacious ever see that?

1918
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,000
You need to do a small update and send it out again, if not.

1919
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
You need to call the game. Mother has arrived.

1920
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Anyway.

1921
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I've made some Unreal 3 mods with UDK.

1922
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Starting to experiment with UE4.

1923
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Working with RPG Maker VX Ace right now.

1924
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Twine and Construct 2 are great for beginners.

1925
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Hitstun says, making games is fun.

1926
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
I come up with game ideas much faster than I build them.

1927
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I got my start with some crappy TI-83 basic games in high school

1928
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:55,000
before moving on to Game Maker 6, HTML5, and Unity 2D.

1929
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
We used Torque Game Builder to make The Adventures of Thong Girl,

1930
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,000
a 2D platforming beat-em-up with a scantily clad superhero

1931
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
that shoots lasers out of her butt.

1932
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
That's awesome.

1933
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,000
That's a bit like powdered toast man's premise.

1934
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Check out that game and my Ludum Dare games at bakamostudios.com.

1935
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,000
That's baka as in stupid and mo as in moron.

1936
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,000
We're three stupid morons from Columbus making games.

1937
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
That's awesome.

1938
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Bravo.

1939
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Yes, I will check those out.

1940
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
You know what?

1941
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
It's not often I just let people come on this show

1942
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
and hawk whatever it is they're selling,

1943
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
but if you're selling me girls shooting lasers out of their butt

1944
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,000
from your game studio called Stupid Moron Games,

1945
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
you know what?

1946
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Props to you mama.

1947
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
All right.

1948
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Going over to Google Plus where we have a couple answers.

1949
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
I'm sorry.

1950
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Nothing's going to top that, you guys.

1951
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
All right, DarkTetsuya.

1952
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Can't wait until I play the game.

1953
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,000
DarkTetsuya says,

1954
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I really wanted to get into Unity but ran into hang-ups

1955
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
trying to get the programming code to work.

1956
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Frowned.

1957
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Prior to that, I wrote a few games in the games factory.

1958
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Search on the VoG forums.

1959
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,000
I made a post about them.

1960
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Nice plug.

1961
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Lastly, AJ Twist says,

1962
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,000
I tried making a fighting game on Flash nearly a decade ago.

1963
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Hit boxes and life bars are hard,

1964
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
but I did make a card game.

1965
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Cutting perfectly shaped cards is hard.

1966
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Inspirations, anime, Tekken, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh,

1967
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
and the love of creating.

1968
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
There you go.

1969
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,000
That game's getting linked in our chat room right now.

1970
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
You're going to see a spike in downloads this week.

1971
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Check that out.

1972
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
That's awesome.

1973
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
It looks like MXC was correct.

1974
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Of the two, Geist was a GameCube name.

1975
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
It didn't sound any bit familiar,

1976
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
but Sirens seems like it matches up.

1977
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I don't remember playing more than 20 minutes of it,

1978
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
but definitely something I want to revisit.

1979
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Not game production, but production on a game system.

1980
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
When I was in high school,

1981
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:59,000
a friend of mine had a MTV music generator for the PS2,

1982
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:04,000
and he actually put together some very interesting songs

1983
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
just kind of mixing the samples and instruments available to you

1984
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
in the game itself.

1985
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
He didn't have...

1986
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
There was some peripheral.

1987
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I think it was just like a karaoke revolution microphone

1988
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,000
that you could use to record new stuff and put it in.

1989
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
But he actually did something with it,

1990
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
and I still have the exported songs on my computer

1991
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
in my library to this day, I think.

1992
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,000
All right, well...

1993
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I was going to say real quick,

1994
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:33,000
I made a couple games back when click and play was a thing.

1995
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:36,000
In Windows 3.1, yes.

1996
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I made a game called Shoot First, Ask Questions Later,

1997
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,000
and it was basically a game where it was...

1998
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Like, a shooting game where you shot, like, hedgehogs.

1999
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Like, there was evil hedgehogs, and it was so stupid.

2000
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,000
You should have made Shoot First, Ask Questions Later 2

2001
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
as one of your projects.

2002
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Nah, it's too dumb.

2003
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Somebody needs to remake Boom.

2004
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Jamie, have you ever made a game?

2005
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I guess you did talk about the roleplay.

2006
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Yeah, I did make an environment in D&D.

2007
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I mean, that's about it.

2008
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,000
And I've, you know, created my own written languages.

2009
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
That's about as close as I've gotten.

2010
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Very cool.

2011
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
I used to make little things in ZZT,

2012
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
but nothing really cool, yeah.

2013
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:18,000
All right, well, joining us here, walking into the studio,

2014
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:22,000
taking a break from Mario Kart 8 to bless us with his presence.

2015
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Say hello to Shane.

2016
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Hi.

2017
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
And Shane wanted to answer the question.

2018
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Make sure you talk loud.

2019
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
I made DDR, bye.

2020
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Wait a minute.

2021
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Wait a minute, Shane.

2022
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
You didn't make DDR.

2023
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,000
You did not create DDR.

2024
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Oh, he wanted to rub it in that he helped to make DDR.

2025
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Yeah, well, where's DDR now?

2026
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Do you still work for them, Shane?

2027
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I'm just saying, I could remake DDR, you know,

2028
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
but I have a thought.

2029
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
I don't know.

2030
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I don't know.

2031
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
I don't know.

2032
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I don't know.

2033
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
I don't know.

2034
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I don't know.

2035
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
I don't know.

2036
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
I don't know.

2037
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I don't know.

2038
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
I don't know.

2039
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
I couldn't remake DDR, you know, but I have the concept.

2040
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,000
It's up in my head.

2041
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
It's just, you know, getting it out on program.

2042
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Some day.

2043
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Some day I will.

2044
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Or make something that's like it.

2045
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
One of these, one of these days.

2046
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
One of these days, Shane, one of these days.

2047
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Because I know you still talk to all of them.

2048
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I want you to get all your buddies from the Konami days

2049
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:22,000
and get them all over here, and we're just going to dish,

2050
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
because I know that's an episode people want to hear.

2051
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Alright, anyway, moving on.

2052
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Let's get into some more news here, because again, we're running a little long.

2053
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I have a follow-up.

2054
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Uh-oh, Shane has a follow-up.

2055
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Hurry up, Shane.

2056
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
It's a five-hour show tonight.

2057
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Just get Flaco Jones over here and we'll talk about how we got drunk at work all the time.

2058
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
That would explain why some of the steps you made were so bad.

2059
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
He wasn't drunk then.

2060
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
He wasn't very good at making steps.

2061
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
I'd have been better if he was drunk.

2062
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Just kidding.

2063
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I never played him, so I don't know.

2064
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says,

2065
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,000
A Shane appears, wielding the power of DDR.

2066
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Alright.

2067
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:04,000
UltraMix isn't even backwards compatible.

2068
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
He just yelled from the other room,

2069
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
You're not backwards compatible.

2070
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Nice retort, nice retort.

2071
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Alright, let's get into some other news.

2072
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Loki.

2073
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
And we had to announce it officially news because it leaked out everywhere news.

2074
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Battlefield Hardline was announced this week.

2075
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
It's going to have its official reveal on June 9th,

2076
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:30,000
when it was originally going to have its official reveal,

2077
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
and not previously when all the different assets and shit started leaking out.

2078
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Or in, hey, internal gameplay video that they had from six months ago.

2079
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,000
That's fantastic, when it was codename Omaha.

2080
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:50,000
But Battlefield Hardline is going to be a cops versus criminals Battlefield type game.

2081
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:56,000
And kind of think a little bit along the lines of like a Grand Theft Auto 5 meets Pay Day,

2082
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,000
in like the Battlefield type gameplay.

2083
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
So you're going to be doing heists,

2084
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:06,000
you're going to be fighting off against criminals, police, and whatnot.

2085
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
So it looks pretty cool.

2086
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
And of course, it's supposed to be coming out later this year,

2087
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
and they're going to show it off at E3.

2088
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,000
I'm actually kind of excited about it.

2089
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,000
It looks pretty sweet.

2090
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:19,000
It's kind of like all the excitement they were saying they were going to have with the heists in Grand Theft Auto 5,

2091
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:23,000
which are kind of lame for the most part.

2092
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:27,000
And I know with online they were doing these heists, and it's just still not very exciting.

2093
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:32,000
But all the Battlefield gameplay has always looked exciting, so I kind of want to check it out.

2094
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Alright, I'm sure there will be more to come at E3.

2095
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Alright, moving on to some other quick updates here.

2096
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:45,000
This is still more fallout from the whole closure of GameSpy and all that.

2097
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:51,000
But the good news is Epic is serving up a patch to help Unreal Tournament 3 get off those servers.

2098
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:55,000
That patch is now out, and it will send players to new servers,

2099
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:59,000
meaning Unreal Tournament 3 no longer tied to GameSpy.

2100
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:03,000
You can check out that patch, which will work with the Steam version of Unreal Tournament 3.

2101
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:08,000
You can check that all out at EpicGames.com if you want to do that,

2102
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
because of course there is no more GameSpy.

2103
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Speaking of games getting off cancelled services,

2104
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Games for Windows Live is going to be shutting its doors in August,

2105
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:20,000
so Capcom is getting Super Street Fighter IV the hell off of the service.

2106
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,000
So Super Street Fighter IV is now available on Steam.

2107
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:29,000
That's the new platform of choice, and you can get that on Steam at 75% off.

2108
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:33,000
It's only $8 on Steam before June 1st. That's not so bad at all.

2109
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Now, here's the problem, is that because of the shift from Games for Windows Live,

2110
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:41,000
you may lose some of your DLC costumes.

2111
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:45,000
DLC costumes that were issued to the retail Games for Windows Live version of the game

2112
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
are tied to the game's physical disk and are not able to jump to Steam

2113
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
along with the rest of the components.

2114
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:57,000
So, again, one of the downsides of this DLC, it's always only ever temporary.

2115
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Anyway, at least those games will continue in one way or another.

2116
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Rob, all things are temporary.

2117
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I guess that's true.

2118
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Everything ends.

2119
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
That's true.

2120
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Even us.

2121
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
That's right, we're slowly dying right now.

2122
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Right now.

2123
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
All we are is dust in the wind.

2124
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Dust.

2125
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Wind.

2126
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Dude.

2127
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,000
What a nice positive show we're having tonight.

2128
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Hey, I quoted Bill & Ted.

2129
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Hey, have a great E3, everybody. You're gonna die.

2130
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Hey, I was just quoting Bill & Ted in that last bit.

2131
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I know, I know.

2132
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
You're gonna die soon, you're gonna die soon.

2133
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
It's not cold in here, you're just dying.

2134
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Thank you, Sarah Silverman.

2135
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Alright, moving on.

2136
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Dark Soccer.

2137
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Hopefully you have some more positive news for us.

2138
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Nope.

2139
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,000
It's all shit.

2140
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Uh-oh.

2141
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Representative Bob Latta, who is a Republican from Ohio, filed legislation that would prevent

2142
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:04,000
the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, from attempting to regulate broadband internet.

2143
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,000
So, yeah, this is more net neutrality bullshit.

2144
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Turns out, this guy, he was funded by a telecommunications campaign group.

2145
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Of course.

2146
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Of course.

2147
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:25,000
He received $51,000 from cable company interests for about two years, ending December 2013.

2148
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:29,000
And there is a group called Open Secrets.

2149
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
It's a campaign finance watchdog group.

2150
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:40,000
He was one of 28 House members who lobbied to drop net neutrality after they got kind of paid off.

2151
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:49,000
So he got part of his money, it looks like, money from AT&T, money from a national cable

2152
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:56,000
and telecommunications association, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, American Cable Association,

2153
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:59,000
CenturyLink, and Comcast.

2154
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:06,000
And his bill is to, quote, amend the Communications Act of 1934 to limit the authority of the

2155
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Federal Communications Commission over providers of broadband internet access service.

2156
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
He wants to keep the internet open and accessible.

2157
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
No.

2158
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:19,000
He wants to keep the internet monetized for the people who are paying him off.

2159
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:26,000
I just still find it so weird how we are trying to alter a global service.

2160
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:32,000
I mean, when you start to create that some sites work differently than other sites, isn't

2161
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,000
that how the internet works in, like, China?

2162
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:40,000
I mean, granted, I might be being a little bit extreme and shocking, but this is shocking.

2163
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
It's not that they slow it down.

2164
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
They just plain block them.

2165
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
I know that's what they do in China.

2166
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:50,000
But my point is, like, what's really the difference at the end of the day?

2167
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Okay, maybe.

2168
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
All right.

2169
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Some people might have very impassioned answers to that.

2170
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:59,000
But my point is, is that, you know, this whole net neutrality thing, this is going

2171
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,000
a little too far, especially when she's talking about things like this.

2172
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:08,000
So I'm just going to say, y'all, let your congressperson know that you do not support

2173
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:11,000
candidates who, you know, are supporting.

2174
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Vote the bastards out and they can eat a bowl of dicks.

2175
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Well, if they don't do anything about it, if you keep telling your congressman to do

2176
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:23,000
something and you have a bunch of people doing that and they just still just kind of sit

2177
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
there with their thumbs up their ass and yes, vote them out.

2178
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.

2179
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:35,000
You know, I realize it's a worldwide show, but, you know, participate in your government,

2180
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
you know, however you're able to.

2181
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
And here in America, we vote.

2182
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
So please vote.

2183
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Thankfully.

2184
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,000
He has no co-sponsors, so it really is just him.

2185
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:51,000
The bill has gone to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

2186
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:56,000
So, yeah, vote the bastards out, send them a bowl of dicks.

2187
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Hopefully they're candy dicks, but instead of actually tasting like candy, they taste

2188
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
like, I don't know, pee.

2189
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:06,000
They taste like E.T. cartridges that have been buried in the ground.

2190
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:13,000
They taste like the tears of children, which is probably what I would say some conservatives

2191
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:14,000
feed on.

2192
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Is that a Jelly Belly?

2193
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:20,000
You just take, you take the cartridges from, you know, the buried E.T.s, you grind them

2194
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:25,000
up into a fine powder, you take the tears of crying children, you make it into a paste,

2195
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:29,000
form the molds into little penises and then mail those off to, you know.

2196
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Here, a bag of dicks.

2197
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Now, you know, you know, I just want you guys have really active imaginations right now,

2198
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,000
and it's a little bit alarming.

2199
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Like, I'm just saying.

2200
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Anyway, so one, there's something really, really wrong with this article, and I think

2201
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I just saw it explained at the end of it.

2202
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Bob Latta, the legislation that he's filing would prevent the FCC from attempting to regulate

2203
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:03,000
broadband internet service as a public utility under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.

2204
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:11,000
That is what people that are fighting for net neutrality want to have happen.

2205
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:15,000
That's not what the FCC said they were going to do.

2206
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:20,000
They were going to allow fast lanes, breaking net neutrality.

2207
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,000
So, like, first of all, both of these are steps in the wrong direction.

2208
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Bob Latta is fucking it over, period, but the FCC was going to anyway.

2209
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,000
So there's, there's like a whole second layer of this article.

2210
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
He doesn't know what the fuck is going on in the first place.

2211
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:37,000
We want it to, I want it to be filed to be, to be classified as a public utility.

2212
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I want it to be.

2213
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,000
And I believe that as well.

2214
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Yes.

2215
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
But, and, and he's preventing that.

2216
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
So the problem is still there.

2217
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:49,000
The problem is he's doing it by preventing the FCC from doing it, which is irrelevant.

2218
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:54,000
So file this one under left hand, not doing, not knowing what the right hand's doing.

2219
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Well, he's just making sure that they can't do that.

2220
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Sure.

2221
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Because they could change their mind later.

2222
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
He's protecting his little side paycheck.

2223
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:06,000
It's a preemptive strike because we know the FCC is under a lot of pressure to change there.

2224
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,000
That's, that's what's happening.

2225
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Sure.

2226
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
And, and, and he's getting calls from other Congress people.

2227
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:14,000
I believe, don't quote me on this because I'm going off of like what I think I read

2228
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,000
a couple of weeks ago.

2229
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:20,000
I believe Al Franken has been trying to get internet put as a utility.

2230
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:23,000
So I think this is a preemptive strike against that.

2231
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
So, yeah, not any better.

2232
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:28,000
It's just, there's, there's, yeah, like I said, a whole second layer of just fucked

2233
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
up-ness here.

2234
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Yeah.

2235
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
So, all right.

2236
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Uh, anyhow, let's, I'm still off from moving to Finland.

2237
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Let's let's go to AKA Ripper's house in Sweden.

2238
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
We can stay with AKA Ripper.

2239
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I don't know that-

2240
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Does he still listen to this show?

2241
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,000
I don't know.

2242
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,000
But this, okay.

2243
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I, right, I, I would say that we should move to Australia, but right now Tony Abbott is

2244
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:53,000
a big, um, well, he, um, he can eat shit.

2245
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
We don't need to move anywhere.

2246
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
We need to fix this country we've got.

2247
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,000
That's what we need to do.

2248
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:03,000
We need, we need to divide this country into four smaller, more easily, uh,

2249
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Administrated countries.

2250
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
And mine's going to be called Awesome.

2251
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
All right.

2252
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Because-

2253
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Let's move, let's move on.

2254
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Where people will be fed on dreams and rainbows.

2255
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:16,000
We could talk about Jamie's plans to take over the world all night, but, uh, we do have

2256
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,000
to keep moving on.

2257
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,000
I don't want to take over the world.

2258
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Too much fucking work.

2259
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Loki.

2260
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Well, we can talk about world domination.

2261
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,000
It's kind of fun.

2262
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Um, Steam, you may remember they have their Linux machines that are supposed to be coming

2263
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,000
out at some point.

2264
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Well, they probably aren't.

2265
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Apparently the Steam controller, uh, which is supposed to be coming out, um, sometime

2266
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:43,000
in 2014 is now, um, getting a release window of some time in 2015.

2267
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:48,000
So, you know, people are thinking it's implied that the Steam machines won't be coming out

2268
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,000
until 2015.

2269
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Which, honestly, at this point, I don't know.

2270
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:56,000
It doesn't really, it does, to me, the Steam machines don't really sound that interesting

2271
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
yet.

2272
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:01,000
You haven't really sold me yet on why I need one.

2273
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:05,000
That's pretty much where I'm at right now.

2274
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:06,000
So.

2275
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Maybe this delay is to kind of help make that argument?

2276
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Or maybe add some features to SteamOS, because I don't know where they're at with, you know,

2277
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,000
integration with, like, certain apps and stuff like that.

2278
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Because, you know, they were doing, like, some basic, like, music app, but they don't

2279
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:26,000
really have a whole ton of features yet.

2280
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Alright.

2281
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Uh, let's move on, just for time's sake.

2282
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Jason.

2283
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Contin- ow.

2284
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Way to bite your tongue, Jason.

2285
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:40,000
In, uh, in further, everybody hears about Kickstarter news, uh, Reading Rainbow, uh,

2286
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:45,000
fronted, quite obviously by LeVar Burton, landed only, what, four or five days ago at

2287
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,000
this point?

2288
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
And in the first day, already beat its million dollar goal.

2289
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Uh, it is on pace to be the first double-digit, double-digit, double-digit funded, double-digit

2290
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:59,000
in the millions funded Kickstarter that I know of, at any rate.

2291
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Maybe-

2292
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Why can't we elect LeVar Burton to Congress?

2293
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,000
That's what I want to-

2294
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Clearly, America loves LeVar Burton, which, and rightfully so.

2295
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,000
There is some very interesting backlash against this Kickstarter, but I'm not well informed

2296
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:10,000
enough to comment-

2297
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
There's always some goddamn back-

2298
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Just saying.

2299
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Which, isn't that ironic that I'm the one saying this?

2300
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:20,000
But there's always, there's always some goddamn backlash, you know what I mean?

2301
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
But here's, here's the difference.

2302
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:25,000
I like to think my opinions were well thought out and reasonable.

2303
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:28,000
This other stuff, just stop.

2304
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Stop.

2305
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I'm right.

2306
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
You're not.

2307
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Exactly.

2308
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,000
I thought about it.

2309
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Exactly.

2310
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
You just came up with it.

2311
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Wait.

2312
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Uh, Reading Rainbow obviously has already had a successful Kickstarter and they are

2313
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:42,000
laying down the stretch goals.

2314
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:47,000
The next goal that I don't think they've hit yet, but I'm going to look, is five million.

2315
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:52,000
And when they do that, their intention is to bring the media created by Reading Rainbow

2316
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,000
to, well, pretty much fucking everything.

2317
02:35:55,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Phones, Android, game consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation, set-top boxes, a la Apple

2318
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:03,000
TV, Roku, and I guess Fire TV as well.

2319
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
I could have Reading Rainbow on the PlayStation.

2320
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,000
That's fun.

2321
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,000
You could have it on literally everything you own in this house.

2322
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
That's-

2323
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,000
And not just PBS and the anarchy that that is.

2324
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:16,000
So it's like, reading Linux, basically.

2325
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:19,000
And Windows and ARM and-

2326
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Rama says $3.2 million is the current tally.

2327
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
With 30 days to go.

2328
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Oh my God.

2329
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Is this stat have the potential to make more money than any other Kickstarter ever?

2330
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,000
That I know of.

2331
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:32,000
How much do you make?

2332
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Six million?

2333
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:39,000
You mean like, I don't know, too much money for what they did with it.

2334
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
Let's put it that way.

2335
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,000
All right.

2336
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:46,000
I saw an update the other day that certain titles are coming to Ouya.

2337
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,000
I'm like, Ouya's still around?

2338
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Just a hair shy of 8.6 is what Ouya landed on.

2339
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Okay.

2340
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:54,000
So, okay, there's still a long ways to go before Reading Rainbow.

2341
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,000
You still have 30 days.

2342
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:01,000
I was just shocked at the supermarket today when I looked at the counter of the DVDs they're

2343
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:04,000
trying to hawk it and I was like, Veronica Mars?

2344
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,000
The movie?

2345
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Oh yeah.

2346
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Yeah, that was a thing.

2347
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Oh yeah.

2348
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
All right.

2349
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,000
All right.

2350
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Well, I'd be excited to see a Reading Rainbow app on console.

2351
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Why don't they do this for other PBS programs?

2352
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Because, didn't Sesame Street get enough funding for PBS?

2353
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Sesame Street had a Kinect thing, didn't they?

2354
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
That was one of the big things they were touting with the Kinect for so much.

2355
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Yeah, they had that thing for Sesame Street, but they only did two seasons of it and that

2356
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,000
was it.

2357
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,000
I don't know.

2358
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Maybe it's just my older age, but PBS isn't what I remember.

2359
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:40,000
You know, they don't have Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood or 321 Contact or...

2360
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:41,000
The Electric Company.

2361
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Yeah, the Electric Company or Square One Television.

2362
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:44,000
The Electric Company.

2363
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
That was coming back, though.

2364
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Is it?

2365
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I thought it was.

2366
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Weren't they rebooting it?

2367
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
What does PBS educate the kids with now, besides Sesame Street?

2368
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
PBS is...

2369
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
They're not young enough to be able to answer that question.

2370
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
They've got the Cat in the Hat.

2371
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Wasn't PBS also fucking Barney?

2372
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Barney is on PBS.

2373
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,000
And Lamb Chops.

2374
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Oh, but Lamb Chops.

2375
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Lamb Chops.

2376
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Play along.

2377
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:04,000
She died, though.

2378
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Oh, yeah.

2379
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Well, those socks only last so long.

2380
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Wow.

2381
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:15,000
You're going to special, hell.

2382
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Well done.

2383
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Anyways, so they've got that.

2384
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:22,000
They have Caillou, which teaches the kids about whining.

2385
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:28,000
They've got Dinosaur Train and...

2386
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,000
What other crap does my son watch?

2387
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:32,000
All right.

2388
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Rama says the most funded Kickstarter was the Pebble Watch.

2389
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
10.2 million.

2390
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:43,000
So I guess I lied about the tens of millions backing, but they are on track to shatter

2391
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
this very quickly.

2392
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Interesting.

2393
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Three, two, one, contact came back.

2394
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Get out.

2395
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
I miss Mr. Rogers, though.

2396
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
And you can't recreate Mr. Rogers.

2397
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
You know what else I miss from PBS?

2398
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I'm sorry.

2399
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I'm just making this show longer.

2400
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:03,000
But God dammit, for people like Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross, I'm going to take a moment to

2401
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:07,000
remember, because Bob Ross was the best.

2402
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,000
The best.

2403
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Fluffy white clouds.

2404
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
This old house was awesome.

2405
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:15,000
And as much as I like Norm, though, I do miss Bob Vila doing it.

2406
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
You know what PBS does have, though?

2407
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Downton Abbey.

2408
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
There is that.

2409
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,000
And you know what?

2410
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:22,000
In the Bay Area...

2411
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
It's a BBC show, but PBS has it here.

2412
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,000
And the Bay Area?

2413
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
They had Yen Can Cook.

2414
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Alright.

2415
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Anyway.

2416
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
That's fucking awesome.

2417
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Let's move on.

2418
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Rama in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Square One TV is my jam.

2419
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Oh my God.

2420
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Like, I know we've had our Square...

2421
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:37,000
And, and, and!

2422
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

2423
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Yes.

2424
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,000
And Ghostwriter.

2425
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,000
And...

2426
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,000
I don't know.

2427
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Square One TV brought us MathNet.

2428
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Oh my God.

2429
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:48,000
MathMan.

2430
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,000
MathMan.

2431
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:50,000
MathMan.

2432
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,000
MathMan.

2433
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,000
MathNet was way better.

2434
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,000
MathNet was way better.

2435
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Anyway.

2436
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Alright.

2437
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Let's move on.

2438
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:57,000
We gotta get to the mailbag.

2439
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:04,600
So, thanks to shows like Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and 321 Contact, you can read and you can

2440
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:05,600
write.

2441
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:08,000
And so you've sent us emails.

2442
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Elite Most...

2443
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Two story?

2444
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Most of you can.

2445
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Two story, Rob?

2446
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Yes.

2447
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,000
I've been able to read since I was two.

2448
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Yeah.

2449
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
I was two and a half.

2450
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Yeah.

2451
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Crazy, huh?

2452
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
My first book that I read?

2453
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Like I would probably say actual novel length book was Little House in the Big Woods.

2454
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:28,000
I always...

2455
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
When I was four.

2456
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:33,000
I always look back at like what a smart kid I was and I go, what happened?

2457
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Video games.

2458
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
And on that note, let's get to the mailbag.

2459
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Every week you guys send us emails.

2460
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Participate at Orangelauntrady.com if you want to participate at the show.

2461
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,000
We got a few emails.

2462
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
We have to catch up from a week off.

2463
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
So, I know Dr. Sakai has a few emails tonight.

2464
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
So, let's get to it.

2465
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:50,000
We do.

2466
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,000
We have a few.

2467
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:56,000
The first one is from EA Skizie.

2468
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Wiggity, wiggity, what's up, Orangelauntrady.

2469
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Smile.

2470
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Yep, I'm a huge dork.

2471
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Your Christopher 10 segment was great and I downloaded Baba Yetu as soon as the show

2472
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:06,000
was over.

2473
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,000
The segment prompted me to send some of the music I've been working on to you.

2474
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,000
One song is attached.

2475
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,000
It's free for anybody to listen to use or listen to.

2476
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
So, no worries on the right to whatever.

2477
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:19,000
FYI, I am currently searching for the vocal artists.

2478
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Think back to high school or early college.

2479
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:24,000
What was your first drinking party experience and what was it like?

2480
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Tell us some funny stories of the first time you were inebriated.

2481
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
You know they're usually funny.

2482
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Okay, I'll tell you right now.

2483
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
The first time I was drunk I was two years old.

2484
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Wait, wait, wait.

2485
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Hold on.

2486
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Hold on.

2487
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Wait, which email is this?

2488
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Is this the Skizie one?

2489
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Yeah, Skizie.

2490
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Okay.

2491
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Because I have to play the song while we tell our drunk stories.

2492
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,000
So, this is the song that he attached to the email.

2493
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:49,000
And I can't.

2494
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
How do I change the volume?

2495
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Where did it go?

2496
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Ah.

2497
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Ah.

2498
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Fail.

2499
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Live radio is really hard.

2500
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Hold on.

2501
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:01,000
We've got to start.

2502
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Hold on.

2503
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:03,000
Live radio is really, really hard, you guys.

2504
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:04,000
All right.

2505
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Jamie will tell her story and then I'll get the song.

2506
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:06,000
All right.

2507
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Okay.

2508
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,000
So, yeah.

2509
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:12,000
I was two years old and my mom's boyfriend got me drunk on a couple of beers.

2510
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Anyway, that's where the source of my superpowers came from.

2511
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:21,000
This is how I found out, though, that I can't get hangovers.

2512
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Is I was at my friend Michelle's house and this is, we were in Mississippi.

2513
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Some kind of dumb party.

2514
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:30,000
We were just drinking the whole time.

2515
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:35,000
I had to have been like 19, 20, something like that.

2516
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:40,000
And we were, this is also how I found out that I like to mix really weird things because

2517
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,000
I want to start tasting the alcohol after a certain point.

2518
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
And you've had my concoctions, Rob.

2519
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
You know how far I'll take it.

2520
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Some of them are really good.

2521
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:51,000
So I was just drinking everything.

2522
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
I mean, they put it in front of me.

2523
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,000
That's also how I found out that I hate Jaeger because I didn't realize it was licorice and

2524
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
I hate licorice like a lot.

2525
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:04,000
But I drank some of everything and then I realized I found orange juice in the fridge

2526
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:05,000
so I mixed tequila in it.

2527
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:09,000
What I didn't know is that the orange juice was screwdrivers.

2528
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:17,000
So I took screwdrivers already and added tequila to it and drank two whole pint glasses

2529
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:22,000
full of it along with Everclear shots.

2530
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:27,000
And, um, God, I don't remember what else the fuck I had that night.

2531
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:31,000
And I woke up the next morning hungry.

2532
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
That's how I found out that I don't get hangovers.

2533
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Slow jams starting on this song.

2534
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:39,000
I'm going to take Skeezy's song down here a little bit so I can tell you my story real quick.

2535
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:40,000
I'll make this quick.

2536
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,000
First time I ever drank.

2537
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
One thing, Brad, I'm sorry.

2538
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:46,000
It is physically impossible for me to have a hangover.

2539
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,000
You have no idea.

2540
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
I cannot get a hangover.

2541
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
And I've tried.

2542
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
That sounds like a challenge, though.

2543
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,000
You've seen me.

2544
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Yeah, no, I know.

2545
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I know.

2546
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,000
But I also remember you passed out on the bed demanding waffles or something like that.

2547
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Anyway, that was an early OLR episode.

2548
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Anyway, first time I ever drank was in college, which is where I think a lot of people start

2549
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:08,000
it, although it was shots of Bacardi 151, although I only had a few, so I didn't really

2550
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:09,000
get drunk.

2551
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:13,000
The first time I ever got like super rip roaring drunk was actually I was kind of a late bloomer

2552
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:14,000
in this regard.

2553
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:17,000
The first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience of the 25th anniversary

2554
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Rocky Horror Convention.

2555
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:25,000
I was with Jessica from under station live and I we had a warp core breach.

2556
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
We quote unquote shared a warp core breach.

2557
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:31,000
But that means Jessica had like two sips and I had the rest of the fishbowl.

2558
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
And yeah, I got really, really drunk.

2559
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:38,000
And there's a voicemail I left to Travis because under station live was going at the

2560
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
time.

2561
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:44,000
And Travis still plays that goddamn voicemail on that show to this day.

2562
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
So there you go.

2563
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
And no, I'm not playing it for you here.

2564
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:51,000
You can go check out under station live, although they're on hiatus right now.

2565
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,000
We can check out their old episodes.

2566
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:57,000
And now with that, there's actually a follow up to this, you know, when Jessica and I went

2567
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:02,000
to the Star Trek experience and we had two warp core breaches.

2568
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:06,000
And these people left their warp core breach and we finished it.

2569
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Wow.

2570
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Drinking other people's booze.

2571
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:09,000
That's awful.

2572
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,000
No, they're like, we can't finish it.

2573
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Like alcohol is fucking sterile.

2574
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,000
We'll drink it.

2575
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Do you guys want the rest of our drink?

2576
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Yeah, sure.

2577
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Drink.

2578
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:24,000
So that's where we developed the pattern of going on the ride sober, drinking a lot, then

2579
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,000
going on the ride drunk, then going on the ride while you're sobering.

2580
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:31,000
And I think we called you at that time.

2581
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:32,000
And then we called Travis.

2582
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Yep.

2583
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:37,000
And that was, and we also played DDR on that machine.

2584
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:38,000
All right.

2585
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Easy song has a minute left.

2586
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:43,000
So Jason or Loki, you have an inebriation story to share.

2587
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:48,000
If you're a late bloomer, I'm still gestating because I don't have such stories.

2588
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Really?

2589
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
I have a dream.

2590
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:52,000
E3 is coming up.

2591
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
All right.

2592
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:57,000
And I am going to be surrounded by a hell of a lot of people that I do trust my life

2593
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:58,000
with.

2594
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Loki, anything quickly you want to share?

2595
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Um, I don't know.

2596
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:05,000
I've gotten sick on the show before because I got drunk drinking screwdrivers.

2597
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Actually, I think skeezy, you want to go back in the night.

2598
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
I was making the screwdrivers.

2599
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:10,000
What episode was it?

2600
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:11,000
No, I was making the screwdrivers.

2601
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:14,000
I just kept using the double shot shot glasses.

2602
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,000
It's shot.

2603
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:21,000
So I kept putting too much, um, that I probably shouldn't have had that much minestrone before,

2604
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
you know, coming into the show.

2605
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
It's very acidic.

2606
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Well, we, all right, we have more of the email.

2607
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:28,000
You know how I talk about, sorry.

2608
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Oh, LR was a very, very different show in the earlier days.

2609
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Maybe dark tissue.

2610
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:35,000
You can tell you what episode number it was because Lord knows I forgot, but there's an

2611
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:39,000
episode where we got so, or I got so drunk on air.

2612
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:45,000
We're on air and I'm lying on the ground with the microphone and I'm kicking the wall.

2613
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
I'm kicking the wall going, I'm in the matrix.

2614
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
I'm in the matrix.

2615
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:52,000
And this was somehow a radio show that we did now.

2616
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Was that episode 69 granted?

2617
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
We haven't improved that much.

2618
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:59,000
No, we didn't, we didn't drink on episode 69.

2619
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Some people did.

2620
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,000
It was like one of our anniversary shows.

2621
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:08,000
I remember a party over at that apartment where Shane and I were drinking and watching

2622
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:13,000
all you guys play spin the bottle and we decided to replace the word drunk with dunk because

2623
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:14,000
it was funny.

2624
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:15,000
Yeah.

2625
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Shane.

2626
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Aim red.

2627
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,000
All right.

2628
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Back when I used to make super bacon.

2629
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Rest of the email.

2630
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Rest of the email.

2631
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:23,000
Okay.

2632
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Rest of the email.

2633
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Uh, Oh yeah.

2634
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Once again, love you guys.

2635
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Keep gaming.

2636
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Keep podcasting.

2637
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Keep caring.

2638
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:32,440
Uh, that's from EA skeezy from Wisconsin.

2639
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:34,000
We have a few listeners in Wisconsin.

2640
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:35,000
There you go.

2641
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
He just filled like six or seven minutes of the show.

2642
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
We got to get high.

2643
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Hi.

2644
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:41,000
It's, it's a Swede.

2645
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
We have another Swede.

2646
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Sweet.

2647
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:48,400
I'm going to say, because there's not a name on this, I'm going to say inkblot.

2648
02:47:48,400 --> 02:47:52,000
We need, we need a, we need more places to crash in Sweden.

2649
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Hi.

2650
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Here's some technical reasons for why the Wii U doesn't have GameCube games.

2651
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:00,000
As far as I see it now, this is an older email.

2652
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Okay.

2653
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:04,000
It was, uh, came in the week we were off, but this is what I was referencing earlier.

2654
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Jason was this email.

2655
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Maybe it will interest you and I don't have a question, but I think the situation is pretty

2656
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:10,000
interesting.

2657
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Just a cool thing about the Wii U home brewers have made GameCube ISOs available on Wii U's

2658
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Wii section via devolution on the home brew channel.

2659
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Since Wii and GameCube have the same architecture, the hacker explained it as just showing the

2660
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:27,000
GameCube games the hardware that the GameCube had.

2661
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Uh, just like devoting a portion of the Wii RAM so the memory addresses, uh, addresses

2662
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,000
map the same way as it did on the GameCube.

2663
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,000
It's not emulation.

2664
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Really cool stuff.

2665
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:43,000
It's the same technique Nintendo used for the 3DS's ambassador program, GBA games.

2666
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:48,000
But Nintendo never went forward with this on the 3DS for GBA on Virtual Console since

2667
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,000
it runs off the 3DS's DS hardware.

2668
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:57,000
While it's in DS mode, the actual 3DS hardware is shut off.

2669
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
No street pass, internet browsing, etc.

2670
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:05,000
It's not ideal and Nintendo wants ideal so they would want it to run on the 3DS mode

2671
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:08,000
hardware which would require emulation.

2672
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:14,000
They've had that problem developing such an emulator ergo no GBA 3DS VC games.

2673
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Yeah.

2674
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Um, it's the same situation on Wii U so Nintendo probably won't use the Wii U's capability

2675
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
to run GameCube games almost natively.

2676
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:28,000
If GameCube comes to Wii U, it will probably be an HD rendering emulator from a Swede

2677
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
who listens every week love the show.

2678
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:31,000
Thank you Swede.

2679
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:35,000
I, I am okay with them, um, doing that HD upres and stuff.

2680
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,000
They're not.

2681
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:37,000
They won't.

2682
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Yeah, I know.

2683
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:39,000
You know why?

2684
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Why?

2685
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Because the Wii doesn't upres.

2686
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:42,000
So they're not gonna fuckin' do it.

2687
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Well, if they develop that and they start upresing Wii games, that'd be pretty cool.

2688
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,000
But they're not.

2689
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Why doesn't Nintendo just one up the homebrew community and take some of these things that

2690
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
they do and sell it?

2691
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Oh my god.

2692
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:56,000
I don't know.

2693
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Alright.

2694
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Anyway.

2695
02:49:58,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Thank you for the email.

2696
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Three words.

2697
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Japanese corporate culture.

2698
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Okay.

2699
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:07,260
Dark Tetsuya says, by the way just so you know, first Drunk Show was number 29, after

2700
02:50:07,260 --> 02:50:14,060
that was 33, and after that was number 148, the three year anniversary where Loki's story

2701
02:50:14,060 --> 02:50:15,060
took place.

2702
02:50:15,060 --> 02:50:18,740
So I'm guessing episode 148 was that show I'm thinking of.

2703
02:50:18,740 --> 02:50:21,100
Which is probably in the OL archive somewhere.

2704
02:50:21,100 --> 02:50:23,660
You'll have to, you'll have to come ask Dark Tetsuya for it.

2705
02:50:23,660 --> 02:50:24,660
Now one of these days.

2706
02:50:24,660 --> 02:50:25,660
Lord knows I'm not making that shit.

2707
02:50:25,660 --> 02:50:30,460
One of these days we need to have like a Drunk Show marathon like block where we just have

2708
02:50:30,460 --> 02:50:32,700
all the Drunk Shows playing back to back.

2709
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:34,140
That'd be funny.

2710
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:35,140
Love it.

2711
02:50:35,140 --> 02:50:36,140
Alright.

2712
02:50:36,140 --> 02:50:37,140
Next email.

2713
02:50:37,140 --> 02:50:38,140
Oh yeah.

2714
02:50:38,140 --> 02:50:39,140
Okay.

2715
02:50:39,140 --> 02:50:40,140
Um.

2716
02:50:40,140 --> 02:50:41,140
Hello.

2717
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:42,620
My name is Matt and I am a new listener to OLR.

2718
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:43,620
Hi Matt.

2719
02:50:43,620 --> 02:50:44,620
Hi Matt.

2720
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:48,660
A friend and I started a gaming podcast about two months ago and I have been listening to

2721
02:50:48,660 --> 02:50:50,540
other gaming pods for inspiration.

2722
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:56,780
I have to say by a mile OLR is the best in terms of content I've heard thus far.

2723
02:50:56,780 --> 02:50:59,100
Keep producing great content and I'll keep listening.

2724
02:50:59,100 --> 02:51:00,100
A new listener.

2725
02:51:00,100 --> 02:51:01,100
Matt.

2726
02:51:01,100 --> 02:51:02,100
Thank you Matt.

2727
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:03,100
Get out.

2728
02:51:03,100 --> 02:51:04,100
That's it?

2729
02:51:04,100 --> 02:51:05,100
There's no plug for the show?

2730
02:51:05,100 --> 02:51:06,100
No.

2731
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:09,900
Let us know your information and we will give you a plug-o-rama.

2732
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:10,900
You know what though?

2733
02:51:10,900 --> 02:51:14,640
That's I mean I'm all for plugging other indie shows like that that's not a problem or whatever

2734
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:20,860
but like the fact that he didn't do that like really makes those words genuine in a way

2735
02:51:20,860 --> 02:51:24,520
like it's not just hey I'm gonna kiss your ass you'll promote my show like it's like

2736
02:51:24,520 --> 02:51:26,820
super genuine so thank you.

2737
02:51:26,820 --> 02:51:32,580
That's positive words like that go so far in motivating what we do week after week after

2738
02:51:32,580 --> 02:51:34,300
week so thank you so much.

2739
02:51:34,300 --> 02:51:35,300
You rule.

2740
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:36,300
Yes.

2741
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:42,980
You rule like a lot but but yeah yeah you rule a lot but send us the stuff like I said.

2742
02:51:42,980 --> 02:51:45,620
Good luck with your show but you could do a better job promoting it.

2743
02:51:45,620 --> 02:51:46,620
We'll push.

2744
02:51:46,620 --> 02:51:50,300
That's Orange On Radio tip number one.

2745
02:51:50,300 --> 02:51:51,300
Rab stop.

2746
02:51:51,300 --> 02:51:52,300
Stop it.

2747
02:51:52,300 --> 02:51:54,300
I'm giving him a hard time.

2748
02:51:54,300 --> 02:51:55,300
All right.

2749
02:51:55,300 --> 02:52:04,260
All right so hey guys I'm not a guy found this show during the early years of podcasting

2750
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:09,620
tuned into the latest episode at the time episode 57 one day and have been laughing

2751
02:52:09,620 --> 02:52:11,780
ever since you guys are great.

2752
02:52:11,780 --> 02:52:14,660
Is there a P.O. box where I can send you a gift?

2753
02:52:14,660 --> 02:52:19,100
I recently replaced my old microphone and instead of selling it I thought of O.L.R.

2754
02:52:19,100 --> 02:52:21,940
It's a blue snowball microphone and it needs a home.

2755
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:22,940
Wow.

2756
02:52:22,940 --> 02:52:26,620
I figured what better way to give back to the show that's been with me through the years.

2757
02:52:26,620 --> 02:52:30,340
If not then that's cool too I just wanted to let you guys know to keep up the good work

2758
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:32,020
that comes from Randy.

2759
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:36,220
I will have to contact this person off air so don't delete that email and give that address.

2760
02:52:36,220 --> 02:52:37,860
I don't ever delete the emails anymore.

2761
02:52:37,860 --> 02:52:38,860
Yeah.

2762
02:52:38,860 --> 02:52:39,860
OK.

2763
02:52:39,860 --> 02:52:42,060
Except for the ones that come from marketers that we don't get anymore.

2764
02:52:42,060 --> 02:52:43,060
Yeah.

2765
02:52:43,060 --> 02:52:44,740
So that's awesome.

2766
02:52:44,740 --> 02:52:48,700
I laughed a little bit there because I know another friend of ours Cody said he was going

2767
02:52:48,700 --> 02:52:50,100
to send some mics.

2768
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:55,060
These mics we use right now were donated by Pod Culture and they work great.

2769
02:52:55,060 --> 02:52:56,260
But here's my deal.

2770
02:52:56,260 --> 02:52:59,660
If we get more mics than we can use which I somehow doubt that will happen because I

2771
02:52:59,660 --> 02:53:04,180
know one of these mics is already going bad because they just go through a lot of abuse.

2772
02:53:04,180 --> 02:53:08,380
So I know we can replace but I promise that we'll pay it forward.

2773
02:53:08,380 --> 02:53:11,900
So because I know a lot of podcasters in the Bay Area I don't know a lot but I know enough

2774
02:53:11,900 --> 02:53:16,280
in the Bay Area and they would happily take other mics and things like that.

2775
02:53:16,280 --> 02:53:19,700
So I'm all for like paying it forward and all that.

2776
02:53:19,700 --> 02:53:22,980
So yeah I'm curious to see what mic this might be.

2777
02:53:22,980 --> 02:53:24,460
I'll contact this person off air.

2778
02:53:24,460 --> 02:53:26,580
Thank you very much for the offer.

2779
02:53:26,580 --> 02:53:29,820
I own one of those microphones as a matter of fact.

2780
02:53:29,820 --> 02:53:30,820
Do you?

2781
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:31,820
What are they?

2782
02:53:31,820 --> 02:53:32,820
Are they more hand mics or is that?

2783
02:53:32,820 --> 02:53:37,740
No it's actually it's actually by no means a hand mic because it's literally just a ball.

2784
02:53:37,740 --> 02:53:39,820
It's a it's it's a desktop stand mic.

2785
02:53:39,820 --> 02:53:45,660
It's intended to kind of like be the play setting and it's it's not it is cardioid because

2786
02:53:45,660 --> 02:53:46,660
these are dynamic.

2787
02:53:46,660 --> 02:53:47,660
Yeah.

2788
02:53:47,660 --> 02:53:50,780
Or I always get it backwards but it's intended to just be a desk mic that you have there

2789
02:53:50,780 --> 02:53:54,140
and it picks up enough of the room that you can just talk and yeah it's not a hand mic

2790
02:53:54,140 --> 02:53:55,140
at all.

2791
02:53:55,140 --> 02:53:57,620
I'd love to have on the kitchen counter for when people come in here screaming things

2792
02:53:57,620 --> 02:53:58,940
like Shane tried to do earlier.

2793
02:53:58,940 --> 02:54:00,220
It would be very good for ambient noise.

2794
02:54:00,220 --> 02:54:01,580
Yeah it would be good for that.

2795
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:02,580
Ambient pickups rather.

2796
02:54:02,580 --> 02:54:03,580
That'd be great.

2797
02:54:03,580 --> 02:54:04,580
You guys rule.

2798
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:05,580
You guys don't have to give us anything.

2799
02:54:05,580 --> 02:54:06,580
Just as we say at the end of every show.

2800
02:54:06,580 --> 02:54:07,580
Tacos.

2801
02:54:07,580 --> 02:54:09,040
Tell a listener or two about the show.

2802
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:11,740
You know somebody contacted me on Twitter going how can I send Jamie tacos.

2803
02:54:11,740 --> 02:54:13,940
You know that I got that mail.

2804
02:54:13,940 --> 02:54:21,380
You know actually I really tacos I can't really have them too often because I am eating ketogenic

2805
02:54:21,380 --> 02:54:22,620
because I'm going back to the gym.

2806
02:54:22,620 --> 02:54:23,620
Right.

2807
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:24,620
I thought you said adopt a kitten instead.

2808
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:29,900
Adopt a kitten do that adopt a kitten in my name and take care of this kitten and raise

2809
02:54:29,900 --> 02:54:36,460
her or him with all the love in your heart and get it also contribute to having strays

2810
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:37,460
spayed and neutered.

2811
02:54:37,460 --> 02:54:40,240
And it might love you back when it feels like it.

2812
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:46,320
You might see love in the shape of claws to your face or mid this thing lately is crawling

2813
02:54:46,320 --> 02:54:51,160
up on this on my side like when I'm at my computer chair and like she'll attach with

2814
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:54,560
her claws on the side of my chair and then pat me on my shoulder.

2815
02:54:54,560 --> 02:54:58,200
But sometimes she'll miss and get my armpit like mom.

2816
02:54:58,200 --> 02:54:59,200
Mom love me.

2817
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:00,200
Pet pet.

2818
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:01,200
OK.

2819
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:02,200
I'm done.

2820
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:03,200
Bye.

2821
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:04,200
She fucks off.

2822
02:55:04,200 --> 02:55:06,160
Brad from Pod Culture says that MXL nine ninety I sent will pick up a cat fart from three

2823
02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:07,360
blocks away.

2824
02:55:07,360 --> 02:55:08,360
That is true.

2825
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:11,720
I tried to use that mic and I was like OK this thing is way too sensitive.

2826
02:55:11,720 --> 02:55:12,720
Like I can't.

2827
02:55:12,720 --> 02:55:16,520
It's it's in one of the other boxes in the back room just because I was like I can't

2828
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:19,800
use this because we are all loud ass bitches.

2829
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:21,800
And this thing is going to.

2830
02:55:21,800 --> 02:55:27,360
But I thought I actually was hanging on to it because there is a project in my mind right

2831
02:55:27,360 --> 02:55:32,520
now where that other room is going to get turned into my little twitch lounge.

2832
02:55:32,520 --> 02:55:33,720
So we'll see.

2833
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:34,720
Anyway.

2834
02:55:34,720 --> 02:55:35,720
Dot dot.

2835
02:55:35,720 --> 02:55:36,720
Moving on.

2836
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:37,720
All right.

2837
02:55:37,720 --> 02:55:39,840
Well we have one last email.

2838
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:41,160
Dear OLR.

2839
02:55:41,160 --> 02:55:43,560
You've made a fuck show.

2840
02:55:43,560 --> 02:55:45,200
You've had a marathon episode.

2841
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:47,920
You've definitely had a few drunk shows as well.

2842
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:52,440
My question to the host is what will be the next theme or for lack of a better term gimmick

2843
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:55,240
of the next special episode of OLR.

2844
02:55:55,240 --> 02:55:58,400
Whenever that happens Jason is all the hosts.

2845
02:55:58,400 --> 02:56:01,620
Sky only allowed to speak with his Kermit the Frog voice.

2846
02:56:01,620 --> 02:56:05,860
Randomly censoring yourself as we log OK.

2847
02:56:05,860 --> 02:56:09,160
Randomly censoring yourself with real and or fake fart noises.

2848
02:56:09,160 --> 02:56:11,400
Your audience demands clarity.

2849
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:14,960
Signed the nasty canasta.

2850
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:18,120
Did he say I am all the hosts.

2851
02:56:18,120 --> 02:56:22,280
Yes you take over all of our positions.

2852
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:24,680
Whoo boy that's.

2853
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:28,800
I don't even know like I have the power.

2854
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:29,800
I don't.

2855
02:56:29,800 --> 02:56:32,160
I kind of think that I sound kind of dumb.

2856
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:36,440
So I don't know how you would imitate me.

2857
02:56:36,440 --> 02:56:39,040
I would say my voice.

2858
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:45,360
I would say that for a special theme show.

2859
02:56:45,360 --> 02:56:51,840
I would say the very last show of OLR will be the next theme show.

2860
02:56:57,720 --> 02:56:59,840
We do the pot brownie show.

2861
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:01,920
No no no no.

2862
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:02,920
I'm just kidding.

2863
02:57:02,920 --> 02:57:03,920
By the way.

2864
02:57:03,920 --> 02:57:04,920
Don't panic.

2865
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:05,920
That's my smart ass answer.

2866
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:06,920
The last OLR.

2867
02:57:06,920 --> 02:57:07,920
Don't panic.

2868
02:57:07,920 --> 02:57:10,000
That's our hitchhiker's guide theme show.

2869
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:11,240
We all have towels and toothbrushes.

2870
02:57:11,240 --> 02:57:13,280
Theme shows are what we do with Rocky Horror.

2871
02:57:13,280 --> 02:57:14,280
All right.

2872
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:16,280
We'll do the Rocky Horror OLR show.

2873
02:57:16,280 --> 02:57:20,040
It was great when it all began.

2874
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:24,280
I was a regular vog fan.

2875
02:57:24,280 --> 02:57:26,640
Only if Loki agrees to play Frank N Furter.

2876
02:57:26,640 --> 02:57:29,320
No no no no no no no.

2877
02:57:29,320 --> 02:57:33,320
I veto that because Rob I have seen you in a corset and you were fabulous.

2878
02:57:33,320 --> 02:57:34,320
How do you do I.

2879
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:46,400
See you've met my fabulous unity game.

2880
02:57:46,400 --> 02:57:49,840
I just don't have that much enthusiasm.

2881
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:51,680
I think you'd make a great meatloaf.

2882
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:54,120
I mean you're going to die halfway through the show.

2883
02:57:54,120 --> 02:57:55,120
Yes.

2884
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:56,520
You're using an axe.

2885
02:57:56,520 --> 02:57:57,520
That would be Jason.

2886
02:57:57,520 --> 02:58:00,840
I mean no offense Jason but it would be really funny because he's only here for half of it

2887
02:58:00,840 --> 02:58:03,160
and then he comes back as somebody else.

2888
02:58:03,160 --> 02:58:04,160
That would be it.

2889
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:07,640
No I was Dr. Scott once.

2890
02:58:07,640 --> 02:58:10,120
I flipped off an entire room because I was Dr. Scott.

2891
02:58:10,120 --> 02:58:11,120
There you go.

2892
02:58:11,120 --> 02:58:12,360
That was great.

2893
02:58:12,360 --> 02:58:13,680
The Rocky Horror OLR show.

2894
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:14,680
That's my answer.

2895
02:58:14,680 --> 02:58:15,680
OK.

2896
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:16,680
The Rocky Horror OLR show.

2897
02:58:16,680 --> 02:58:17,680
That's it.

2898
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:18,680
That's it.

2899
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:19,680
At least it's not shock treatment.

2900
02:58:19,680 --> 02:58:20,680
All right.

2901
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:21,680
If you want to.

2902
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:22,680
Oh my God.

2903
02:58:22,680 --> 02:58:23,680
Shock treatment.

2904
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:24,680
Watching that.

2905
02:58:24,680 --> 02:58:25,680
OK.

2906
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:29,840
Evan when Evan lived with Jessica and he made those hacker cookies that like had no doughs

2907
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:32,080
cooked into the cookies.

2908
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:33,080
Oh.

2909
02:58:33,080 --> 02:58:35,280
The OLR baking show.

2910
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:36,280
Yes.

2911
02:58:36,280 --> 02:58:37,840
I can't bake for shit but yes.

2912
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:39,480
The kitchen is right there.

2913
02:58:39,480 --> 02:58:41,520
Oh Alan hates this idea already.

2914
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:44,520
Well I remember when I made lobster on the show.

2915
02:58:44,520 --> 02:58:45,520
I do.

2916
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:46,520
I do.

2917
02:58:46,520 --> 02:58:47,520
Rock lobster.

2918
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:48,520
All right.

2919
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:49,680
9 20 and we're not even at calls yet.

2920
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:52,880
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2921
02:58:52,880 --> 02:58:54,600
Every week we do some FUs of the week.

2922
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:55,600
Why?

2923
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:56,600
Because we're mad.

2924
02:58:56,600 --> 02:59:16,680
Bless you.

2925
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:26,560
I don't know FU too too much stuff too many things that I don't have a name for.

2926
02:59:26,560 --> 02:59:33,480
And apple pie moonshine that I drank a lot of last night and then I started playing

2927
02:59:33,480 --> 02:59:38,720
Final Fantasy 14 because I forgot that I had to go to bed.

2928
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:39,720
All right.

2929
02:59:39,720 --> 02:59:41,060
That it.

2930
02:59:41,060 --> 02:59:47,160
Also FU to how they did the very very very very end thing after X-Men Days of Future

2931
02:59:47,160 --> 02:59:51,200
Past which I'm not going to spoil it for people who haven't seen it but fuck how they did

2932
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:54,600
that because he doesn't look a damn thing like that.

2933
02:59:54,600 --> 02:59:55,600
All right.

2934
02:59:55,640 --> 02:59:56,640
Lowkey.

2935
02:59:56,640 --> 03:00:08,120
I guess FU to trying to call these objects without having Unity Pro or as Unity Pro I

2936
03:00:08,120 --> 03:00:10,120
just say call these objects.

2937
03:00:10,120 --> 03:00:16,120
Unity free I have to come up with some creative solutions and it's a pain in the ass.

2938
03:00:16,120 --> 03:00:17,120
All right.

2939
03:00:17,120 --> 03:00:20,520
My FU of the week just goes to the fact that I am like really really busy this upcoming

2940
03:00:20,520 --> 03:00:25,760
month between E3 and Disney 3 and Rocky Horror at the end of the month and my birthday and

2941
03:00:25,760 --> 03:00:31,160
NSF pride and work where where I have a lot going on at work right now.

2942
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:33,000
Yeah I'm really busy this month.

2943
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:39,880
So if my gaming weeks start to dry up over the next few weeks just stop and also a big

2944
03:00:39,880 --> 03:00:44,920
FU to the fact that I was trying to be a good boy and I went to the gym first time in forever

2945
03:00:44,920 --> 03:00:46,480
over Memorial Day holiday.

2946
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:48,960
I was sore for five days.

2947
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:52,240
I was walking like a rubber band and I know that's a good thing like it's your body making

2948
03:00:52,240 --> 03:00:57,200
the muscle or whatever but me not being able to walk at work is not a good thing.

2949
03:00:57,200 --> 03:00:59,960
So FU to the fact that I'm so fat and out of shape.

2950
03:00:59,960 --> 03:01:00,960
Jason.

2951
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:05,240
Yeah that makes three out of the four of us FU to time.

2952
03:01:05,240 --> 03:01:08,560
Hey time not out of shape you know that's technically true for me too.

2953
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:11,040
But I'm really good about that and I am losing weight for Amy.

2954
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:12,320
That's not what this segment is for.

2955
03:01:12,320 --> 03:01:13,960
Yeah FU to time.

2956
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:20,040
I was I felt strapped for time getting set for this latest trip because I had what five

2957
03:01:20,040 --> 03:01:24,640
things to plan for and four of them have finished at this point.

2958
03:01:24,640 --> 03:01:31,080
And so the last thing is B3 and then getting home and then coming back for a week later.

2959
03:01:31,080 --> 03:01:32,080
Wish I were doing it.

2960
03:01:32,080 --> 03:01:33,080
Sort of.

2961
03:01:33,080 --> 03:01:36,680
All right there it is your FUs of the week although I do want to mention this from our

2962
03:01:36,680 --> 03:01:40,120
chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because it didn't come up in the show elsewhere.

2963
03:01:40,120 --> 03:01:43,560
Blender says FU'd and B Davis dying.

2964
03:01:43,560 --> 03:01:44,880
That is true.

2965
03:01:44,880 --> 03:01:51,840
Alice from the Brady Bunch their homemaker or whatever was died today.

2966
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:55,280
Although I'm going to admit like I don't want to sound crass or rude but it was one of those

2967
03:01:55,280 --> 03:01:58,800
things where when they announced it I said she wasn't already dead.

2968
03:01:58,800 --> 03:01:59,800
You know I just.

2969
03:01:59,800 --> 03:02:00,800
Oh she was still alive.

2970
03:02:00,800 --> 03:02:02,840
But unfortunately people disappear like that.

2971
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:03,840
You know.

2972
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:04,840
Anyway.

2973
03:02:04,840 --> 03:02:06,440
But rest in peace.

2974
03:02:06,440 --> 03:02:09,840
I grew up on the Brady Bunch reruns as I'm sure a lot of other people did.

2975
03:02:10,120 --> 03:02:11,120
All right.

2976
03:02:11,120 --> 03:02:15,160
Just a couple quick stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1 8 7 7 game OLR it's

2977
03:02:15,160 --> 03:02:18,320
going to be a quick Skype line tonight because we're running way over it's almost 930 on

2978
03:02:18,320 --> 03:02:19,320
the West Coast.

2979
03:02:19,320 --> 03:02:20,320
So Loki.

2980
03:02:20,320 --> 03:02:21,320
All right.

2981
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:30,040
So EA has basically come to a settlement agreement with the whole NCAA football and basketball

2982
03:02:30,040 --> 03:02:34,720
thing where they were basically having the college students in the game but not actually

2983
03:02:34,720 --> 03:02:38,200
paying for them to be in the game.

2984
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:42,800
So it's in the game except you're not getting paid for it.

2985
03:02:42,800 --> 03:02:43,800
Yeah.

2986
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:49,480
So now they have to pay almost a thousand dollars per college athlete in the game.

2987
03:02:49,480 --> 03:02:54,780
So that's not really much compensation considering that they've made a lot of money in that.

2988
03:02:54,780 --> 03:02:58,280
But well.

2989
03:02:58,280 --> 03:03:02,280
Thousand dollars per student I guess is still a bit of money.

2990
03:03:02,280 --> 03:03:05,080
It's quite quite another.

2991
03:03:05,080 --> 03:03:06,240
All right.

2992
03:03:06,280 --> 03:03:12,160
Lastly there was a little bit of excitement over and not an announcement but basically

2993
03:03:12,160 --> 03:03:16,040
a revealed rating so to speak on Germany's rating board.

2994
03:03:16,040 --> 03:03:21,720
It was a rating for a game called Gianna sisters versus Super Meat Boy which instantly brought

2995
03:03:21,720 --> 03:03:24,720
all those thoughts to people's heads like oh there could be a game where like the two

2996
03:03:24,720 --> 03:03:28,040
of them kind of because you know they're both platforming games they're both indie they're

2997
03:03:28,040 --> 03:03:32,760
both fun and the thought was that oh they maybe you're going to do like a mashup type

2998
03:03:32,760 --> 03:03:33,760
of game.

2999
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:34,760
That would be a lot of fun.

3000
03:03:34,800 --> 03:03:38,880
I know people are running rampant about oh is this like an E3 thing or what but no no

3001
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:39,960
it actually isn't.

3002
03:03:39,960 --> 03:03:45,280
A press release from Head Up Games confirms that what this is it's just a bundle of Gianna

3003
03:03:45,280 --> 03:03:47,880
Sisters Twisted Dreams and Super Meat Boy.

3004
03:03:47,880 --> 03:03:52,060
It's only available in Germany at least right now on June 26th.

3005
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:54,520
My birthday is when this is coming out.

3006
03:03:54,520 --> 03:03:58,560
So it is a repackaging of two other great I mean they are good games that are worth

3007
03:03:58,560 --> 03:04:03,840
your time if you somehow haven't already played them but maybe they were out a little later

3008
03:04:03,840 --> 03:04:05,240
in Germany I don't know.

3009
03:04:05,240 --> 03:04:07,560
So there you go.

3010
03:04:07,560 --> 03:04:08,560
That does it.

3011
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:11,460
So we're going to open up the Skype line to take your calls.

3012
03:04:11,460 --> 03:04:16,880
It's that time 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio if you wish to

3013
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:19,320
give us a call we will set that up.

3014
03:04:19,320 --> 03:04:23,720
I got to make sure that the calls can actually come through tonight so we'll set that up.

3015
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:27,640
Okay so 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us

3016
03:04:27,640 --> 03:04:29,160
a call.

3017
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:31,480
Meanwhile last minute stories if we have any.

3018
03:04:31,480 --> 03:04:32,480
Loki?

3019
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:33,480
Nope.

3020
03:04:33,480 --> 03:04:36,400
I do have one that flew under the radar last week.

3021
03:04:36,400 --> 03:04:40,940
There was an announcement that Samsung and Oculus VR are entering a partnership.

3022
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:46,160
The quick version is that Oculus gives Samsung early access to its mobile software development

3023
03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:50,540
kit and helps develop user interface software while Samsung gives Oculus early access to

3024
03:04:50,540 --> 03:04:55,160
its next-gen OLED screens because Samsung is joining the race without having to do the

3025
03:04:55,160 --> 03:04:56,160
hard work.

3026
03:04:56,160 --> 03:04:58,920
Let's go to the phones.

3027
03:04:58,920 --> 03:04:59,920
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3028
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:00,920
Who's this?

3029
03:05:01,360 --> 03:05:02,360
Hey it's Ron.

3030
03:05:02,360 --> 03:05:03,360
How's everyone doing tonight?

3031
03:05:03,360 --> 03:05:04,360
Of course it is.

3032
03:05:04,360 --> 03:05:05,360
Rama.

3033
03:05:05,360 --> 03:05:06,360
How you doing Rama?

3034
03:05:06,360 --> 03:05:07,360
We're good.

3035
03:05:07,360 --> 03:05:10,840
And sorry we weren't here last week for you to call first.

3036
03:05:10,840 --> 03:05:11,840
It's quite alright.

3037
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:15,440
I found myself doing other things like you know catching up with stuff on the DVR.

3038
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:18,600
I've been sitting on my DVR since summer of 2013.

3039
03:05:18,600 --> 03:05:22,840
I figured that's what a lot of people were making out of the holidays so what's up?

3040
03:05:22,840 --> 03:05:23,840
Not much.

3041
03:05:23,840 --> 03:05:26,920
I want to talk about something slightly different and I'll be on my merry little way.

3042
03:05:26,920 --> 03:05:27,920
Okay.

3043
03:05:28,920 --> 03:05:29,920
Um.

3044
03:05:29,920 --> 03:05:30,920
Rhythm games.

3045
03:05:30,920 --> 03:05:32,920
Let's talk about that.

3046
03:05:32,920 --> 03:05:34,920
Of course.

3047
03:05:34,920 --> 03:05:40,800
I recently stumbled upon a game for Android which is also available for iOS called Love

3048
03:05:40,800 --> 03:05:42,960
Live School Idol Project.

3049
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:43,960
Okay.

3050
03:05:43,960 --> 03:05:48,080
Also you can get it in the US on the download stores as Idol Project.

3051
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:54,600
Pretty much you are a manager of an idol group and people ask to join and you train with

3052
03:05:54,600 --> 03:05:55,600
them.

3053
03:05:55,600 --> 03:06:00,880
You train with them with the music and what it is is all of the members of the band which

3054
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:05,480
I believe is about nine of them and these circles come down from the center and you

3055
03:06:05,480 --> 03:06:09,800
just tap the screen you know for perfect timing.

3056
03:06:09,800 --> 03:06:17,040
It's sort of like the timing plays sort of similar to the Sega musical games like K-On!

3057
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:18,040
and Project Diva.

3058
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:19,040
Right.

3059
03:06:19,040 --> 03:06:20,040
Hatsune Miku.

3060
03:06:20,040 --> 03:06:21,040
Sure.

3061
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:24,040
It's pretty fun and as you play the songs you go back into the story mode.

3062
03:06:24,040 --> 03:06:27,560
You discover more characters, more people that want to join and then you go back into

3063
03:06:27,560 --> 03:06:34,320
the game mode and you play the songs again to increase your combination, earn points

3064
03:06:34,320 --> 03:06:36,720
and raise the idols levels.

3065
03:06:36,720 --> 03:06:42,080
And you can do special practices where as you collect members of your team they're like

3066
03:06:42,080 --> 03:06:43,080
trading cards.

3067
03:06:43,080 --> 03:06:47,240
You can merge the cards together and get a better character and train off of that.

3068
03:06:47,240 --> 03:06:48,240
It's kind of fun.

3069
03:06:48,240 --> 03:06:52,400
Now AkumaJP in chat says Idol Master and yeah that does kind of sound like what you're describing

3070
03:06:52,400 --> 03:06:58,040
here is kind of like a IOS version of that probably like a knockoff in a way.

3071
03:06:58,040 --> 03:07:02,600
Something like that but it is actually based off the anime Love Live school idol project.

3072
03:07:02,600 --> 03:07:03,600
Got it.

3073
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:08,120
It's kind of might be from the same people but I do know what's kind of interesting is

3074
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:11,720
that one of the companies that's behind this is ASCII media.

3075
03:07:11,720 --> 03:07:16,320
The same company that had ASCIIware, same company made those awesome ASCII sticks back

3076
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:18,320
in the day.

3077
03:07:18,320 --> 03:07:19,320
Wow.

3078
03:07:19,320 --> 03:07:20,560
Interesting how far these companies have come.

3079
03:07:20,560 --> 03:07:23,960
It's so interesting to see like who all's gone mobile because the answer is like everybody

3080
03:07:23,960 --> 03:07:28,480
except like Nintendo and even Nintendo is finally going to do what Miiverse or something.

3081
03:07:28,480 --> 03:07:31,960
So I wonder if that'll happen during E3.

3082
03:07:31,960 --> 03:07:32,960
Anyway.

3083
03:07:32,960 --> 03:07:33,960
OK.

3084
03:07:33,960 --> 03:07:34,960
Well that's cool.

3085
03:07:34,960 --> 03:07:35,960
So so you enjoy the game.

3086
03:07:35,960 --> 03:07:36,960
Is it worth it.

3087
03:07:36,960 --> 03:07:37,960
How much is it.

3088
03:07:37,960 --> 03:07:38,960
It's free.

3089
03:07:38,960 --> 03:07:39,960
Really.

3090
03:07:39,960 --> 03:07:41,720
Oh so they must make the money off some of the cards and these other enhancements right.

3091
03:07:41,720 --> 03:07:44,960
It's like buying gems and other items to raise your characters.

3092
03:07:44,960 --> 03:07:48,960
But to be perfectly honest you really don't need to do any in-app purchases.

3093
03:07:48,960 --> 03:07:50,200
Just play the game through.

3094
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:52,180
How's the music in it though.

3095
03:07:52,180 --> 03:07:53,280
It's very cute.

3096
03:07:53,280 --> 03:07:56,600
It's very anime J-Poppy which is kind of a given.

3097
03:07:56,600 --> 03:07:57,600
Of course.

3098
03:07:57,600 --> 03:07:58,600
Of course.

3099
03:07:58,600 --> 03:07:59,600
All right.

3100
03:07:59,600 --> 03:08:01,600
Well thank you for the review and introducing some of our listeners to that.

3101
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:04,180
I might have to check that out myself.

3102
03:08:04,180 --> 03:08:07,200
You should because there's like three four of us on Facebook that are playing.

3103
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:09,200
We've already traded our friend IDs.

3104
03:08:09,200 --> 03:08:12,520
So we're trying to help each other out as we're playing through the game so you should

3105
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:13,520
join us.

3106
03:08:13,520 --> 03:08:14,520
All right.

3107
03:08:14,520 --> 03:08:15,520
One more time the name.

3108
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:18,500
The name of the anime is called Love Life School Idol Project.

3109
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:24,580
You can find it on iTunes Store and Google Play as Idol Project or School Project.

3110
03:08:24,580 --> 03:08:25,580
All right.

3111
03:08:25,580 --> 03:08:26,580
Idol Project.

3112
03:08:26,580 --> 03:08:27,580
I'll look for that.

3113
03:08:27,580 --> 03:08:28,580
You got it.

3114
03:08:28,580 --> 03:08:29,580
If not just find a school project.

3115
03:08:29,580 --> 03:08:34,260
If I have to I will post a link to where you can get it from whatever version of the mobile

3116
03:08:34,260 --> 03:08:36,680
system that you have.

3117
03:08:36,680 --> 03:08:37,680
I'm trying to look at it.

3118
03:08:37,680 --> 03:08:40,340
I have my handy dandy little iPhone.

3119
03:08:40,340 --> 03:08:45,740
See it might be under School Project.

3120
03:08:45,740 --> 03:08:46,740
I'm looking right now.

3121
03:08:46,740 --> 03:08:51,740
I'm going to search for school project and it's not the end look up school.

3122
03:08:51,740 --> 03:08:52,740
I know.

3123
03:08:52,740 --> 03:08:53,740
Shit.

3124
03:08:53,740 --> 03:08:54,740
I was in the music store.

3125
03:08:54,740 --> 03:09:00,180
I hate how there's the two separate stores I mean I get why they do it but OK so school

3126
03:09:00,180 --> 03:09:03,000
Idol Festival Jax.

3127
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:11,300
This is great radio but hey free game y'all schools of chaos school Idol Festival that's

3128
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:12,300
not it right.

3129
03:09:12,300 --> 03:09:13,300
Oh that's it.

3130
03:09:13,300 --> 03:09:14,300
Mm hmm.

3131
03:09:14,300 --> 03:09:15,300
OK.

3132
03:09:15,300 --> 03:09:16,300
School Idol Festival.

3133
03:09:16,860 --> 03:09:20,500
Yeah they had to change the name because the actual anime series has not been licensed

3134
03:09:20,500 --> 03:09:21,500
here just yet.

3135
03:09:21,500 --> 03:09:22,500
All the way.

3136
03:09:22,500 --> 03:09:24,500
So you know.

3137
03:09:24,500 --> 03:09:25,500
Sounds good.

3138
03:09:25,500 --> 03:09:28,260
I imagine you guys talked a lot about this on anime jam session.

3139
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:29,260
Actually no.

3140
03:09:29,260 --> 03:09:32,540
I started playing this like a few days ago on occasion but I may have to bring it up

3141
03:09:32,540 --> 03:09:37,340
because it is fun and I've noticed a few of my friends one of the reason why they're upgrading

3142
03:09:37,340 --> 03:09:41,620
their Android is just so they can have something powerful enough so they can play this game.

3143
03:09:41,620 --> 03:09:42,620
Love it.

3144
03:09:42,620 --> 03:09:43,620
All right.

3145
03:09:43,620 --> 03:09:44,620
All right.

3146
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:45,620
Rama.

3147
03:09:45,620 --> 03:09:46,620
Here are the thoughts before I let you go.

3148
03:09:46,620 --> 03:09:47,620
No that's it.

3149
03:09:47,620 --> 03:09:51,900
But I left you a message because I have a I have some stuff to send you.

3150
03:09:51,900 --> 03:09:52,900
Oh OK.

3151
03:09:52,900 --> 03:09:53,900
I'm a little behind.

3152
03:09:53,900 --> 03:09:54,900
Oh I just see my little red.

3153
03:09:54,900 --> 03:09:55,900
OK.

3154
03:09:55,900 --> 03:09:56,900
You got it.

3155
03:09:56,900 --> 03:09:57,900
I will send that right away.

3156
03:09:57,900 --> 03:09:58,900
Awesome.

3157
03:09:58,900 --> 03:09:59,900
Thanks a lot bro.

3158
03:09:59,900 --> 03:10:00,900
Bye.

3159
03:10:00,900 --> 03:10:01,900
I love how people use the Skype line.

3160
03:10:01,900 --> 03:10:04,820
Hey check your private messages.

3161
03:10:04,820 --> 03:10:07,740
Sorry I'm trying to do a show live radio is kind of hard.

3162
03:10:07,740 --> 03:10:09,140
You know it's a little bit difficult.

3163
03:10:09,140 --> 03:10:10,420
You said it was hard.

3164
03:10:10,420 --> 03:10:11,420
Shush.

3165
03:10:11,420 --> 03:10:12,420
Shush.

3166
03:10:12,420 --> 03:10:18,100
1 8 7 7 game OLR username on Skype orange lounge radio.

3167
03:10:18,100 --> 03:10:21,020
Many other last minute stories Jason.

3168
03:10:21,020 --> 03:10:24,380
All right.

3169
03:10:24,380 --> 03:10:31,260
Who is going to use a VR headset for a mobile phone.

3170
03:10:31,260 --> 03:10:33,300
I just.

3171
03:10:33,300 --> 03:10:38,700
The same people who buy the 3DS version of Skylanders.

3172
03:10:38,700 --> 03:10:41,220
Like why would you haul around that big portal and things everywhere.

3173
03:10:41,260 --> 03:10:43,140
I don't understand.

3174
03:10:43,140 --> 03:10:44,860
You don't.

3175
03:10:44,860 --> 03:10:45,860
You don't.

3176
03:10:45,860 --> 03:10:46,860
No you don't.

3177
03:10:46,860 --> 03:10:47,860
I thought you had to.

3178
03:10:47,860 --> 03:10:48,860
You load your character.

3179
03:10:48,860 --> 03:10:52,100
It has like so many slots of characters you can store so you put a few characters in there

3180
03:10:52,100 --> 03:10:53,100
you swap between them.

3181
03:10:53,100 --> 03:10:54,100
All right.

3182
03:10:54,100 --> 03:10:55,100
That makes a little more sense.

3183
03:10:55,100 --> 03:11:00,040
The Oculus thing with the phone is it's for stuff we haven't thought of yet or stuff they

3184
03:11:00,040 --> 03:11:02,420
haven't thought of yet as far as using Oculus Rift.

3185
03:11:02,420 --> 03:11:06,940
But when you can't see the phone like there's no you need another sensor to know where the

3186
03:11:06,940 --> 03:11:07,940
hell you're.

3187
03:11:07,940 --> 03:11:11,740
But if you're able to interact with it like you can with like Google Glass or something

3188
03:11:11,740 --> 03:11:16,780
like that there is currently no input mechanism in the in the Oculus currently and that's

3189
03:11:16,780 --> 03:11:17,780
your whole point.

3190
03:11:17,780 --> 03:11:18,780
OK.

3191
03:11:18,780 --> 03:11:19,780
One more.

3192
03:11:19,780 --> 03:11:21,860
I'm going to put one more call out for the Skype line 1 8 7 7 game OLR username on Skype

3193
03:11:21,860 --> 03:11:22,860
orange launch radio.

3194
03:11:22,860 --> 03:11:26,380
I know I know dark soccer is leaving the studio because we're all running a little long she's

3195
03:11:26,380 --> 03:11:27,660
got other things she's got to get to.

3196
03:11:27,660 --> 03:11:29,860
But final thoughts for our listeners tonight.

3197
03:11:29,860 --> 03:11:30,860
Al.

3198
03:11:30,860 --> 03:11:31,860
Al.

3199
03:11:31,860 --> 03:11:32,860
Yeah.

3200
03:11:32,860 --> 03:11:35,220
I'm going to take.

3201
03:11:35,220 --> 03:11:37,180
Take medication when I get home.

3202
03:11:37,220 --> 03:11:38,220
All right.

3203
03:11:38,220 --> 03:11:39,220
If you need a band aid I have those two.

3204
03:11:39,220 --> 03:11:40,220
All right.

3205
03:11:40,220 --> 03:11:41,220
I don't know if you can put a band aid on my brain.

3206
03:11:41,220 --> 03:11:42,220
Oh no.

3207
03:11:42,220 --> 03:11:43,220
Feel better.

3208
03:11:43,220 --> 03:11:45,220
Tomorrow's a work day.

3209
03:11:45,220 --> 03:11:46,220
Alas.

3210
03:11:46,220 --> 03:11:47,220
Yeah.

3211
03:11:47,220 --> 03:11:48,220
No.

3212
03:11:48,220 --> 03:11:49,220
No more three day weekends.

3213
03:11:49,220 --> 03:11:50,220
I miss those.

3214
03:11:50,220 --> 03:11:51,220
All right.

3215
03:11:51,220 --> 03:11:52,220
It looks like we do have at least one more call coming in.

3216
03:11:52,220 --> 03:11:53,220
So let's get to it.

3217
03:11:53,220 --> 03:11:54,220
Have a great night.

3218
03:11:54,220 --> 03:11:55,220
Dark soccer soccer.

3219
03:11:55,220 --> 03:11:56,220
We'll see you next week for our preval E3 special.

3220
03:11:56,220 --> 03:11:57,220
The preval show.

3221
03:11:57,220 --> 03:11:58,220
All right.

3222
03:11:58,220 --> 03:11:59,220
Let's get to it.

3223
03:11:59,220 --> 03:12:00,220
Hi.

3224
03:12:00,220 --> 03:12:01,220
You're on orange lounge radio.

3225
03:12:01,220 --> 03:12:02,220
Who's this.

3226
03:12:02,220 --> 03:12:03,220
Hey it's blender.

3227
03:12:03,220 --> 03:12:04,220
Hey blender.

3228
03:12:04,220 --> 03:12:05,220
Long time no talk.

3229
03:12:05,220 --> 03:12:06,220
How you doing.

3230
03:12:06,260 --> 03:12:09,260
I actually moved out to Nashville Tennessee.

3231
03:12:09,260 --> 03:12:12,260
Not in California anymore.

3232
03:12:12,260 --> 03:12:16,260
I was in Nashville when I was 17 years old for one whole day.

3233
03:12:16,260 --> 03:12:18,260
Oh really.

3234
03:12:18,260 --> 03:12:19,260
Yeah.

3235
03:12:19,260 --> 03:12:20,260
I imagine it's changed a lot.

3236
03:12:20,260 --> 03:12:22,260
We went to Graceland and signed.

3237
03:12:22,260 --> 03:12:24,260
I remember writing something on the wall.

3238
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:26,260
Where all those messages were to Elvis.

3239
03:12:26,260 --> 03:12:28,260
And that's all I remember.

3240
03:12:28,260 --> 03:12:29,260
And show no's.

3241
03:12:29,260 --> 03:12:30,260
Yeah.

3242
03:12:30,260 --> 03:12:31,260
That's cool.

3243
03:12:31,260 --> 03:12:32,260
Yeah.

3244
03:12:32,260 --> 03:12:34,260
So what's up buddy.

3245
03:12:34,300 --> 03:12:35,300
No.

3246
03:12:35,300 --> 03:12:37,300
I was telling you.

3247
03:12:37,300 --> 03:12:38,300
Well.

3248
03:12:38,300 --> 03:12:39,300
You know the situation.

3249
03:12:39,300 --> 03:12:40,300
You know I've talked about it.

3250
03:12:40,300 --> 03:12:41,300
You guys.

3251
03:12:41,300 --> 03:12:45,300
I was a home caregiver for my grandparents for 12 years.

3252
03:12:45,300 --> 03:12:46,300
Right.

3253
03:12:46,300 --> 03:12:48,300
And unfortunately they passed away last month.

3254
03:12:48,300 --> 03:12:54,300
And I actually passed through Salt Lake City.

3255
03:12:54,300 --> 03:12:56,300
A couple days before I left.

3256
03:12:56,300 --> 03:12:57,300
Right.

3257
03:12:57,300 --> 03:12:59,300
And they had the Salt Lake City Comic Con.

3258
03:12:59,300 --> 03:13:00,300
And I went through there.

3259
03:13:00,300 --> 03:13:03,300
Oh how was that.

3260
03:13:03,340 --> 03:13:05,340
That was freaking awesome man.

3261
03:13:05,340 --> 03:13:07,340
They had everybody there.

3262
03:13:07,340 --> 03:13:08,340
Yeah.

3263
03:13:08,340 --> 03:13:13,340
I had a couple friends that actually were running the thing.

3264
03:13:13,340 --> 03:13:17,340
And they had over 100,000 people shut up for that weekend.

3265
03:13:17,340 --> 03:13:18,340
Holy moly.

3266
03:13:18,340 --> 03:13:19,340
But.

3267
03:13:19,340 --> 03:13:20,340
Yeah.

3268
03:13:20,340 --> 03:13:23,340
It's the third biggest Comic Con in the country right now.

3269
03:13:23,340 --> 03:13:24,340
Is it really.

3270
03:13:24,340 --> 03:13:25,340
You know.

3271
03:13:25,340 --> 03:13:27,340
I am and I'm not surprised to hear that.

3272
03:13:27,340 --> 03:13:29,340
Because there's a part of you that kind of goes.

3273
03:13:29,340 --> 03:13:30,340
Or of me anyway.

3274
03:13:30,340 --> 03:13:31,340
That kind of goes.

3275
03:13:31,380 --> 03:13:33,380
Well what the hell is there in Salt Lake City.

3276
03:13:33,380 --> 03:13:34,380
Like who knew there were that many people.

3277
03:13:34,380 --> 03:13:35,380
But at the same time.

3278
03:13:35,380 --> 03:13:36,380
Yeah.

3279
03:13:36,380 --> 03:13:41,380
Like you know there's a lot of very small remote areas just for hundreds of miles.

3280
03:13:41,380 --> 03:13:45,380
Like Salt Lake City really is the biggest city for hundreds of miles in any direction.

3281
03:13:45,380 --> 03:13:46,380
I mean it really is.

3282
03:13:46,380 --> 03:13:47,380
Yeah.

3283
03:13:47,380 --> 03:13:48,380
Salt Lake City is huge.

3284
03:13:48,380 --> 03:13:49,380
Like when I think about.

3285
03:13:49,380 --> 03:13:50,380
Yeah.

3286
03:13:50,380 --> 03:13:51,380
I went in there on a whim.

3287
03:13:51,380 --> 03:13:52,380
I was just like well.

3288
03:13:52,380 --> 03:13:53,380
Because I knew the guys.

3289
03:13:53,380 --> 03:13:54,380
Because I listened to you guys.

3290
03:13:54,380 --> 03:13:58,380
And I listened to the guys who used to podcast back in 2010.

3291
03:13:58,380 --> 03:13:59,380
Right.

3292
03:13:59,420 --> 03:14:03,420
Their first year was like 10,000 people shut up.

3293
03:14:03,420 --> 03:14:05,420
And then boom.

3294
03:14:05,420 --> 03:14:08,420
2014 they had 100,000 people shut up.

3295
03:14:08,420 --> 03:14:09,420
Wow.

3296
03:14:09,420 --> 03:14:11,420
And I walked in the front door and there's like a line.

3297
03:14:11,420 --> 03:14:13,420
And I'm like who's this?

3298
03:14:13,420 --> 03:14:15,420
Line for it.

3299
03:14:15,420 --> 03:14:17,420
Nathan fill in right there.

3300
03:14:17,420 --> 03:14:19,420
Just walked in.

3301
03:14:19,420 --> 03:14:20,420
That's awesome.

3302
03:14:20,420 --> 03:14:21,420
Yeah.

3303
03:14:21,420 --> 03:14:23,420
I mean it was a huge turnout.

3304
03:14:23,420 --> 03:14:25,420
I mean they're having another one in September.

3305
03:14:25,420 --> 03:14:26,420
I'm not plugging anything.

3306
03:14:26,460 --> 03:14:27,460
But I'm just saying.

3307
03:14:27,460 --> 03:14:32,460
The thing that I found about it was it's like the middle of the country.

3308
03:14:32,460 --> 03:14:33,460
So you don't have to go.

3309
03:14:33,460 --> 03:14:34,460
Yeah.

3310
03:14:34,460 --> 03:14:35,460
Well not middle.

3311
03:14:35,460 --> 03:14:41,460
But you know if you're on the east coast and you want to go.

3312
03:14:41,460 --> 03:14:43,460
You know for the right convention.

3313
03:14:43,460 --> 03:14:45,460
You don't have to travel all the way to Anaheim.

3314
03:14:45,460 --> 03:14:47,460
For the right convention there's always time for travel.

3315
03:14:47,460 --> 03:14:50,460
Because I go to Atlanta for Dragon Con.

3316
03:14:50,460 --> 03:14:53,460
I had a blast last year and already got my ticket for this year.

3317
03:14:53,460 --> 03:14:57,460
So it's awesome to hear that you had a good time at the convention.

3318
03:14:57,460 --> 03:15:01,460
I'm sorry to hear about the circumstance that kind of had you moving from one coast to the other.

3319
03:15:01,460 --> 03:15:02,460
But you know.

3320
03:15:02,460 --> 03:15:04,460
But now that you're back in.

3321
03:15:04,460 --> 03:15:07,460
Or now that you're in Nashville have you been doing any gaming?

3322
03:15:07,460 --> 03:15:09,460
Is there any games that you're into?

3323
03:15:09,460 --> 03:15:12,460
You know I'm getting at a lot of board gaming man.

3324
03:15:12,460 --> 03:15:14,460
I got a six year old nephew.

3325
03:15:14,460 --> 03:15:18,460
And so I'm getting at all these little board gaming.

3326
03:15:18,460 --> 03:15:20,460
You know just because he's into baseball.

3327
03:15:20,460 --> 03:15:24,460
And you know I'm trying to teach him a little bit more about strategic stuff.

3328
03:15:24,460 --> 03:15:27,460
You know so he's learning a lot more about.

3329
03:15:27,460 --> 03:15:29,460
You know and just sitting down on the table.

3330
03:15:29,460 --> 03:15:32,460
And just let's think about what we're doing here.

3331
03:15:32,460 --> 03:15:36,460
I don't think we give board games enough credit here on OLR.

3332
03:15:36,460 --> 03:15:38,460
And that you know we don't talk about that enough.

3333
03:15:38,460 --> 03:15:41,460
And board games are awesome.

3334
03:15:41,460 --> 03:15:43,460
Like who doesn't enjoy a good board game night.

3335
03:15:43,460 --> 03:15:45,460
Like what a fun way to hang out with friends.

3336
03:15:45,460 --> 03:15:48,460
And I've been introduced to a lot of like fun ones lately.

3337
03:15:48,460 --> 03:15:50,460
Like I like well this isn't really a board game.

3338
03:15:50,460 --> 03:15:53,460
But a Dominion was one that Xtover's partner introduced me to.

3339
03:15:53,460 --> 03:15:55,460
That I had a lot of fun with that.

3340
03:15:55,460 --> 03:15:56,460
It's more of a card game I suppose.

3341
03:15:56,460 --> 03:15:57,460
But that's a lot of fun.

3342
03:15:57,460 --> 03:15:59,460
And yeah yeah.

3343
03:15:59,460 --> 03:16:03,460
What's one board game we here at OLR ought to check out?

3344
03:16:03,460 --> 03:16:05,460
I'll tell you what.

3345
03:16:05,460 --> 03:16:08,460
You know the best thing and it's something you guys can sit down and play.

3346
03:16:08,460 --> 03:16:10,460
While you're doing a show.

3347
03:16:10,460 --> 03:16:12,460
It's called Zombie Dice.

3348
03:16:12,460 --> 03:16:15,460
And you can buy it at Target for like ten bucks.

3349
03:16:15,460 --> 03:16:17,460
I've heard of this.

3350
03:16:17,460 --> 03:16:19,460
Somebody showed this to me once.

3351
03:16:19,460 --> 03:16:22,460
Tell it quickly because I got to wrap up here soon for time.

3352
03:16:22,460 --> 03:16:24,460
But quickly what is Zombie Dice?

3353
03:16:24,460 --> 03:16:29,460
Well it's just like a bar dice game.

3354
03:16:29,460 --> 03:16:31,460
Like liar's dice or whatever.

3355
03:16:31,460 --> 03:16:33,460
But you know you just roll your dice.

3356
03:16:33,460 --> 03:16:35,460
And you're apparently the zombie.

3357
03:16:35,460 --> 03:16:40,460
And you either roll a brain, a shotgun, or feet.

3358
03:16:40,460 --> 03:16:44,460
And whoever gets scored a 13 wins the game.

3359
03:16:44,460 --> 03:16:51,460
And the cool thing about it is like my sister had to do some laundry at the laundromat the other day.

3360
03:16:51,460 --> 03:16:57,460
And me and my nephew sat at the laundromat and rolled out the Zombie Dice and started playing right there.

3361
03:16:57,460 --> 03:17:00,460
And everybody else is like what the heck are these people doing?

3362
03:17:00,460 --> 03:17:02,460
But we're just having fun down at the laundromat.

3363
03:17:02,460 --> 03:17:04,460
That's great.

3364
03:17:04,460 --> 03:17:05,460
That's great.

3365
03:17:05,460 --> 03:17:06,460
Alright.

3366
03:17:06,460 --> 03:17:08,460
Well Blender Buddy it's so good to hear from you.

3367
03:17:08,460 --> 03:17:11,460
I always love to hear you know listeners that would call in a lot a few years ago.

3368
03:17:11,460 --> 03:17:15,460
And then have kind of moved on to whatever and then come on back to the show.

3369
03:17:15,460 --> 03:17:18,460
So I'm so glad to hear from you.

3370
03:17:18,460 --> 03:17:20,460
But I hope everything is tricky in Nashville.

3371
03:17:20,460 --> 03:17:24,460
And thank you for reminding us how amazing board games are.

3372
03:17:24,460 --> 03:17:25,460
Alright take care buddy.

3373
03:17:25,460 --> 03:17:27,460
Alright take care buddy.

3374
03:17:27,460 --> 03:17:28,460
Bye bye.

3375
03:17:28,460 --> 03:17:29,460
Some folks in chat.

3376
03:17:29,460 --> 03:17:31,460
We see a few people in our chat room here.

3377
03:17:31,460 --> 03:17:34,460
Like we have Kaijudo saying board games for the win.

3378
03:17:34,460 --> 03:17:38,460
Akuma JP says board game is fun if you have friends to play with.

3379
03:17:38,460 --> 03:17:41,460
Justin says a big fan of Love Letter.

3380
03:17:41,460 --> 03:17:44,460
It's a super quick card game based on bluffing.

3381
03:17:44,460 --> 03:17:48,460
Also in that vein, Coup is another great card.

3382
03:17:48,460 --> 03:17:50,460
Is another great bluffing card game.

3383
03:17:50,460 --> 03:17:53,460
And Black Wolf says King of Tokyo is awesome.

3384
03:17:53,460 --> 03:17:57,460
So it sounds like a lot of these games I'm going to have to play over at Dragon Con and so forth.

3385
03:17:57,460 --> 03:17:59,460
So anyway.

3386
03:17:59,460 --> 03:18:01,460
That is going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

3387
03:18:01,460 --> 03:18:05,460
I'm sadly going to close things up because we're really long tonight.

3388
03:18:05,460 --> 03:18:06,460
And we got to wrap up.

3389
03:18:06,460 --> 03:18:08,460
We already had a host bail on us.

3390
03:18:08,460 --> 03:18:10,460
But you know we had to make up for lost time a little bit.

3391
03:18:10,460 --> 03:18:13,460
So thank you guys for staying up late with us.

3392
03:18:13,460 --> 03:18:17,460
And thank you guys for supporting the show and listening.

3393
03:18:17,460 --> 03:18:19,460
And glad you're back after a week off.

3394
03:18:19,460 --> 03:18:24,460
And let's get ready because it's going to be a heck of a month between E3 and our 12th birthday.

3395
03:18:24,460 --> 03:18:25,460
And have a lot of fun.

3396
03:18:25,460 --> 03:18:26,460
You ready Jason?

3397
03:18:26,460 --> 03:18:27,460
Yeah.

3398
03:18:27,460 --> 03:18:28,460
It'll be fun.

3399
03:18:28,460 --> 03:18:33,460
Alright for now let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as we wrap things up.

3400
03:18:33,460 --> 03:18:34,460
I do want to say really quick though.

3401
03:18:34,460 --> 03:18:36,460
Of course if you do like what you've heard here at OLR.

3402
03:18:36,460 --> 03:18:37,460
Don't forget.

3403
03:18:37,460 --> 03:18:39,460
Support the show by just telling a friend or two.

3404
03:18:39,460 --> 03:18:41,460
I mean the offers of gifts and things are really nice.

3405
03:18:41,460 --> 03:18:44,460
But I don't want your money.

3406
03:18:44,460 --> 03:18:46,460
I know it seems like a weird thing to say.

3407
03:18:46,460 --> 03:18:49,460
But I want your love.

3408
03:18:49,460 --> 03:18:51,460
Tell a friend or two about the show.

3409
03:18:51,460 --> 03:18:54,460
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

3410
03:18:54,460 --> 03:18:56,460
And yeah.

3411
03:18:56,460 --> 03:18:59,460
That's all we really ask here at OLR.

3412
03:18:59,460 --> 03:19:02,460
Just help our family grow a little bit with like minded individuals.

3413
03:19:02,460 --> 03:19:04,460
That are not jerks when it comes to video games.

3414
03:19:04,460 --> 03:19:06,460
That are there for the fun.

3415
03:19:06,460 --> 03:19:08,460
Leave a nice word on iTunes.

3416
03:19:08,460 --> 03:19:10,460
Stitcher Radio really helps too.

3417
03:19:10,460 --> 03:19:11,460
And anywhere.

3418
03:19:11,460 --> 03:19:12,460
Wherever you heard about this podcast.

3419
03:19:12,460 --> 03:19:15,460
There's probably a bunch of other people waiting to hear about some new podcasts.

3420
03:19:15,460 --> 03:19:17,460
And we'll hope they'll check us out.

3421
03:19:17,460 --> 03:19:18,460
Jason.

3422
03:19:18,460 --> 03:19:19,460
Thank you for being here.

3423
03:19:19,460 --> 03:19:21,460
As you have been for the past few weeks.

3424
03:19:21,460 --> 03:19:22,460
We'll see you again next week.

3425
03:19:22,460 --> 03:19:23,460
As always.

3426
03:19:23,460 --> 03:19:24,460
You absolutely will because.

3427
03:19:24,460 --> 03:19:25,460
That's right.

3428
03:19:25,460 --> 03:19:28,460
Our fun starts 12 hours after the show finishes.

3429
03:19:28,460 --> 03:19:30,460
And we gotta get in the car early too.

3430
03:19:30,460 --> 03:19:32,460
Because we gotta be in LA by like.

3431
03:19:32,460 --> 03:19:33,460
No later.

3432
03:19:33,460 --> 03:19:34,460
Like 3 or 4.

3433
03:19:34,460 --> 03:19:35,460
So.

3434
03:19:35,460 --> 03:19:36,460
Because the Sony thing is like.

3435
03:19:36,460 --> 03:19:38,460
I think it's like 6 o'clock or something.

3436
03:19:38,460 --> 03:19:39,460
So.

3437
03:19:39,460 --> 03:19:40,460
Lots of stuff going on that day.

3438
03:19:40,460 --> 03:19:41,460
So.

3439
03:19:41,460 --> 03:19:42,460
We're gonna have a busy busy week next week.

3440
03:19:42,460 --> 03:19:43,460
Final thoughts for our listeners.

3441
03:19:43,460 --> 03:19:45,460
I really need to start writing things down.

3442
03:19:45,460 --> 03:19:49,460
Because I remember having a thought either today or yesterday about a perfect ending.

3443
03:19:49,460 --> 03:19:50,460
Yep.

3444
03:19:50,460 --> 03:19:51,460
Don't remember it.

3445
03:19:51,460 --> 03:19:52,460
Write shit down.

3446
03:19:52,460 --> 03:19:53,460
Helps you remember.

3447
03:19:53,460 --> 03:19:54,460
Like get a voice recorder.

3448
03:19:54,460 --> 03:19:55,460
Just record yourself.

3449
03:19:55,460 --> 03:19:56,460
Like come on.

3450
03:19:56,460 --> 03:19:57,460
Alright.

3451
03:19:57,460 --> 03:20:00,460
My final thought for the night is.

3452
03:20:00,460 --> 03:20:01,460
It's almost 10 o'clock.

3453
03:20:01,460 --> 03:20:02,460
Do I still go to the gym?

3454
03:20:02,460 --> 03:20:03,460
Yes or no?

3455
03:20:03,460 --> 03:20:04,460
Shane's nodding yes.

3456
03:20:04,460 --> 03:20:05,460
We'll see.

3457
03:20:05,460 --> 03:20:06,460
I gotta get up at 630 in the morning.

3458
03:20:06,460 --> 03:20:07,460
We'll see.

3459
03:20:07,460 --> 03:20:08,460
Alright.

3460
03:20:08,460 --> 03:20:09,460
Last but not least.

3461
03:20:09,460 --> 03:20:10,460
Loki your final thought tonight.

3462
03:20:10,460 --> 03:20:11,460
I have to go to work tomorrow.

3463
03:20:11,460 --> 03:20:12,460
Oh my gosh.

3464
03:20:12,460 --> 03:20:14,460
You gotta work like the rest of us again.

3465
03:20:14,460 --> 03:20:16,460
Well you've been working from home though.

3466
03:20:16,460 --> 03:20:17,460
Any full time dad.

3467
03:20:17,460 --> 03:20:18,460
That's a job.

3468
03:20:18,460 --> 03:20:19,460
Yeah.

3469
03:20:19,460 --> 03:20:20,460
It's actually a little.

3470
03:20:20,460 --> 03:20:21,460
It's easier now.

3471
03:20:21,460 --> 03:20:22,460
Well except Thursday I have to watch him again.

3472
03:20:22,460 --> 03:20:23,460
Because.

3473
03:20:23,460 --> 03:20:24,460
You know our babysitter.

3474
03:20:24,460 --> 03:20:25,460
She's going to the doctor.

3475
03:20:25,460 --> 03:20:26,460
In San Jose.

3476
03:20:26,460 --> 03:20:27,460
It's like three hours fucking away.

3477
03:20:27,460 --> 03:20:28,460
I hope she's okay.

3478
03:20:28,460 --> 03:20:31,460
It's usually a specialist of some sort.

3479
03:20:31,460 --> 03:20:32,460
Anyways.

3480
03:20:32,460 --> 03:20:34,460
It's just whatever.

3481
03:20:34,460 --> 03:20:35,460
So.

3482
03:20:35,460 --> 03:20:36,460
Yeah.

3483
03:20:36,460 --> 03:20:42,460
Everybody I'm sure will be glad that I'm back including all my annoying customers.

3484
03:20:42,460 --> 03:20:44,460
And now I have to talk to you on the phone.

3485
03:20:44,460 --> 03:20:46,460
Before I could just email them.

3486
03:20:46,460 --> 03:20:47,460
Sorry I can't call you.

3487
03:20:47,460 --> 03:20:48,460
I'm on a cell phone.

3488
03:20:48,460 --> 03:20:49,460
I have limited minutes.

3489
03:20:49,460 --> 03:20:50,460
I can't talk to you.

3490
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:52,460
And I gotta talk to them.

3491
03:20:52,460 --> 03:20:54,460
No escaping work now.

3492
03:20:54,460 --> 03:20:55,460
Alright.
