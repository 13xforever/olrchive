Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, we interview Mike Kennedy, publisher of Retro Magazine, with their plans of a second year of crowdfunded retro publishing goodness and much more.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's been a busy two weeks, so without any further delay, let's get to the news, your chat, comments, calls, and emails right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Jason, you forgot about the delay for food talk. That's the thing that always happens. Hi everybody, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And yes, we are back after a week off live with this episode number 572 for October the 26th of 2014.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and not here with you unfortunately tonight in studio, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I know, we were just gone last week, shouldn't she be here tonight?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But actually, DarkSakura actually moved this week, so she is moving into a new house, so she's finishing up some business that comes with moving, because moving is certainly no fun task, I can attest to that.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But that means, for those of you that have been listening to OLR for a while, we currently tape at what we call studio N7, because it's number 7, the seventh studio we've had.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This means that studio number 5 is no more. It's gone though, she's moved into a new place, so she should be back on the program next week.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Joining us here in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hi Loki, how are you? Welcome back.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, did you have a good week off?

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, I guess.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sorry, you were muted there for a minute there, but what did you do, it was my fault, what did you do with your week off?

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think watched the kids.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, working on your game, did you get to play games?

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, you know what, actually I did work on my game, that's right, that's what I was doing.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I didn't really play a whole ton of games. I bought a PlayStation 4.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sadly enough, I didn't really get to play any games on it, because it was one of those, you buy it off of Craigslist for a discounted price, and everything seems good.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And I even was smart enough to power it on, I brought my portable HDMI monitor with me, plugged it in, made sure that I got something on the screen.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I forgot to bring a game disc to see if it played, and unfortunately the disc drive was busted.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But fortunately, it's under warranty, and the dude even had an extended warranty on it, so I, instead of sending it off to the extended warranty place, I just went ahead and sent it to Sony.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Because they're like, oh well if it's in within a year, you know, it's under warranty.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm like, well the PlayStation 4 hasn't been out for a year yet, so I'm pretty sure it's under your warranty.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So there's no problems, and they're sending me a box to send it back, and they'll fix it, and that'll be that.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So what made you decide to finally take the plunge, and you got PlayStation 4, as opposed to Xbox One?

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Because you and I were talking a little bit before the show, catching up from a couple weeks, and you kind of mentioned that Xbox One has a lot of really attractive, exclusive software right now.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
With the, you know, the Fantasia, Disney, and with the Forza Horizon 2, what made you decide ultimately for PS4?

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, basically it's just, you know, what my friends have.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So, I picked that console because I wanted a PlayStation 4 more than I wanted an Xbox One as far as like third-party stuff goes, because everything seems to play better on a PlayStation 4 versus an Xbox One.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And, you know, the first-party stuff that I really wanted right now, like Sunset Overdrive and Forza Horizon 2, I mean, it's okay, but even like next year is going to have some pretty good stuff with like Crackdown and stuff.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I still have time to get a system for that, but there's not a lot of our friends right now that have Xbox Ones, and so if I want to play like, you know, Call of Duty with my friends and stuff, or if I want to play, you know, like Grand Theft Auto, or even, you know, you guys are playing Destiny and stuff, you know, everybody has a PlayStation 4 to do that, so that's...

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Or Final Fantasy XIV, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I just, I really don't have time for an MMO.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I know, I know.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hey, if it wasn't, you know, monthly, you know, that would be a whole different story.

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But very interesting that, in a way, I don't want to say it's peer pressure that caused you to do it, because it's not so much that, but it's definitely that inertia and why the launches of systems are so important, because, you know, you kind of say, well, because all my friends have this, because, you know, PS4 kind of had the bigger boom out the gate,

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
a lot of people kind of adopted that. That's kind of what swayed you. It's kind of interesting to see how that inertia really plays into things.

40
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, and on top of that, I mean, that's also why, you know, like, and if it was the opposite, yeah, I'd probably be buying an Xbox One, because if all my friends had an Xbox One...

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, I got a 360 before a PlayStation 3 for very similar reasons. I mean, I think they were launched a year apart, but I was a later adopte...

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The PS4 is the first system I bought at launch in a while.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, you see, I had a lot of store credit built up from selling off our LAN systems, because I had a lot of those.

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And so I sold those off and sold off a lot of my duplicate games and stuff, and even I sold my Kinect and, you know, all that stuff.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I still have my PlayStation 3, my, you know, original one, and I've still got my Xbox 360.

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So I'm still playing stuff on... I'm going to be playing stuff on those still, at least for a little bit.

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And then, I don't know, but I just wanted to get, like, a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One, and I just kind of like, well, I'm just going to get PlayStation 4.

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then, mainly because Grand Theft Auto V is coming back out again.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Aha!

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Call of Duty. Call of Duty looked really good, you know, next-gen.

51
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I was like, you know, it's just not going to be the same.

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But, I see, and this is kind of even weird, because, like, you know, I never understood the point of pre-ordering games digitally.

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Obviously, though, with Call of Duty, we talked a few weeks ago that they have that deal where if you buy it on, you know...

54
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And they've even done that with, like, Destiny and stuff, where you buy it on one system, you get it...

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's cross-buy, so, since I still play with people on PlayStation 3 Call of Duty, I have bought it digitally, because now I'll have it on PlayStation 3 for the people that haven't upgraded yet.

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And we can still play on that, and then when everybody upgrades the PlayStation 4, I'll have it for that as well.

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And if you're listening live, you should join us in chat. Live.vognetwork.com, just like SSG100Matt, who says, apparently it was too much effort to get it fixed and then sell it to someone.

59
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What a jerk. Talk about the Craigslist guy. Have you learned your lesson about Craigslist yet? You don't...

60
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I had good... Well, I've only done three deals on Craigslist, and to be honest, this wasn't so bad, because the system works. It is really strange, though.

61
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't you think that the dude broke the disk drive and was just like, eh, I'll just sell it to some sucker?

62
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Here's the thing, though. He didn't break the disk drive. The launched PS4s actually have a problem with their disk drives. Like, a lot of them failed.

63
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And that was something that's well-known, but I just... It's under warranty. You fucking bought it. It's under warranty. Why didn't you just send it off for like a few days, and it would be fixed. Done.

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But I think what happened is he ended up buying like another PlayStation 4 or something, and he just said, eh, fuck it. I'm just gonna... I can't wait to...

65
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, the only game he had on the hard drive was NBA 2K14, so I guess he couldn't wait to play NBA 2K14, so...

66
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, you know, and whatever. I mean, it works. I mean, I can still play games on it right now. I just only play digital games.

67
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Have you played NBA 2K14?

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, because it's not licensed to my account. Not that I would even want to, but I played the... I played that one because I bought a camera with it, so...

69
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, the playroom.

70
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, I played the playroom a little bit.

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Actually, TigerClaw is kind of referencing that there. TigerClaw says, with Loki now owning a PlayStation 4, hopefully we can see him stream some games on Twitch. Is that part of your long-term plan?

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I guess I could.

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Everybody's doing that now. It's so interesting.

74
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's what it looks like, you know, now that everybody's doing it. It's like, eh, who cares?

75
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, you and I were talking before the show about the whole, like, you can't, you know, you're gonna have to send your PlayStation 4 in, but then I was like, oh, wait a minute, on Tuesday...

76
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You know, I know we'll get into this a little later in the show, so sorry to jump ahead, but on Tuesday we're gonna get that patch, and it's gonna have the whole SharePlay thing, so I could pop in Diablo 4, or...

77
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Diablo 4, I wish. Diablo 3, and we could do the co-op, you know, over the SharePlay, at least for an hour before we get cut off, but...

78
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
See, that'd be cool. I mean, you know, I'd like to check that out, and it's not a big deal if it's gone for, like, you know, because I...

79
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Just because I have it doesn't mean I'm playing the system right now, and, you know, really I'm gonna want to play Call of Duty when it comes out, but...

80
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Assuming I get that box pretty soon. They said it takes about seven to ten business days, I think, to turn it around, so it won't be too bad, so I'll miss a few days on it.

81
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can always play it on PlayStation 3 because I bought it digitally, so...

82
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, and you haven't had a PS4 for this long, so what's another...

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Exactly, I'm just, I'm not in a huge hurry. I was just like, aw, I want to play Watch Dogs and Infamous, and, you know, the other game I...

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, Destiny, so...

85
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Going to our chat room, a name I have not seen before, so welcome, continues in our chat room, says, people don't think about that when a system breaks after they buy it, so maybe...

86
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, I mean, maybe this guy, like, sure, he had the extended warranty, but he just kind of was... said, screw it.

87
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Or maybe he bought the game digitally and literally didn't know that that drive was bad, because it was installed on there digitally, so...

88
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It could be.

89
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It could be just that he literally didn't know. I think he did know, but whatever, I mean, it's so stupid, and it's not, like, something I can't get fixed.

90
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Exactly.

91
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's going to get fixed.

92
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, you know, my launch, Xbox 360, broke, red-ringed after I had it, like, four days. You can go back in the show archive and find it, it was about February, it was around Valentine's Day, right after the 360s came out.

93
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And I could have this point now that, you know, PlayStation Plus has Dust and the Legion tale is free right now. Yeah, see, that's the problem, is all those games that are free right now, a lot of them, I have on my Steam library.

94
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So it's like, I could play this, but I'm not playing it on the Steam.

95
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Not Pix the Cat, which is, like, actually way more awesome than you would think it is, looking at screenshots.

96
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I will have to try that.

97
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Alright, there you go. Play Pix the Cat, then send back your PlayStation 4.

98
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I have it downloaded, yeah.

99
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Alright, get on that.

100
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Alright, let's talk about a couple quick things here. We are going to bring in, of course, as Jason said there at the top of the show, we have a return guest this week.

101
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We haven't had a lot of these in the history of OLR, but we like to support indie productions, meaning indie podcasts, and indie publications.

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And Mike Kennedy, the publisher of Retro Magazine, is going to be coming back on the show tonight.

103
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He was on about a year ago when Retro Magazine was just an idea, and here we are a year later, and the Kickstarter for year number two is currently underway, and we'll talk to Mike all about that.

104
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So that's in about ten minutes.

105
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So I've got about ten minutes to talk about other stuff that happened while we weren't here.

106
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Namely, Final Fantasy Fan Fest. That is where I was last weekend in Vegas. This all took place at the Rio.

107
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I talked about this in depth a little bit on my other program, Hoard House, so I don't want to repeat myself too much, but I know there's some of you that listen here that don't listen to Hoard House.

108
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Just to kind of clear a few things up, even though it's Final Fantasy Fan Festival, if you actually look at the logo, there's a very big 14 logo in it, meaning this festival was not about all things Final Fantasy.

109
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was only about Final Fantasy 14.

110
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They had some demo kiosks for Final Fantasy Theatrhythm, where they were giving away codes for the song Good King Mooglemog, which is a stage in Final Fantasy 14, except they ran out of those halfway through the first day, but whatever, I'd already bought the song anyway.

111
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That was it. There was no 11, which really surprised me, because Squares had four other Fan Fests before dedicated to Final Fantasy 11, but this was purely 14, not a peep set about Final Fantasy 11.

112
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Nothing about 13 being on Steam, or the other ones, like 4 just came out on Steam, or the Monster Hunter game coming out next year, that one, the Final Fantasy Explorers, or whatever it's called.

113
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Nothing about that. It was strictly about 14, and there was a lot of good things, a lot of not-so-good things.

114
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Community was great, met a lot of good people, had a great time with my link shell. The developers of the game, so personable, and a real standout star from the whole thing, I think, is Soken, who's the music producer.

115
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Who's kind of, you know, I know Nobui Matsu does stuff with Square still, but he's also kind of branched out on his own. He's not really tied so much to the Final Fantasy brand right now.

116
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So Soken is kind of like their guy right now, and he's very different, because he's a little more contemporary, probably, but he's really, really personable, and just a lot of fun, and you really see the passion he has for it.

117
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I really just loved watching him, and his band played the closing ceremonies, and they were very good, even though their repertoire was very limited, because as The Primals, the name of the band, they only played Primal songs, meaning the five boss themes that are in the game right now, that's all they could play.

118
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh no, and then Moogle Mog, they played that song too, and had Koji, who's the localization guy who does all the voices of the Moogles in the game, I did not realize this, he does all those voices in that song.

119
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He actually sung it on stage, which was actually kind of a hoot to watch live, so yeah, it was pretty funny.

120
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So, and then some of the events, they had a really neat too, like they actually had an archery studio that like came in, and you could learn for like two minutes how to fire a legit bow and arrow, we had like signed releases and everything, and you could do that.

121
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Pull bow back, or pull arrow back, let go of arrow.

122
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's harder than it looks, trust me, because I really flopped at it, and you actually had a little real, I should have brought him out here in the studio so you could see it, Loki, but they actually had like a little real life quest log book, and as you did all these events, you get it stamped, and then you could turn it in, you get like a participation badge for some of these things that you did, and the Odin battle was neat, because that's something that's not in the game.

123
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So this was all, you know, kind of neat, all these events. The part that wasn't so great was the glue that held it all together, like there wasn't enough for everybody to do, the lines were really badly long, and in fact I know like the merchandise line was like crazy long, it was like four hours at one point,

124
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:15,000
so yeah, there was this whole thing about where we had some seats, we got kicked out, and that really pissed me off, because we've been there for 90 minutes, I'm not going to get into the whole thing, I talked about it on Hoard House, so there's just some organization things that were kind of bad, which I don't consider this the first year of Fan Fest, I consider it the fifth, and so I would have hoped some more of these things would have been worked out, but granted Final Fantasy 14 is in a much higher place, so to speak, sub-number wise, than Final Fantasy 11 ever was,

125
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
so maybe they really truly did under anticipate the volume, I really hope they learn a lot, and I would consider going to a year or two if they do one.

126
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Joining us here in studio just for a bit, because I know we have an interview to get to here before too long, but joining us here in studio for a bit is our pal Shane.

127
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I'm going to go to sleep, because I'm super tired.

128
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're super tired, because that 6am shift or whatever it is you work, kicks your butt, right?

129
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Waking up at 4.30.

130
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Now you weren't able to come on Hoard House this week, because I wanted to have you on there to talk about Fan Fest, but you and I went to Vegas together on that 9 hour drive.

131
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It was fine.

132
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
How'd you like the desert?

133
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The desert's stupid, the desert needs to die somehow more than it already has.

134
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, I can't believe people live there, right?

135
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Just old people.

136
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What did you think of Fan Fest, because you kind of disagreed with me on some things, so quickly, what was your take on the whole thing?

137
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I think it was amazing. I understand the frustration with some of the parts. The lines were terrible at times. There wasn't a lot of things to do, unless you wanted to wait in line.

138
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You stood in that merch line for 4 hours, and you still come out of this going, I had a great time.

139
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, I did. For one thing, I didn't have to stand the entire time, because I got in so late that they were seating people to get in line.

140
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So I sat through my favorite panel of the entire thing, the music panel, so it was great.

141
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Did you hear what I said when you were in the other room about Soken?

142
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
No.

143
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He's kind of like, you know, with Uematsu.

144
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
He's amazing.

145
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Well, with Uematsu, not really, I mean, he does stuff with Square, but now he kind of does other things too.

146
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like, Soken's really kind of like the face of music in the Final Fantasy games right now.

147
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes, he's way more interesting, I think.

148
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He's just different, I think. He's just different.

149
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Like, I don't want to shade Nobuo Uematsu, who is a legend of legends, but Soken is...

150
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
He's more personable.

151
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, Soken's also contemporary. He's more contemporary to me. I think he's a great face.

152
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Well, I just watched the London ceremony, and he was awesome in it.

153
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But anyway, no, I don't also consider it its fifth attempt, because the Vana Deal Fest, Vana Fests or whatever, I don't think those are even remotely the same thing.

154
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's the same company, but I don't think it's the same people involved.

155
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But I had a great time. Arrow shooting was fun. The cannon stuff was dumb. It was really dumb, actually.

156
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It was a cute idea, but if I was four, I might have liked it.

157
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And yeah, I thought everything was really great, even if I didn't get to do everything.

158
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like, I didn't do the Primal Battle. I didn't do Frontlines. I didn't do Speed Challenge, but we did Odin.

159
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We did the panels, and really, I was there for the information in the panels. The other stuff was just extra.

160
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It was worth $120 to you?

161
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It was amazing, yes. And I want them to do a second year, but they said they might not do it yearly, because people will expect an expansion every time.

162
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Which I'm like, no, just say there's not going to be an expansion announcement and still do it, because people would still go.

163
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We had free company members show up that decided they were going to go the day before it happened, and they had a blast.

164
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah. I was really amazed that they pulled that together.

165
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But Final Fantasy XIV, one thing they've been very good at is that they've been putting out patches really regularly.

166
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, we have one on Tuesday.

167
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah, exactly. I feel like they'd still have something to talk about with all these regular patches if they still go down that path.

168
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, and think about it. Our Fan Fest, we got the announcement of the expansion.

169
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The rest of Fan Fest was dedicated to the upcoming patch, and then just other random things like music or lore.

170
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Not anything to do with the new expansion. So, yeah, they could really just base it around a patch, and I think people would be happy.

171
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Acteft is linking to something on eBay asking, did Shane get this? And it's Fan Festival 2014 Delivery Moogle with in-game minion codes.

172
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes, I already have my minion, and it's all running around in-game with me.

173
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And that's why the line was so long, because this was the first time they were selling these exclusive Fan Fests with in-game minions.

174
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes, the Moogle is going to be on the online store, but they were only taking pre-orders in every region for it. It wasn't out yet.

175
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The art book was also there, and I believe...

176
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Which also has a minion.

177
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Which also has a minion. I believe Japan had just got the art book when we were able to get it at Fan Fest, but it's still up for just pre-order in the site.

178
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So since I don't know anything about this game, what exactly are the minions?

179
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They're just little pets that follow you. Sometimes they interact with things like...

180
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay, so I have this adorable dog minion, and so you have a pet emote, and when you do that to him, he lays on his back so you can rub his stomach.

181
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's adorable. Sometimes the Moogles, no matter if it's a regular Moogle or the delivery one, they will...

182
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If you have multiple out, like you have one out and your friend has one out, they will link up and start doing a little dance around with each other.

183
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You can beckon some of them to hop on your shoulder. It's pretty neat. I mean, it's stupid, but it just gives you more things to do in the game.

184
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah, and honestly, when I saw that merch line, I was like, screw that. I'm like, Alan will understand if I don't bring one of those home because I'm not going to stand in that line.

185
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And then I got extraordinarily lucky, and somebody who had connections did me a really nice favor, and I got one anyway.

186
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
One thing that I didn't mind...

187
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If you're listening, thank you.

188
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:19,000
One thing I didn't mind about the line is that the people I was standing with were pleasant enough that I could talk with them the entire time.

189
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I found that to be something... One of the biggest pluses about Fan Fest was that the community was really awesome.

190
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And I was worried about that going in. I thought we were going to get the hardcore Final Fantasy fans that know everything, and if you say something wrong, they will look at you and say bad things at you.

191
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because I played 11 a lot. I played 14 a lot. The other Final Fantasies, to be honest, I haven't beat a Final Fantasy since 7.

192
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And I didn't care for a lot of the ones after that.

193
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And I thought it was awesome because there were 7 of us from the free company there. A party in Final Fantasy XIV is 8 people.

194
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So to do Odin, we were one short to do a party. So we pugged somebody.

195
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Well, you guys pugged him before you got the us three.

196
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
To make a long story short, because I'm running out of time.

197
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We ended up pugging a guy that was there by himself from a low-pop server, didn't know anybody there, and he was really awesome and helped explain the fight to us.

198
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And we were like, why don't you just hang out with us?

199
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He hung out with us for the rest of the weekend.

200
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
For the rest of the weekend, he hung out with us. And we invited him up to party.

201
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I don't think he's joined our free company.

202
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah, he has a factory teacher. Actually, this is really funny. I think I got him in my trial today.

203
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Because...

204
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You know his name?

205
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I know his name because our friend, his friends, I'm trying to keep this for public radio.

206
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But yeah, I saw that name pop up in Duty Finder as a tank.

207
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

208
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I got Leviathan, and I was like, I think that's...

209
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But he was one of those ones that was like, in and out. Pulled, and then left the thing right away.

210
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So I couldn't say, oh my god, were you FanFest?

211
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I couldn't get any of that.

212
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's another reason why our FanFest was great. Because in our concert, we got Leviathan twice.

213
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We got it as the second song, and we got it as the encore.

214
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And that is my favorite song in the game.

215
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And so I was beaming the entire time that song was being played live. So good.

216
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Quickly here, because I have to transition topics here, but what was your favorite thing about FanFest?

217
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Leviathan.

218
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And what does that mean for the listeners that don't know?

219
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Leviathan, the concert they had at the closing ceremonies was the Soken, the guy that does all the music.

220
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And he has a band called the Primals, and they played the theme songs to all the current Primals in the game.

221
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And Leviathan's song is my absolute favorite, probably song of all Final Fantasy games ever that I've heard.

222
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And now that I have theater in them, I can hear a lot of the other songs I've never heard before.

223
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And they played it second. I was kind of going crazy about it.

224
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And then they did an encore, and they asked what song we wanted to hear.

225
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And Leviathan won the encore, and they played it again.

226
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But they wouldn't play Shiva, yet they did this weekend in Europe, which is bull.

227
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah, and now that I've heard it, we didn't really miss out on much. I'm glad we got Leviathan twice. I'd rather have that than Shiva.

228
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And what's my least favorite? Because I assume that was the other side to this.

229
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,000
My least favorite probably was...

230
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It being in a casino hotel, which I understand Vegas is probably all that, but I really don't like the smell of cigarette smoke.

231
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
When you're walking through the casino areas to get to the event, you walk through a lot of cigarette smoke.

232
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And I did not like that at all.

233
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And that was your first trip to Vegas, right?

234
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah, and you know what? Maybe. I'm just not a Vegas person, but I didn't drink or gamble, and I just didn't really see the point.

235
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I was there with a purpose.

236
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And I noticed one other thing I'll quickly say is that a ton of Street Passes, especially for 3 of them, I've got 99 Chaos maps now.

237
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Theater of the M and Smash Brothers, that was the highlight for your 3DS there. And getting all your puzzle pieces, that was easy to do.

238
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Anyhow, Shane, if you want to come back later and hang, that's cool.

239
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We'll be in bed.

240
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You're probably going to bed.

241
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Well, I gotta go park my character in front of the Rogue Guild in Final Fantasy to be prepared on Tuesday.

242
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Well, good luck. But I gotta shift gears here because it is time for us to give our pal Mike Kennedy a call.

243
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Mike is with Retro Magazine, and they're just coming off their first year of Retro Magazine.

244
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And they're starting a Kickstarter for the second year, which is actually in progress. We're going to get a status update on that.

245
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And I believe we have Mike on the line. Hi, Mike. You there?

246
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hey, I'm here. Thanks again for having us on.

247
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
No problem. And actually, we're going to have a second person, too, here in this interview.

248
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Do you want to introduce this guy for us here, Mike?

249
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, I wanted to bring on Mark Kaminsky. He's the co-founder and also our creative director.

250
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
He's the guy responsible for all the pretty pages in the magazine, among lots of other things.

251
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Very nice. Welcome to the show, Mark. How you doing?

252
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

253
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Hey, thank you guys for being here. I appreciate it.

254
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Well, first off, I just want to say congratulations. You guys have successfully completed one year of Retro Magazine.

255
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And I know we're here to talk about the Kickstarter for year two.

256
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And usually when we're talking about Kickstarter progress, I want to give an update and say,

257
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Oh, go donate because they have this much further to go. But you made it.

258
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You've accomplished already your Kickstarter goal for year two of Retro Magazine, right?

259
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We have hit our goal, but the goal was really set, something that we thought we could achieve.

260
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And really our goal for this second year is to make the magazine bigger and better,

261
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
add more pages and lots of other cool things to the magazine.

262
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So right now, we're really excited that we hit the goal within, I think it was about a week.

263
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And we've got three weeks left to start hitting some stretch goals, which means just more pages and more inserts and more cool things.

264
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So we're really excited that we hit it early on. So we've got this nice launching pad for hitting some of these stretch goals, hopefully.

265
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Awesome. Well, let me take a step back a little bit here because even though we had you on the show last year, Mike, we're fortunate enough.

266
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We have some new listeners every week here on the show. So some people out there listening might not have heard about Retro Magazine before.

267
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So maybe I'll ask you, Mark, since you weren't here last year, tell us a little bit about Retro Magazine, Mark. What is it?

268
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well, it's just an old school magazine. It's a double entente, so it's retro. We cover retro content.

269
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's also a retro throwback magazine, kind of like the old school magazines that we had in the past.

270
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Nintendo Power, Game Fan, Game Pro, that kind of thing. So we want to resurrect a print magazine for guys that still collect games and don't emulate stuff.

271
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And it felt like there was a void in the market, and we just kind of went out and created one.

272
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And created you did. You guys have been very successful at that. How does it feel to see that there's all these people out there saying print is dead, print is dead, but yet you guys are still able to make this successful thing? How does that kind of feel?

273
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Well, as Mark said, we're a retro magazine, and it is that double entendre being that we talk about retro and we deliver it in a retro format.

274
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Although there are still a few video game magazines out there, but obviously the great ones are dying off with Nintendo Power last year.

275
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And hopefully that's about where it stops. There's still a few on the rack, and it's great to see that.

276
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We certainly don't want to be the only one on there. We just want to add to that cornucopia of video gaming goodness that you can still get and hold onto in your hands.

277
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And that's kind of what we want to deliver. And I think so far our fans and readers, that's kind of what we're seeing because we do sell quite a few more print subscriptions than digital.

278
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We offer it in both formats, so we're trying to cover all of the bases there. But generally, people seem to really resonate with the print.

279
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Awesome. And if you guys have questions for Mike or Mark, you can ask them in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com if you are listening live here.

280
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And of course, if you want to find out more about the Kickstarter, there's not an easy way for me to give Kickstarter links out on the show.

281
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We have a link that's friendly.

282
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Oh, because usually they're so long and slash, dot, so what is the link?

283
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:23,000
We have thought of that. We think of everything. Well, we think we do. We have a link for that, guys. It's readretro.com slash Kickstarter.

284
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Simple enough.

285
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah, so there it is.

286
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Good thinking. All right, I can just say that. Readretro.com slash Kickstarter. Much easier than go here and search for this person's name. Good job on thinking that through.

287
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Well, let's talk about Kickstarter for a minute here, Mike. I want to ask a question that might be kind of tough, but I think just to clear the air and make sure everybody kind of understands.

288
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You've gone to Kickstarter for year two of the magazine, but I know there's probably going to be those cynical people out there that say, well, doesn't year one pay for year two?

289
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So do you want to elaborate on why that is not the case here and why you do need this Kickstarter for year two?

290
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, we're using the Kickstarter not to fund the second year because we've committed to doing year two already. We've been selling subscriptions all year long.

291
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But we wanted to use Kickstarter for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's a marketing, you know, people use it for marketing right now.

292
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I mean, there's lots of sophomore follow-up deals or things that people are working on where they'll go back to Kickstarter again and again and again because it brings new people for whatever reason.

293
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I mean, there's enough new people kind of on Kickstarter that will see this project maybe for the first time.

294
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So, you know, it's kind of, for us, it's being used as a supplemental campaign to what we've already done.

295
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And we're really just using it to grow the subscriber base, get in front of new people because, you know, there's just buzz around a Kickstarter project.

296
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And so we just wanted to continue to use Kickstarter in whatever way that we can. I mean, it's kind of a smart way.

297
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And other magazines, you know, Nintendo Force is another great magazine that they just completed their second year Kickstarter a few months ago and that was very successful.

298
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And again, it's just a way to fund more growth and I think most people will understand, I hope, anyway why we're doing it.

299
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So far we really haven't had too many questions about it. But it's just a great way to bring in new people, new eyes, new subscribers.

300
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:30,000
There's some marketing value that Kickstarter offers these days that, you know, again, a lot of people use it just to keep things going.

301
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
That's a very honest answer that I wouldn't have really thought of but you're absolutely right.

302
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's because, you know, these crowdfunding things are so, is really the buzz and what a lot of people are talking about right now.

303
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And I'm sure it does kind of put this in front of more people that maybe were not even aware of year one.

304
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So that's a great response. Thank you.

305
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Let's talk a little bit about some of the contributors to the magazine, Mike, because you talked about how there's some of these magazines that aren't around anymore.

306
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But it seems like some of the people you might recognize in those magazines, you've got writing for Retro.

307
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Can you tell us a little bit about some of the contributors you have?

308
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah, yeah. So it was, you know, when we started this thing, it was always our goal to bring on a great team of writers.

309
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And, you know, it didn't necessarily mean it was some big name. Everybody had heard of it.

310
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You know, we wanted to try to kind of make it a mix of some well-known, you know, industry writers.

311
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But if you look at our magazines, you'll notice lots of new names, you know, coming in and out of every issue.

312
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So we certainly try to mix it up and give people opportunities to get in print.

313
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Because, I mean, those opportunities are falling by the wayside these days, right?

314
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Right.

315
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But people want to see their name in print still, and I think always will.

316
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And so we wanted to be an avenue for that, not for, you know, the kind of the more, I guess, well-known people, but the newer people as well.

317
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But as far as the well-known people, I mean, yeah, people like Jeremy Parrish, Chris Koehler, Sean Baby, Kath Bailey, Alexandra Hall, Andy Eddy.

318
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You know, he's been writing for video game magazines, he's published, he's been publisher or, I'm sorry, editor, you know, back in the 90s at Video Games and Computer Entertainment.

319
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So he goes way back.

320
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Dave Halverson.

321
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, Dave Halverson, we brought him back, you know, in issue four, did our cover story.

322
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So, you know, we try to mix things up, you know, we kind of have this, kind of our core group that you're going to see probably in every magazine.

323
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But the other half of the people, you know, we're going to bring in and kind of new people and keep things fresh.

324
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And, you know, kind of, and it's been, you know, it's a pretty successful model, I think, so far.

325
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Awesome. And, yeah, you've got some great names there.

326
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And when you say a name like Sean Baby, I kind of go like, oh, man, I remember reading that guy's stuff when there wasn't OLR, which I can't even remember that far back some days.

327
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Like, this show's been going on so long.

328
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And we got new people, you know, we just had Scott Sharkey sign on.

329
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Oh, cool.

330
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So a lot of you guys may remember Scott Sharkey.

331
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I mean, he's kind of disappeared, you know, the last couple of years.

332
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
He went out and basically bartended out in the Nevada, middle of the Nevada desert for the last two years.

333
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Wow.

334
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So I caught up with him at Portland Retro Gaming Expo last weekend.

335
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And, you know, really great guy.

336
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And he's really excited to be back. He's really excited to be writing for the magazine.

337
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So, you know, he's just one of the people that we're bringing on.

338
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We've got kind of a handful of a few other kind of interesting folks that may be joining the contributor list that I think will surprise a lot of people.

339
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But we're just sort of keeping wraps on those just for right now.

340
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But there may be some revealing going on in the next three weeks before the Kickstarter ends.

341
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
All right. Then stay tuned to that.

342
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Mark, let me ask you this one since, you know, you've done a lot with making the magazine pretty, as Mike said earlier.

343
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What is a personal favorite article or contribution of yours from the first year of publication?

344
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And I know it's probably a tough making you pick between all this stuff.

345
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But try to pick just one that was a personal favorite of yours.

346
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm going to have to say, you know, content-wise, some of the interviews that we've done.

347
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It was really cool to get Ed Semrad in the first issue.

348
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You know, he was one of the original guys at EGM.

349
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Had some really cool custom stuff.

350
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Another interview, we found a guy in Pittsburgh that was sort of in the closet with his collection of pinball machines.

351
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Has over 800 machines in his private collection.

352
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You know, never talked to anybody before, like not part of Papa or any of the big events.

353
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So he was sort of like an unknown quantity.

354
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And we kind of, you know, dug him out and got an exclusive interview.

355
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So that's kind of my personal favorite.

356
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Awesome. That's always kind of cool.

357
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It sounds like you guys have been very good at kind of, I don't want to say digging up people,

358
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
but seeking out these people that maybe haven't kept up with the industry as it is today.

359
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But really finding these folks that contributed to gaming in the past and letting us catch up with them.

360
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Because maybe they don't all have Twitter accounts or what have it.

361
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Well, in our first issue, we have an interview with Inafune.

362
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Actually, one of the images that his team sent us wasn't supposed to be sent.

363
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And I guess there's some scribbling in Japanese there where it says something like this is just like Mega Man.

364
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And they were a little concerned about it.

365
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It wasn't supposed to be released publicly kind of thing.

366
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And that's in the book. So that's kind of cool.

367
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Whoops.

368
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I love that.

369
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
We might have done something bad, but it's in the book now.

370
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Hey, we just published what they gave us.

371
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
That's right. You didn't do anything wrong.

372
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's right. But yeah, that's a great comment.

373
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Part of what we want to do moving forward, adding more pages and content.

374
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
We had polled all of our readers back in probably March, kind of first quarter.

375
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And a lot of people loved the retro gaming interviews that we do with some of these gaming legends.

376
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And coming back and trying to find some of these people that haven't been interviewed hundreds of times.

377
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I think it's going to be a new challenge of ours.

378
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
There's a lot of these legends that for whatever reason have flown under the radar for years.

379
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And they're all getting a lot older now.

380
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So it's important to find some of these people that maybe wrote some really great hit game back in the 80s or early 90s.

381
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And then they've just disappeared.

382
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So we're trying to find these people and give them an opportunity to come in and tell us about their time in the industry.

383
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Everybody's heard David Crane, Gary Kitchen, at least kind of the pre-NES era.

384
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Those guys have been interviewed a bazillion times.

385
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So I know when we interviewed them on our latest issue, part of the angle I took with them is that issue was about platforming.

386
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It was kind of the theme.

387
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And so I pretty much centered all my questions around platforming, which a lot of these questions they've probably never been asked before.

388
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So it's still kind of a cool way to ask them and get information out of them that maybe they hadn't told people before.

389
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
There was a section of that article that we actually cut when we had to edit it down.

390
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And I think we've still got this and we're going to probably get it on the website sooner or later.

391
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But there was this real in-depth explanation that Gary Kitchen had given us about porting over Donkey Kong to the Atari 2600.

392
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And that's generally a port that people either love it or hate it, but unfortunately a lot of people didn't like it.

393
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Me, I thought it was great. I've spent zillions of hours playing Donkey Kong on Atari 2600.

394
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
But he talked about how hard it was to angle the girders like in the first level of Donkey Kong,

395
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
because for whatever reason the architecture of Atari, everything had to be on a straight line.

396
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And so it was just this great explanation.

397
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And you could tell that this was something that he just had struggled with because he went on and on and on

398
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
about how much of an accomplishment it was for him to actually figure out how to angle the girders.

399
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Because if you played Donkey Kong level one and they were flat, it just wouldn't look like Donkey Kong, right?

400
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So he figured out how to do that.

401
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And those are just the great stories that we loved to hear and talk about.

402
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And although we cut that piece, there's still a ton of great information that we left in,

403
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and we'll probably have that here someplace else.

404
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But just hearing these people's struggles, they didn't have anybody they could learn from.

405
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
They were there first.

406
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And while it's a unique opportunity that few people can find themselves in,

407
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:41,000
it's pretty amazing to see what they did without any training, no school, nobody to ask how to do something.

408
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I think people nowadays just sort of forget where it all started. And it wasn't that long ago, really.

409
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Well, and that kind of ties into some of the new content that we cover as well,

410
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
where it's almost like the golden age of resurgence of indie game publishing right now.

411
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
These little guys are going out there, and they worked with big developers,

412
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and now they're coming out and they're like, you know, I want to make a cool platforming game,

413
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
or I want to make my own RPG.

414
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And they're small teams of a handful of people, and they're making the game that they really want to make.

415
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And it's just a really interesting space right now.

416
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I don't know if you know this, but we literally had one of those guys on the show here two weeks ago

417
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
talking about his game, Timespinner.

418
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I don't know if that's one of you guys' radar, but literally what you just said there.

419
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And I kind of agree. There's a lot of love of the retro going on there.

420
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And yeah, you are seeing people that are stepping away from maybe these AAA studios

421
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
to really do their quote-unquote pet projects, such as when we had Bodhi on a couple weeks ago.

422
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Curious, are there any of these types of retro nostalgic games?

423
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Because Retro Magazine doesn't only cover classics.

424
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Like, you guys had Mighty No. 9 on your very first issue, which is certainly a retro-inspired game, right?

425
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,000
What kinds of these retro-inspired games do you think might not be on our radar right now, but should be?

426
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Mike, is some of this stuff from E3?

427
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I don't know. I was just looking at actually recovering Timespinner in our next issue.

428
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So I knew you had mentioned that. I'm going through a pagination here going,

429
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
that really sounds familiar.

430
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You know what, one of the things for me being kind of an older gamer,

431
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm 45, I'm the pre-NES kind of demographic that we try to shoot some of our content towards.

432
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
There's tons of these games coming out that I would never hear about

433
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
if I wasn't publishing this magazine or reading this magazine.

434
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Because I read it, you know, when we're doing the pagination

435
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and people are turning their stories in and everything, that's when I get to read the magazine.

436
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And I tell you what, I go through this stuff and we learn about these games.

437
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And I tell you, there's not that many really great indie games that are coming out right now

438
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
that people haven't heard of because the industry has totally changed.

439
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I mean, Sony, they're going after exclusives.

440
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
We're covering Axiom Verge, which is this great Metroidvania game.

441
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
That's kind of our cover story for the next issue.

442
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Oh my god, that's a Sony exclusive.

443
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So you've got companies like Sony going out to these single-person dev teams.

444
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It's not even a team, it's just you.

445
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And your game is so good.

446
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
They're trying to give you an exclusive deal on it.

447
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Think about that.

448
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I mean, it's insane.

449
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And it's great.

450
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
That's why the industry is changing right now.

451
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So there was Indiecade a couple of weekends ago.

452
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I went out there and Nintendo had a tent there

453
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
showcasing all of these great indie titles that are coming out.

454
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Ouya had a booth there and Sony had a booth there.

455
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And so they're really trying to get these games out to the public.

456
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And there's really no other magazines, at least at this point,

457
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that are really covering it and giving these types of games top billing.

458
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So I think that's a great place for us to come in

459
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
and kind of help get these people's games kind of permanently recorded

460
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
on paper and everything else because it's just kind of eroding right now.

461
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But I don't know.

462
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Mark, is there any other games that you can think of?

463
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Well, right now on the Ouya, I'm playing Never Ending Nightmare.

464
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's that time of year, Survival War.

465
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I'll tell you what, that is one of the creepiest games you will ever play.

466
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I love the Ouya platform.

467
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I think there's a lot of great stuff on there.

468
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I wish them the best of luck. I hope they can continue on.

469
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Me too.

470
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
My appreciation for the Ouya really didn't grow until I really saw

471
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
probably about E3 this year or GamerX,

472
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
where I really started to see more of the indie stuff

473
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
that they were really opening up that platform to

474
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and really kind of going over and championing these indies.

475
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, it made me really appreciate the Ouya a lot more as a system.

476
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
They had a tent full of people at IndieCade, full of people.

477
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And there's probably a dozen flat screens in there playing all these games.

478
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And almost every single one of them was a retro title.

479
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So it's really turning into a pretty decent format.

480
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So they had some rocky times.

481
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
But I think they're bringing the games,

482
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
which ultimately hopefully will work out really well for them.

483
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Rob, I want to take a quick step back and just first of all thank you.

484
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You were the first show that we got on last year to promote the Kickstarter.

485
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And it really means a lot.

486
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I've listened to your show since about 2006 on and off.

487
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I ran into Bobby at Southern Fried Gaming Expo,

488
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and we put your name in the magazine.

489
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I just want to say thanks a lot for having us on.

490
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Thank you so much. It's an absolute pleasure.

491
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And I like to kind of say,

492
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
oh, well, we were there catching this wave before it got big.

493
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah, absolutely.

494
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
When the first issue came out, I noticed,

495
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and I looked at the backer pages, I was like,

496
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
oh, orangeontrated.com is right there in the first position.

497
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I was like, well, that's kind of neat.

498
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And then, yeah, I had heard that that could be part of the reason why.

499
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
We were the first show that had you guys on.

500
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So fantastic.

501
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm glad we can give you guys a boost again this year,

502
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
just in case there's folks out there that still,

503
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
for whatever reason, have not heard of Retro Magazine.

504
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And yes, print media is still happening out there, still happening.

505
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Speaking of that, let me ask one more question I have here.

506
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Do you have advice to anybody else

507
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
that might decide to venture into the world of print media?

508
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Now, we are the voice of geeks network,

509
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
so we have a lot of different fandoms, not just video gaming.

510
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
We've got people that like British television shows and anime

511
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and all sorts of fandoms here.

512
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And I'm sure a lot of people are feeling like

513
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
they see the print media for their stuff slip away.

514
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I've seen everything from newsletters

515
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and what we used to call zines many years ago.

516
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I've seen all sorts of things.

517
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So what advice would you guys have

518
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
from what you've learned over the past year

519
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
to anybody else that might be ready to venture down this path?

520
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I think, first of all, it's easy to say,

521
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
but you've got to just go for it.

522
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And then you figure out a way to make it happen,

523
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
especially if what you want to talk about

524
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
would resonate with people to read magazines.

525
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Like old video game magazines, that resonates with people.

526
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So generally, I'm thinking,

527
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
probably a lot of your people grew up reading magazines

528
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
and whatever hobby they like.

529
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And those magazines probably are disappearing.

530
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Maybe they didn't have magazines in the first place

531
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
if they were really small hobbies.

532
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But generally, you're not the only kind of people that like something.

533
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
There's other people out there.

534
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And we've just found that people still really like the magazines

535
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and don't think that we're crazy.

536
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But there's a lot of work that's involved.

537
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And it helps if you've got connections.

538
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Honestly, if Marc wouldn't have come to me,

539
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I was going to do a digital magazine originally,

540
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
and Marc, who happens to be in that business,

541
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
kind of sought me out and heard what I wanted to do

542
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and said, let's do a print magazine.

543
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And at first I thought, you're nuts.

544
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But luckily for me, he had a background in it.

545
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
He had the printing contacts and the desire and will

546
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and aptitude to lay out a complete magazine by himself.

547
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's insane.

548
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So we got a little bit lucky that way.

549
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But with the software and stuff out there these days,

550
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
if you wanted to do it and do it yourself and start small,

551
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I think you probably could do it.

552
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
But just nail your costs down.

553
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Yeah, just go out there and do it, really.

554
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
There's a lot of technological advances

555
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
that happen with printing.

556
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So we print on a traditional big web press.

557
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
We ship out through the mail and everything,

558
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
polybagger magazines.

559
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
But I mean, there's print on demand services

560
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
through places like Jumag or MagCloud,

561
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and all these other things.

562
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So you could put out a digital magazine.

563
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And let's say it's something that you

564
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
start with some people you know.

565
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And then you want to offer a print version.

566
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
People can ante up and pay and have it shipped to them

567
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
directly, sort of like a one-off print on demand.

568
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So I mean, go out there and do it.

569
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I mean, we love it.

570
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And we didn't really skip on any of the,

571
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
we don't print on cheap toilet paper.

572
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
We have really nice quality paper.

573
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
We have high quality stock for our covers and everything.

574
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
We want this to be something that you put on the shelf.

575
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And we're going after a certain market, people

576
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
that collect games, that want to have something to hold on to.

577
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So I mean, if you love it, go out, do it.

578
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
You'll feel better for it.

579
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And there's a lot of options right now.

580
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So yeah, absolutely.

581
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Follow your dream.

582
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Excellent.

583
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Well, again, if you guys want to check out Retro Magazine,

584
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
check out their website, readretro.com.

585
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And of course, the Kickstarter, readretro.com slash Kickstarter.

586
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I got that right.

587
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Correct?

588
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You got it.

589
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
All right.

590
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Awesome.

591
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Well, before we close up here, I always

592
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
like to ask this question of all the guests

593
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
out there on the show.

594
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
What games are you playing right now?

595
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So what games are you into right now?

596
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I'm curious if you're playing retro games

597
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
or maybe there's newer games that have your eye right now,

598
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
which is totally fine too.

599
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I play both.

600
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Mark, I'll start with you.

601
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What games are you playing right now?

602
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
OK.

603
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Classic games right now.

604
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm playing through R-Type 1 and 2 as best I can on Ouya.

605
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Really hard.

606
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I keep going back to it.

607
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'm like, man, I don't remember this being so hard.

608
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But any shmup that I can't.

609
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And I'm pretty good.

610
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I have a Neo Geo cabinet and everything.

611
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I mean, having a hard time getting past the third level

612
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
in both games.

613
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And it's like, ugh.

614
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But Borderlands, Borderlands, Borderlands,

615
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
as far as the new stuff.

616
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Just a big fan of the Borderlands series.

617
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Can't praise it enough.

618
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yeah.

619
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Clearly, you must have picked up the pre-sequel.

620
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh, yeah.

621
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yep.

622
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Awesome.

623
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Awesome.

624
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Mike, how about you?

625
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Oh, gosh.

626
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So I'm going to come on the total opposite end

627
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
of this spectrum.

628
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
First of all, I've not been playing a lot.

629
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Because it's just, I don't know.

630
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
That's the sad part of being so busy.

631
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
He is true.

632
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But I did pick up the ColecoVision Flashback

633
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and the Intellivision Flashback.

634
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And I've been playing through some of the new homebrew games

635
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
on the ColecoVision Flashback.

636
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
There's about, I don't know, half a dozen of them

637
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
or so on there.

638
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I forgot those were coming.

639
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I need to get those.

640
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Thank you for reminding me.

641
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Those are out.

642
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I mean, you know, 40 bucks at Toys R Us.

643
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I think Intellivision, I just saw something come down

644
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
by Facebook, a Groupon for the Intellivision Flashback.

645
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Oh, I needed a 60-week original one.

646
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You know, 60 built-in games.

647
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
You know, you've got the original looking Intellivision controller.

648
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
They're pretty decent little systems, you know.

649
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And there's certainly going to be games on there.

650
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You've got the base plates.

651
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
That is awesome.

652
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

653
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
They've got the controller overlays and stuff.

654
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
They'll come with that.

655
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And again, there's some new homebrew games on there

656
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
that are real good, you know.

657
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So if you kind of grew up, you know, in that era

658
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and you want some new games to play,

659
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
the other great thing about these is a lot of the rare games that,

660
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
you know, the cartridges may be 50 to 100 bucks,

661
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
there's probably a dozen of them on this thing.

662
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So you don't have to get the cartridge.

663
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You can get this flashback and play a lot of the harder to find

664
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
and more expensive games.

665
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But I'm trying to think of, like, a current game.

666
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
No, that was a great answer, Mike,

667
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
because, like, you literally have me going, like,

668
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
you know what, I have money on my Groupon account

669
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
from some gift certificates,

670
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
and if this Intellivision thing is on there, I'm buying one.

671
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It's a great gift to give somebody, too.

672
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Like, for that gamer that, you know, that, you know,

673
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
kind of has everything, I mean, they're really cool systems.

674
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Or a great gift to give myself.

675
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Exactly.

676
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah, there you go.

677
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Hey, even better.

678
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yo, hit titles.

679
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Adventure, Zaxxon, Pepper 2, Jumpman Engineer.

680
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Okay, I'll just buy that right now, then.

681
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Right?

682
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Right?

683
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I can't wait.

684
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Is there going to be, like, a Commodore 64?

685
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Well, I know they had that newer PC a few years ago

686
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
that also had the retro mode, but, you know,

687
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
one of these days, they're going to release,

688
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I think they have, like, a Commodore 64 joystick

689
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
or something that came out some time ago,

690
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
but, oh, that was my retro console.

691
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That was great, yeah.

692
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Hey, Mike, what was that TV that they had at CGE with this?

693
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Oh, yeah, so there's a new television that's out.

694
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It's from Crossley.

695
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
If you guys Google, I think if you just Google Crossley,

696
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
C-R-O-S-S-L-E-Y, they're the ones that are making

697
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
some of the new, like, in Target stores,

698
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
it's, like, the USB record players and stuff.

699
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But Crossley Retro Television.

700
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah.

701
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You're going to see this beautiful flat screen TV

702
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
with these big chrome knobs on it and this wood grain,

703
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
you know, kind of perimeter, you know,

704
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
around the edge of the TV, and they're pretty expensive,

705
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
but, man, they're really sharp, they're video game friendly,

706
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
they've got lots of inputs, and so those have been

707
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
kind of the new thing.

708
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And they've been working with Intellivision

709
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and a lot of these companies to bring these TVs

710
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
into the retro expos.

711
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
They have a 24-inch one for $229.

712
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Wow.

713
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I think they have them at Target,

714
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
or maybe you'd probably get them online,

715
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
but they're pretty sharp.

716
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Awesome.

717
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Wow, I learned some new stuff,

718
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and now I've just spent more money

719
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
thanks to this interview.

720
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's fantastic.

721
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Thanks, you guys.

722
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Well, I want to thank you guys again for coming on.

723
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Let me quickly read some of these comments here

724
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
we're getting in a chat room.

725
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
SSG100Matt says,

726
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
The digital PDF subscription are great for any medium.

727
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Absolutely, it's a great way to kind of get the magazine

728
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
on your iPad and all that stuff, right?

729
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Dungeonbuster, in response to the zine question,

730
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
saying, I wonder how many of these fanzine authors

731
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
went on to become full-fledged writers and editors.

732
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I bet quite a few.

733
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I know some people that started as podcasters

734
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
that do a lot of this, you know, big-time stuff now,

735
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
which is cool.

736
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Dungeonbuster also says,

737
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The old mags are great snapshots of the past in gaming.

738
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
The ads, the articles, and the excitement

739
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
were splashed on every page.

740
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Do you guys ever have the urge to run, like,

741
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
a classic video game ad of sorts in your magazine?

742
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Mark, I mean, I don't know.

743
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I mean, I guess first of all, I don't know if there's...

744
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I know a lot of the ezines and the fan magazines did that.

745
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I don't know for, like, a widely distributed magazine

746
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
if that's infringing on anything, you know?

747
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah, we have to be careful we don't get sued.

748
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I mean, I'd love to, but I don't know.

749
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Some of that stuff, I mean...

750
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And, you know, the ads that we've had in our magazine,

751
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I mean, we keep it to a minimum.

752
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
We only have, you know, four to six pages,

753
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
and we really feel everything we put in there

754
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
is, like, something you check out, you know?

755
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Video game box protectors or some class,

756
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
you know, retro game coming out.

757
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So we've been really fortunate.

758
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yeah, it's relevant.

759
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Awesome, awesome.

760
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Well, I'm going to go ahead and wish you guys the best of luck

761
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
with year two of Retro Magazine

762
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
and any other links or things you want to plug here

763
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
before I let you guys go.

764
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Mike, I'll start with you.

765
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Well, I'd just say, you know, readretro.com.

766
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
That's our website that, you know,

767
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
is kind of tagged onto that Kickstarter campaign.

768
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But the main thing is the website.

769
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I mean, we got a ton of writers over there

770
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
putting a lot of effort and time into creating new content,

771
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
you know, retro content.

772
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
We're trying to kind of fill the gaps

773
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
between the magazine deliveries, you know,

774
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
give people a place to kind of interact

775
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
and read what our writers, you know,

776
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
are talking about online every day, you know?

777
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And, again, just fill the gaps between the magazine

778
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
and really use the website to kind of complement the magazine.

779
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And I've just been really proud of the content

780
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
that we're getting up there,

781
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and we just want people to go and read it.

782
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
We got a lot of people spend a lot of time,

783
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
and I think there's some neat stuff there.

784
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
And it's all, you know, pretty timeless.

785
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
You know, there's not a lot of reviews for...

786
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
We have some new game reviews,

787
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
but, I mean, we're getting some pretty exclusive stuff,

788
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
some cool interviews.

789
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
We're getting some, you know, cool videos

790
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and stuff that you can kind of just read any time,

791
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
you know, and it's kind of timeless and resourceful.

792
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So, you know, I would just say, for me,

793
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
yeah, check out the website as well.

794
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Awesome. Mark, anything you want to add to that?

795
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Absolutely. SouthernFriedGameRoomExpo.com.

796
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It's a long link, but Bobby Blackwolf was there.

797
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I know the host of this show are pinball fans.

798
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
If you can make it out next year in Atlanta,

799
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
June 20th through the 22nd, it's a great show.

800
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Lots of really cool pinball stuff.

801
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Check it out. Like, get it on your bucket list

802
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
or calendar or whatever. Come out next year.

803
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I already do make my one trip to Atlanta a year for DragonCon,

804
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
but it sounds like you guys have quite the convention.

805
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I know Bobby's gone a few years there, and he's a fan.

806
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Well, this year was the first year.

807
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I mean, it was totally crazy, like naked people in the pool.

808
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You know, it was out of control. It was a good time.

809
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Why did I think it was like you were on year two or three?

810
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I guess I'm getting ahead of myself.

811
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I guess it was just that solid.

812
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It was like a second or third year convention.

813
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
It was so amazing. Yeah, it was a really good time.

814
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
That's why. All right, well, thank you guys again,

815
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
and congratulations on all your success with Retro Magazine

816
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
and I'm looking forward to year two,

817
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
as I'm sure a lot of people are,

818
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and thanks for keeping the print media alive.

819
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's fantastic.

820
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Thanks, Rob. Thanks for having us on again.

821
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Thanks again. Take care, you guys.

822
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Yeah, bye. Bye-bye.

823
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Again, that was Mike and Mark from Retro Magazine,

824
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and we wish them the best of luck with year two,

825
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
and that Kickstarter's going on right now,

826
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and as we mentioned earlier, they have made the goal,

827
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
but they are looking at stretch goals,

828
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
like they're going to make the magazine bigger,

829
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
add more pages, things along that line.

830
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So if you are feeling so generous,

831
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
you want to check out the magazine,

832
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I would urge you to go over to the Kickstarter.

833
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I believe, too, from what I'm reading on the Kickstarter,

834
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
if you want to get a subscription,

835
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
like if this is just even something that interests you,

836
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
you can lock it in now cheaper

837
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
than it's going to be after the Kickstarter's over.

838
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So if you're like, I want to get the magazine,

839
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
you might as well do the Kickstarter

840
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and get locked in for year two of Retro Magazine.

841
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Thanks again for them coming on the show.

842
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Always good to have them on.

843
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
How do you like that, Loki?

844
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
He's been listening since 2006.

845
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I had heard we were the first show that had them on.

846
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That's great.

847
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
That's pretty awesome.

848
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That's very awesome.

849
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Almost as awesome as this

850
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
ColecoVision Flashback Game Console that I now need to get.

851
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I know, right?

852
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Like, I see everybody linking it in our chat room there.

853
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
In fact, ActDeft sent me a link directly to Groupon

854
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
of this Intellivision Flashback Console there.

855
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
How much is that thing going to set me back

856
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
when it comes up here?

857
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Oh man, it even comes with the...

858
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Okay, see, here's the thing.

859
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I had the Intellivision lives on what, the Xbox

860
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
or whatever it was?

861
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Like, I remember on our old network, All Games,

862
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
they were really tight with the Intellivision guys

863
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
and I seem to remember for a while

864
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
they were pushing that Intellivision lives.

865
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
It was on like Xbox, right?

866
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So I remember getting a copy of that then,

867
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
but man, this Flashback Console comes

868
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
with one of those little disk controllers

869
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
with the number pad on it.

870
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Awesome.

871
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Forty bucks on Groupon.

872
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I think I'm going to have to buy that.

873
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah, the regular price on those is like $49.99.

874
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I gotta buy it.

875
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Somebody stop me.

876
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Alright, that's 60 titles on that.

877
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Although, if you can't get through Groupon,

878
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
according to Google here, at least the Colecovision one

879
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
is $39.99 at Bed Bath & Beyond,

880
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
the place that you'd probably never think to buy a retro console.

881
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Who would think to get a console at Bed Bath & Beyond?

882
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Oh my gosh. Wow.

883
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Alright, well...

884
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
That's what I grew up on, man, is the Colecovision,

885
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
so that's some awesome stuff.

886
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Although, those controllers look a little bit different than I remember.

887
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Alright, well, let's get into it.

888
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So from retro to current gaming,

889
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
let us get into how was your gaming week

890
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
and the types of video games that you've been playing this week,

891
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
and then we can finally get into our news.

892
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

893
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
My gaming week was okay.

894
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I mean, obviously, I bought a game system.

895
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Sadly, I did not play really anything on it.

896
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I just kind of got it ready.

897
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I got all those games that kind of bookmarked

898
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
with PlayStation Plus back when I had it,

899
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
because I had to renew it, because I let it lapse for a while.

900
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
But now I have another year in there,

901
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
because obviously if I'm playing multiplayer games,

902
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I got to have it anyways.

903
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
But I meant to do it at some point.

904
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I was just waiting for when I was going to have a PlayStation 4.

905
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So I renewed that,

906
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
and I just kind of downloaded everything that I had marked

907
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
that I wanted to play.

908
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So I have that all installed,

909
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
so I just had to go and play that.

910
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Really, the only game I kind of played

911
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
was just to test out the camera,

912
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
the playroom or whatever that's called, I think.

913
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yeah.

914
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So I had my son mess around with that.

915
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I was going to say,

916
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
your kids would probably get a real big kick out of that.

917
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yeah, my son liked it.

918
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
He's always skittish about everything,

919
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and I'm like,

920
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
they have these robots in there,

921
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
and he's like,

922
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
well, I don't know, robots are scary.

923
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm like, no, no, no, it's not scary.

924
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
So he liked it.

925
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
He liked, you know,

926
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
so I'll suck them back up into the controller area.

927
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I was like, okay, fine, I'll do that.

928
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
He's like, what's that noise?

929
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I'm like, they're stuck in the controller, see?

930
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So I'll shoot them back out.

931
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So he had fun with that.

932
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
So I messed with that a little bit.

933
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Sadly, that's probably the,

934
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I don't think I'm going to be using the camera very much,

935
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
but whatever.

936
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
That's cool to have anyways.

937
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And then I just preordered some stuff

938
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
that's going to be coming out,

939
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
you know, because Grand Theft Auto V,

940
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
you know, I got to have that.

941
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So I did that digitally, just for the fuck of it.

942
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I mean, whatever.

943
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I'm not going to sell that game.

944
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It's going to be awesome.

945
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And then Call of Duty,

946
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
just because I wanted that on PS3,

947
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
as well as PlayStation 4,

948
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
because I still have friends

949
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
that haven't bought a PlayStation 4 yet,

950
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
and we're going to be hopefully

951
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
upgrading that from Modern Warfare 2.

952
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So that, and then just working on my game,

953
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
still working on doing the new Unity GUI stuff

954
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
to redo my whole editor

955
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
so that I can quickly go through it

956
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
to make levels out of it

957
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
instead of just ships and stuff.

958
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And so that's what I've been working on,

959
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
just getting the new interface down for that

960
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
so that I can build stuff.

961
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And so I was just kind of working away at that.

962
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But, uh...

963
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Is your game retro-inspired?

964
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Because maybe you'll get covered

965
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
in that magazine someday.

966
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Retro magazine.

967
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Sort of.

968
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I mean, it's a 2D shooter, I guess.

969
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And it's got, it's going to have,

970
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I mean, the original idea was

971
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
it was going to be like the NES color palette and stuff,

972
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
so it was going to be very limited,

973
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
you know, looking like that.

974
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Kind of like, you know,

975
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
how they have those 3D NES games sometimes,

976
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
like, you know,

977
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
where it'll be just kind of blocky-looking stuff.

978
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
That's what the original idea was,

979
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
is it was going to look like that.

980
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Are you talking about, like, Vector?

981
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Are you talking about something like...

982
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
No, I'm talking about, like,

983
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
where they, like, take, like,

984
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
the Super Mario Brothers,

985
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
original Super Mario Brothers,

986
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
and they make, like,

987
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
a 3D web version of that or something like that.

988
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Where you can, like, pan the camera and stuff.

989
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Oh, okay.

990
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
That kind of thing.

991
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Where it's going to look...

992
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Paper Mario.

993
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Kind of like Voxels or something.

994
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Paper Mario is cool.

995
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I love Paper Mario.

996
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
But, no, not exactly.

997
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And I increased the color palette.

998
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It's, like, 88 colors now.

999
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So, but that's what I'm sticking with,

1000
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
is just 88 colors,

1001
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
and I'm working with that.

1002
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
But, yeah, so, sort of, I guess.

1003
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It's not entirely retro.

1004
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It's just kind of a bunch of things combined together.

1005
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But, yeah, that's pretty much it this week.

1006
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I mean, hopefully, I'm going to play some stuff

1007
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
on the PlayStation 4 next week,

1008
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
before I get shipped out,

1009
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
and then I'll just be working on my game

1010
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
while it's gone.

1011
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Well, actually, no.

1012
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I take that back.

1013
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
There is one game I purchased today

1014
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
that I will probably go back and play,

1015
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
but I'll get to that later.

1016
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
But, yeah.

1017
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
So, I'll be playing some more stuff,

1018
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
hopefully, this week.

1019
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'll get back to it.

1020
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
So, I'll be playing some more stuff,

1021
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
hopefully, this week.

1022
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Okey-dokey.

1023
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
My gaming week.

1024
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
You know, I've been insanely busy with,

1025
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
you know, I took the trip to Vegas.

1026
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm going to BlizzCon in a couple weeks.

1027
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I know.

1028
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Poor me.

1029
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
All these trips.

1030
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But it can still kind of take its toll on you

1031
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
with being busy.

1032
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And then I have my final Rocky show,

1033
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
which I talked about a couple weeks ago

1034
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
at the end of the show.

1035
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I have that coming up on Halloween.

1036
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So, I've been pretty insanely busy.

1037
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I have been squeezing in some video games

1038
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
here and there.

1039
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So, I do have a few things to talk about.

1040
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Final Fantasy XIV, which, you know,

1041
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
going to the Fan Fest, it did re-energize,

1042
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
you know, despite the problems I had with it.

1043
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It definitely re-energized, like,

1044
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
how, like, my love of the game

1045
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and how into it I am.

1046
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And they've got a brand new content patch

1047
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
coming on Tuesday that's going to add

1048
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
the Shiva battle.

1049
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
We'll finally be in there the last

1050
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Primal Battle for this expansion.

1051
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And, you know, some new dungeons,

1052
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
some other new features.

1053
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So, I'm really kind of pumped getting ready

1054
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
for that with that releasing on Tuesday.

1055
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
With some non-MMO games,

1056
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I played Pagle 2 on our week off

1057
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
because that came out on the PlayStation Marketplace.

1058
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That's been out for a while for the Xbox One folks

1059
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
because that's been exclusive,

1060
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
but it finally came out for PlayStation 4.

1061
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
So, I've been playing a little bit of that,

1062
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
which, you know, to be expected,

1063
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
a lot like Pagle 1,

1064
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
but they throw in some new little things

1065
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
like armored blocks,

1066
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
which I don't remember seeing in the first one.

1067
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
You have to hit them twice before they disappear.

1068
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Like, you know, I've kind of seen that

1069
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
in some breakout clone games,

1070
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
but didn't really see that in the first Pagle.

1071
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
So, you know, it's a very familiar formula,

1072
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
but, you know, it works well.

1073
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And the game's definitely on crack,

1074
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
like the first one was, you know,

1075
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
like the horse that literally will, like,

1076
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
fart like little rainbows and things like that.

1077
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Very silly types of stuff.

1078
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
So, cute to see that.

1079
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Other games.

1080
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Friday was a big, big game release day.

1081
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
There was a couple of them that came out,

1082
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and I've gotten to spend a little time with each of these.

1083
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Civilization Beyond Earth would be the first one,

1084
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
which, as you know, I love Civilization.

1085
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
The original's probably my favorite PC game ever,

1086
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
and I've been following with the series

1087
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
through Civilization V.

1088
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And, you know, at E3, I was fortunate enough

1089
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
to check out a sneak peek of Civilization Beyond Earth,

1090
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
and I was ready to put down the money right there.

1091
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
So I picked up Civilization Beyond Earth,

1092
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
which, you know, a lot of people will look at it and go,

1093
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
hmm, it just looks like Civ V in space,

1094
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
which on a purely kind of, like, just visual level,

1095
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
it probably does, like, look like that.

1096
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But the game has a little more depth than that.

1097
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Oh, the one screenshot I saw looked really weird.

1098
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I'm like, this doesn't look like Civilization.

1099
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Well, I think that's the hardest thing people are having with it

1100
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
is that Civilization has that familiarity with it.

1101
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You know, you're gonna research guns

1102
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
because I want to be able to make gunners

1103
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
and musket men that can shoot the enemy.

1104
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I'm gonna fight people like Queen Elizabeth and Gandhi

1105
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
and, you know, Abe Lincoln and all these very familiar things.

1106
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Civilization has that very, you know, sense of familiarity with it.

1107
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Civilization Beyond Earth has none of that

1108
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
because it's all about science fiction

1109
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
and, you know, what could be the future.

1110
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You know, if you ever played Alpha Centauri,

1111
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
it was very much like that too.

1112
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So Beyond Earth in some ways is a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri.

1113
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
One of the big, you know, game-changing things it does

1114
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
is that there's not just the land on the planet,

1115
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
but there's the land in orbit

1116
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
because you actually will fire some things into orbit

1117
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
because you have to, let's say you have to clear

1118
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
what they call miasma, or just poison.

1119
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
You might have to clear poison from squares,

1120
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
although miasma may not really be poison

1121
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
depending on how you kind of take the approach to the game.

1122
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I'll just kind of leave it at that.

1123
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Something else, the alien race.

1124
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
The first time I played the game, I went,

1125
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
oh, these aliens are like barbarians in civilization.

1126
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Kill them all, kill them all, kill them all.

1127
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
But as you start to play through the game the first time,

1128
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
you start to realize there's a path you can go down

1129
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
where you can coexist with the aliens

1130
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
instead of necessarily blowing them away.

1131
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So it was kind of one of those very interesting

1132
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
kind of self-check sort of things

1133
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
where my instinct was to just immediately kill the aliens

1134
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
because that is what civilization has taught me,

1135
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
is kill the intruders,

1136
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
but that may not necessarily always be the case.

1137
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
The technology system is completely different,

1138
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
and there's this whole new system in there,

1139
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and I apologize, I don't have a guide

1140
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
that tells me what everything is officially called in the game,

1141
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
but there's some type of system that involves harmony

1142
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and purity and these different types of

1143
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
how do you want your civilization to coexist on the planet,

1144
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
and that really drives the victory conditions for the game,

1145
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
which will also throw you for a loop if you're a Sith player

1146
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
because the victory conditions are not what you're used to before.

1147
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
You can still win through military dominance,

1148
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
but everything else has changed.

1149
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
So that took me a little bit to get used to at first.

1150
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
So yeah, I think there's enough in this game

1151
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
that differentiates it from Civ V.

1152
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Not everybody's going to like that differentiation,

1153
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
but I think it makes for an interesting and different experience

1154
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
that I think is worth the money.

1155
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I don't know if necessarily the game

1156
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
is going to end up being superior to Civ V,

1157
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
but it's a really great holdover at least until Civ VI,

1158
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
if you're a Civilization fan.

1159
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Come on, we all know Civ VI is going to happen at some point.

1160
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
It's just a matter of time, right?

1161
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Let's see, also in my gaming week, one other thing to mention.

1162
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Bayonetta 2 came out for the Wii U on Friday, and I did pick that up.

1163
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Haven't got to play a whole lot.

1164
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I only really played through the prologue

1165
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and then the first chapter and a little bit of the second chapter,

1166
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
so I can't really speak at length about the game,

1167
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
but it was all the excess and over-the-top,

1168
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
even in just the first opening scenes in New York City at Christmas time,

1169
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
just such excess over-the-top hilarity

1170
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
that I loved in the original Bayonetta game,

1171
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and I'm having a great time with it.

1172
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
If you're not very good at action games like me,

1173
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
they've totally dumbed down a mode

1174
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
where basically they'll just do the combos for you.

1175
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You can literally just button mash your way through Bayonetta,

1176
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
but if you don't want to do that, there's more intense skill levels too.

1177
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I think they have the one button mode, wasn't that in the first game?

1178
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
They did. Yeah, first climate.

1179
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I believe that was in the first game.

1180
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I don't think I played it that way

1181
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
because I think somebody else had introduced me to it.

1182
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I actually read there was some disabled gamers or something

1183
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
that were saying, like, that's fantastic

1184
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
because now I can play this game without having to, you know...

1185
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
That is very cool. That's very cool.

1186
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And there's a whole touchscreen control thing too.

1187
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I haven't really played at that with any extent.

1188
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Again, I haven't got to spend a lot of time with the game,

1189
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
but I know that is there as well if that's something people want to do.

1190
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So I realize there's a lot of people really pissed off.

1191
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The Bayonetta 2 did not come out for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One,

1192
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
that it is a Wii U exclusive,

1193
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
but this is the type of Wii U exclusive

1194
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
that Nintendo really needed in their back pockets.

1195
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
So suck it up.

1196
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
This is what video game competition is about.

1197
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And this is going to make the Wii U...

1198
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And I think somebody had asked earlier in chat,

1199
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
is this a Game of the Year contender?

1200
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
It's a little early for me to say personally,

1201
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
but the vibe I'm getting out there on Twitter

1202
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
and the other reviews and so forth

1203
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
is it very well may be,

1204
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
which, you know, the Wii U may not have a lot of games on it,

1205
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
but it sure produces a lot of very highly reviewed games.

1206
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
So definitely something worth looking into.

1207
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
All right. That was it for my gaming week.

1208
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Some housekeeping we have here coming up.

1209
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
So, of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,

1210
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio,

1211
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000

1212
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
and on YouTube as well, youtube.com slash orange launch radio.

1213
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Follow us on all those fantastic websites.

1214
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Some housekeeping.

1215
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Even though I was gone just this last weekend,

1216
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
guess what, guys, I'm really sorry,

1217
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
but I'm going to be at another convention November 9th, 10th.

1218
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I don't remember what the show day is in there,

1219
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
but it's the second week of November.

1220
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
It's basically in two weeks,

1221
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
so unfortunately there will be no live show that night,

1222
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
but good news for podcast listeners,

1223
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
really pushing for us to tape something in advance that week

1224
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
so you at least won't have to go the entire week with no o-l-r again.

1225
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
That's just the way things worked out.

1226
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I'm going to BlizzCon and Final Fantasy Fan Fest,

1227
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
but that'll be it.

1228
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
No more conventions for me for the year after that,

1229
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
so it just happens that they're all kind of back to back.

1230
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I will say this, though.

1231
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I gave really deep thought to that PlayStation convention that's happening in Vegas.

1232
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
You heard about that, right?

1233
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
That was all announced while we were out.

1234
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Did you hear about this?

1235
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
The PlayStation convention that they're going to do in Vegas?

1236
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Yeah, so Sony's putting on their own event in Vegas,

1237
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
and I really wanted to go.

1238
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I just don't think I'm going to be able to make it work financially

1239
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
and with the time away from my day job

1240
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
because I'm doing so much this past month.

1241
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I wish I'd had more time.

1242
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I wish they gave more notice so I could have prepared more.

1243
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I hope those of you guys that do go have a fantastic time, however.

1244
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
All right.

1245
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Speaking of PlayStation, I think we're going to start off the news tonight

1246
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
with some PS news, right, Loki?

1247
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Yes.

1248
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So this is pretty cool.

1249
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I just got a system, and now they're going to be rolling out that 2.0 update

1250
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
that's going to add a bunch of cool stuff,

1251
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
including that SharePlay, which was the thing that they were talking about

1252
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
originally when they debuted the PlayStation 4,

1253
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
where basically you can connect up with somebody else

1254
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
and do several different things,

1255
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
including either playing a couch co-op game with them over the Internet,

1256
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
which is pretty awesome,

1257
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
or you can literally what they call pass the controller,

1258
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
so you can have someone play one of your games that they don't even own

1259
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
and they don't even need a copy of over the Internet.

1260
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
And so that's going to be pretty cool.

1261
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
It's coming out on Tuesday, October 28th.

1262
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Along with that, they're going to be also doing the ability to play music

1263
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
from USB drives connected to the console

1264
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
and trying to see what other features that they have in there.

1265
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I'm sure a whole bunch of other stuff, a dedicated YouTube app as well.

1266
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So, yeah, a few more days and we'll have this.

1267
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I am very much looking forward to this.

1268
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I think that SharePlay sounds awesome.

1269
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I know they announced this when the PlayStation 4 was first unveiled

1270
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
and they got a lot of shit for not having it out until now.

1271
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I kind of wasn't even expecting it to get out this soon.

1272
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And now that I kind of hear about it,

1273
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
if it really works as well as it seems to,

1274
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
that's going to be a game changer, pun intended.

1275
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
That's going to be a really interesting way to try out new games

1276
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
with your friends online.

1277
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It's almost like what Microsoft was talking about with the Xbox One,

1278
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
how they wanted to have that library that you could share with friends

1279
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
and stuff like that.

1280
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It's almost like kind of how they're implementing it there.

1281
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I'd be interested to see if that's something that they end up doing

1282
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
on the Xbox One later on down the road, calling it something else

1283
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
and just kind of piggybacking on the idea, I guess, if it works out.

1284
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Yeah.

1285
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Also, very curious, just as somebody who does a lot of the broadcasting things,

1286
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
as I know many of you do,

1287
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I'm very curious to see what these enhancements to the Twitch

1288
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
and the YouTube integration and all that entails.

1289
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So that's going to be really cool.

1290
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I like the fact that we will be able to directly put things on YouTube now

1291
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
instead of me having to copy what I do in ShareFactory to my drive

1292
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
and then taking it over to the computer and doing that whole thing.

1293
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
So that's going to be neat.

1294
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I wonder if they're going to enable YouTube live streaming

1295
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
because I know that they have that.

1296
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
That is a thing, huh?

1297
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I keep forgetting that YouTube does have live streaming,

1298
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
but it's the same thing as Google Hangouts pretty much, isn't it?

1299
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Sort of. I don't know.

1300
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
The only other show that I watch on a weekly basis, Cooking with Unity,

1301
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
they do their shows live,

1302
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
and so they broadcast them live on YouTube

1303
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
and then they have the archive up literally minutes later.

1304
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It would be cool to see something like that

1305
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
just because I don't know.

1306
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I don't really use Twitch, but I guess I will.

1307
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I had a Justin TV account,

1308
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
so I hope that got transitioned over at some point.

1309
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I'm sure it did.

1310
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
If you were marked as a games channel, then it did.

1311
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
If you didn't, then it didn't.

1312
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I think I've created a secondary one if I did.

1313
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I don't ever use it, so whatever.

1314
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Moving on to some other news.

1315
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Some big news that came out this week in the Wii U world.

1316
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:19,000
One of the other big games this holiday season besides Bayonetta 2 is Smash Bros. Wii U.

1317
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Until now, I feel like we've been given the impression

1318
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
that there wasn't going to be a lot of differences

1319
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
between the 3DS and the Wii U versions, which makes sense.

1320
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
They want to sell a lot of copies of the 3DS version,

1321
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
but then they announced this Nintendo Direct with 50 things

1322
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
that will be unique to the Wii U version.

1323
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And I've got to say, the cynic in me was like,

1324
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
oh, it will be eight new colors for these new characters,

1325
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and those will be the 50 things, right?

1326
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
But then the thing happened, and it was like, wow,

1327
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
there is a lot of new stuff that just kind of made the 3DS version

1328
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
really feel like a demo in some ways.

1329
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I know the 3DS version has its supporters.

1330
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
We got into this conversation a few weeks ago.

1331
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Portability has its perks,

1332
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
and there's only so much you can put in that 3DS system, right?

1333
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So for the 3DS, it's still a heck of a value.

1334
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It would be kind of weird to see what they could pull off

1335
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
on a Vita or something with that same game,

1336
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
being that it has a little bit more processing muscles.

1337
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Right, yeah.

1338
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
So here's some of the new stuff that's coming to the Wii U version.

1339
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
First off, the big one that had everybody talking,

1340
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
eight player battles.

1341
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Eight people all playing each other.

1342
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
That is going to be crazy.

1343
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
But is that locally?

1344
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I believe it is locally and across.

1345
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I don't want to misrepresent that, though.

1346
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Hold on, I have a little story on this here.

1347
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
If it's over the internet, that might be pretty cool.

1348
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Locally, it's one of those things like I never have eight people over.

1349
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Well, it would also explain why the 3DSes can be used as controllers.

1350
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
That's how you can get more people in there.

1351
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Players can use as many as eight Nintendo 3DSes

1352
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
or eight GameCube controllers, but there are some restrictions.

1353
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Only seven Wii remotes or Wii U Pro controllers can be used simultaneously,

1354
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U only supports a single tablet gamepad.

1355
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
So that's how that will work.

1356
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And nothing in the face of the earth supports two tablet gamepads.

1357
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
By the way, eight player battles have their own stages

1358
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
that will support eight people because those are going to be,

1359
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
as you can imagine, quite a mess with all those people in them.

1360
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
There's going to be a new board game mode called Smash Tour.

1361
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
There's going to be a ton of trophies.

1362
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Masterpieces mode returns from Brawl,

1363
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
which is basically demos of all the virtual console games that everybody was in.

1364
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
You know, something.

1365
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
The Stage Builder returns, which you might have forgot was in Brawl.

1366
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I remember that. I made a stage.

1367
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
But you can now build your own stages in this game as well.

1368
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And if you have both of the 3DS and the Wii U version,

1369
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
you can get a 2-disc soundtrack if you register them both on Club Nintendo.

1370
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
And DLC character, a new challenger approaches,

1371
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Mewtwo, going to be added to the game in spring of 2015.

1372
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
They weren't able to show him in combat, but they announced that he would come.

1373
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Still, this opens the door to, well, if they're going to do that one as DLC,

1374
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
there's going to be more.

1375
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
So, who knows?

1376
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Hey, your favorite characters that didn't show up in this one.

1377
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
All those pressed Lucas fans and Ice Climbers fans,

1378
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
all the characters that got cut might end up getting something after all.

1379
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And who knows?

1380
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I mean, maybe the people that are saying,

1381
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
oh, God, I'd love to see Bayonetta in the game.

1382
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Anything's possible at this point, right?

1383
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So, DLC characters are going to be a thing.

1384
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
So, that's pretty cool.

1385
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I mean, I was already going to buy it anyway,

1386
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
assuming it was just kind of a clone of the 3DS version,

1387
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
but it would be on my TV and in HD, and I'd be able to see it.

1388
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But then, after seeing this direct,

1389
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I was just rubbing my credit card on the screen.

1390
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It's not doing anything type of thing.

1391
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So, I'm very excited about this.

1392
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Very, very excited about this. Low-key.

1393
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Yeah.

1394
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
So, I don't know. I'm hoping that they do something.

1395
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Maybe it'll bring back Snake.

1396
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Everyone's hoping for Snake to come back,

1397
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
even though there's no Metal Gear games on the Wii U,

1398
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
and right now it doesn't look like there's going to be.

1399
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And I don't think they're going to be bringing back any of the assassins,

1400
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
since Ubisoft is actually going to be...

1401
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Hey, Rayman would be a good character.

1402
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Speaking of Ubisoft here.

1403
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Jade Raymond has actually decided to leave the company.

1404
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Now, she was attached to a lot of really big franchises at Ubisoft,

1405
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
including, she started off with the Assassin's Creed series,

1406
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
and then, of course, Splinter Cell and Watch Dogs, that kind of stuff.

1407
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Well, now, after 10 years being at the company,

1408
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
she's decided to part ways,

1409
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
and kind of, I guess, leading, going on a different path.

1410
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I don't know what exactly.

1411
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Maybe, maybe she is going the whole indie route,

1412
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
because it seems to be that's where all these people are going

1413
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
after they depart these companies for a long time.

1414
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
It's like, oh, hey, I want to work on this.

1415
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Very well could be.

1416
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Let me ask the question that I'm sure some cynics are asking,

1417
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and I kind of don't believe this to be true,

1418
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
but I'm going to say it anyway.

1419
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Could this be related to the foot-in-mouth Assassin's Creed comment

1420
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
about it's too hard to render female characters?

1421
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I don't think so, because I don't think she was working on that one.

1422
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I don't think she was part of...

1423
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Because she started on the first Assassin's Creed game,

1424
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
but I don't think she was on the latest one.

1425
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Yeah, I don't think...

1426
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Let's be honest.

1427
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
But you know people are saying that on Twitter,

1428
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
so I just had to bring it up.

1429
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
It's okay.

1430
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Obviously, it's not harder to render those characters.

1431
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,000
It's just extra work to create new characters or something.

1432
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It's just something that they've got to do.

1433
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
They're cutting corners on a lot of these things.

1434
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I don't know, whatever.

1435
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Just take it as it is.

1436
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
They don't want to put a female character in their game.

1437
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
That's it. Done. Whatever.

1438
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Not every single game on the face of the earth

1439
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
has to have a female character that's playable in the game.

1440
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Same with male characters.

1441
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Not every single game out there has to have a male character playable in the game.

1442
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Where's my male Samus in Metroid?

1443
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It doesn't matter.

1444
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Whatever the game that they want to make has this character,

1445
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
and it doesn't have to be fucking equal across the board.

1446
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I think what was problematic about that whole thing

1447
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
was more the way they answered it.

1448
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
They should have just said,

1449
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:46,000
this particular story is going to be a male narrative,

1450
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
and we didn't render other characters for the co-op mode.

1451
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
They did not want to admit that they didn't want to render

1452
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
all these other characters for the co-op mode.

1453
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
That's really what it came down to.

1454
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
But anyway, that's a months-old debate.

1455
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
It's pointless at this point.

1456
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It's stupid. I mean, come on.

1457
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It's dumb.

1458
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Whatever. It is what it is.

1459
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

1460
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
of some games that are coming out very soon,

1461
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
of which, ironically, isn't the new Assassin's Creed on deck for the US this week?

1462
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I could be wrong. It's really soon.

1463
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
You would have been right if they hadn't moved the dates.

1464
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Oh, I didn't realize they moved it.

1465
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Yeah, because they wanted to put it out at the same time

1466
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
as the Assassin's Creed Rogue game,

1467
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
which is coming out later in November on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1468
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But since it's not coming out right then,

1469
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
they just didn't do it.

1470
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
But anyways, so this week,

1471
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
a game that I probably would have picked up had I bought an Xbox One.

1472
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
But Sunset Overdrive coming out on Xbox One,

1473
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
one of the best-looking games, I think, out of E3 this year.

1474
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
So that's something to look forward to picking up this week.

1475
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And hopefully, hopefully, they go the route like they did with Rise and Dead Rising,

1476
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Sure, it's exclusive to the Xbox One, but we're going to see a PC version sometime.

1477
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Lords of the Fallen on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

1478
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:14,000
We've got Disney's Big Hero 6 on 3DS and Nintendo DS.

1479
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1480
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1481
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
No, this is almost the same title as the movie,

1482
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Danger of the Ooze.

1483
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It's a new game coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and I think the 3DS.

1484
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Freedom Wars from Sony coming out on the Vita.

1485
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Probably was going to be the last Vita game that they're going to put out from Sony there.

1486
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Assassin's Creed The Americas Collection,

1487
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:51,000
which is a re-release of Assassin's Creed 4 and Assassin's Creed 3.

1488
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
The Murica Collection.

1489
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Murica and then Liberation as well.

1490
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1491
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Yeah, no Wii U, sorry.

1492
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
MX vs ATV Supercross on PS3 and 360.

1493
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And let's see, WWE 2K15 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

1494
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,000
And I want to say it's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, although maybe that was delayed.

1495
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I think that was delayed.

1496
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And then, also delayed.

1497
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
NBA Live 15 coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1498
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Hopefully this year doesn't suck.

1499
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And Power Rangers Super Megaforce.

1500
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
They're just making up names now and that's on 3DS.

1501
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And The Legend of Korra, a new era begins on 3DS

1502
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
because that was the only game that actually got a physical release.

1503
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
All the other ones were on digitally.

1504
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
That's it.

1505
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Alright, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases there on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1506
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Metro Redo is on the PlayStation 4.

1507
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
And Oni Chambara, Z2 Chaos.

1508
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Hey, there's something you can import for the PS4, Loki.

1509
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:04,000
You better believe it that I am importing Earth Defense 4 or whatever the hell they're calling the new one on PlayStation 4.

1510
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Of course.

1511
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
On the Xbox One in Japan this week, Metro Redo is there as well.

1512
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
And Sunset Overdrive, day one edition.

1513
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
It also sees its Japanese release this coming week.

1514
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel makes its way to Japan.

1515
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
We got it first here in the States, but Japan's getting it this coming week.

1516
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
That is also happening on the Xbox 360 for all those Japanese 360 owners.

1517
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
On the Wii U, sadly nothing to report.

1518
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
The next big release over there is on November the 13th.

1519
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
So things are a little dry there on the Wii U front.

1520
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:42,000
But on the 3DS, there's Illuminage Ibun Ame no Mi Hashira Kai comes out this week from Starfish.

1521
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
This game is... I'm trying to figure out what this is.

1522
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
There's no screenshots or nothing.

1523
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It just looks like anime characters holding swords and a cute little like cat avatar character.

1524
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,000
So maybe somebody in chat knows a little more about this than I do.

1525
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
But there's no screenshots or anything for me to tell you what that game's all about.

1526
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So let's travel over to Europe.

1527
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Dark Soccer's not here tonight, but I am.

1528
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
So I will tell you about what is coming out in Europe.

1529
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And on the 28th, we have MX vs ATV Supercross on PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Mac.

1530
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I believe I saw this one at E3.

1531
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And it was like a little racing game, but of course it uses the motorcycles.

1532
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,000
It kind of felt like what Iron Man's super off-road might look like in motorcycles in 3D.

1533
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
That's kind of what it looked like to me.

1534
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Which one?

1535
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
You remember Iron Man?

1536
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
MX vs ATV Supercross.

1537
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
What was it?

1538
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
MX vs ATV Supercross.

1539
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
There's other games in this series that are out there.

1540
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Yeah, this is the first one that I think they've put out since Nordic took them over.

1541
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Because it used to be THQ.

1542
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Correct.

1543
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It is.

1544
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
It is.

1545
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
On the 29th, you have Freedom Wars on the Vita.

1546
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And The Unfinished Swan gets its PlayStation 4 and Vita release.

1547
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And then on the 30th of October, Farming Simulator 15 on the PC.

1548
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I know we got Farming Simulator fans out there.

1549
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
If you want it on consoles, it's coming out in January.

1550
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Did you know I took a picture of something Farming Simulator.

1551
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
They had a cute mascot or something at E3.

1552
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And they got some Twitter rando that was like, tell me more, tell me more.

1553
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I was like, dang, Farming Simulator has some hardcore fans out there.

1554
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
They seriously do.

1555
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
And I think their first version is going to be on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1556
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Or maybe just PlayStation 4.

1557
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
That's coming out in January.

1558
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Do not confuse it with Farmville or they will kick your ass.

1559
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition on PC and Mac.

1560
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And on Halloween or the 31st of October in Europe, Sunset Overdrive.

1561
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Walking Dead Season 1 for Xbox One.

1562
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Walking Dead Game of the Year Edition for PlayStation 4.

1563
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Walking Dead Season 2 for PlayStation 4.

1564
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Walking Dead Season 2 for Xbox One.

1565
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And WWE 2K15, PS3, and Xbox 360.

1566
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were delayed to November 9th, I think of it.

1567
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Yeah.

1568
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
That was one of the things that happened while I was still working at my old company.

1569
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Ah, gotcha.

1570
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Did you start the new job already, by the way? Are you still on your break?

1571
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
No, I was an alternate for the first class and because it's such a good company, everybody showed up.

1572
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
But hey, I got paid for two hours even though I was there for only like five minutes.

1573
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So it's all good.

1574
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Dope.

1575
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I do start officially on the 5th.

1576
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
There you go. Alright.

1577
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I'm not an alternate this time. First in line.

1578
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Awesome.

1579
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Yeah.

1580
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Alright, let's go to a few more news stories.

1581
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And then the classic game of the week, which, you know, when Dark Soccer is not here, we take it over.

1582
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
And it was Loki's turn this week, pick classic game of the week.

1583
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So Loki's gonna pick one in just a minute here. But first, some news.

1584
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
This should be just filed under, like, you gotta be fucking stupid to do this in the first place.

1585
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But you did it, so suffer the consequences.

1586
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:45,000
But apparently, a guy, Mike Malbeck, who is an indie developer who, part of an indie development team, I guess.

1587
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
They created a game called Paranautical Activity.

1588
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:55,000
It was a Steam game, like a first-person shooter voxel-looking retro-styled game or something.

1589
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And he had some issues where, I guess, they were doing, like, a sale or something to that effect.

1590
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And it was listing the game as early access, even though it wasn't an early access game.

1591
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
It was early access at one point, but now it's like the full version of the game.

1592
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And he got really miffed that he couldn't, you know, change that.

1593
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:23,000
And so he did what any sane, logical person would do. He went to Twitter and said,

1594
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I'm gonna go kill Gabe Newell. He is gonna die.

1595
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And apparently, you know, people don't like that sort of thing.

1596
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:38,000
So Valve pulled the game off of, you know, the sale, and they, you know, ceased their relationship with the developer.

1597
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Good. What a fucking idiot. Sorry, not sorry. What a fucking idiot.

1598
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,000
They're like, yeah, we don't really want to do business with people that make death threats, so sorry, you know.

1599
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And of course, you know, later on, you know, the Mike Malmak guy, he's basically leaving the developer code avarice,

1600
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:06,000
and he sold his half of the company, and he won't be making any money from it, distancing himself as far away from it as he can.

1601
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:13,000
But you gotta be fucking stupid. Like, seriously, just, I understand you're frustrated,

1602
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:18,000
but, you know, if you're gonna say, oh, I'm gonna fucking kill those guys at Valve, you know,

1603
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,000
do it in, like, not a public forum if you're gonna make those kind of things.

1604
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Like, say it to yourself and shake your fist at the sky or something, but just, like, don't, like...

1605
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Especially with the state of gaming and social media the past couple months.

1606
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
And y'all know what I'm talking about. I don't have to get into it, alright?

1607
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
But especially with how volatile everything has been. We've been in, like, code orange, right?

1608
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Okay, if, like, gaming had an alert system, we'd be in, like, code orange right now.

1609
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Especially as how volatile everything has been in the industry.

1610
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Like, haven't we learned yet that making death threats is not okay ever?

1611
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And for, like, somebody who develops games to be doing that is just, like, get out of the pool. You out.

1612
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,000
And you do realize that Gabe Newell isn't the only person that works at Valve that's, you know,

1613
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
he's not behind a computer, he's, like, setting up your fucking game and shit, you know, for the sales.

1614
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
It's not this one dude in, like...

1615
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Even if you knew the guy that did it or gal that did it, still not okay. I want to make that perfectly clear.

1616
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:28,000
But, yeah, I mean, everybody at Valve does everything, though. Nobody has a title at Valve, right?

1617
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Except for Gabe.

1618
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Whatever. But, yeah, so, Gabe pulled off there, but, you know, of course, he's just like,

1619
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
eh, it's no big deal. It's, you know, we sold 12 copies off of Steam, so we're gonna be okay. Whatever.

1620
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:50,000
But, yeah, it's just a lesson in common sense, you know, as if we even need to tell you, just don't make death threats.

1621
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, these people have to understand that Twitter isn't a place to be venting out frustrations over something because it will cost you your job.

1622
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:05,000
This is true in a lot of different facets, and just, you know, with social media becoming more and more a part of culture,

1623
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I'm just telling you, in general, this even goes beyond video games. Like, if you are really fucking pissed off about something, anything,

1624
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
if you are really, really mad about something, put your goddamn phone down.

1625
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Put it down, put it away, get it far away from you so that you are not tempted to write something stupid.

1626
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And I'm not even just talking about, like, death threats, but just, like, you know, stupid shit, complaining about, you know, complaining about where you work,

1627
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:40,000
where you have a public Twitter, where your company may be big enough where they have, like, social media people that search Twitter for the name.

1628
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I mean, like, that kind of shit can get you in so much trouble. It's, like, just a life lesson here.

1629
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:54,000
When you are pissed off, get away from your computer ASAP, whether it's gaming or anything.

1630
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:05,000
So, now, of course, you know, if you can do it in a reasonable manner, you know, because sometimes you can complain to companies, like, you know, tweet at Taco Bell,

1631
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,000
that quesarito really sucked, you know, or something like that. That's a little bit different.

1632
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
That quesarito makes me want to die, really.

1633
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:20,000
True story, I had a quesarito today for the first time. I got through two bites before I was like, this is fucking disgusting.

1634
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Anyway.

1635
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Quesarito in the potty, I don't know. I can't make a pun joke with that.

1636
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Our pal Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying, there was so, so much I wanted to say this morning on something not vog-related, and I had to put the phone down.

1637
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Jason in chat says, super good advice, spread happy, not vitriol. See, I'll suggest always keep accounts set to private.

1638
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
You know, I kind of feel like, though, that might not always be an option.

1639
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:57,000
You know, like, I feel like I have more to gain from a public account because I have these public-facing things that I do,

1640
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:06,000
but I do try really hard to keep my work life or my OLR podcasting life or whatever separate from, you know, the rest of my life.

1641
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
But Bobby, don't you know they cast the shows differently in London than they do over here?

1642
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I mean, after all, there is the UK office and the US office, right?

1643
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Sorry, I feel free, man. That's terrible.

1644
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Alright. Anyway, let's move on. Talking about 3D Realms. 3D Realms is, of course, a classic PC publisher,

1645
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:40,000
and, you know, so many great games from back in the day, like Duke Nukem, of course, back when Duke Nukem was a side scroller.

1646
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Hell yeah.

1647
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Commander Keen, also amazing.

1648
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
When am I getting my next Commander Keen game?

1649
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I don't know. Well, maybe if they sell enough copies of this because the 3D Realms Anthology is now available at 3drealms.com,

1650
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:00,000
and it's a collection that has games like Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Commander Keen, Goodbye Galaxy, Wolfenstein 3D,

1651
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Rise of the Triad, Dark War, and all these other classic games. It's in a DRM-free package.

1652
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Where's my Redneck Rampage? Didn't they do that one? I thought that was in the Duke Nukem 3D engine.

1653
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I will look here, but there are some games available for free, so if you want to check out Alien Carnage,

1654
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Major Striker, and Stargunner, I mean, come on, they're not going to give away Commander Keen for free,

1655
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:30,000
but these other games, you can get those for free. Now, the article I'm reading says that the pack is $19.99,

1656
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
but actually, looking on the site, it's $39.99, so I'm not sure if it was, like, on sale for a couple days,

1657
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:40,000
and then they raised the price back up, but it's $39.99 for the Anthology, so you can check that out.

1658
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,000
But, I mean, that's a lot of classic games available there, so...

1659
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Now, just so you know, 3D Realms, the staff has been gone since 2008, because remember, like,

1660
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Gearbox had to pick up Duke Nukem and all that, right? Duke Nukem and the other PC franchises,

1661
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:03,000
they did retain the rights to this. Developer Interceptor Entertainment, who made Rise of the Triad,

1662
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
acquired Apogee Software earlier this year, so now they control the associated IP and branding.

1663
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It's complicated. Who owns all that stuff? That's why there isn't a new King game.

1664
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
The next time, another Duke Nukem game, because I'm still going to forget who owns what.

1665
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And Dungeon Buster in chat says Redneck Rampage was pubbed by Interplay, so it was a little bit different arrangement there.

1666
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
So, again, makes things complicated.

1667
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Damn it. Redneck Rampage would be perfect for a remake.

1668
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah.

1669
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Let somebody get Devolver Digital on that.

1670
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Alright, well, let's take a walk down memory lane here in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

1671
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:51,000
And, as you know, Dark Soccer will usually step into the vault and pick out a game that she thinks is worthy of being a classic,

1672
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
and, hey, you guys should be playing this game this week.

1673
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
So, the rules to be a Classic Game of the Week is that the game has to be ten years old or more.

1674
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That is what we call a classic game.

1675
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Dark Soccer, of course, is not here tonight, so I think I filled in for her the past two or three times,

1676
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
so I was like, you know what, Loki, it's well past your turn.

1677
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Loki tonight is going to pick the Classic Game of the Week with Dark Soccer moving this week.

1678
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
So, Loki, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1679
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,000
The Classic Game of the Week just turned ten years old today.

1680
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Ten years old today.

1681
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Today. Today is the tenth anniversary of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1682
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:38,000
One of the best PlayStation 2, Xbox, 3D action games ever.

1683
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
It was seriously the best Grand Theft Auto game up until 4 and 5,

1684
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
and had one of the largest maps in the whole game.

1685
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Basically, it came out October 26, 2004 on PlayStation 2,

1686
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:59,000
later in June the following year on Xbox and PC.

1687
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Ironically enough, they actually re-released it today on Xbox 360 in the HD version,

1688
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,000
which you can pick up for the price of the games on demand version, which is only like $3.74.

1689
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
It's ridiculously cheap, so go check that out.

1690
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:21,000
But the game followed around kind of an ex-gang banger, CJ.

1691
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:27,000
He comes home after his mom's been murdered back to Los Santos,

1692
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
which is kind of the modern day LA.

1693
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
And the whole game is set in the 90s, which is cool.

1694
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
It had one of the greatest soundtracks ever.

1695
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:44,000
But anyways, he comes back and finds the gang's kind of torn apart,

1696
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,000
and he has to regroup his gang and fight against cops,

1697
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
and find out who actually murdered his mother and stuff like that.

1698
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:01,000
What's kind of cool is the game takes place not only in the fictional state of San Andreas,

1699
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
which is like California and Nevada,

1700
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
and takes place in Los Santos, which is kind of LA,

1701
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
San Fierro, which is San Francisco-ish,

1702
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
and Las Venturas, which is kind of like Las Vegas.

1703
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,000
So it was the first time it was like a multi-city game, which is pretty awesome.

1704
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
It was one of the best-selling games of...

1705
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
It became one of the best-selling games on PlayStation 2.

1706
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
27 million copies.

1707
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
It's still one of the best-selling games of all time.

1708
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Oh, it is the best-selling game of all time on PlayStation 2, so that's pretty awesome.

1709
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Of course, one of the things that made the game infamous was the fact that

1710
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:50,000
there was some content that was taken out of the game that later modders found,

1711
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
which kind of brought this whole controversy with the ESRB,

1712
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
known as the Hot Coffee mod,

1713
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
where it's a hidden sex game that they're going to have in the game,

1714
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
since you can date a bunch of people in the actual game.

1715
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
You can make girlfriends and stuff like that.

1716
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:10,000
It was also the first Grand Theft Auto game that featured co-op,

1717
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
and not a lot of people realized this,

1718
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
but you can actually, if you date those girlfriends,

1719
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,000
you can go out and have a person with you playing on the second controller,

1720
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
and you can go shoot up stuff in Grand Theft Auto.

1721
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
It was awesome.

1722
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
It's been released on a bunch of different platforms,

1723
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:39,000
aside from the original release on PlayStation 2 and on the original Xbox.

1724
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
It's been released on Mac, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network.

1725
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
They also did some of these HD versions on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Kindle,

1726
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
that kind of stuff.

1727
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:59,000
And they said, of course, they just took down the original game off the Xbox Live Store,

1728
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
and they were saying that they're going to re-release an enhanced version

1729
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
to celebrate the 10th anniversary.

1730
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Well, that was released today, so pretty awesome.

1731
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Do you know what is mind-fucking me right now?

1732
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Because we talk about this game turned 10 years old today, right?

1733
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
And this game was highly controversial because of the hot coffee mod.

1734
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Okay, get this.

1735
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Episode 28 of the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition,

1736
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
back when it was a separate thing,

1737
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
taped July 11th, 2005.

1738
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
One of our top stories, rock star investigated by the ESRB over hot coffee.

1739
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,000
And then Episode 29 on July 18th of 2005 was a follow-up about this whole thing.

1740
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I was like, I remember this was an early thing we talked about on OLR.

1741
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I still have the hot coffee version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on PlayStation 2.

1742
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Oh, my God.

1743
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
It's awesome.

1744
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
But, yeah, they had a bunch of other features in the game.

1745
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Of course, tons of vehicles in there.

1746
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:02,000
It was the first time, well, actually, no, I believe they had airplanes in there.

1747
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Also, they had a jet pack which was hidden in the game, which was kind of fun.

1748
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
You can sneak into an Area 51 type thing.

1749
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
All sorts of weapons.

1750
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
You can swim underwater.

1751
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
It's the first game to add BMX bikes.

1752
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
So you can do tricks and stuff with your BMX bike if you really wanted to.

1753
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Like, all this extra stuff.

1754
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
They had a bunch of different kind of RPG elements like gang wars.

1755
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
You can mod your card, a bunch of different side missions, burglary.

1756
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Lots of fun stuff like that.

1757
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
And Hitstone wants to know, why is the background music replaced by dialogue?

1758
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Can we put on Radio Los Santos or something?

1759
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
We're actually doing that because we don't want to get copyright strikes on YouTube.

1760
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I mean, the music in the game was notable for being a lot of great licensed songs.

1761
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
So, unfortunately, we don't want to replay that.

1762
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:54,000
So, sorry, you guys get the very coarse dialogue from the game that many people remember.

1763
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
All sorts of F and S and other bombs galore in the background there.

1764
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Yes.

1765
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
And, of course, won a bunch of game awards there.

1766
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
2004 Spike TV Video Game Awards.

1767
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
It was a game of the year.

1768
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Best performance by human mail.

1769
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Best action game.

1770
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Best soundtrack.

1771
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
They even have a lot of big names in there.

1772
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I want to say Samuel L. Jackson did Officer Tenpenny in there.

1773
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I'm trying to remember all the different actors that are in there,

1774
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:24,000
but there's just a lot of different people in the game.

1775
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
But, yeah, great game.

1776
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I mean, it was one of those games that I took off work to go play.

1777
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Actually, I want to say I've done that with every single Grand Theft Auto game.

1778
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
But, yeah.

1779
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:41,000
And, of course, one of the big games that I want to say, even like the ESRB,

1780
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
and I want to say Jack Thompson were even kind of rallying behind this.

1781
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:50,000
This is the reason why you should be banning games because they're terrible.

1782
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But, yeah.

1783
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
So, that's it.

1784
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
All right.

1785
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1786
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Dressed by a hare on its tenth birthday, the day it becomes eligible.

1787
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
There it is.

1788
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Grand Theft Auto.

1789
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Oh, here we go.

1790
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Here's a list of some of the celebrities in there.

1791
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,000
David Cross, Andy Dick, Ron Foster, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Peter Fonda,

1792
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Charlie Murphy, Frank Vincent, Chris Penn, Dan Dyer, Sarah Tanaka.

1793
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Wil Wheaton was in there.

1794
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
They had different rappers.

1795
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Icy, Chuck D. Frost, MCIte, also the game, George Clinton, Axl Rose, Sly and Robbie,

1796
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Sean Ryder, Young Melee.

1797
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I mean, Young Melee, of course, did Carl.

1798
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And, hopefully, with this being the tenth anniversary and stuff,

1799
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
and Grand Theft Auto 5 also taking place in Los Santos,

1800
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
we're going to get some sort of DLC.

1801
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I think CJ is going to be coming back.

1802
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
You think some type of crossover might be the worst.

1803
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Yeah, I think so.

1804
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
That'd be cool.

1805
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Hopefully.

1806
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
That'd be cool.

1807
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Maybe on the tenth anniversary of the hot coffee controversy is just in time for that.

1808
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
They should call it that.

1809
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:02,000
They should call it like the cappuccino mod or something that references it without saying it.

1810
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
That would crack me the hell up.

1811
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
We'll see.

1812
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Of course, then again, if you're a rock star, you probably want to get the hell away from all that business.

1813
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
All right, there's your classic game of the week.

1814
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Of course, Loki picked Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1815
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
But you know what? It really is.

1816
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I saw a comment in the chat room here that was,

1817
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I don't like this game.

1818
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
What is this?

1819
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Oh, here it is.

1820
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Bojokawa says, great choice.

1821
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Don't like the game, but great choice.

1822
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Even people that weren't so into this, you kind of recognize what a huge title it was in gaming,

1823
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
and the fact that you managed to do it on its tenth birthday.

1824
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
That's pretty good.

1825
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
It just happened to work out that way.

1826
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Yeah.

1827
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
All right, well, there it is.

1828
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Part A of our show.

1829
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
But we've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.

1830
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
We have more news.

1831
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
The Fugu Question of the Week.

1832
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And oh, by the way, did I mention the retro guys that were on the show earlier?

1833
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
They left behind a little giveaway.

1834
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Something, something.

1835
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:59,000
So we'll give you some details on that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1836
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

1837
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Tonight with our 572nd episode, October the 26th of 2014.

1838
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:19,000
And if you're tuning in to hear our interview with Read Retro Magazine, you're too late.

1839
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It happened already.

1840
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
It was in the first part of the show, but don't worry.

1841
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
It will be on the podcast feed later tonight after we wrap up the show.

1842
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And that was a great interview there with Mike and Mark from Retro Magazine.

1843
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
In fact, I think Mark is still in our chat room there.

1844
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:40,000
So if you guys have any other questions or so forth, you can ask Mark who's in our chat there right now.

1845
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
And I will say this.

1846
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Those guys over at Retro Magazine were kind enough to leave behind for us to give away a year's subscription to the print version of the magazine.

1847
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
So we're going to be giving that away.

1848
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:57,000
We'll open that up to both our live and our podcast listeners so that everything is fair.

1849
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:03,000
So check out that a little later because I want to give that away around our Frugal Question of the Week.

1850
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Because our Frugal Question of the Week kind of ties into this as well, the whole retro stuff.

1851
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Anyway, speaking of retro.

1852
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:18,000
So during the break tonight, I played some scary songs to go along with the fact that Halloween is this Friday.

1853
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Are you going to do any trick-or-treating with the kids?

1854
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Are you probably still too young?

1855
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I'm not. I'm staying home with the baby.

1856
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
But my son's going out as Captain America.

1857
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
So he's going out with his friend from preschool.

1858
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
That'll be fun.

1859
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
So in Halloween, I played some scary songs.

1860
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:41,000
And one of them that I played was a retro classic that I loved.

1861
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Friday the 13th, which had a great soundtrack.

1862
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Like even if you hated the game, the soundtrack was still pretty awesome there.

1863
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
So we played that during the break tonight.

1864
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
It kind of had me thinking about that game and how it really gets shit on.

1865
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
I think in a lot of people's memory.

1866
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
But I kind of enjoyed it.

1867
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
It used to legit scare the hell out of me.

1868
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
And I think it was because the music was so good.

1869
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Like when you were in the little...

1870
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Because you would go around if you never played it.

1871
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:18,000
You played counselors at a camp trying to prevent Jason from killing either the other counselors or the children that for some reason lived in the middle of the lake.

1872
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I figured that was the safest spot to put him in.

1873
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
So you played these counselors and went around.

1874
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,000
So when you'd actually go into the other cabins and come across Jason, it would scare the hell out of me.

1875
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Because you'd actually be going through the NES-style 3D.

1876
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Where it's like move forward, it's a big old jump.

1877
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Turn left, the whole screen changes.

1878
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
And then all of a sudden it would go...

1879
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
And Jason would come out of nowhere and you'd have to fight him.

1880
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And usually he'd kick your ass.

1881
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Because that game was really, really hard.

1882
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
You could run away from him, I think.

1883
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
And then he would actually chase after you in the 2D section of the game as well.

1884
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Yeah, and then sometimes he would be in the lake.

1885
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
You'd be rowing across the lake and he'd just be in the lake and it would be boom boom boom.

1886
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And you couldn't do shit about it.

1887
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
You couldn't hurt him or anything.

1888
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,000
And then when you would kill Jason, of course he came back at least two more times before you officially beat the game.

1889
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
So that game was impossible.

1890
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Any classic games that get dumped on, Loki?

1891
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
That everybody seems to hate, but you seem to appreciate?

1892
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Like, why does everybody hate this game but me?

1893
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Not to put you on the spot, I didn't prep you on this topic.

1894
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
So I'm just curious if anything comes to mind.

1895
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Ask this of our chat room as well over at live.voguenetwork.com.

1896
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Is there any retro classic everybody shits on?

1897
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
But you're like, it wasn't that bad.

1898
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Leave it alone.

1899
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I can't think of anything off the top of my head that was like that.

1900
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I'm sure there's something that I like that a lot of people didn't like.

1901
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I don't know.

1902
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
There were games I like that I feel like nobody's ever heard of.

1903
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Like on the Super Nintendo, one of my favorite games to this day was Equinox, which was the sequel to Solstice.

1904
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I think a lot of people knew that one on the NES.

1905
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
But it was a rare Sony game.

1906
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I remember, Sony didn't start making consoles.

1907
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
So Sony published this game on the Super Nintendo and it was amazing.

1908
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
It was that whole 3D isometric thing.

1909
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
But I don't think people hated that game.

1910
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
There's probably nobody ever heard of it.

1911
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
So let's see.

1912
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Some folks in chat talking about Friday the 13th.

1913
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Mark from Retro says, LJN's only good game, I think.

1914
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
ActDef says, LJN had some good games, but they were mostly crap.

1915
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
ActDef is suggesting Earth Defense Force 2017.

1916
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
People like that though.

1917
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
No one's arguing that it's a high quality game.

1918
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
That's not the case.

1919
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Everybody that plays it, they have fun with it.

1920
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
That's the thing.

1921
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Obviously if you're going to read a review score, it's like, well those graphics suck.

1922
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
The physics are terrible.

1923
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Yeah, of course. Those are all true facts about that game.

1924
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
It's just fun though.

1925
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Just play it because it's fun.

1926
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Dungeon Buster says, Deadly Towers.

1927
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Controls took some getting used to, but when she figured some things out, it was not quite as horrible as some others.

1928
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Let's see. Rama says, A notable LJN game was Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

1929
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Oh, I remember that one.

1930
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Mark from Retro says, My favorite Resident Evil was Outbreak 1 and 2 for PlayStation 2. So underrated.

1931
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Let's see.

1932
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Kaijuto says, The Nightmare on Elm Street game with 4 player co-op was my favorite and people shit on it.

1933
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Back to the Future 2 is another one for me.

1934
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Oh, wait. Back to the Future 2 on NES?

1935
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Yeah.

1936
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Even Back to the Future 2 and 3, but it's...

1937
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Yeah, I bought that game because I was like, oh, that looks sweet because Back to the Future 1 looked pretty awesome.

1938
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:42,000
You know, as an NES game and I played 2 and 3, I'm like, god, these are fucking terrible.

1939
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,000
It's just like so terrible and I got the cheat code to get Back to the Future 3.

1940
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I'm like, oh cool, it's Back to the Future 3. Oh wait, it's still fucking terrible.

1941
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Let's see. S3100Matt says, I know plenty of people who didn't like Thekster.

1942
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
That was one of the few games I grew up with on my i286.

1943
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Now, Cuntinues in our chatroom flips this around a little bit saying, everyone loves the first Silent Hill, but I think it's not that great.

1944
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
We can have a whole other conversation on what game is fucking overrated.

1945
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
But we'll have to have that on another episode because we have some rapid fire news to get into.

1946
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Let's be fair though. I say it's overrated, but honestly, I've never played it.

1947
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
What game?

1948
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Ocarina of Time.

1949
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Ocarina of Time.

1950
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
See, I just don't like the look of it.

1951
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
No, now we're gonna get emails.

1952
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:35,000
No, no, no, stop, stop. Here's a game that people don't like that I like a lot and that would be Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.

1953
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
People hate the art style in that. Absolutely hate it. I think it was fantastic.

1954
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I think that showed off the graphics on the GameCube really well.

1955
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I think that's the art direction that they should have gone with on the Wii to make their games look even better.

1956
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
But, whatever.

1957
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Alright, sorry chatters. Now the chatters are answering the other questions. Sorry chatters, we're rolling that over to another day.

1958
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:04,000
We have still plenty more show to go. We gotta get your calls later in the show at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1959
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
But first, some news. Loki.

1960
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Alright, so a little bit of rapid fire stuff here.

1961
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,000
We've got a million copies sold of the Stanley Parable.

1962
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:21,000
That's awesome because that's a pretty sweet game and if you haven't played it yet, you really should.

1963
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:32,000
But yes, a million copies sold of that. On top of that, if you're kind of a fan of those building games, not necessarily like a voxel game.

1964
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I mean, it's a sort of voxel, but Space Engineers sold a million copies as well.

1965
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:44,000
So, that's awesome. That is for indie developers. That is something that's incredibly hard to do.

1966
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Congrats, that's amazing.

1967
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Finally, we've got, oh let's see here. Also, another game for Mojang that you might not hear a lot about, but Scrolls.

1968
01:53:54,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Scrolls now is going to be exiting the beta stage and it's going to be releasing the game, I believe, November is going to be coming out.

1969
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:13,000
The first real version of the game that's not like a beta stage type thing.

1970
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Is this now a Microsoft product though?

1971
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
No, I don't think it is.

1972
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Oh, I thought Microsoft bought all the stuff that Mojang had.

1973
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Maybe they did, I don't know. It's still under Mojang, but that's going to be coming out.

1974
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:30,000
They said also that they're going to be dropping the price of the PC version of the game from $20 to $5.

1975
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Probably right. And then they're going to launch it on iOS and it's going to be free, but you're going to be able to use an in-app purchase to pay for the full version or something like that.

1976
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Neat. I don't know. Once again, for me, it's not as appealing as say Minecraft.

1977
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I'm curious. Plus, a lot of this, and I talked about the Microsoft connection a minute there, a lot of that is probably still kind of transitioning.

1978
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:04,000
This is probably one of the things where this was already planned before that all took place.

1979
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:11,000
But I'm curious. I like that they're going to have the free version, at least on the phones, even though I might prefer to play this on the PC.

1980
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:20,000
At least I'd be able to try it and kind of get a sense for is this my type of game, yes or no, before I commit that $5 to it, which is a pretty good deal.

1981
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:28,000
And then this is pretty cool. They're going to be putting out a game called The Doctor and the Dalek, which is a web-based game.

1982
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Featuring, of course, Doctor Who. And it teaches kids on how to code.

1983
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:43,000
So I think that's pretty sweet. They're going to have Peter Capaldi playing the Doctor in that.

1984
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:52,000
And I think anything that's out there to teach kids on how to do that stuff is fantastic.

1985
01:55:52,000 --> 01:56:02,000
And the game, of course, if you're in the UK, is going to be free. You can find it. It was at bbc.co.uk slash cbbc.

1986
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And, yeah, I think that's pretty awesome. And, you know, hopefully if you live in the UK or I'm sure there's going to be a way to get around any sort of region locks.

1987
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Oh, especially with the Doctor Who fans. They will not be kept away.

1988
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I think it's awesome to have any sort of way to be able to teach your kids about programming. That should be something that's included.

1989
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:34,000
We've come a long way from Rocky's Boots. I'll say that. That was the programming game I remember.

1990
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Although I've got to say, being not a guy familiar with Doctor Who or anything, I don't know. It looks pretty cool.

1991
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Alright, well, Amiibo. That whole thing, you know, the Nintendo Amiibo figures, which, Loki, I mean, you think you might pick them up or no way?

1992
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I haven't seen any sort of actual uses for them other than being collectible figures. I mean, they kind of look cool as collectible figures. I just don't really want to pay for them.

1993
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Check out the Nintendo Direct. They get into it a little bit with the Super Smash Brothers.

1994
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Yeah, I get it. They're AI players that you can level up. I don't give a shit about that. All it is, you know what they made it for is fucking Pokemon.

1995
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:24,000
You level them up by having them, you know, you train them to level up and then you can play them in the game. It's fucking Pokemon. It's going to be Pokemon.

1996
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:31,000
If the figures are of a nice quality, then that alone will be worth it. But if they're kind of crap, then never mind.

1997
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Doesn't, it's, I just don't see the point yet. Like, why do I care about, you know, fighting an AI player that gets harder or like playing as a character in Mario Kart or something? Just, no.

1998
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Well, maybe you will enjoy Amiibo a little more in this. It was announced this week that Amiibo will work with Hyrule Warriors. But now, don't go thinking like every single character is going to suddenly show up in Hyrule Warriors. It's not how it works.

1999
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:10,000
If you buy the Link figure, Super Smash Brothers for Wii U has the Link figure, of course, coming out. That Link figure can be registered with Hyrule Warriors. There's no other detail about this.

2000
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:22,000
However, Nintendo is set to announce more about this soon, probably towards November 21st when Smash Brothers for Wii U comes out. So there will be some sort of functionality for Hyrule Warriors Amiibo there.

2001
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Yeah, I guess it would be kind of cool if, like, you can level up cross games. Like, you know, if I have my Link character or something like that. If I play Hyrule Warriors, he'll go up levels. And if I play Smash Brothers, he'll go up more levels.

2002
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Now, I wonder if that might be something, and you might actually be on it, the pulse of what that is. That maybe you can somehow level up your Link Amiibo and then take it over to this game. That would be kind of neat to have that synergy within the Nintendo games.

2003
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I still think it'd be cooler, though, if you could bring in Mario and put him into Hyrule Warriors.

2004
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
See, that's kind of cool, but, you know, I just, I don't know.

2005
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,000
That's a lot of rendering and resources.

2006
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:06,000
It's not a lot of rendering. Come on, they can render Mario. They can render females in that game. They can render Mario.

2007
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:13,000
SSJ100 Matt says, so no Duck Hunt Dog in Hyrule Warriors? Alas, probably not, my friend. Probably not.

2008
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Hey, in Donkey Kong, like, I'm not talking about the character or the Amiibo. I'm talking about the 80s arcade game Donkey Kong.

2009
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:31,000
About 30 years after this game originally came out, a fan went through Donkey Kong and actually found some unused music and voiceovers within the game.

2010
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:39,000
This was discovered while looking through the game's original code. There were some quick music clips and some short snippets of Pauline actually speaking,

2011
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:46,000
hey, and help, because remember, the lady at the top of the board there that you're trying to rescue is not Princess Toadstool.

2012
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,000
In the original Donkey Kong, her name was actually Pauline. So Pauline can say, hey, and help.

2013
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
The vicious cycle that Mario got himself into.

2014
01:59:53,000 --> 02:00:00,000
So, there you go. So that's kind of neat. You can check those out there over on YouTube and around the various blogs there.

2015
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:08,000
As I mentioned, Bayonetta 2 came out this past week. Nintendo definitely wants to get awareness out there that Bayonetta 2 is available.

2016
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:14,000
They've chosen some very interesting partners to do so. Nintendo has joined up with Playboy.

2017
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:22,000
That's right, the magazine you get for the articles. Nintendo has joined up with Playboy to promote Bayonetta 2.

2018
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Playmate Pamela Horton, who is Miss October 2012, actually, for lack of a better term, put on the cosplay.

2019
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,000
And then shortly after took it off.

2020
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:42,000
And all this can be found on Playboy's official site. And my understanding is that Pamela is a gamer and a Nintendo fangirl herself.

2021
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:49,000
So they actually picked somebody. They didn't just pick her because she happens to look like Bayonetta. They picked her because she's a fan.

2022
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:59,000
So that's pretty cool. Not gonna do a lot of favors for the whole Bayonetta's over-sexualized argument.

2023
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:08,000
But, alright. You know what though? All I'm gonna say is that, you know, there is a lot of excess.

2024
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:15,000
For better or for worse, excess exists in the video game industry. When I say excess, I mean things like Grand Theft Auto.

2025
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Excessive amounts of violence. Like almost a parody of itself level of violence, right?

2026
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Something like Dead or Alive with breasts. An excessive amount of that, right? Excess...

2027
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,000
That's just Tecmo. Not Tecmo, Team Ninja.

2028
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:39,000
If we want video games to be considered art, which I think many gamers do consider games art, there's always gonna be that excess within art.

2029
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I think I said this before on an earlier OLR. Maybe it was Hoard House.

2030
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:50,000
In movies, you have people like John Waters that are going to really push the envelope of film.

2031
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,000
In art, you have people like Andy Warhol that push the envelope there too.

2032
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:59,000
There's always gonna be these excess sorts of games and I kinda think Bayonetta's one of those games.

2033
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:05,000
It's camp to me. I don't take it too seriously. I mean, how fucking could you?

2034
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:10,000
It's really, really over the top camp.

2035
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:16,000
So, I guess if that's how they want to try to sell it, then I hope it works out for them.

2036
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Because I do want to see this game do well. I would like to see a Bayonetta 3 happen someday.

2037
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
But we'll see. We'll see. It depends on how well this one does.

2038
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Alright, let's take a step over to our FUGL question of the week.

2039
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,000
That's right. When you take Facebook and Google and you throw those words together, you get FUGL.

2040
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,000
It's time for the FUGL question of the week.

2041
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
And over on our communities, we asked a question.

2042
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,000
You know, usually when we have interviews on the show, which we've been fortunate to have quite a few lately,

2043
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,000
we like to ask questions that kind of tie into the interviews we had.

2044
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:58,000
So, we said, what is an article that you'd want to read about a classic retro game?

2045
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Do you want some behind the scenes gossip about the development of a certain game?

2046
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Or do you want to compare or contrast with a modern game?

2047
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
What kinds of things would you like to read about in a magazine like Retro?

2048
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
So, we got some answers here.

2049
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,000
On Facebook, we have Gene W. who replied saying,

2050
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I think an article about classic games like Mario 64 and Zelda Ocarina of Time being reviewed

2051
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:26,000
as if it was a new game currently after 20 years of gaming evolution would be interesting.

2052
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:32,000
You know, the closest thing I've seen to something like this would be like when re-releases happen.

2053
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Like when Ocarina of Time 3D came out on the 3DS.

2054
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:40,000
It's very interesting to see how a lot of reviewers have to kind of walk that line of it's a classic,

2055
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
but a lot of them don't really, though.

2056
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
They just kind of, well, I guess when they remake them, it's a little bit different,

2057
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
but sometimes when they're just being ported over, it's like, well, just read our original review here

2058
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,000
and we'll tell you what the differences are between this version and this one.

2059
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Serping Slurpee. I never can say that.

2060
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Serping Slurpee responds,

2061
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Greetings from Cleveland, Ohio.

2062
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
And Ohio is all in caps, I think in reference perhaps to a show of ours a couple of weeks ago

2063
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
where we may have pissed some people off.

2064
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
I've always been a Sega fanboy.

2065
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:16,000
When discussing console wars, people focus on Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox,

2066
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,000
but they omit such important consoles as Sega Saturn and Dreamcast.

2067
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Both were groundbreaking to their respective generations.

2068
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,000
What circumstances led to their early demise?

2069
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Without losers, there could be no winners.

2070
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Ooh, that's a very interesting little last sentence there.

2071
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Kind of examining the phoenix of games, so to speak, how we rise up from the ashes, I guess,

2072
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
with these consoles that may have failed.

2073
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
That's a very interesting perspective.

2074
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
They could still make a comeback.

2075
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I'm confident that Sega could make a comeback if they wanted to.

2076
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Well, you know what's funny is I was playing Bayonetta 2,

2077
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
and I don't remember if it was Alan or Seamus.

2078
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Somebody walked into the room and was like,

2079
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
are you playing a Sega Dreamcast game?

2080
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Because this looks like a freaking Dreamcast game.

2081
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
And the more I thought about it, I was kind of like,

2082
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Bayonetta totally is a game that would have been on Dreamcast.

2083
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
But it makes sense. Sega's involved.

2084
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Anyway, Raginator says, I'd like to read a retrospective of early to mid-90s console gaming.

2085
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:16,000
The 16-bit console wars, the advent of certain genres like fighting and FMV games,

2086
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:22,000
the seemingly explosion of consoles, i.e. Super Nintendo, Genesis, 3DO, CDi, Neo Geo, etc.

2087
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,000
That's like a whole year's worth of magazines right there, Raginator.

2088
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
That's a big topic.

2089
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
But yes, lots of good stuff.

2090
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Let's go over to Google Plus because we do have a few answers over there on our Google Plus page,

2091
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:38,000
which of course is google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

2092
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
And some of our responses there. We have three comments there.

2093
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
At Def says, maybe about game ROMs and emulation.

2094
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I know it's taboo for many, but let me explain.

2095
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I would actually like to read about people working on fan translations and making a game

2096
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
that probably didn't see the light of day in America.

2097
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Understandable for us.

2098
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Or even interviews of localizing teams back in the day.

2099
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
You know, sometimes this happens though after the fact, you know, legitimately.

2100
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I keep thinking of that one Genesis game.

2101
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
It was like, you know, years after the fact they translated it from like a Taiwan game.

2102
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,000
You know, they actually translated it into English, you know, and that was released.

2103
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:18,000
So sometimes it's not necessarily questionable legalities.

2104
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Sometimes this happens way after the fact completely legitimately with all licenses intact.

2105
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
But yes, I agree though. The fan translations are really something.

2106
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,000
And to this day, you know, when they translated Second Detsetsu 3 into English, that was huge.

2107
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:37,000
And that still to this day remains a game that for whatever reason,

2108
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Square Enix has not wanted to give out officially in English.

2109
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Yet there's such a demand for it out there, there's that ROM, you know, the ROM.

2110
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
And we all know it's there.

2111
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,000
You know, we all know it's out there.

2112
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Anyway, Tom W. says,

2113
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I'd really like an in-depth article on how to build a rockin' MAME or multi-system cabinet,

2114
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
complete with diagrams, software, configs, and tool lists.

2115
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Well, now again, you get into that little bit of a legal gray area,

2116
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
because how legal is MAME?

2117
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
What? There's all these public domain ROMs.

2118
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
So I think as long as we stuck to a conversation, and maybe that could be about,

2119
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
here's how to build a perfectly legal MAME machine.

2120
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,000
There's a lot of articles out there on the internet.

2121
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I mean, there's whole, you know, forms and stuff that are dedicated to that kind of thing.

2122
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Yes, but I mean, it could be very convenient to have a magazine page with a shopping list to take with me.

2123
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I mean, I guess people have their phones and stuff.

2124
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Well, it depends what you want.

2125
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,000
There's so many things. You can find a cabinet, you can build a cabinet.

2126
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
What cabinet type do you want to design, build, or whatever?

2127
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I'll tell you, having built...

2128
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
You're speaking from experience.

2129
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Yes, I'm telling you, having built a couple and bought a cabinet that I converted into a MAME cabinet,

2130
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:53,000
definitely some choices I would make differently nowadays.

2131
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
All right, lastly, Rettertainment says,

2132
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I'd like an in-depth piece where they interview several people who developed games during the Atari area,

2133
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,000
particularly those people who developed games where they were the only person working on it.

2134
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I think it would be interesting to compare and contrast the stress developers of the Atari era went through

2135
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:11,000
compared to the stress that modern-day developers went through.

2136
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Well, I think we heard a little bit of that in our interview earlier tonight,

2137
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
so it sounds like, you know, Retro's bringing some of that.

2138
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
But I think we want to hear more.

2139
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,000
More of these guys that had to work by themselves in the teams of one in the past,

2140
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
creating some of the all-time classics.

2141
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:33,000
And if you want that now, I recommend checking out, was it the GDC Vault?

2142
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:40,000
They've got usually a lot of these kind of postmortems for different games.

2143
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Like, I remember there was one time when I was, you know,

2144
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:48,000
well, I think it was actually when I didn't have anything to do with my company after they took away our system.

2145
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:54,000
But I was watching these postmortems because they have stuff from like Maniac Mansion,

2146
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
and just about like all these developers on these games

2147
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
and like all the process that they went through to develop the engines for these games

2148
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
or like design choices that they made and stuff like that.

2149
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,000
And it's really fun to just watch and listen to.

2150
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
So yeah, GDC Vault is one place I'd check.

2151
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Or just do a search, I think, for like, you know, postmortems for your favorite game and see if you can find that.

2152
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Dungeon Buster wants to point out there's a great interview with Carol Shaw,

2153
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
who worked at Activision floating around out there.

2154
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
She did River Raid and a few other games.

2155
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:30,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase CANDLE.

2156
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Alright, well, I mentioned that our friends at Retro Magazine wanted to give away a print subscription to one lucky listener.

2157
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
So what I'd like you guys to do, if you are interested in this and you're listening either live or on the podcast,

2158
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I'd like you to email participate at orangeloungeradio.com

2159
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:52,000
and I want you to tell me what game would you like to see on the cover of a future magazine.

2160
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Now, keep in mind, we have nothing to do with the development of the magazine.

2161
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,000
We've got no pull.

2162
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
But I will let our friends know.

2163
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,000
If I notice any trends, I will let our friends know.

2164
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
We will pick one emailer at random to win this prize.

2165
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:11,000
So if you are interested in this, again, send a message to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2166
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Make sure somewhere in the subject it says retro and in the body tell us what would you like to see on the cover of the future magazine.

2167
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Again, we have no say or any pull of any sort and that stuff might already be planned out for the next two years for all we know.

2168
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:34,000
But we'll certainly pass it along if we see any trends or anything like that to our friends over at Retro Magazine.

2169
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:40,000
So once again, a print subscription to one lucky listener for Retro Magazine available at readretro.com.

2170
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Email participate at orangeloungeradio.com with what game would you like to see on the cover of the future magazine.

2171
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
We will pick one lucky listener from all the submissions on next week's show.

2172
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Alrighty, let's get back into some other news. Loki.

2173
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Alright, so I don't really know how to take this news, but apparently the former CEO of EA, John Rickdello,

2174
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I think that's how you pronounce his name, is now the CEO of Unity.

2175
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,000
As in the Unity 3D, the game engine I like to use.

2176
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:27,000
You may remember him from such wonderful failures as SimCity's online issues or Star Wars The Old Republic or a lot of the other stuff that he dealt with in his tenure.

2177
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:33,000
I want to say he was obviously around during the online pass thing and all that fun stuff.

2178
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Not exactly too highly thought of by a lot of the gaming community.

2179
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:46,000
But he's basically saying, hey, things are going to be different now.

2180
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:56,000
He actually went to the Unity forums and was answering questions and stuff there regarding some of the stuff.

2181
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:04,000
For example, the company he's working for now is a very different company in a very different place.

2182
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
He says they're not really comparable.

2183
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:15,000
The thing that might have been right or wrong with EA when the company was a turnaround situation are entirely different than what's right for Unity.

2184
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
The companies are very, very different.

2185
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Basically saying, my philosophy is not to get bigger or more profitable for the sake of these things.

2186
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:42,000
He wants to recognize that developing a great game is hard and even if you pull it off or having your game discovered and installed is also hard.

2187
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Earning a good living on this is very hard.

2188
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:51,000
I don't know. I think he's trying to skirt around some of the past mistakes and trying to start fresh.

2189
02:12:51,000 --> 02:13:00,000
So don't fuck this up like you fucked up some of the stuff or had a hand in fucking up at previous companies.

2190
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:06,000
That's good advice. To quote a favorite mentor of mine, good luck and don't fuck it up.

2191
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Any concern because you're using Unity to develop your game. Any concerns here?

2192
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Not yet.

2193
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I just hope that maybe they don't change the pricing models. Although the pricing model could be a little bit better.

2194
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:28,000
For me being poor, $1500 is a lot. But it's $1500 and that's it.

2195
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:35,000
And you don't have to pay for royalties except for say you want to buy the next version of Unity that comes out.

2196
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
The next numbered version.

2197
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:44,000
For example, Unity 5. If I pay $1500 for that, I get 4 for right now because it's so close to 5 coming out.

2198
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:51,000
And then I get 5, but later on when 6 comes out, I have to pay more money to upgrade to the fancier shit.

2199
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I guess it makes sense, but it's not that much money.

2200
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,000
It could always be cheaper.

2201
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Everything could always be cheaper.

2202
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Moving on to some stories on Mortal Kombat X. Don't call it Mortal Kombat X. It is actually Mortal Kombat X even though it is the 10th game.

2203
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
This is a game to look forward to early next year. I don't remember if it was on or off air.

2204
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
We're talking about the Wii U and what is there to look forward to in the first few months of next year.

2205
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Now, of course, Mortal Kombat X would not be one of those games.

2206
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
But for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, this is definitely one that has a lot of people looking forward to it.

2207
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I thought they had it gated already.

2208
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:32,000
It was April something, I think. Which tends to be the time frame for those spring releases.

2209
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:40,000
So, to coincide with the 2015 launch of Mortal Kombat X, there's going to be a new live action series.

2210
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,000
You might remember they've done some live action Mortal Kombat stuff before, but this is going to be something new.

2211
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:53,000
This will be a joint production from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Blue Ribbon Content, which is a digital series production house within Warner Bros.

2212
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:59,000
This will showcase some of the franchise's most storied characters while introducing a new generation of fighters.

2213
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Because, as we know, the last Mortal Kombat game was, for the most part, familiar faces.

2214
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,000
In fact, I think it was really all familiar faces save maybe Freddy Krueger.

2215
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:11,000
But this game, we know there's some new people in it and there's people looking forward to that.

2216
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Some of the characters, I'm really curious to see how they're going to pull off in a live action.

2217
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Isn't one of them like a flying insect lady or something?

2218
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
That's going to be interesting to see how they pull that off.

2219
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I think they're just going to be pulling it off like they did some of the flying characters in Injustice.

2220
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Not even Injustice, but even going back to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe back when they had some of that stuff.

2221
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
But I think Injustice is a little bit more where they're playing off of for some of these characters.

2222
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,000
So, for the live action, though, I'm curious how they're going to pull off some of that. It's going to be expensive.

2223
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
It's not going to be that expensive.

2224
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
This is true. I keep forgetting how many strides we've made in that.

2225
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
So, yeah, there you go. That's going to be pretty cool.

2226
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:01,000
They're just going to have this person jump up every time the camera's on them,

2227
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:05,000
and they're just going to have to somehow shoot those scenes very fast.

2228
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:10,000
No word on when this is exactly coming, although I would imagine it would be around the game.

2229
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:15,000
It should be noted this has nothing to do with Mortal Kombat Legacy from 2011.

2230
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:18,000
It's nothing to do with that, just to make that clear.

2231
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Also, by the way, speaking of comics, since you brought up DC, DC Comics is going to be making a Mortal Kombat X comic.

2232
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:31,000
This will, quote, serve as a prequel to the game and will feature many favorite characters in the next generation of combatants.

2233
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:41,000
It will be written by Shawn Kittleson in illustrations by Dexter Soy and cover art from Ivan Reiss, January of 2015, when this will be released.

2234
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
So, there you go.

2235
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:52,000
I'm looking forward to the game, and all this hype around it will hopefully get a lot of people online to play against.

2236
02:16:52,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Yeah. All right. And then, let's see. So, this is kind of cool.

2237
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:04,000
We, I think, talked a little bit about how they're going to be doing a Dead Rising movie,

2238
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:11,000
and now it wasn't necessarily going to be something that was, you know, in theaters or something like that,

2239
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:15,000
but it is going to be something that they're going to be debuting, I guess, on Crackle.

2240
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:20,000
But the title of the movie was Dead Rising Watchtower, and it actually has,

2241
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Rob Riggle is going to be playing Frank West in the game.

2242
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:33,000
And Rob Riggle, he's done a bunch of different, you know, comedic roles, but he's also, you know, I think,

2243
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
He's on The Daily Show.

2244
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Yeah, he's known for The Daily Show.

2245
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
I can see him as Frank West, actually. I think that could work.

2246
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:47,000
So, I'm curious to see how this movie is actually going to turn out, especially since it's on Crackle.

2247
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I guess it's free.

2248
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Hey.

2249
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I like free.

2250
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:56,000
They haven't given a date yet when that's going to be coming out, but hopefully sooner than later.

2251
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:02,000
All right. Well, let's talk about some arcade games for 2015, and one game that's going to be making its way to arcades.

2252
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Yes, thank heavens, more arcade games in 2015, because I start to worry every day that arcades are dying out,

2253
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:11,000
because every time I walk into one, it's just a bunch of ticket spitters.

2254
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:14,000
But Time Crisis 5 will be happening in 2015.

2255
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,000
It will be released internationally in March or April of 2015, that time frame.

2256
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Very cool there that that is happening.

2257
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:27,000
This will, I believe, has the whole foot pedal action thing going on with the gun.

2258
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I'm curious if this will lead into a port.

2259
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Are we going to have a next generation laser gun or something, or will you be able to plug in a USB mouse or what?

2260
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I mean, because these Time Crisis games pretty much all came out on PlayStation, right?

2261
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Even Time Crisis 4.

2262
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,000
If only PlayStation had some sort of way to do light guns.

2263
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:53,000
If only they had a device called the Move that they had a gun peripheral for.

2264
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
The camera, of course.

2265
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:01,000
They had a previous Time Crisis game on. They used it just like that in the House of the Dead game, and that's how they would do it.

2266
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Or maybe this will just stay in the arcades. Who knows?

2267
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Most likely because it's going to rely on connecting the camera and who's really...

2268
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Hey, I'm all for more games that use the connect to the camera, since otherwise those peripherals are kind of useless, aside from...

2269
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Now, Dark Dead City is pointing out there's actually two pedals on Time Crisis 5.

2270
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,000
There's an L and an R. You can see in some of these pictures here that somebody took of the game.

2271
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:29,000
It looks like some pretty fun in-game shots. I see somebody on a little zip line there.

2272
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Pretty cool.

2273
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Also, for the arcade, it should be noted there.

2274
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:39,000
There is a new Bandai Namco game that's location testing called Synchronica.

2275
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:43,000
This is actually a music-based game. It's a touchscreen rhythm arcade game.

2276
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:50,000
It looks a little familiar for Beatstream by Konami and Rerave Plus, if you know that game.

2277
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:54,000
So, yeah, that is something that Bandai Namco is testing right now, Synchronica.

2278
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:59,000
And, interestingly enough, the Taiko No Tatchujin mascots are appearing on the game's art as well.

2279
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Which, you know, that was a big music game that Bandai Namco did, which does pretty well overseas.

2280
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:09,000
I don't think you see a lot of it here. I know they had a couple home releases here, but you definitely don't.

2281
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
It's not in the arcades here, really, unless it's imported.

2282
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
It would be cool if they...

2283
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Now, this would be kind of hard to do, I guess, but it would be kind of cool if they had one of those games.

2284
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:26,000
But it utilized the second-screen stuff of a tablet to actually play those games on a console or something.

2285
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Because you know how they have all these second-screen apps and stuff.

2286
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Maybe do a download version of the game or something where you're required to have that in order to play it.

2287
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Now, I do want to point out this is location testing in Japan.

2288
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Doubtful, because Taiko No Tatchujin never really made its way over here besides a couple home versions.

2289
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I don't know if this ever will either outside the imports, but you never know.

2290
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Sometimes, if something does very well in Japan, it'll make its way over here.

2291
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

2292
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Every week, you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

2293
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:03,000
and we open up the mailbag and read some of the emails on the program.

2294
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Except, since I'm having to multitask all night tonight, I actually don't have the mailbag up right now.

2295
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
So let me bring it up.

2296
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:16,000
I know we had at least one email when I looked earlier, so I should have something to read.

2297
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,000
You would think with two weeks off, we would have had a lot.

2298
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:24,000
But nope, just one email tonight, because the other one says retro on it, so people are already entering the contest.

2299
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:28,000
So here it is, our email for tonight from Gene, who says,

2300
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Hello, OLR! Tuesday, I finally broke down and bought a PlayStation TV.

2301
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Oh, we haven't talked a lot about this yet.

2302
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I seriously thought about picking one of those up when I bought my PlayStation 4, because I saw the box up on the shelf.

2303
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
You're thinking about it, huh?

2304
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Maybe.

2305
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Well, let's see what Gene has to say about the PlayStation TV.

2306
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:51,000
There has been much talk that this unit is going for the Apple TV market.

2307
02:21:51,000 --> 02:22:01,000
After almost a week, I can confirm my initial impression is that it is going for the niche market of people that want to play their PS4 remotely, play PSP and Vita games on the big screen.

2308
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:06,000
The menus on the big screen are the biggest deterrent, making it an alternative to the Apple TV.

2309
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Sony had put so little into the system to make it for that audience that I was a bit confused as to how to close programs.

2310
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Still, a week later, I feel the operating system doesn't translate well on the TV.

2311
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:24,000
It works great for what I bought it for, Dissida on a big television with a great controller that doesn't cramp my hands.

2312
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Since I bought the bundle and will not play it, feel free to give out my code for the LEGO Movie Video Game for the Vita.

2313
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
And it comes with a code.

2314
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
As always, thanks to the podcast, Gene.

2315
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:43,000
So there it is. The interface sucks, but if you want to play Dissida on your television, there you go.

2316
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
That sounds about right.

2317
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
I don't know. I'm tempted.

2318
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I don't want to just buy a PlayStation TV for it, but there is something to be said about the Vita Luminous game, which is one of the best, being able to play that on the TV.

2319
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Even the PSP games, like Final Fantasy IV, I think the PSP version of Final Fantasy IV is the best one.

2320
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I prefer it to the 3D remake. I know not everybody agrees with me.

2321
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
But it's the original and the after years.

2322
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Yeah, I don't know. I'm tempted.

2323
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
I'm tempted.

2324
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I'm sure if you just wait a little bit, like wait until Black Friday, wait until they drop in price.

2325
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Because I bet you a lot of people are going to be, you know, maybe people will be dropping those, I don't know.

2326
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
I hope it does well.

2327
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Well, gosh, you know, I kind of want to keep this code for myself, but I see actdeft in chat going, I want it! I want it!

2328
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I want that LEGO movie game code!

2329
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,000
So you know what? Alright, cool, you want it, you got it.

2330
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
There you go. Thanks for listening.

2331
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:43,000
I'm going to pass that code on to actdeft, just because he's clamoring about wanting that in our chat room.

2332
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
So there you go. You got it.

2333
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Thanks, Gene.

2334
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I hear the movie game's not that bad.

2335
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
I mean, just saying.

2336
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
I like the movie.

2337
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Don't make me regret that. I should have kept it for myself.

2338
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Have you watched the movie? Have you seen the LEGO movie?

2339
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,000
I haven't yet.

2340
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
What the hell is your problem? Go watch the LEGO movie.

2341
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Is it on Blu-ray?

2342
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
It is on Blu-ray already.

2343
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I still have not bought a fucking table for that little arcade machine. I've been that busy.

2344
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:14,000
But things are clearing up in a couple weeks, so I'll be able to watch movies and things like that again.

2345
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Alright.

2346
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Let's move on and get to the FUs of the week.

2347
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:25,000
We usually use this part of the show to get a little bit angsty, so here we go.

2348
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Alright.

2349
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I guess, since Jamie's not here, I'll make an FU for my cat.

2350
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
My cat is an asshole.

2351
02:24:52,000 --> 02:25:03,000
And, you know, sometimes I give her the benefit of the doubt where, oh yeah, I just think that she's an asshole, but maybe she's actually pretty nice.

2352
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
But no, she actually goes out of her way to be an asshole.

2353
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Let me give you an example here.

2354
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
I was getting my son his...

2355
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:15,000
We have a full-size whiteboard that I normally let him play on and draw and stuff like that.

2356
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:20,000
So while I was getting it out, I had to move this box that had our fake Christmas tree in it.

2357
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:29,000
And lo and behold, the cat had decided to jump up on the box and vomit into the box onto the Christmas tree.

2358
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Nasty!

2359
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
She literally ruined the Christmas tree.

2360
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Ruined Christmas for everybody.

2361
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:42,000
So now I have to go buy a new fucking tree because the cat decided to jump up on the box when she knew she had to throw up and throw up into said box.

2362
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Thank you.

2363
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Alright, I want to give an F.U. to the fact that our fucking livestream just went down again.

2364
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:55,000
This is... I'm really giving consideration going somewhere else. This is happening way too much.

2365
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:01,000
So yeah, our livestream is currently down and I'm trying to furiously reconnect so we can get our live listeners back.

2366
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Because, yeah, having a good feed is really the lifeblood of the show.

2367
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Alan, are you here to...

2368
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Are you an F.U.s?

2369
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Yeah, we're doing F.U.s.

2370
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Oh, Alan wants to give a guest F.U. of the week.

2371
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Alan's here home early for a change for the show and wants to give an F.U. of the week while I try to fix our livestream.

2372
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:33,000
F.U. to the huge giant Safeway near my work that's huge like an airport hanger, yet in spite of it being a fancy Safeway, I was trying to get Rob more Stacy's salted caramel pita chips.

2373
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Oh, they're so good!

2374
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Yeah, they don't have the Stacy's brand of pita chips at all. Couldn't find them.

2375
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:47,000
I mean, I was in a rush, but I went up and down that chip aisle like four times and then I went over to where they have like the kale chips and the frou-frou stuff.

2376
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
None. No Stacy's.

2377
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Then I looked for the popcorn that you like. The microwave popcorn, the garlic. Didn't have that either.

2378
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,000
So, fuck them.

2379
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:08,000
F.U. to the fact that I like all this food that makes me fat, but seriously, those pita chips, the salted caramel ones, are so good. I can't. I can't.

2380
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:22,000
They have the cappuccino Lay's that I almost got as a replacement, but the thing is that's why the cappuccino Lay's lost that contest because if you want sweet chips, you get the Stacy's salted caramel or the Stacy's sugar cinnamon.

2381
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
There are better chips like that.

2382
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:30,000
I will agree. Those salted caramel chips are way better than the stupid cappuccino chips at a Lay's.

2383
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,000
But anyway.

2384
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Alright, thankfully we got our live listeners back, so my rage has calmed down a little bit with losing the stream there.

2385
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Very frustrating.

2386
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:43,000
But don't worry guys, you only missed the F.U.'s of the week and those will be up in full on our podcast feed.

2387
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:50,000
As you can hear, Alan came in the room to help contribute to that segment while I was furiously trying to get our feed back up.

2388
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 Game O.L.R.

2389
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2390
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Loki.

2391
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Alright, this is pretty cool.

2392
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,000
I watched this last time that they had it up, but awesome games done quick.

2393
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:11,000
It's coming back if you like watching speedruns and really if you haven't watched this yet, you really should check it out.

2394
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:19,000
It's coming out January or starting January 4th next year and they're going to be doing it for about six days.

2395
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,000
It's going to end on January 10th.

2396
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:25,000
All our proceeds from donations are going to Prevent Cancer Foundation.

2397
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:40,000
And if you haven't heard of this event, it's basically a bunch of really great speedrunners playing a bunch of different games and kind of talking about what they do in those games to go fast.

2398
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
And there's races and all sorts of fun stuff.

2399
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Seriously, check it out.

2400
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Games Done Quick I think is the Twitch channel.

2401
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:54,000
So they'll be coming out on the 4th and they have the whole lineup.

2402
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,000
The trailer for my next story started playing in the background.

2403
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I didn't realize it was on and it made a great ambience for what you were talking about.

2404
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:04,000
I'm going to spoil what I'm going to talk about.

2405
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I know there's a lot of fans out there at this marathon.

2406
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I know Flaco Jones here at OLR, an extro at Hoard House, they love this.

2407
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
It is a very fun thing to watch.

2408
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Do you think they would get mad if maybe we did an offshoot on a different week called Mediocre Games Done Slow?

2409
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
There's something a little bit more our pace.

2410
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Invitation is the finest form of flattery, right?

2411
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,000
It's all for a good cause, right?

2412
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,000
I don't think they would care.

2413
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,000
It's just whatever.

2414
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I think it looks awesome.

2415
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:36,000
I can't wait to watch it again because last year was fantastic.

2416
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,000
They even do it I think twice a year. They do Summer Games Done Quick also.

2417
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Check it out.

2418
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Maybe in 2015, Mediocre Games Done Slow from Loki and Rob and Darth Zagara and pals.

2419
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Mediocre Games Done as fast as we can, but our limited skills limit our speed through said game and possibly won't finish it.

2420
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
The end.

2421
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Mediocre Games Done until we need a nap.

2422
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I was trying to play through, like, was it, I want to be the guy.

2423
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:10,000
It's like, give us an hour until we throw the controller down on the ground because we don't want to play this.

2424
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Alright, Tigerclaw in chat says, I think they did an awful games done quick before.

2425
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Actually, that does sound familiar.

2426
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Again, I don't want to steal anyone's idea.

2427
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,000
It's for charity. It's all great stuff.

2428
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Alright, well, I think I spoiled what I'm going to talk about.

2429
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:30,000
This is, okay, this is a game I'm not fucking playing during a marathon.

2430
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Let's just make that real clear.

2431
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:36,000
That is the game Five Nights at Freddy's 2.

2432
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Loki, you familiar with the Five Nights at Freddy's game?

2433
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the game.

2434
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
You don't, okay, here's the thing.

2435
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I haven't played it because I kind of refuse to and I've actually had several people request me to stream it.

2436
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,000
And I've watched other people play it on YouTube and I'm like, no thanks.

2437
02:30:54,000 --> 02:31:04,000
So here's what it is. It's a survival horror game where you're working as the security guy at a Chuck E. Cheese type of place where the animatronics are basically trying to kill you.

2438
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,000
That's awesome. That sounds so cool.

2439
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
I can't believe you haven't heard of this game.

2440
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I haven't heard of this, but that's really cool.

2441
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Alright, let me play this trailer full screen so Loki can see it here.

2442
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:27,000
So they do have the sequel available on Greenlight and you're trapped in a room and you just have the security cameras.

2443
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:31,000
You don't actually walk around or whatever. It's all through security cameras.

2444
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:37,000
And you watch the different cameras and try to make sure that the little monsters aren't trying to get close to you.

2445
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Because if they get too close there will be a hell of a jump scare where they burst through the door and basically kill you.

2446
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,000
And it's like they make these little sounds when they do it like blah.

2447
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
They make these really hideous noises.

2448
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:52,000
So I'm letting Loki see the trailer here in studio.

2449
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Because Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is on Steam Greenlight.

2450
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:02,000
And it looks like as the taping of the show they've actually posted an update that says they made it.

2451
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,000
So yeah, you can see the game area and they switch between all these different cams.

2452
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,000
And some of the cameras are broken and they're audio only.

2453
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:12,000
And so you look at the different areas and you have to basically survive all night.

2454
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Which runs like six or seven minutes.

2455
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:19,000
And then at some point, come on if we get to that part of the show.

2456
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Don't those monsters look freaky?

2457
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:29,000
And at some point in the trailer here, they come and get you.

2458
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:34,000
It looks kind of stupid but it kind of looks a little janky there.

2459
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,000
It almost looks like an old Saturn game.

2460
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Like a night trap type thing.

2461
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:44,000
So how are you supposed to prevent the monsters from getting you?

2462
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Because when they're on the camera they don't move.

2463
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Click, click, click, click.

2464
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Somehow I don't think that works. I don't think you can rapidly click everything.

2465
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Let's see, Rama in chat says,

2466
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I know people that are doing Five Nights at Freddy's cosplays.

2467
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
That is fucked up.

2468
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
That's just mean.

2469
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
That's like furries gone wrong.

2470
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Really, really wrong.

2471
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Act Def says,

2472
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:14,000
But after a while you don't feel scared of the animatronics but rather just not fucking it up.

2473
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Yeah, I can see that.

2474
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:19,000
The animatronics themselves probably lose the scare a little bit.

2475
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:23,000
But later on it's a tense game.

2476
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
I've played games that weren't necessarily scary.

2477
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
They were just tense.

2478
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Like if I screw this up I'm going to have to do it all over again.

2479
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Even Pagle 2 got tense for me.

2480
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
It's like, I have to get three of these in a row.

2481
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:37,000
And it's like, okay, one, two, am I going to get the third shot?

2482
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Why are you still working at like this place that's abandoned as a security guard?

2483
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
And there's like...

2484
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:46,000
As soon as you see any of those animatronic things trying to kill you be like,

2485
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Oh fuck it, I'm out, gone.

2486
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
It's video game logic, Loki.

2487
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
That doesn't make sense.

2488
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Dungeon Buster says,

2489
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Alien isolation is kind of like that but it took almost 15 or so hours for it to get there for me.

2490
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
That's another game that people have suggested I buy and stream live.

2491
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
And I'm like, nope.

2492
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Because, A, it's a pricier game.

2493
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:08,000
At least Five Nights at Freddy's is only what, five, ten bucks?

2494
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,000
But Alien Isolation is still pretty expensive and it's like,

2495
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I don't know, I don't think I could make it through that.

2496
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Alright, let's do it.

2497
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Let's open up the Skype line and take your calls.

2498
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

2499
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2500
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2501
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
If you want to give us a call and be on the program tonight.

2502
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,000
And the phone line is already lighting up to take some calls.

2503
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Let's do it.

2504
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2505
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Hey, this is FTF.

2506
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Hey my friend, how you doing?

2507
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Hey, pretty good, pretty good.

2508
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Well, you talked about Five Nights at Freddy's.

2509
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Yes.

2510
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
And yeah, I said it in chat and you pretty much repeated it.

2511
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Or said it.

2512
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
The game starts really scary.

2513
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
It's a scary atmosphere.

2514
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:00,000
At the first, early in your first playthrough maybe,

2515
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,000
you're going to get scared because yeah, that's the feeling.

2516
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,000
But after a while, it doesn't get that scary.

2517
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Does it support the Oculus Rift?

2518
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:11,000
No, it doesn't actually.

2519
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
But it should.

2520
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:18,000
It's a game that pretty much could take advantage of that really well.

2521
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
I don't know, though, if the whole fact that you're watching on cameras.

2522
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:25,000
I mean, not everything should necessarily be crammed into the Rift.

2523
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
And the fact that this is about watching security cameras,

2524
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:30,000
that might not work so well on the Rift, actually.

2525
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,000
So, I know people want to, you know,

2526
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
they want people to actually die having a heart attack

2527
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
from playing a video game at some point

2528
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
by putting all these scary games on the Rift.

2529
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:43,000
But isn't Slender Man enough?

2530
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I don't remember who talked me into doing that stream,

2531
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
if it was Shane or Gemet or what,

2532
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:50,000
but I did that livestream of Slender Man and I screamed so loud.

2533
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Hey, Slender, the arrival is coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One very soon.

2534
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Oh, is it really?

2535
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
And also the Wii U, yeah.

2536
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

2537
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Yeah, and speaking, turning to Five Nights at Freddy's,

2538
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
speaking of the Wii U,

2539
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:07,000
it actually would work on the Wii U,

2540
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:11,000
especially since you use a tablet to watch the other cameras.

2541
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Yeah, it actually worked.

2542
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:16,000
It's basically a horror version of that stupid prototype

2543
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
that, was it, Miyamoto's working on?

2544
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Like, look at my genius idea.

2545
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:24,000
No, no, it's kind of dumb, you know,

2546
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:28,000
watching Rob the Robot try to infiltrate your shit.

2547
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Yeah, Five Nights at Freddy's 2,

2548
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:38,000
it's gonna be pretty much, maybe not the same thing,

2549
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:42,000
but it's gonna do a lot of stuff that the first one didn't,

2550
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:46,000
and it's gonna be way, way more creepier,

2551
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
and probably way more harder.

2552
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:53,000
I got to the Fortnite and I had to stop playing

2553
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:56,000
because it was getting on my nerves really bad.

2554
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Not in a scary sense, but like I said,

2555
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
it's mostly not to fuck it up,

2556
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
because you have to check all the cameras,

2557
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:08,000
you have to be very careful of what you do,

2558
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
and not waste energy and all that.

2559
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,000
It really gets on your nerves in that way.

2560
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,000
It's not the animatronics getting you.

2561
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Like I said, and again, I'm repeating myself,

2562
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
it's mostly not to fuck it up.

2563
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
The game was cheating, right?

2564
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
I do that all the time.

2565
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
You're really frustrated because the game's cheating.

2566
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Yeah, kind of.

2567
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Even some of the animatronics actually cheat.

2568
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:37,000
They give you one kill,

2569
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:42,000
but they don't give you a chance even to do something.

2570
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:47,000
There's this, well not an animatronic,

2571
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,000
but a thing called Golden Freddy,

2572
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,000
that if you catch it on your monitors,

2573
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
on the security cameras,

2574
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:00,000
and it appears immediately on your station,

2575
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,000
it will pretty much crash your game.

2576
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:07,000
It's a one-hit kill, and you cannot do anything about it.

2577
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Oh my gosh, that does look pretty cheap.

2578
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
That would suck.

2579
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Well, I guess it is that time of year

2580
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
where everybody's thinking about scary games.

2581
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:18,000
I'm sure there'll be plenty of people live streaming

2582
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:21,000
and playing scary games with friends on Friday night.

2583
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Good luck to everybody,

2584
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
and I hope these games don't scare you too bad.

2585
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Speaking of the furry community and Five Nights at Freddy's,

2586
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:33,000
you haven't seen anything of it.

2587
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Like, anything.

2588
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
You know what? That is something...

2589
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Haven't seen, don't want to seen.

2590
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Yeah, that's the only difference.

2591
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I will keep that nicely stored away in Pandora's box.

2592
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Thank you very much.

2593
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
All right, Actif, anything else on your mind, my friend?

2594
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
That's all, that's all.

2595
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
All right, take care.

2596
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Yeah, you too. Thanks for having me.

2597
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Bye.

2598
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
All right, one of these days,

2599
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I'm going to just end up downloading that game

2600
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,000
and live streaming it inevitably.

2601
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,000
We'll see, we'll see though.

2602
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2603
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Hey, guys, it's Jason.

2604
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Hey, Jason, and I can see you.

2605
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
I'm waving at you, you just can't see it.

2606
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,000
I know, your beard's getting fluffier.

2607
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
It hasn't even been winter yet.

2608
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
It's not even cold in Colorado yet,

2609
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:14,000
at least not regularly, but...

2610
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Are you planning on cosplaying Santa Claus?

2611
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Because you're about there.

2612
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I, at this rate, given two more months,

2613
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
well, I don't have a Halloween costume yet,

2614
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,000
so why not use it for two occasions this year?

2615
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:28,000
There you go, there you go.

2616
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
This is great radio, by the way.

2617
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
This is fantastic radio.

2618
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Jason has a big, fluffy Santa Claus beard right now.

2619
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Well, it's not gray though, it's black, but still.

2620
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:37,000
All right, what's on your mind?

2621
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Maybe hair dye, things can happen.

2622
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Exactly.

2623
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Can I toot my own horn for a minute?

2624
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Toot, toot, I suppose.

2625
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:48,000
So, back in, I think it was late last year,

2626
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:52,000
but it may have even been 20, what year is it, 2012.

2627
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
At least a year ago, and possibly more,

2628
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:58,000
I made this comment about how game worlds,

2629
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:04,000
in the general sense, can finally come to consoles,

2630
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
now that in the current generation,

2631
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:09,000
everything not only has the capability,

2632
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:12,000
but is largely expected to always be on,

2633
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
possible to connect to the internet,

2634
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:17,000
phoning home to services, all that kind of stuff.

2635
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
And yeah, consoles have gotten MMOs,

2636
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Final Fantasy has been on all of them,

2637
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:25,000
has been on consoles even as far back as the PS2,

2638
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:29,000
so the MMO itself isn't exactly a surprise.

2639
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
But it's really interesting to me,

2640
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:34,000
because Destiny, a lot of people have said

2641
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:37,000
a lot of negative things about Destiny,

2642
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,000
and provided Bungie keeps up, which I really expect them to,

2643
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I expect that sentiment to change in the end,

2644
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:49,000
by the time that Destiny as it stands is considered done,

2645
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
whether that's a sequel, or just run its course,

2646
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:54,000
or what have you, I just expect the game

2647
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
to be something completely different,

2648
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,000
and the opinions of them, if not better,

2649
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:02,000
than to be different along with the change of content.

2650
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:06,000
What brought this up, what really gobsmacked me with that,

2651
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:10,000
this week, is that Titanfall released Patch 8,

2652
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
and it was just a patch,

2653
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
they've had three pieces of DLC already,

2654
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
all just map packs,

2655
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
and not actually doing anything else with the game,

2656
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:21,000
but a patch update, free to all players

2657
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,000
that came out this week,

2658
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,000
added an entirely new mode to the game.

2659
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Nothing crazy, nothing revolutionary,

2660
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:33,000
it was just survival, what did Halo Reach call it?

2661
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Was it actually Reach mode?

2662
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Whatever Halo Reach or ODST,

2663
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
whichever one came between 3 and 4

2664
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
that was actually first person shooter,

2665
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
you get waves, tower defense FPS

2666
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,000
is basically the quickest way that I can explain that.

2667
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:52,000
But it's just super interesting that now that

2668
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
we have the capability to do this and keep up,

2669
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
and capacity, mandatory storage,

2670
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
and all of that kind of thing,

2671
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:02,000
that games are now shifting so that certain experiences

2672
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
you probably only would have gotten on the computer before,

2673
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
now are finally on the console,

2674
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,000
and whatever doors open are interesting,

2675
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:13,000
but it's just interesting to finally see that

2676
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:16,000
with very specific AAA examples here and now.

2677
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Right.

2678
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Well, yeah, and it's pretty impressive

2679
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:22,000
how a lot of these big games are being very well supported,

2680
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:25,000
like Destiny is being, for all its criticisms,

2681
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
they have been working pretty regularly

2682
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
and quickly on these patches to improve

2683
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
the quality of life for the game.

2684
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
I really feel like I kind of hit a point in Destiny

2685
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
where I kind of ran out of things to do,

2686
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
and I realized I haven't done the raid,

2687
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:40,000
I could still push my character forward and so forth,

2688
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,000
but I don't know, I wasn't really super motivated.

2689
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I kind of felt like I hit the end of the story,

2690
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
I did all the single-player stuff,

2691
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
and I wasn't really motivated to push my character further

2692
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:52,000
by going on a gear hunt and relying on RNG,

2693
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,000
you know what I mean?

2694
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
But I feel like Destiny and Bungie

2695
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
did address some of those concerns,

2696
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
the whole criticisms that the Crypt arc

2697
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
would give you crap items,

2698
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
even when you brought in purple engrams and stuff,

2699
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
they at least kind of listened to some of that,

2700
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
so that doesn't make me hopeful for the future of the game,

2701
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
and like I said then, and like I say now,

2702
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
and like I'll say forever,

2703
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
if Blizzard could fix Diablo 3,

2704
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
and boy did they ever,

2705
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
you know, anything is possible

2706
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:20,000
as far as changing a game around with free patches.

2707
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Right.

2708
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
It's just interesting, because Destiny,

2709
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
every couple of days, I actually haven't played it

2710
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
in about a week or something like that,

2711
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
and I'm going to turn it on and get all the content updates.

2712
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I haven't even been keeping up with the news,

2713
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:36,000
just bits of things that I hear about around Twitter and whatnot.

2714
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:41,000
For somebody who has all but checked out of PC gaming,

2715
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:44,000
at least as far as new titles are concerned,

2716
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
it's super interesting to be like

2717
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:49,000
back in this familiar environment from my past,

2718
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
but be doing it on a newer console.

2719
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Yeah, and like you brought up earlier,

2720
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,000
MMOs, I think a lot of this is kind of borrowed from MMOs,

2721
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:01,000
and I talk ad nauseam about Final Fantasy XIV,

2722
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
but tomorrow they're getting another huge patch,

2723
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
which is quote unquote for free,

2724
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
and I put that in my quotey fingers

2725
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
because you are paying a monthly sub

2726
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
to play Final Fantasy XIV,

2727
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:14,000
so you should get some reasonable upkeep and so forth

2728
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
in some of these kind of free perks,

2729
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:20,000
but it's nice to see the games supported like that,

2730
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:23,000
and the fact that these games aren't paying monthly fees

2731
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:27,000
for giving us this stuff that's not necessarily tied to DLC.

2732
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Right. Amazon Prime's free two-day shipping,

2733
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
et cetera, et cetera.

2734
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Yeah, we all know the, oh, here's your free games

2735
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
that you get for the low, low price of money

2736
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
directly debited every month.

2737
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Yes, or release day shipping

2738
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
for something, that's how I got Bayonetta 2

2739
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
on Friday.

2740
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Ultimately, I suppose it's not really outlandish,

2741
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
it's just like, not to mention

2742
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
like being back in gaming regularly

2743
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
and all that kind of stuff since I've been home

2744
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
for a month and a half straight now,

2745
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
been able to actually like sit down

2746
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
and see this stuff happening to myself firsthand.

2747
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
It's also the positive side

2748
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
of the patching world we live in,

2749
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
and I know we've focused a lot, I mean, gamers

2750
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
focusing on the negative, get out.

2751
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
I know we've oftentimes focused on the negative

2752
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
of, well, with these stupid patches,

2753
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
you know, these companies can release

2754
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
these half-finished games, and we just have to get

2755
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
this day one patch and blah, blah, blah,

2756
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
but this is kind of the positive end of it,

2757
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
is like, oh, patching can also make

2758
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
an old game new again

2759
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
when there's a lot of games competing for your attention.

2760
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Yeah. Speaking of games competing for my attention,

2761
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
I have that 3D Realms anthology

2762
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
to get to, so hooray!

2763
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
You bought it, huh? Oh, yes, absolutely.

2764
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Like, those games are my childhood, period.

2765
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Like, those games were the ones

2766
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
that were on AOL Games,

2767
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
AOL Kids Games

2768
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
download section. Some of these things

2769
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
I even downloaded off BBS's,

2770
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Zmodem for Life.

2771
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Yeah, like, this

2772
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
is my childhood, and I

2773
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
owned almost

2774
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
none of them until the last couple of years,

2775
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
and now they're all here.

2776
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
I have, like, literally full versions

2777
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
of my entire, my entire

2778
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
childhood, and it's gonna be a good

2779
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
rest of the year. What game are you most looking

2780
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
forward to in that collection?

2781
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
My eyes immediately

2782
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
crossed Raptor and Monster Bash.

2783
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
I don't even know those.

2784
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
Raptor was a vertical

2785
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
shoot-em-up. You know,

2786
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
1942, very standard affair. I don't

2787
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
remember what interested me in it. Good soundtrack,

2788
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
good visuals, I guess. I don't know. I'm gonna

2789
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
find out, though. Monster Bash

2790
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
was a

2791
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
side-scrolling

2792
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
platformer. You

2793
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
played Johnny Dash,

2794
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
I think, and you

2795
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
had to rescue cats and dogs

2796
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
in this monster

2797
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
world of zombies and

2798
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
crows and skeletons and a bunch of

2799
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
other really, it's super

2800
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
cartoony, very, like, overdone

2801
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
sound effects and vivid colors,

2802
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
but again, that's a game

2803
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
that I only ever played the demo, and I played the

2804
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
demo to death multiple times.

2805
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
That whole collection is freaking

2806
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
amazing. I bet you can't

2807
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
wait to play such classics like Math

2808
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Rescue, as well.

2809
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
And the same thing,

2810
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
like, with 3D Realms,

2811
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
what 3Drealms.com used to be,

2812
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
like, I used to, even as an adult,

2813
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
even in the last couple of years, I would go to

2814
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
3Drealms.com, look at their games list,

2815
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
and just see the same shareware

2816
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
version, patch updates, retail

2817
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
updates, the Duke

2818
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Nukem, various Duke Nukem patches

2819
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
for, like, getting

2820
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
restoring

2821
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
mature, filtered,

2822
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
restoring violence in, like,

2823
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
clean versions that were rebuilt for, like,

2824
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Walmart, whenever they used to actually sell stuff

2825
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
like that, that kind of thing.

2826
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
And, like, 3D Realms and Apogee have been,

2827
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
have always

2828
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
held a place in my heart, and it's here.

2829
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
It's fantastic. Fantastic. Well, have a lot of fun

2830
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
with that, Jason. I shall.

2831
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Alright, you take care, buddy. You too. Alright, bye-bye.

2832
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
Always good to hear from the man, Jason,

2833
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
there, on the call. Oh, Wacky Wheels.

2834
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
I remember Wacky Wheels. Yeah.

2835
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Like a Mario Kart type game. I gotta be honest, a lot

2836
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
of those, I don't, oh my god, that,

2837
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
I do remember Wacky Wheels.

2838
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Yeah. Oh, god, that game was the bomb.

2839
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR,

2840
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
or username on Skype,

2841
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio, if you wanna give us a call.

2842
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Let's see, I do have some tweets

2843
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I wanna get to. We've accumulated quite

2844
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
a few tweets. I'm gonna apologize if I missed your

2845
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
tweet. If you tweeted us, like, earlier in the week,

2846
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
especially when we were out, I'm probably gonna miss your tweet

2847
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
cause we get mentioned sometimes in other

2848
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
conversations and things get lost.

2849
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Uh, but let's see, uh, tweet here from

2850
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Spaznator who says,

2851
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
if you could buy any one non-MAME

2852
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
cabinet, what would it be?

2853
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
For me, it would be a 4-slot

2854
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Neo Geo MVS.

2855
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Um,

2856
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
I came super close

2857
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
to legit buying a BurgerTime cabinet not that

2858
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
long ago. I saw one at the auction.

2859
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
And if I was in the financial place I was in

2860
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
now, then I would've bought

2861
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
it. But unfortunately I was

2862
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
going through a phase where I wasn't as fortunate

2863
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
so I didn't buy it. Only if you had a cabinet sitting within

2864
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
the computer that you could play BurgerTime on.

2865
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
But this, okay, but there's a, you have to admit, Loki,

2866
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
there is a difference. I mean, yes, it's awesome that there's

2867
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
but to have, like, the real thing

2868
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
is also very attractive.

2869
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
I understand. So, uh, that was

2870
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
one I came very close to buying.

2871
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
You know my friends would've eaten that,

2872
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
would've ate that shit up. What about,

2873
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Loki, what about you? Something, uh, you could buy.

2874
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
That's easy. What?

2875
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
I could get a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet.

2876
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Of course. Easy, I mean. Of course.

2877
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Come on, I mean, that's super easy.

2878
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Or, or if, I'm an idiot for not

2879
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
saying that. I am, you know, pretty

2880
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
out of shape, but hopefully that would help.

2881
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
But if I was gonna go lazy route, I would

2882
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
probably pick, like, a, I don't

2883
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
know, like a racing cabinet or something.

2884
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Maybe, like, uh,

2885
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
I don't know, F-Zero,

2886
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
AX, or, um. Oh.

2887
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
That'd be awesome. I don't know.

2888
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
You know what pisses me off is I went back to that

2889
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
place to see if I could get it, and it was

2890
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
gone. You know, well, I can say this, I guess

2891
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
on air, it doesn't matter. You know, uh, Denia was out

2892
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
in Roseville, right? Yeah. It used to be that place across the

2893
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
street, the, uh, auction town

2894
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
or whatever it was called. Oh, I never went there. Gone.

2895
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
They had that, oh, man.

2896
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
I'm so, so angry about that.

2897
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Seriously, just look on Craigslist. There's so many

2898
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
people selling like that. Yeah, and actually, uh,

2899
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
and a baby Pac-Man is something I've

2900
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
always considered for a long time, too.

2901
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
And Dark Soccer knows about that one, cause that's,

2902
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
that's that half pinball, half game

2903
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
one. That one's a lot of fun.

2904
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
They have some, well, yeah, yeah.

2905
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Alan, you'd understand if I bought

2906
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
a baby Pac-Man machine, right? If you came home from work

2907
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
one day and there's a baby Pac-Man machine in the living room,

2908
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
would you, uh, would you understand that?

2909
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Oh, he's coming over. I would,

2910
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
and it is such a rare

2911
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
novelty to see

2912
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
a half and half

2913
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
game like that, but at the

2914
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
same time as either version

2915
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
of the screen game or the pinball, they're

2916
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
both not that

2917
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
great. It's just the fact that they're

2918
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
integrated together that makes it like

2919
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
cool, but the pinball's kind of

2920
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
jank if I remember.

2921
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Crushing my dreams live on air, did you hear

2922
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
that? Well, you can bring one home if you want,

2923
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
but it kind of sucks.

2924
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
You could bring it home if your taste is

2925
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
crap.

2926
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
Fine. What do you want me to bring home, Alan?

2927
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
What, what, what, what arcade machine or

2928
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
thing would you want to see?

2929
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Oh, he says Killer Instinct 1 or 2.

2930
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Can I just get a Nintendo 64 and

2931
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Killer Instinct Gold? Wouldn't that be enough?

2932
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
I'm offended.

2933
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Alan just said, I'm offended

2934
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
and walked out. Alright,

2935
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
um, I need to get a room

2936
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
ambient mic so you guys can hear him.

2937
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Uh, anyway, S. Jonah and Matt

2938
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
tweeted us and said, I went to a friend's wedding

2939
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
this weekend and the bride and groom walked

2940
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
the aisle to Lindsey Stirling's

2941
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
rendition of the Halo theme.

2942
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
So I ask, what gaming tune

2943
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
would you like to hear at a wedding?

2944
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
No happy wedding jokes

2945
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
from BeatMania 2DX.

2946
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
I actually went to a wedding that was

2947
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
Halo themed as well. I don't think it was that

2948
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
same thing, but they walked down the aisle

2949
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
the music from Halo. I'm not kidding.

2950
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
That was, and that was over ten years

2951
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
ago at this point. That's what sold me on an Xbox.

2952
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Was, uh, getting to play

2953
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Halo for the first time. Uh, local

2954
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
area, not Halo 2, but Halo 1

2955
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
LAN, uh, style

2956
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
at that wedding reception. That

2957
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
sold me on the Xbox.

2958
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
That and DDR Ultimix.

2959
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Loki, I know you already had

2960
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
your wedding, but, um,

2961
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
you know, let's say you got to

2962
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
do it again and, uh, the wife would let

2963
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
you do anything you want.

2964
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
What video game? She's like, okay, I want you to ruin

2965
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
this. Exactly.

2966
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Exactly. Okay, if I'm gonna pick the

2967
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
song that's gonna ruin,

2968
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
ruin the, um,

2969
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
let's see, the most inappropriate

2970
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
song I can think of,

2971
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
um, walking down the aisle too

2972
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
just because it would really script the tempo

2973
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
and everything would be like,

2974
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
I don't know, like, drop

2975
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
out or, you know, uh,

2976
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
maybe, uh,

2977
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
you know, max 300 or something

2978
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
stupid. Drop the bomb. Drop the

2979
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
bomb.

2980
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Uh, no, I got

2981
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
this, what is it, uh,

2982
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
secret rendezvous or something.

2983
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Stop.

2984
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
Um, let's see, now,

2985
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
now see, here's the problem is that I already

2986
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
know I'm gonna walk down the aisle

2987
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
to ABBA music just like in Muriel's Wedding

2988
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
for anybody that's ever seen that movie. That's, that's what it's going

2989
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
to be and it's non-negotiable, but

2990
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
I suppose if it had

2991
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
to be video game music, I don't know,

2992
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
like, maybe something

2993
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Final Fantasy-ish?

2994
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
I'm sure there's tons of people that have done,

2995
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
like, a thousand words or something. One-winged angel, yeah.

2996
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Okay.

2997
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Okay, you got it. One-winged angel.

2998
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
That would do it.

2999
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
I'm sure someone has

3000
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
walked down the aisle to that. I'm sure

3001
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
there's some, like, nerd couple out there that

3002
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
walked down the aisle to that.

3003
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Alright, one more, uh, plug for

3004
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
phone calls here. Last chance to get in.

3005
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

3006
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
her username on Skype, Orange

3007
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Lounge Radio. Could somebody,

3008
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
like, mod the lyrics so it was, like,

3009
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
me, da, de, da,

3010
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
da, da, da, Rob Roberts.

3011
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Could we, could we get it modded somehow?

3012
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
I don't know. Alright.

3013
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

3014
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Rob will walk down the aisle to Leviathan.

3015
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
No, that's Shane.

3016
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
That would be, that would be Shane

3017
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
that would want to get married to, uh, the Leviathan

3018
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
song from Final Fantasy 14.

3019
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Just saying.

3020
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Alright, uh, Loki, do you have any last minute

3021
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
stories for us? Because our phones aren't lining

3022
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
up. I'm about to close them.

3023
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
Um, yeah, we can talk a little bit about,

3024
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
um, they're saying that, uh,

3025
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
I guess right now

3026
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
the first idea

3027
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
of what Microsoft's gonna do with the

3028
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
Minecraft property is

3029
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
trying to, um,

3030
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
merge the console, PC,

3031
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
and mobile versions together a little bit

3032
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
like maybe having them interact with

3033
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
each other or something like that.

3034
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
It's incredibly vague.

3035
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
I guess it was coming from some sort of

3036
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
IGN podcast or something like that.

3037
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Um, I guess the

3038
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
PlayStation 4 has outsold the

3039
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Xbox One by 40% worldwide.

3040
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
As of right now, so that's

3041
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
interesting, I guess.

3042
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Um, and then, of course,

3043
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
um, what was it?

3044
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
They're saying that the Xbox One sales are up.

3045
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
But,

3046
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
I think it's gonna, I think the Xbox One's gonna do

3047
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
fine. They've got really good

3048
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
first party games coming out.

3049
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Halo Collection will be a good.

3050
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Yeah, Halo Collection, I mean, they've got strong

3051
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
titles coming out. What's Sony have?

3052
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
Sony has

3053
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
Drive Club, which is just a fucking mess,

3054
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
unfortunately. And Little Big Planet 3,

3055
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
which Little Big Planet 3 is a good game,

3056
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
but it's not gonna fucking sell systems.

3057
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
Uh, Inertia is what, I mean,

3058
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
and everything you talked about earlier about all my friends

3059
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
already have one type of thing. I mean,

3060
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
that's my honest answer. I mean,

3061
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
it's a bigger deal than

3062
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
you think, because, you know, it's like

3063
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Destiny. Like, for a lot

3064
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
of people I know, PlayStation 4 is

3065
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
the console to have Destiny on. Why?

3066
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Because that's where everybody else has it, and I want to play with my friends.

3067
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Like, we had our buddy Delvin from

3068
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
Video Game Realness was on Hoard House,

3069
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
and he was talking about Destiny,

3070
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
and I'm like, Delvin, you play Destiny?

3071
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Why have we never played together? And he's like, because I'm on

3072
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
Xbox One.

3073
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
And nobody's over here on

3074
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Xbox One that I know.

3075
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
So, it's kind of unfortunate.

3076
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Yeah.

3077
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Alright. Any other

3078
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
last minute stories here for us to get to?

3079
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
That's it.

3080
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
That's about it. Well, the phones are not lighting up,

3081
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
so I think that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange

3082
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
Lounge Radio. I want to

3083
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
thank you guys for listening to the show tonight, and

3084
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
taking time out of your day or

3085
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
night, whatever the case may be, if you're listening

3086
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
to the show, to listen to the show.

3087
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
I want to thank, once again, the folks at Retro

3088
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Magazine for coming on tonight, and best of luck

3089
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
on that Kickstarter. Usually I would say I hope

3090
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
you get the Kickstarter, but they already made the

3091
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
goals, so I hope, I hope they

3092
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
attain enough stretch goals so that they

3093
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
can do something even bigger

3094
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
than they did in year one. That's the wishes

3095
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
that I send over to Retro Magazine.

3096
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Best of luck to them. And

3097
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
you can, again, find them at

3098
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
reidretro.com and

3099
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
their Kickstarter, reidretro.com slash

3100
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Kickstarter. Again,

3101
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
thank you guys for listening to us. I know we were gone

3102
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
last week, so I appreciate you sticking with us

3103
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
and coming right back to the show tonight.

3104
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

3105
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
please, don't forget to tell a friend or

3106
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
two or five or twenty about

3107
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
the show. Help spread the word about

3108
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Orange Lounge Radio. And if you don't like this show,

3109
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
then you know what? Screw you. No,

3110
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Go support a show,

3111
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
go support another indie

3112
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
show, because there probably is somebody

3113
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
out there making a show that's right up your alley

3114
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
and it's a hardworking indie producer

3115
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
just like us, so please support

3116
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
independent broadcasting.

3117
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3118
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
DarkSakura's not here tonight.

3119
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
She'll be back on the show next week.

3120
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
She's been moving, so I'm

3121
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
sure her final thought would probably be

3122
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
along the lines of, I'm really tired

3123
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
and I want a taco.

3124
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
I'm gonna guess that would be DarkSakura's final thought.

3125
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3126
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
I guess I'll just work more of my game

3127
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
this week and hopefully maybe get some actual

3128
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Playstation 4 games so that I can

3129
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
well, hopefully play some Playstation 4

3130
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
games. I don't know if I'm really gonna

3131
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
I don't wanna buy any more digital games.

3132
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
I already have three physical games that I just

3133
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
haven't gotten to play yet and two digital ones

3134
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
coming out in November, plus

3135
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
I'm probably gonna buy like Far Cry 4

3136
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
and maybe The Crew,

3137
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
we'll see.

3138
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
So I don't wanna like

3139
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
I don't wanna do what I do with every single console

3140
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
launch where I'm like, oh, games, games, games, games, games!

3141
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
And don't play any of them, so it's like, you know.

3142
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
So, yeah.

3143
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Alright. Well,

3144
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
when that patch comes out, you and I have to

3145
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
play some Diablo online and test that thing

3146
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
out at some point. I'm gonna be

3147
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
with my show on Friday, I'm gonna be a little

3148
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
busy this week, but maybe Tuesday or Thursday

3149
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
somewhere around there, I'll be available

3150
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
if the patch works right away on Tuesday

3151
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
which I'm not always anticipating it to.

3152
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
But we'll get around to it.

3153
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
Actually, my final thought tonight is

3154
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I need to go finish my game

3155
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
of Beyond Earth because I made the mistake

3156
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
of playing on like a normal-sized map

3157
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
and I'm on like turn 200 plus

3158
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
and still nowhere close to being done

3159
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
so I need to go finish my game of Beyond Earth.

3160
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
So, and,

3161
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
oh my gosh, Final Fantasy XIV goes down tonight

3162
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
for an entire day and I still have to get my drop

3163
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
out of Circus Tower! I got games to play,

3164
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
people! I hope you do, too.

3165
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Have a great week. Be nice to each other,

3166
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
people. It's a crazy time right now

3167
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
on gaming, so, you know, treat people

3168
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
how you want to be treated. Don't be a jerk.

3169
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Take care of each other. Good night.

3170
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
See you next week.

3171
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Thanks for watching!
