14000	27000	Tonight we interview Lunar Ray Games, creators of the kick-started title Time Spinner, a 2D metroidvania platformer coming to multiple systems next year. We'll have this and much more along with your questions in chat, calls and emails right here on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
31000	47000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio Live with this episode number 571 for today which is October the 12th, 2014.
47000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts joined by my co-host. Say hello here in studio to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Hi.
55000	56000	Hi, how are you?
56000	57000	I did a thing today.
57000	58000	What did you do today?
58000	59000	I slept a lot.
59000	61000	You slept a lot. Congratulations.
61000	64000	No, I did another thing today but you'll find out about that during what I played.
64000	73000	Oh my, okay. Well, you had a very me day and I had a very you day because to reward myself because we have a big show tonight. Tonight it's like OLR is taped in front of a live studio audience. We have so many people here in the studio.
73000	75000	You left track.
76000	89000	But since we have a busy show tonight and I did a performance last night because as you know I do the shadow cast theater stuff although as I announced on the show a couple weeks ago that's all going to be winding down very soon. So my next to last show was last night.
89000	92000	So I rewarded myself with tacos today. So I had a very Jamie day.
92000	93000	Tacos are amazing.
93000	95000	Tacos are great. So there you go.
95000	96000	Tacos are amazing.
96000	101000	Awesome. Alright, also amazing. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
101000	102000	Hi.
102000	103000	Hi, how are you Loki?
103000	104000	Clean spam.
104000	108000	Clean spam. Are you getting attacked by the spam bots on your email account again?
108000	112000	I just haven't checked in like a couple days and so I have a million messages.
112000	120000	Uh oh. And it's like, you know, would you like to enlarge your penis or would you like to enter the lottery in Nigeria or whatever spams?
120000	126000	No, it's increase the value of your home. Mysterious water of life vanishes.
126000	132000	I love it when I get those emails that are like increase the value of your home. It's like, I'm a runner. Delete.
132000	139000	Delete. Alright, anyway, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern to the voice of Geeks Network,
139000	144000	vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. We do have a very busy show tonight.
144000	155000	We have, as mentioned there in the intro, Bodhi Lee from Luna Ray Games going to join us in about 25 minutes here to talk all about what they're up to and their game time spinner.
155000	158000	That's going to be awesome. But here in studio, we have a very packed house.
158000	167000	I want to get to it here. Kicking off tonight, introducing our guests. First off, this is a name you might recognize if you've been listening to OLR for a very, very, very long time,
167000	174000	but she hasn't been here in way too long. So welcome back to the show. Princess Irene is here tonight. Hi, Princess Irene.
174000	181000	Hello. How are you? Doing pretty well. How about you? Good. Great. So we're all caught up. Let's move on. No, I'm kidding.
182000	191000	So, okay. So for those that haven't heard you on the show before, you've been a gamer as long as I've known you, which has been a very long time.
191000	197000	I remember we used to play DDR together and all that fun stuff. What kind of games do you like? Like, what are your favorite sorts of games?
197000	205000	Well, obviously, rhythm based games. That's kind of how we met. Well, not how we met, but a lot of our friends. I like RPGs. I like puzzle games.
205000	213000	I'm sounding like the, I don't know, stereotypical like girl gamer or something, but, you know, it's kind of on an independent case.
213000	221000	I just judge it based on like what I see. So, yeah. But you also play a lot of like recent stuff too, because I noticed before we were getting started here,
221000	228000	there was like a Smash 3DS brawl going on during Bobby's show. So yes. Yeah. Is that what you've been into kind of lately?
228000	239000	Yeah. I mean, um, you know, I'm Poe, so we just got a 3DS last year. We actually got two of them, but, um, I've been loving it, you know, and I've been trying to catch up on, on a backlog of games on the 3DS.
239000	246000	So that's been great. And yeah, I got, um, Smash Brothers for my one year wedding anniversary. So isn't that romantic?
246000	253000	Oh, congratulations. No, it is. It's awesome. Yeah. And you're, well, your husband's a giant nerd too. So, you know,
253000	264000	Yes. Yeah. The couple that plays together, stays together. Wink. Indeed. Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, you're getting a lot of welcomes there.
264000	272000	Like, yay, Irene. Yay. Hi Irene. Yay, Rice Princess. Yay, anniversaries. Cause you used to go by that name and then you switched cause you know, you can.
272000	279000	Yeah. I wanted to be less racist. No, I'm kidding. Thanks for remembering me guys. Oh, hearts and feels.
279000	287000	So while you've been gone, this is interesting though, because while you've been gone, I mean, I don't think you've been on OLR in probably at least a year and a half. It's probably been almost longer.
287000	292000	I think it's more than that. Yeah. It's been a while, but while you've been gone, you just decided to start your own show.
292000	303000	Not really. I was invited onto another show by another person who's here tonight. Um, and it's, it's just worked out. So yeah.
303000	312000	No, I th you know, we say support indie podcasting and I actually think that is like super fucking awesome that you're doing your own thing right now. Yeah. Cause you guys are focused on like retro type of games, right?
312000	321000	Um, most, well, we don't really like to call yourself a retro cast, but it ends up being a retro cast cause we're all like really old gamers.
321000	329000	It's usually what it is. Everything, you know, new is crappy and everything old is good. So kind of pretty much that's not true. Yeah.
329000	336000	Well, it's appropriate that you're here tonight when we're going to be talking to somebody who's developing a new game, but very influenced by the retro stuff.
336000	347000	I've heard a thing or two about this game. Let's be real. You actually put this on my radar. I'm glad you did. I'm excited. Me too. Yeah.
347000	355000	All right. Awesome. Well, let's talk to your cohost who's also joining us here tonight. Say hello everybody. I didn't ask if he has an alias. Do you have an alias that you use or should I call you by your name or what?
356000	365000	The universal handle is usually the mad piper. Okay. Whatever you find. So mad piper it is. How are you doing? I'm well. Yeah. Yeah. Welcome to the show.
365000	370000	Thanks. I'm excited. All right. Tell us a little bit about what you and Irene do on your show.
370000	377000	It's called the multi-tap podcast. It's on the Fistful of Potions network. You guys have the VoG network here.
377000	388000	It's mainly just, I don't know if we even have a theme really. It's a lot of tangentry and it's loosely based around older video games or newer video games.
388000	394000	Tangentry. Not familiar with tangentry. No, we only stick to business here. You're on the wrong show, buddy. I'm sorry to say.
394000	401000	I probably won't talk a lot. Well, okay. Since you guys are retro fans, what are some of your retro classics?
401000	408000	Because I've known her forever, but I've only just met you, although I've heard your show. But what are some of your favorite classics?
408000	417000	Goodness. I think I mention Super Mario RPG on every episode. Final Fantasy VII. Really like big ones, but there's some that just really stick out for me.
417000	421000	I'm really liking theater in them, though. But my poor 3DS is in the shop.
421000	422000	What happened?
422000	435000	So, I found out there's a numskull somewhere that built the 3DS and the motherboard is warped. So when it was in assembly, you know those little hooks that you can put a lanyard on?
435000	438000	Thank you.
439000	448000	So the motherboard was put on top of that. Or I guess one corner of the motherboard was kind of assembled on top of that. And so, it's having a hard time. It won't read the SD card anymore.
448000	453000	Now, you're getting some hellos in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
453000	457000	Ochikawa says, hello Piper, great radio voice. Link to podcast?
457000	458000	Oh, hi.
460000	463000	It would be, I guess, at fop.net. You can find it on the webpage.
463000	464000	Wait, fop?
464000	465000	Yeah, F-F-O-P.
465000	469000	Oh, okay. I thought he said something else for a minute there. I was like, the fap? What is this?
469000	474000	The fap net? If you listen to the show, you'll understand. You'll feel a sudden urge.
474000	476000	So, this is for fop?
476000	477000	This is for fop.
477000	478000	Okay.
478000	491000	fop.net, Fistful of Potions. Or I think spelled out fistfulofpotions.com. And then we're on the webpage or on iTunes or on YouTube. We have a playlist up on YouTube, so you can find it fairly easily.
491000	497000	Nice. Awesome, awesome. So, tell us about what you talked about on your most recent episode, if people would check it out.
497000	509000	We had actually, we went out of sequence, but we did episode Mighty No. 9 to celebrate Mighty No. 9 coming out, I guess, soon. So, we couldn't talk about that very much, so we just kind of talked a lot about Mega Man.
511000	512000	That's fine.
512000	516000	We had nothing else. But it was a good time.
516000	521000	We were going to talk about Mighty No. 9, but then we realized nobody's played it, so we'll just talk about Mega Man. It works.
521000	522000	Yeah.
522000	524000	Which one's the best Mega Man? Ooh.
524000	525000	Ooh.
525000	526000	You have to listen to the podcast.
526000	528000	I'm asking you now.
528000	529000	Oh, man. For me?
529000	530000	Yeah.
530000	531000	I like X.
531000	532000	You like X?
532000	533000	I like X.
533000	534000	Really?
534000	535000	But it's one of the few I've played.
535000	536000	You dare to not say two or three?
536000	542000	I've played one, two, and three, and X, and I think I loved X the most just from nostalgia's sake, from when I was little.
542000	544000	It did the most for me. You got armor.
544000	545000	Yeah, you did.
545000	548000	Extra, not back to canisters, what are those? Energy capsules.
548000	561000	I think two will always be my favorite, but again, I think that's a nostalgia thing. Like, I had played one when it was new, but then two is that game you saw in Nintendo Power, and you were like, this looks like a frickin' cartoon.
561000	575000	These graphics are so amazing. Oh my God, my mind is blown. And then the game comes out, and it really does, like, for graphics of the time, looked so good. Like, some of those, like, I remember the giant fish in Bubble Man's stage. That was amazing for us, right?
575000	579000	You gotta listen to the episode. One of our co-hosts is Bubble Man's number one fanboy.
579000	580000	Okay. Alright.
580000	582000	He said the right one.
582000	585000	That is something. Bubble Man's fanboy.
585000	588000	We also talk about Bubble Man's wiry remains.
589000	599000	Nice. Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Somebody over there, Raginator, is quickly registering for fap.com, so there you go.
599000	600000	Oh, man.
600000	612000	Agdeft says, I'm still waiting for Mega Man X20. Bochikawa says Mega Man 9. Oh, sorry, no, that's Mighty No. 9. So feels like classic Mega Man to me, even though you dash constantly everywhere.
612000	616000	Now, some people have played it because there's that beta for the backers of a certain level on Steam, right?
616000	617000	That's none of us.
617000	624000	Let's see. And Dungeon Buster agrees. Mega Man 2 is so good. Well, because you have good taste, sir. Alright.
624000	629000	We're going to move on. I'm going to introduce one other guy we have here. I told you guys it was a full house here tonight.
629000	639000	Not only do we have our friends here from the MultiTap podcast on FFFOP, but we have another old friend of OLR back tonight making his yearly visit to the studio.
639000	641000	Say hello, everybody, to JB Mon.
641000	642000	Hello.
642000	643000	How you doing?
643000	644000	Pretty good. You?
644000	645000	Pretty good. You?
645000	649000	Good. You just flew in from New York City the other day, right?
649000	654000	Yeah. My sister had gotten married this past weekend, so, you know, I figured I might as well show up.
654000	660000	Might as well. Well, that's I mean, that's still really awesome because you usually when you come visit your sister, from what I recall, is in the Bay Area somewhere.
660000	661000	Yeah.
661000	664000	And we're still a good two hour drive from the Bay Area. That's still, you know, dedication.
664000	666000	Like an hour and a half, two hours, depending on traffic.
666000	670000	Oh, okay. So did you get a lot of wine at the wedding?
670000	677000	Yeah. It wasn't like free bar for like liquor or beer, but like wine. They were just like cases and cases and cases of wine.
677000	686000	And, you know, today they were picking everything up. They had maybe like one or two bottles of wine left out of like 50, 15 cases.
686000	688000	And all the kegs were still almost full.
688000	689000	Nice. Nice.
689000	690000	My family likes wine.
690000	697000	Now, our other guests were promoting a podcast, and I know you used to do one, but your podcast list right now, right?
697000	698000	No, it started.
698000	699000	Oh, you did?
699000	700000	Yeah.
700000	701000	Oh, yay.
701000	702000	It's about one episode every month or so.
702000	704000	Okay. All right. Hey. Do it when you do it.
704000	705000	It's still about Eurobeat.
705000	706000	Yeah.
706000	707000	So.
707000	712000	Well, we have a lot of fans of like DDR, and so if you like that kind of music, this is going to be right up your alley, right?
712000	720000	Yeah. And we've sort of been inspired by Orange Lounge Radio, so we kind of get on the tangent train all the time.
720000	721000	Nice.
721000	724000	Because, you know, it's not a good podcast if you don't have tangents.
724000	729000	That's very humbling to hear that, although to be fair, I don't think we invented the tangent here at Orange Lounge Radio.
729000	731000	Hey, I'm giving you credit, so take it.
731000	733000	You know what? I'll take it. I'll take it. That's awesome.
733000	738000	So you guys, do you play a lot of the music, or you just talk about it, or how does that work?
738000	739000	Both.
739000	740000	Both?
740000	743000	Because, you know, you can't really just play the music straight for copyright reasons, so.
743000	744000	Right.
744000	748000	I like to think we got away with it for talking over it and keeping it in a low volume.
748000	751000	You know, just skirting the issue completely.
751000	752000	Sure.
752000	753000	It's like, this is a gray area.
753000	760000	This is a gray area. But, I mean, you tend to play stuff from, like, the probably, let's be real, most people probably haven't heard.
760000	761000	At least in America.
761000	762000	Right.
762000	763000	Yeah.
763000	764000	So, you know.
764000	768000	Although, recently in the past few years, Avex has been putting a lot of it on American iTunes.
768000	772000	So, it's kind of like, years and years and years, US doesn't exist.
772000	777000	And then, like, 2008, 9 happened. It's like, everything on iTunes at once.
777000	778000	Yeah.
778000	787000	Well, that's been happening a lot with, like, video game soundtracks and other types of things that, you know, I remember we used to have to, you'd have the one corner of the comic book shop that would have, like, the import CDs from Japan.
787000	788000	Yeah.
788000	792000	Where it's like, you have a Final Fantasy soundtrack and a, you know, a Hamasaki Ayumi CD, and that's about it.
792000	797000	Yeah, and then they'd want, like, $70 for five songs, and it's like, you're smoking crack.
797000	799000	That's still A-1 Comics.
799000	801000	Is that, you still do that there?
801000	802000	Except they do that for the bootlegs.
802000	811000	Well, and then I remember when it was the giant Virgin Megastore in, and this is not a place to buy Virgins, it was, you know, Richard Branson.
811000	820000	It was a Virgin Megastore in San Francisco, right, not far from the Metron, used to have, like, all the, not just the Japanese imports, but then it was all, like, the Euro, Euro singles.
820000	826000	So, it's like, if there's, like, a Kylie Minogue song you haven't heard, they probably have it at the Virgin Megastore, right?
826000	828000	I wasted a lot of money at Virgin Megastore.
828000	830000	Oh, you're a Kylie fan too?
830000	841000	No, I was an import, I was a Ministry of Sound fan, and I used to pick up a bunch of different mix CDs from all these European imports, and they're, like, I spent hundreds of dollars there.
841000	847000	No, no, no, no. Let's rewind this a little bit to the same era for me in Alabama.
847000	848000	Okay.
848000	854000	Oh, I could order this for $100 with shipping? I'm ordering the single.
854000	860000	Oh, my gosh, no way, no way. That's, like, that's how much it would cost to, like, get a game imported from Japan.
860000	866000	I can order a Super Famicom game for only $120? Yes, I'll order the Sailor Moon S Fighting Game.
866000	868000	True story.
868000	877000	Oh, my gosh. Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see, Locopoco says, OLR perfected the tangent. Oh, well, thank you very much, I appreciate that.
877000	886000	SSG100Matt says, the things I'm hearing at a New York Comic Con is that it's a mess. Oh, JV Mon, you ran out of town the weekend New York Comic Con is happening, are you? How do you feel about that?
886000	895000	Around the time I was going to buy tickets, my sister's like, by the way, my wedding's the weekend of the 11th, and I'm like, God damn it.
895000	897000	You need to move your wedding.
897000	906000	That's kind of pretty much what I told her. I was like, it can't be the week before or after. She's like, nope, it's the 11th, and I'm like, well, you suck.
907000	914000	And I'm not gonna lie, I sort of considered it. I was like, do I have to go for the whole weekend for the wedding? Can I just show up that morning?
914000	919000	Well, then does that make it like, be honest, does it make you kind of feel better that you're hearing that New York Comic Con's a little bit of a mess?
919000	922000	Because you're like, oh, since I couldn't go anyway, fuck them.
922000	927000	That, and I hear there's like this whole nonsense with banned weapons, like if it wasn't made out of cardboard.
927000	930000	I saw like garbage pails filled with weapons.
930000	939000	Yeah, I think if it wasn't made out of cardboard or foam, they pretty much, I'm hearing conflicting reports, they either took it from you and threw it out or they took it from you and you got it back at the end of the day.
939000	943000	Either way, that's like, people work hard on that stuff. That's kind of BS.
943000	947000	Yeah, well, I mean, but if that's the policy of the con, you didn't read up on the policy or whatever.
947000	955000	But I also heard that they had like conflicting policies, like their mobile site said one thing regarding weapons and the actual like PC site said something else.
956000	962000	Maybe there's an overreaction too, because I don't know if you've been on Twitter this week or whatever, but people like legitimately went fucking crazy.
962000	964000	People went crazy on Twitter?
964000	965000	I know, right?
965000	970000	But did they have a ball pit? Was there a ball pit? Because that's really the most important part.
970000	977000	Hopefully Rama went. Hopefully Rama, actually, I think John from Critical Myth went, so we might get the ball pit report from John a little later.
977000	979000	I know that Kayla went.
979000	980000	Okay.
980000	983000	So I can ask her. She's actually cosplaying a couple of people.
983000	984000	We have spies.
984000	988000	Yeah, well, I know that the big stink was about them confiscating cosplay props.
988000	992000	Rana might have been too busy with that buff boys van outside of his place.
994000	998000	That's great that none of the listeners are going to know what that is. Let's see.
998000	1001000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1001000	1004000	Akdev says people went crazy on the internet? No way.
1004000	1010000	Dungeon Buster says the arsenal of foam freedom. So like nerf weapons were banned too? That would be really sad.
1010000	1012000	No, I think like you could only get through if it was foam.
1012000	1014000	Oh, okay. Well, that's good.
1014000	1015000	Nerf off the place.
1015000	1020000	Nerf weapons are fun. Like, why would you not have a nerf weapon? That's the honest question.
1020000	1024000	They just stuck to the policy. It's nerf or nothing.
1028000	1037000	Amazing. Alright, we're just about ten minutes out from our interview, but we're going to start tonight by going around and finding out for everybody here in studio.
1037000	1041000	How was your gaming week and what types of video games have you been playing this week?
1041000	1046000	Kind of establishing our frame of reference here before we get too far into the show. DarkSakura, start us off.
1046000	1053000	I played Super Smash Brothers because I woke up after Yom Kippur and found that waiting for me and I was like, ooh.
1053000	1061000	So I've got that. I'm trying to remember to finish playing Bravely Default, which I've been sort of, because I've been so busy at work I haven't really had a chance to.
1061000	1072000	Final Fantasy XIV, which I'm chopping down trees and stealing things from them. And today we did the thing. The thing.
1072000	1081000	We broke out the ignition pads to test them with DDR Max. So Dan and I played DDR this morning.
1081000	1085000	Wow. Like legit, like DDR Max on PS2?
1086000	1098000	On our JPS2, which is like, I can't, I'm old, I can't let my drawer out. You better sneak that disc in in five nanoseconds or that's going to go, no, I'm taking it back.
1098000	1106000	Wow. So our PS2 first model still works. Barely. So that's what we've been doing.
1106000	1108000	What made you decide to play that of all things? Was it just like...
1108000	1111000	To make sure our dance pads worked.
1112000	1114000	That's right. You guys have a move coming up.
1114000	1118000	We picked up three ignition pads at the thrift store for six bucks.
1118000	1119000	Really? I want one.
1119000	1123000	Well, one of them was given away. We have two left. I didn't break yours.
1123000	1125000	Why didn't you call me first?
1125000	1132000	You knew I had those because I put it on the internet three years ago. Look what I got at the thrift store by my house.
1132000	1134000	All I'm hearing are excuses. No, I'm kidding. It's fine. It's fine.
1135000	1140000	Let's be real. Me playing DDR is my big butt on the couch with the controller going up, down, left, right, up, up, up, down.
1140000	1147000	Well, you know what? When I clean out the closet, when we start getting rid of parts of the vault, then I'll call you.
1147000	1150000	We actually are going to be packing up the vault coming up this week.
1150000	1153000	I'll help you move, but if games go missing...
1153000	1157000	I'm not looking forward to packing the vault because we're not keeping the shelves.
1157000	1161000	Moving is punishment for murder in some countries. I'm almost positive.
1161000	1167000	I'm going to have to take pictures of the shelves and put them up somewhere before we disassemble the shelves and get rid of them.
1167000	1171000	We're probably going to be getting bins for everything, so we're probably going to go off on tangents and say,
1171000	1174000	Let's see if this game still works. Let's see if this game still works.
1174000	1177000	Oh, this is in the box. We could get $500 for this.
1177000	1180000	You should make a YouTube series out of this. I'm telling you, this is a golden opportunity here.
1182000	1184000	Effort.
1184000	1188000	I know. I know. It's so difficult. Anything else quickly before we move on?
1188000	1190000	I like pie.
1190000	1192000	Ricky, how was your gaming week?
1192000	1195000	I had programming. I didn't play anything.
1195000	1197000	It's still continuing on your programming request.
1197000	1200000	Wait, this is your time between jobs right now, right?
1200000	1205000	Well, not much. I start a week from Monday.
1205000	1207000	Okay.
1207000	1210000	Well, potentially start. It's either a week from Monday or three weeks from Monday.
1210000	1212000	Okay, whatever they decide, yeah.
1213000	1215000	But, I mean, just watching the kids.
1215000	1219000	But, yeah, lots of programming. I've been programming tools to make levels.
1219000	1221000	Nice.
1221000	1226000	I finished that, and I was converting some stuff over to make it work with the new stuff.
1226000	1231000	And I just found the mistake I made, so I had to go back and fix that.
1231000	1234000	But, yeah, that's what I've been working on.
1234000	1238000	I registered a site domain and a Twitter account.
1238000	1242000	Can you unveil the name of your company now, or are we waiting on that?
1242000	1244000	Well, I don't really have a company yet.
1244000	1252000	It's placeholder because in order to file a trademark, you have to have evidence that you're using it.
1252000	1258000	And so I have to have a website with the name of my game on it for a while.
1258000	1260000	Got it.
1260000	1267000	And then once I've done that, then I can file paperwork to register the name, the trademark.
1267000	1270000	I don't know about trademarking the company. It's expensive.
1270000	1272000	Seems like a lot. Yeah, yeah.
1272000	1273000	We'll see.
1273000	1275000	Just don't steal Loki's name or you're a dick.
1275000	1277000	That's basically how it boils down to, right?
1277000	1283000	Yeah, so I've got that, and I don't know.
1283000	1285000	I've been just kind of bouncing around a bunch of different things.
1285000	1288000	I looked for music earlier this week, but mainly just coding stuff.
1288000	1291000	And now I'm pretty much still at the spot I was at.
1291000	1293000	I was just getting a bunch of stuff.
1293000	1302000	I was kind of trying to model the tools I'm making off of stuff that's the same kind of tools that they have for making levels in Minecraft.
1302000	1306000	Kind of like the world builder stuff or voxel sniper or something like that.
1306000	1314000	So I'm building similar things because that's what I've used before to make stuff in Minecraft, and that was super easy.
1314000	1320000	And so since a lot of the stuff that I'm making for my levels is voxel based, even though it's not all cubes,
1321000	1333000	I kind of based it off of that just to get some ideas for things to make it a little bit easier than plotting one block at a time, which would take fucking forever.
1333000	1334000	So we'll see.
1334000	1339000	I still haven't gotten actually tested yet because it hasn't worked yet because I still have to fix this other bug here.
1339000	1343000	I changed something that I thought I needed to change, but I didn't.
1343000	1345000	Ah, bug testing. What the life.
1345000	1346000	Yeah.
1346000	1347000	Alright.
1347000	1349000	I'll move on to my gaming week, then we'll get to our guests here.
1349000	1355000	For my gaming week, I finally got my 70 hardcore character in Diablo 3 seasonal.
1355000	1356000	Thank you very much.
1356000	1360000	Finally, it took me forever, but because I was too afraid to play on high difficulties because I didn't want to die.
1360000	1361000	But I did.
1361000	1364000	That was my first hardcore character ever, and I made it all the way to 70 without dying on a demon hunter.
1364000	1365000	So yay.
1365000	1367000	So are you going to encase it in glass and make sure no one ever touches it?
1367000	1368000	Pretty much.
1368000	1369000	No.
1369000	1374000	Now that I got that and that was the goal, now is where I'm going to start playing really stupid.
1374000	1378000	So this character will die at some point because I'm going to keep pushing the envelope until...
1378000	1382000	But that's okay because I reached the goal I wanted to reach and that's the important thing.
1382000	1385000	So I got my stupid transmog stuff in Diablo.
1385000	1387000	So that made me very happy.
1387000	1389000	I also played the Bayonetta 2 demo.
1389000	1395000	Again, I don't want to rate a game based off the demo, but let me just say, the Bayonetta 2 demo definitely reminded me like,
1395000	1397000	oh yes, you need this game day one.
1397000	1402000	Because the first Bayonetta was so freaking great, and Bayonetta 2 definitely just kind of reminds you.
1402000	1406000	At least the demo is very short, it's like one playable level in like two boss fights.
1406000	1411000	But it's just enough to remind you, oh god, this game is so over the top and amazing.
1411000	1413000	Like, oh, I miss this shit.
1413000	1416000	So, yeah, I'm definitely going to pick that up when that comes out.
1416000	1419000	Otherwise, those were pretty much the bulk of my week.
1419000	1421000	A little bit of Final Fantasy XIV here and there.
1421000	1422000	Destiny.
1422000	1428000	Oh, one other game I want to mention actually that came out on PlayStation Plus that I've been playing an awful lot of.
1428000	1430000	Because PlayStation Plus got some really good stuff this week.
1430000	1434000	You have Dust and Elysian Tail, which I just started, but I've barely scratched the surface on that.
1435000	1439000	Splunky, which I've played the crap out of on PC and PlayStation 3.
1439000	1443000	But there was also another game in it, and I'm afraid this one's going to get overlooked.
1443000	1446000	And I actually think it's one that's almost most deserving of your time.
1446000	1450000	It's Pix the Cat is the name, which is kind of a silly name, right?
1450000	1455000	But this game is available on Vita and PlayStation 4, and it's not like a technical marvel.
1455000	1459000	Like, the graphics are really things that probably could have been done on a PlayStation 2 or 3.
1459000	1465000	But it has a very, like, classic arcade feel to it that makes it very addicting.
1465000	1474000	And essentially it's kind of like Pac-Man mixed with, I don't know, more like Pac-Man Championship Edition kind of mixed with a puzzler sort of thing.
1474000	1479000	Because what you do is you go around, you pick up these eggs, and then you drop them off in the little holes.
1479000	1488000	But if you screw up and do it out of order where you don't pick up all the eggs first, then the eggs will crack and you don't get the bonus so your meter doesn't fill up as much.
1488000	1492000	So it's about pushing a high score, like a classic arcade game is. Yeah, Irene?
1492000	1495000	So this involves cats somehow?
1495000	1498000	I don't know why it's called Pix the Cat because I don't remember actually seeing...
1498000	1502000	Oh, in the nostalgia mode it's a black and white cat with a little top hat.
1502000	1505000	I was going to say, it looks like that's a cat in the picture.
1505000	1510000	I guess a little bit. I don't remember it having a lot of cat traits to it.
1510000	1513000	It's got cat teeth and ears and a tail.
1513000	1514000	Fair enough.
1514000	1521000	But yeah, for some reason I'm super addicted to this game. I keep trying to rush the high scores and everything.
1521000	1527000	And it's the loud techno music, and I swear they got the guy from Bejeweled to do some of the voices.
1527000	1529000	You know, it's like, ultra combo.
1529000	1532000	You know, that type of thing. He does some of the voices in this game too.
1532000	1534000	You can change the voice to some of the...
1534000	1537000	But you want Bejeweled guy who does all the...
1537000	1539000	You got a perfect...
1539000	1540000	You know, that type of stuff.
1541000	1543000	Yeah, that game is a surprising amount of fun.
1543000	1550000	I've actually been playing that more than Spelunky or Dust, which surprised me because I thought I'd be playing the other two first.
1550000	1557000	It just goes to show you that a game doesn't necessarily need to have all these extreme bells and whistles to be addicting.
1557000	1558000	So, there you go.
1558000	1562000	Quickly, let's check in with our guests here and see what types of games they've been playing this week.
1562000	1563000	Irene.
1563000	1568000	Well, I already mentioned Super Smash Brothers, so I don't really need to get into that because everyone already knows.
1568000	1574000	I'm actually playing Oracle of Seasons because they had the Super Smash sale a couple of weeks ago.
1574000	1579000	And I bought Ages and Seasons and they didn't have Link's Awakening on sale and I'm like, what the fuck, guys?
1579000	1581000	But yeah, so that's been fun.
1581000	1585000	Off and on Bravely Default, that's always an ongoing project.
1585000	1587000	And that's pretty much it.
1587000	1589000	Nice. So you are making good use of that 3DS.
1589000	1590000	Absolutely.
1590000	1595000	You don't just play that one game and then go back to something else like I've been doing way too much lately.
1595000	1600000	I know you've never been poor, Rob, but it's what poor people do. They cherish what they have.
1600000	1607000	Yeah, right. I talked to you before the show about when the PS1 demo disc came, it was like, here's my game for the month. Yay!
1607000	1611000	It's the first stage of Parappa 50 times I can play. Yay!
1611000	1612000	You and me both, sister.
1612000	1620000	But how much, knowing that, where it's like, I'm going to play the first stage of Parappa 50 times, how much does it piss you off to see that Nintendo limits it to like 30 or whatever?
1621000	1626000	It depends on the demo. I'm more sad that some of the demos are just kind of really, really...
1626000	1632000	Like, we were talking about the feet rhythm demo where it was just two songs. I'm like, what the fuck is this?
1632000	1636000	This is ridiculous. Why just two songs? What the hell?
1636000	1641000	But, you know, so I wouldn't get 30 plays out of that anyway because it's like, I'm bored.
1641000	1646000	Yeah, realistically, I would never hit the 30 cap on these demos, but Bayonetta 2 is 15.
1646000	1651000	They're getting less. Pretty soon it's going to be like, you get three, they're making count.
1651000	1655000	Yeah, there's no real logical reason to limit it.
1655000	1662000	It better be nice because pretty soon they're only going to have 15 games coming out in a year, you know, with all the third party support that they're losing.
1662000	1665000	I was like, the Wii U had 15 games this year?
1665000	1667000	Third party, yeah, there's lots of third party games.
1667000	1668000	Fair enough.
1668000	1672000	I mean, a lot of third party terrible games, but I mean, I don't know.
1673000	1677000	Let me move on and check in with Piper. How was your gaming week? What types of games have you been playing this week?
1677000	1681000	I've been working a rigorous job, growing a beard.
1681000	1682000	It's hard work.
1682000	1690000	Yeah, my 3DS is broken. I had to take it in the shop, so I bought theater them and then didn't get to play it.
1690000	1699000	I don't know what I can say here. My PSP got something done to it when it had undergone elective surgery.
1699000	1704000	Okay, so you just kind of left it somewhere and then suddenly it was able to do these things it couldn't do before.
1704000	1709000	When I picked it back up, I can play any Mega Man or Nintendo game that I want on it.
1709000	1712000	Oh my gosh, Mutant Powers. It got bitten by a spider.
1712000	1720000	Right, so I've been abusing its mutant power on lunch breaks and reading comic books.
1720000	1721000	Very controversial.
1721000	1722000	That's my week in gaming.
1722000	1724000	All right, retro gaming makes sense.
1724000	1730000	You know what else can play any Nintendo game you want? This wonderful arcade cabinet that's sitting very underutilized right here.
1730000	1736000	I know. I've still got to set this thing up. You must have missed the part where I had a show last night and I'm going to Vegas next week.
1736000	1740000	So getting this thing finished is not on my priority list. Sorry, Logie.
1740000	1743000	Oh, I see what it is. You're just better than the game.
1743000	1746000	Yeah.
1746000	1752000	To be fair, absolutely fair, it does not have Ms. World.
1752000	1755000	I know. That's why I was like, let it collect dust if it didn't have Ms. Nude World.
1755000	1758000	At least I don't think it does. It might be on there.
1758000	1761000	You know the minute I get it up and running, that's the first thing I'm going to make happen.
1761000	1763000	Like, how do I get Ms. Nude World 96?
1763000	1770000	Okay, well I just have to back up my collection from my arcade cabinet at home and bring it here and then that way it will have that on there.
1770000	1775000	All right. Which, by the way, if you've never heard of Ms. Nude World 96, I'll have to get into it another week.
1775000	1780000	We've got to get to our guest here in a minute, but lastly here, JV Mon, how was your gaming week?
1780000	1789000	Uh, Smash Brothers, Smash Brothers, Super Metroid with my boyfriend, and Dead Rising 3, Smash Brothers, and I think...
1789000	1791000	Oh yeah, I played Smash Brothers.
1791000	1792000	Okay, you did.
1792000	1794000	Anybody's heard of Smash Brothers?
1794000	1798000	I think I had heard a couple things about... Who's your go-to character right now?
1798000	1805000	I don't know. I kind of just like to pick Random, although because I'm confused by him, I play the Duck Hunt dog a lot.
1805000	1806000	Mm-hmm.
1806000	1808000	Because I... Why?
1808000	1812000	It's kind of one of those, like, I just... I'm drawn to your strangeness type thing, right?
1812000	1816000	Like, the duck and dog are usually enemies, so...
1816000	1817000	How do you feel...
1817000	1818000	They're friends now.
1818000	1826000	How do you feel about Smash on the 3DS as opposed to, you know, being on a console living room television?
1826000	1833000	Because, you know, when I talked about it last week, I kind of said, you know, my biggest problem with Smash 3DS is that it's on the 3DS.
1834000	1837000	I could sort of see that, but probably for a different reason.
1837000	1842000	Half the fun of Smash is playing with somebody else, and when you're on a 3DS, you sort of kind of coordinate with somebody.
1842000	1846000	It's like, are you going to be online? Want to play Smash? No? Okay. Move on to the next person.
1846000	1847000	Right.
1847000	1851000	I mean, I have no problem with the small screen. I think it looks fine. I think it looks good. It's just...
1851000	1854000	Playing by yourself can get boring.
1854000	1858000	Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. Yes?
1858000	1859000	I'll tell you in chat.
1859000	1861000	Okay.
1861000	1865000	Are we going to settle this in Smash? Is that what's going to happen there? All right.
1865000	1867000	All right. Well, there we go. There's everybody's gaming week.
1867000	1873000	But we are going to, actually, at this point, we're going to move on into our interview part of the show.
1873000	1875000	Because we want to get here on the show.
1875000	1881000	Bodhi Lee is going to join us from Lunar Ray Games, and they're currently creating the game Timespinner.
1881000	1889000	Timespinner is a game created in the vein of Super Nintendo and PlayStation 1 classics like Castlevania, Savia the Night, Super Metroid, and Star Ocean.
1889000	1892000	And Bodhi is going to join us right now. Bodhi, are you there?
1892000	1893000	Hello.
1893000	1895000	Hey. Thanks for joining us today. How are you doing?
1895000	1896000	Good. How are you?
1896000	1900000	I am great. We can actually see you. I'm waving hello, although you can't see it. I'm sorry.
1900000	1904000	But we're running on a computer that's powered by a hamster, so I'm afraid to run a webcam.
1904000	1910000	But thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule in developing the game to join us here.
1910000	1911000	No problem.
1911000	1915000	Now, for those that don't know about Timespinner, tell us a little bit about it.
1915000	1926000	Timespinner is a 2D metroidvania about a young woman who travels through time to get revenge on an empire that killed her family.
1926000	1930000	So this side sounds like a really nice, fluffy, happy kind of story, isn't it?
1930000	1934000	No, no, no. It's a little on the darker side.
1934000	1936000	Oh, boy. Okay. Well, no, that's all right.
1937000	1947000	And I noticed that Timespinner definitely has, like, an art style to it that feels very light. It's very retro, very sprite-based and so forth.
1947000	1949000	What made you decide to kind of go that direction with it?
1950000	1966000	I've always liked pixel art, and so when I was making the game, well, actually, when I've been learning pixel art since, like, middle school, I've been trying to kind of incorporate all the styles of games that I like.
1966000	1977000	So, for example, like, the game has some art influences from Final Fantasy Tactics and it has some from, like, the Castlevania games and, like, Star Ocean and other stuff.
1977000	1988000	So I, as I learned, I just took my favorite parts of other games and that's how the game style, like, happened.
1988000	2001000	Nice. So you actually, and I, you know, reading through your site on Lunar Ray Games and so forth, you mentioned there that you actually used to work for Bungie, which I'm sure a lot of people know with Halo and Destiny and all that.
2001000	2010000	But you actually ended up, you know, kind of leaving that to start this endeavor. That's a huge life change. What made you decide to make that change?
2010000	2015000	I think I just caught the indie bug.
2015000	2030000	Last May of 2013, I saw a Kickstarter for a similar game to Time Spinner called Chasm. It's also pixel art, also Metroidvania, but it's also procedurally generated, which Time Spinner isn't really.
2030000	2046000	And I didn't know that Kickstarter was something that you did for games. I thought it was something that you did if you were going to start a restaurant or something. Like, I started a small business. I didn't realize that you could be really successful with games.
2046000	2062000	And so they did really well and I was super excited for the game. And the idea got in my head that, hey, I could do this too, since at this time I had been working on Time Spinner on my off time for probably like four years at that point.
2062000	2085000	And eventually I would just spend the whole day at work daydreaming about doing that and I kind of lost interest. I like to use the word that I was cheating on Bungie with Time Spinner and I left Bungie to, you know, get married to someone else.
2085000	2109000	I love it. You're having an affair, so you finally had to step up and admit that you've been cheating. So that's amazing. I love that. But you did very well on Kickstarter, you know, considering that this is, I mean, yes, it's been a project you've been working on for so long, but you did very well on Kickstarter for, you know, essentially this being your company's first game.
2109000	2116000	What do you think was part of that success? Why did people really buy into this? I mean, literally.
2116000	2133000	I mean, since the Chasm Kickstarter, I've been backing games that were very similar to that for like the year leading up to my Kickstarter. And I was just studying all of them about what made them successful, what things they did that were good, what things were bad.
2134000	2158000	And I tried to kind of hit on all of those good points and not hit the bad points. I think a big part of the allure specifically for Time Spinner was that it was darker and it had the 16-bit style of sprite art rather than like the more popular right now is like the 8-bit, like normal Nintendo's sprite art style.
2159000	2179000	And also, I think that the trailer for the game was really kind of story heavy and just heavy in general. I felt like a lot of people related to that, or at least they were like, hey, this reminds me of kind of darker Castlevania games. So I'm going to get on board with this.
2180000	2199000	I think there's just a lot of love out there for the Metroidvania type of game anyway. I know you say Metroidvania. I perk up right there. I go, is this something I should be looking at? Literally, I think that's how somebody sold me a copy of Rogue Legacy. They were like, Rob, it's Rogue but a Metroidvania. And I was like, purchase.
2200000	2218000	Right. Interesting because you talk about you're inspired by these classics, but you're also inspired by a lot of indie games too. I mean, it sounds like you have these other indie Kickstarters. How else have indie games kind of influenced you in the indie movement?
2219000	2234000	I mean, they're all inspiration in their own ways. Like Heartforth Alicia is like, I don't know if you've seen it, but it was out a couple months before my Kickstarter and it has like obscenely good sprite art.
2234000	2256000	And that really inspires me to like, do better, like be a better artist. And like Chasm has really good gameplay. And I mean, just all these other Kickstarters and other indie games are really inspiring because people are doing their own thing. And I can do that too. And we can do it together.
2257000	2271000	I think that's so amazing too, that you are essentially doing this yourself, especially when you go and you look at the trailer for the game, which I encourage people to do. Check out what's going on with the game over at timespinnergame.com.
2271000	2282000	And you can check out the latest trailer and so forth and where you're at and all the artwork and all that. But you're essentially doing this yourself. I know you have some help with the music and voiceover and I don't want to neglect those types of contributions.
2282000	2291000	But you know, a lot of that stuff when it comes to the art and the programming, you're doing that yourself. I mean, what's the hardest part about that one man band?
2292000	2305000	I think the hardest part is that, I mean, for me, the hardest part is the inspiration for art. It's really hard when you want to make something, but you don't have the right inspiration to do it.
2305000	2325000	Or when you go to make it, that it's not what you had originally imagined. And that sort of artistic failure is really frustrating. But that's really the only hard part. The programming part is really simple and easy since that's what I was trained to do in school.
2325000	2346000	And yeah, that's probably the hardest part of the art. And after the Kickstarter, actually, another hard part is actually being kind of anxious, I guess is the word. Because there's now so much I have to do and it's all on me.
2346000	2362000	And a lot of other Kickstarters have talked about this, how it's suddenly stressful, the fact that you have all these people behind you and they're expecting you to finish. And you're like, I was planning on doing this, but now I'm kind of anxious now.
2362000	2374000	Right. Right. You know, Loki, here in studio, he's making his own game. And he's doing the one-man-band thing, too, with the exception of music and some of that stuff.
2374000	2380000	Well, yeah, music right now is just all anything I can find in Creative Commons. I have no money.
2380000	2390000	I was wondering if you had any, and then Loki didn't go to school for this, but this is what Loki does. He learns by doing type of things. I was wondering if you had any advice for Loki on making your first game.
2391000	2413000	Just do it. The best way for me to learn things is by doing them and failing and learning from your mistakes. And also, if you need help with programming, just lots of Stack Overflow. That's generally what I do. Just Google, hey, how do I do this? And then Stack Overflow tells me what to do. I'm like, okay, got it, thanks.
2413000	2429000	Yeah, kind of the same place there. And same with coming up with assets and stuff. That's always difficult. So, yeah, I don't know. A lot of what we're doing, I'm kind of seeing a lot of the same stuff right now, just like, okay, you know.
2429000	2434000	I try to cut corners of different things and then end up having to go back and learn the right way to do it. So, it's kind of fun.
2434000	2453000	Now, Bodhi, I noticed one thing you do, you know, you talked a minute before about kind of like feeling that pressure about like, I have to deliver this game that these people backed. But I thought one kind of clever thing that you're doing with this and that kind of shows people like, yes, I am working, I didn't take your money and run to, you know, Tijuana, I'm actually working on this game, I'm doing it.
2453000	2469000	You're doing live streams every week that really kind of like show the progress. There was one that I was catching on YouTube where I actually was watching you draw like one of the sprite art in the game and I thought that was really cool. How have the live streaming that you've done helped kind of contribute to the game?
2469000	2482000	It's kind of a double-edged sword because like normally when I work on art, I will work on it for a bit and then like take a break, go on a walk or something and then come back to it.
2482000	2492000	And with the live streams, I basically sit there for three hours straight and work. So, it's really good for productivity.
2493000	2509000	And I actually kind of enjoy having people there, you know, talking to me while it's happening and then like suggesting things or giving me advice. Like, for example, at this week's stream, I was doing like a bird skeleton and there was like a guy who's kind of like a biologist.
2509000	2512000	He's helping me with all my bird anatomy.
2512000	2515000	You're doing it wrong. Oh, no.
2515000	2523000	No, it was a good thing. Like I would be stuck on something and I would ask them like, so wait, how does this work? And they tell me I'm like, can that make sense? Got it.
2523000	2528000	That can be a bullet point on the list of features now. Authentic bird anatomy.
2528000	2531000	Yes.
2531000	2541000	But I also really liked the idea that, I mean, in a way it takes the pressure off me because I don't feel like I'm like hiding from them.
2541000	2551000	A lot of Kickstarters, when they get delayed, a lot of people are like, oh, you are clear with the backers or something like that. Like you failed to be up front.
2551000	2561000	And I feel like the streams are a really good way for me to be like, hey, this is me and I'm doing it. So, you can't ever say I'm not doing it because this is me every week.
2561000	2571000	Now, what's really cool is that if you somehow miss the boat on the Kickstarter, which I'm hanging my head in shame, I totally missed the Kickstarter. I didn't find out about this until later.
2571000	2581000	But no, this is cool because I can still buy the game. If I go to timespinnergame.com, you're still offering a lot of similar types of rewards on your site right now.
2581000	2586000	Can you tell us a little bit about that? Like if people want to actually kind of pre-order the game, they can do that, right?
2586000	2599000	Right, right. On that page, there's three of the lowest Kickstarter tiers, or at least similar to them. You get the game for the lowest tier with one in-game item.
2599000	2605000	And then the next two tiers also have in-game items associated with them. And you also get a soundtrack for the second tier.
2606000	2623000	And the second tier also comes with development forum access. So, on the development forum, it's a special part. I have a forum for the game, and then there's a smaller subsection that has me posting pictures of stuff I'm working on that I wouldn't post on Tumblr because it's not quite finished.
2623000	2630000	But it still gives people an opportunity to see how the game's coming even beyond the livestreams.
2630000	2644000	So, you are very upfront. I mean, you've got these livestreams, you've got a forum, and this is just you communicating with all this, too. You're very busy. No wonder this is a full-time job now for you. Amazing.
2644000	2656000	Now, I have to thank Princess Irene here in studio because I mentioned I was unfortunately late to the party. I apologize. But actually, Princess Irene's the one that turned me on to what you're doing there with Timespinner.
2656000	2670000	So, I was curious if Irene, because you've been following this project a little longer than I have, if you might have anything you want to ask. By the way, Bodhi is here live with us on Sunday night. So, if you have a question over at live.vognetwork.com, ask away, and I will relay some of those questions. Irene?
2670000	2672000	Well, hi.
2672000	2674000	Hi.
2674000	2686000	Well, first, I just want to say thank you because this game looks amazing, and it's kind of pretty much an amalgamation of everything I've ever wanted in a game, and I'm happy that there's a female protagonist. I can say a lot of things about it.
2686000	2694000	But, you know, I don't know that I really have a lot of pressing questions or anything. Maybe just how are you enjoying being your own boss?
2694000	2711000	It's good. I don't think I would want it any other way right now. I thought about maybe going back after I shipped the game to maybe work at a big studio, and I don't think I'd be as happy as I am right now, or at least satisfied with my work.
2711000	2729000	Sure. I'm not sure what you had done at Bungie or Microsoft or anything, so is this more fulfilling for you, or is it more tedious than you thought it was going to be, or how is it in comparison?
2730000	2746000	I'd say working at Microsoft was considerably more tedious because I was doing tests. And also, both jobs, I didn't really have much power, and that was also kind of frustrating for me.
2746000	2766000	I'm obviously a creative person, and not being able to be creative in my work was very frustrating. And it probably is one of the main reasons why I ended up leaving was because I wasn't able to be creatively fulfilled in my work.
2766000	2772000	And now I can do that. I can imagine things and then make them, and that's my job. And that's pretty cool.
2772000	2774000	Very awesome. And I'm jealous.
2774000	2787000	Irene, I know you wanted to curb the love fest a little bit, but I'm genuinely curious, as a gaming fan, A, how did you find out about this, and B, what was it that just made you go like, yes!
2787000	2789000	Yes, mama!
2789000	2791000	Say!
2792000	2800000	Well, I heard about it through Heartforth, Alicia, which had another strong female protagonist, and it just, you know, it's sending the same signals to me.
2800000	2810000	You know, it's got RPG elements, and it's a magic-based system, and just, I don't know, obviously the whole 16-bit graphic thing is pretty cool.
2810000	2814000	Here is all of Irene's favorite games, and then we're going to put it in a blender.
2814000	2823000	Yes, I mean, literally, like Final Fantasy Tactics, and just like, wow, okay, where do I pay my money? Take it all. So, yeah.
2823000	2836000	I mean, technically, the game is a blender of all my favorite games. Like, I'm just kind of regurgitating the story and my imagination onto the same canvas as those games.
2837000	2843000	Let me ask you, I know we have another question here in studio. Sorry, Piper. I just thought of something that I definitely want to ask, because this is a very tricky thing.
2843000	2853000	I mean, you're an indie developer of games. I'm an indie commenter, you know, of the games industry and so forth, and one thing that I'm always kind of worried about is, you know, if I listen to too many other podcasts,
2853000	2864000	and I do try to listen to a variety of podcasts to support my indie people, but I'm afraid I'm going to tell a joke that some other podcaster used, or I'm going to do something that was already done in another podcast.
2864000	2876000	Are you worried about, and maybe how do you kind of make sure you don't cross that line where you're just, like, copying another game? Like, how do you kind of keep yourself in check in that regard, like, between influence and copy?
2876000	2882000	That's actually kind of difficult, and in fact, it's something I kind of screwed up on on the Kickstarter.
2883000	2893000	On the very first day, people realized that some of my tilesets, like the environment art for a couple of the areas, was really similar to Symphony of the Night.
2893000	2909000	And, like, I addressed that on the first day. I'm like, yeah, I was learning how to do tilesets, and I wanted to learn from Castlevania, but when I was, like, kind of emulating that style, I didn't put any personal inspiration into it, and so people caught on to that.
2909000	2921000	So it is something you really have to be careful with, that even though you're taking inspiration from something, you need to mix a part of your own imagination into it to make it different.
2921000	2936000	But I think, like for art, you have to be very careful, but for gameplay features, like for how it plays, like, I think a lot of games kind of rely on just taking, like, flat out taking elements from other games.
2936000	2947000	Like, games are starting to take Dark Souls elements from it, or just like all Metroidvanias, they're taking elements, and that's okay, that they're outright taking it.
2947000	2959000	As long as you add a little bit more to it, your own flair. And that's the most important part, I think, is adding to someone else's stuff is what makes it okay.
2959000	2965000	Okay. Let me go over, we have a couple questions to chat, but I actually want to go over to Piper, here in studio, who also has a question.
2965000	2966000	Hello.
2966000	2967000	Hi.
2967000	2981000	So I don't want to bulldoze the sentiment, I guess, but yeah, it's similar to everybody else, I'm in love with the project, I've been following it for some time as well, and it's a blender of basically everything that's, oh man, no words.
2981000	2998000	I'm not a programmer, or have anything to do with the video games other than playing them, but I'm a writer, and I was curious as to if you get inspiration from doing this for a secondary project, if you have your mind on anything in the future, or if this is taking all of your time.
2998000	3018000	I think every time I'm doing something creative, I always end up getting kind of tangent ideas that aren't with my current project, and I definitely have ideas for future games, and it just kind of happens.
3018000	3027000	I just want to point out, the tangent train is not exclusive to podcasts, therefore, the tangent train is a very real thing, even in game development.
3027000	3028000	Right.
3028000	3029000	There you go.
3029000	3030000	Great.
3030000	3031000	That's a great question.
3031000	3039000	Yeah, actually, let me dive into that a little bit, and then I'll get to these chat questions, but the writing, I mean, that's kind of something you have to do a little more originally.
3039000	3043000	Where are you inspired with your writing, specifically, for the story?
3044000	3047000	I'm going to be upfront.
3047000	3058000	I'm really bad at dialogue and actual story words, so I'm actually bringing on someone to help me with that and kind of make the story a little more fleshed out.
3059000	3074000	But I really like world building, or at least the idea of creating worlds, and here's our history, and here's what happened on this world, and the people on it, and how the people are different from people in other worlds.
3074000	3088000	And the actual Time Spinner universe takes place in a story that I've been kind of building since I was a kid, and future games that I make will definitely still carry on in that same game universe.
3088000	3091000	Story, universe, yeah.
3091000	3092000	Excellent.
3092000	3093000	Yeah, Irene?
3093000	3096000	Okay, yeah, just to, I guess, follow up on that.
3096000	3111000	I know that you, well, at least I read that you've been, you've conceived of this idea many years ago, like nearly 20 years ago, and that you have this whole universe that this world is sort of kind of a part of, like tangential to.
3111000	3130000	So if, I guess this is kind of a premature question to ask right now, but if Time Spinner, for some crazy reason, doesn't end up meeting the goals that you want it to, like if it's not your definition of successful, are you planning on continuing the story in the universe through maybe another venue?
3130000	3139000	Like, I know your thing is game design, but maybe you could collaborate with someone else to continue the universe on, or, I mean, maybe that's, I don't know.
3140000	3153000	I feel like the story of, like the story universe is really important to me. And, like, I would be sad if I had to drop it, even if I, like, Time Spinner didn't do well.
3153000	3159000	So yeah, I think I would still try to use that story somehow.
3159000	3162000	It's going to do amazing, you know, but it's just a hypothetical, yeah.
3162000	3165000	I was going to say, Negative Nancy, he did amazing on the Kickstarter, so.
3165000	3167000	You know, I just had to find a way to ask that, okay?
3167000	3169000	Asking the tough questions, Barbara Walters over there.
3169000	3173000	All right, go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3173000	3176000	We've got Dungeon Buster saying, it's great to hear about the streams.
3176000	3182000	I've seen too many projects and good feelings wither on the vine because the devs fell out of updating their community.
3182000	3187000	But you've done very good at, you know, kind of keeping up with the forums and all this other stuff.
3187000	3189000	So just kind of getting some props there in our chatroom.
3189000	3190000	Thanks.
3190000	3194000	And Dart Tetsuya says, any games in particular that inspired you in making Time Spinners?
3194000	3198000	Well, I know we've talked an awful lot already about like, you know, Symphony of the Night and so forth.
3198000	3206000	But maybe let me twist Dart Tetsuya's question a little bit here and ask you, is there maybe a game that people would be surprised to know?
3206000	3211000	I mean, you can look at Time Spinner and go, oh, okay, there's that Metroidvania vibe to it.
3211000	3215000	But is there a game that people might be surprised to know actually influenced Time Spinner?
3215000	3218000	Huh.
3218000	3221000	That's kind of an interesting question.
3221000	3229000	There was I mean, there's a Castlevania game that in particular I'm taking really heavy influence from called Order of Ecclesia.
3229000	3233000	That was the best. Okay. That was the second best in that style.
3233000	3240000	Yeah. Like, I absolutely love that game and I cosplayed the main character and everything.
3240000	3245000	But yeah, the huh.
3246000	3250000	I mean, I was pretty upfront with the inspiration on the Kickstarter besides that.
3250000	3253000	Like, that's the only game I didn't really mention in the Kickstarter.
3253000	3255000	Okay. Well, okay.
3255000	3264000	I think that one might be a little weird for people because Star Ocean is like an RPG that's not really Metroidvania-esque.
3264000	3269000	But I feel like I really like the story of the first one, even though some people thought it was a mess.
3269000	3271000	But I enjoyed it.
3271000	3272000	All right. All right.
3272000	3275000	Just a couple more questions here, and then we've got to let Bodhi get back to developing you guys.
3275000	3278000	But just a couple more questions here from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3278000	3282000	SH21 Hunter Matt is asking, do you get burned out when you're working?
3282000	3285000	If so, what tactics do you use to get back on track?
3285000	3289000	I do suffer a lot from burnout.
3289000	3301000	The problem with me is that if I work on the same thing, for example, like if I'm doing a tileset for an area and I do it for like a week straight,
3301000	3306000	then I get sick of it and I don't want to work on it anymore and I'm not inspired anymore.
3306000	3311000	So what I do is I try to jump to a completely unrelated task.
3311000	3314000	And since I do programming and art, that works out pretty well.
3314000	3321000	So like my most recent burnout was on, just like I said, the tileset for like a city level I'm working on.
3321000	3328000	So what I did was I went completely tangential to work on the inventory menu.
3328000	3331000	And that like broke me out of the burnout.
3331000	3337000	So yeah, just hopping between completely different fields helps me out.
3337000	3344000	And I'm actually trying to take weekends off, seeing if that helps. Maybe it won't. I don't know.
3344000	3348000	All right. Yeah, you got to have a day off once in a while.
3348000	3353000	And I think that's, you know, despite the Kickstarter and I know there's that pressure to deliver and so forth,
3353000	3358000	if you don't have that mental wellness, then, you know, it's going to affect things negatively.
3358000	3360000	So give yourself some time off once in a while.
3360000	3364000	ActDeaf in chat, speaking of that, let me ask this and I guess I'll wrap up after this question.
3364000	3369000	But ActDeaf says, how big is the pressure from being a Kickstarter backed project?
3369000	3371000	And ActDeaf also clarifies, like, I don't want to sound rude.
3371000	3373000	And I don't think that's necessarily a rude question.
3373000	3378000	But, you know, how is that kind of pressure from being a Kickstarter backed project?
3379000	3383000	It's definitely a lot more pressure than before the Kickstarter.
3383000	3389000	Like before the Kickstarter, I kind of was just working on stuff that I knew I needed to do.
3389000	3391000	But whenever I was inspired to do it, I would work on it.
3391000	3396000	And then if I felt like this wasn't progressing very well, I just jumped to something else.
3396000	3405000	Now, when I have like a release date, like that I've told people about, there is a lot of pressure and it's stressful.
3406000	3409000	But I'm doing okay. I'm managing.
3409000	3412000	And yeah, I think it's going to work out.
3412000	3418000	And I think the fact that I'm being fairly upfront with people, especially with like the live streams in the forum,
3418000	3423000	that even if I do slip, that it'll be okay. So I'm not freaking out too hard.
3424000	3426000	All right. Well, we're all rooting for you.
3426000	3430000	And you've given yourself plenty of time to deliver a quality product.
3430000	3433000	And it's looking like it's coming along really good so far.
3433000	3435000	So we're all very hopeful here at OLR.
3435000	3437000	Irene, want to close out here one more question?
3437000	3439000	I do. And it's a really quick one.
3439000	3441000	Top three favorite games ever go?
3442000	3449000	Final Fantasy Tactics, Castlevania Symphony Night, and Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
3449000	3452000	Like I've played those many times and I'm going to play them many times in the future.
3453000	3457000	Let me ask you this since we ask a lot of our, I know I keep saying one more question.
3457000	3458000	I lied.
3459000	3461000	We ask a lot of our guests that come here on OLR,
3461000	3463000	what have you been playing lately?
3463000	3466000	Like, obviously, besides your own game, what have you been playing lately?
3466000	3471000	Like any newer stuff? Or do you focus simply on retro stuff?
3471000	3473000	Or is there anything kind of lately you've been playing?
3474000	3478000	Lately, it's been a mix of AAA and Indie.
3478000	3482000	So the last couple games have been, so I'm doing Destiny right now.
3484000	3489000	Before that, it was like Dark Souls 2 and all of its never-ending DLCs.
3490000	3494000	And then on the Indie side, like I recently fell into Don't Starve.
3496000	3499000	I had to like beat Adventure Mode so that I would stop playing it.
3500000	3502000	Because it's like, oh, I beat it and now I don't have to play it anymore.
3503000	3508000	And also like Crypt of the Necrodancer and I've been playing like the Chasm Alpha, which is pretty fun too.
3509000	3512000	So it's a good mix of Indie and AAA, I think.
3513000	3516000	All right. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show tonight.
3516000	3519000	I know we've taken up almost a half hour of your time, but we really appreciate you coming on here.
3520000	3521000	We really want to wish you the best of luck with the game.
3522000	3526000	This is really cool because most people come on here, you know, when the Kickstarter's in progress.
3527000	3529000	But, you know, you're funded. This game's going to happen. So this is really cool.
3530000	3534000	And if people want to continue to check out the progress, they can head over to Timespinnergame.com.
3535000	3538000	Anything else you want to throw out there, Bode? Like Twitter, Facebook?
3539000	3541000	I don't know if there's other places online you want people to follow you.
3541000	3545000	It's everywhere basically at LunarRayGames.com.
3546000	3550000	So it's like on Twitter, it's at LunarRayGames and Facebook slash that.
3551000	3555000	Yeah, same on YouTube and Twitch. So that's where you can find me.
3556000	3558000	Awesome. Well, we wish you the best of luck with Timespinner.
3559000	3561000	And I know I will be pre-ordering the game.
3562000	3567000	And I think some of us here in OLRS, you can thank Irene probably sold probably like five copies of the game here in studio.
3568000	3569000	So there you go.
3569000	3570000	Yay!
3571000	3575000	I can tell you one thing. I was watching the trailer again today and my husband walks past me and goes,
3576000	3577000	You're ordering this, right?
3578000	3579000	Yeah, I just bought it.
3580000	3581000	Nice.
3582000	3583000	You're welcome.
3584000	3591000	Well, there it is. Best of luck and I hope we'll be able to check in with you again a little closer to the game's release and talk about the excitement of the big game release.
3592000	3593000	Yeah, sounds good.
3594000	3596000	All right, keep us posted. Thanks again for your time tonight, Bode, and best of luck with Timespinner.
3597000	3598000	Yeah, thanks for having me.
3599000	3600000	Have a good night.
3601000	3602000	All right, you too. Bye.
3603000	3604000	Bye.
3605000	3606000	All right, that was, again, Bode Lee with Lunar Array Games, Timespinner.
3607000	3610000	Early on in the interview, I accidentally said Timespinner because my fat finger typed an S.
3611000	3616000	But it's Timespinner, so be sure to check that out. Timespinnergame.com.
3617000	3620000	Fantastic. Talk to him. That's great.
3620000	3630000	And it's so interesting to kind of hear about the similarities between like what I do as an indie broadcaster and what he's doing as an indie developer and how many similarities.
3631000	3637000	I like how he kind of talks about, you know, sometimes I just have to get up and walk away and I'm like, God, I've wanted to do that so many times during this show.
3638000	3639000	Me too.
3640000	3643000	That's what I appreciate about him. He's rural, you know?
3644000	3645000	Yeah.
3646000	3647000	He's keeping it rural.
3647000	3651000	He's the boss and all that stuff and none of that corporate BS with these indie games.
3652000	3655000	Yeah. I can die now, by the way. That was great. I'm so happy.
3656000	3657000	But you must live to play the game.
3658000	3664000	Yeah. Yeah. But if I did die, you know, I'd be like, can you just send a copy to, well, actually be hell, I guess.
3665000	3668000	Yeah. Anyway, I'll get into that.
3669000	3671000	You've taken it to a dark place here on OLR.
3672000	3673000	A little bit.
3673000	3675000	Just send that care of the lake of fire.
3677000	3680000	Anyway, thank you again for helping.
3681000	3687000	Most people, I don't know if you know, but Princess Irene kind of really helped me get in touch and bring my attention to that whole thing. So I appreciate it.
3688000	3690000	You're welcome. Thank you for interviewing him.
3691000	3692000	You're welcome. All right.
3693000	3700000	Let's get into some gaming news from the indie world to the AAA world, everything in between.
3700000	3708000	Let's get into some gaming news tonight. And please, to our guests here in studio, please raise your hand, grab a mic, feel free to comment on anything as we're going through tonight's news. Loki.
3709000	3715000	Well, I have news about an online game starting with D that's having server problems. No, it's not Destiny. It's actually Drive Club.
3716000	3721000	Drive Club, unfortunately, has had some problems with servers not working or not working at all.
3721000	3729000	I don't know if anyone's actually been able to connect online and play with other people, but apparently it's really rough right now.
3730000	3736000	To kind of fix that, or at least work towards fixing that, they've started disabling features, I guess.
3737000	3757000	So, unfortunately, some of the social features, I guess, have been disconnected, including challenges, updates, and I guess leaderboards and some of the other stuff like online multiplayer racing should be playable, although it's probably going to be a little bit tricky to get in line.
3757000	3774000	And, of course, because of all these server problems, they halted the release of the PlayStation Plus version of Drive Club, so you won't be able to get that kind of piecemeal version of the game for, you know, Plus subscribers.
3775000	3782000	But it'll be coming later on. They just haven't said yet when that's going to be. So, that sucks, but...
3783000	3787000	God, every time I'm hearing about this game, I swear to God, the news is something like this.
3788000	3807000	You know, I just, I think, you know, the social features, I'm not really sure if it's that important. I'm not sure if it's anything like, you know, because when I think of Drive Club, I think of like Forza Horizon, and I don't know if it's just...
3808000	3818000	Obviously, I don't think it's open world, so you're not racing with each other, but I don't know. It seems like the game was delayed because of social and online features before, and now it's being delayed, sort of, again.
3819000	3827000	It seems like when it was released, it still wasn't quite ready yet. I just... I don't know. It's kind of disappointing.
3828000	3838000	Do you think this game is hosed now because of all these problems? Because I kind of think Sony has this really amazing way of being able to, like, make people forget about fuck-ups.
3839000	3848000	I mean, you know, remember the whole credit card breach, and they were like, oh, nobody actually had money stolen. Here's some free games. We'll just forget that ever happened, y'all.
3849000	3858000	I don't think that it's hosed. I mean, it's only been a few days since the game came out. I hope it gets better quicker than, say, Battlefield 4.
3859000	3870000	I just hope that they fix the problem quickly, because that kind of sucks, since it is a comparable racing title to Forza Horizon, and I don't know, Horizon just sounds more exciting to me.
3871000	3873000	Why can't Forza Horizon be on the PlayStation 4? It'd be a perfect world.
3874000	3878000	But no, it's just that ActDeft in chat says Forza Horizon 2 wins this round, I think, so far.
3879000	3892000	Yeah, unfortunately. Well, there's things about that, too. I don't know. It's a little disappointing, because if I was going to get PlayStation 4, this would have been kind of one of the games I wanted to get, but it's not quite Forza Horizon or even, like, Gran Turismo.
3893000	3901000	But, you know, there will be other racing games coming out. I mean, there's plenty of other racing games. The Crew, I guess, is quite open world, so hopefully that's a little bit better.
3901000	3913000	And then, also, was it, not Drive Club, but Project Cars is going to be coming out later in about a month or so, so there's options.
3914000	3926000	I sort of think, too, because there's that PlayStation Plus angle with this game where they're going to give a significant portion of it or a very meaty demo or whatever away for free, and I use my quotey fingers, because, you know, you have to have a PlayStation Plus account.
3927000	3932000	But I think a lot of people that own Sony products now have one, because, well, A, you have to have it to play online now.
3933000	3935000	Yeah, I was going to say, if you want to play Drive Club, you probably want to have that.
3936000	3943000	Exactly, right? So, I kind of think, and, you know, there's a lot of people who are like, oh, this game failed. I'm not going to play this game now, and I'm like, yeah, you are.
3944000	3947000	If you have a PlayStation Plus account and they come out and it's free, you're going to download it.
3947000	3956000	It's just like Destiny or Diablo 3 or Battlefield 4 people are still playing, even though it's just, how long did it take them to fix that shit? I mean, a long time.
3957000	3965000	So, I don't know, it's just, it might be one of those games that, like, I don't need to get right away, maybe wait for it to come down in price a little bit.
3966000	3972000	Or, hey, you know what, if you really kind of, well, I don't know what the performance is going to be on this, you're probably going to have PlayStation Plus already.
3972000	3979000	Just wait for the demo to come out. Check it out. If it's something that you want, buy it. If it's not, enjoy what free part of it you got.
3980000	3990000	There you go. I think for me, like, I just want to get in there and, like, control it to know, like, is this something that I can actually play? Like, Forza, Burnout, or Mario Kart, a little more arcade style?
3991000	3994000	Or is this going to be like, you know, Gran Turismo, where I'm just consistently crashing into the wall?
3995000	4000000	Well, that's the thing, is it's by the guys that did Motorstorm, and I loved, like, Motorstorm Apocalypse, which was a game that no one really cared for, but...
4000000	4003000	That was the one that came with the 3D TV, wasn't it?
4004000	4012000	They had one, yeah, that came with that, but no, it was a great game. I mean, it was one of those games that I bought a review copy or something like that.
4013000	4021000	It came out right before the whole network thing went down for, you know, a few weeks, and that was when they delayed the release of that, so I got to play it for, like, a month before it came out.
4021000	4027000	It was fantastic. I love that game, and I even like the other Motorstorm games, even though they're a little bit frustrating and whatever.
4028000	4034000	But I'm curious to see how this game is, you know, different, because obviously it's a different, you know, it's not an off-road racing game.
4035000	4036000	I don't know.
4037000	4043000	Now, I see JVMon in our chat room over there, inciting some Forza chat there throughout all this, so wait a minute, JVMon, what's going on here?
4044000	4046000	Are you poo-pooing Drive Club and you're just like, who cares?
4046000	4053000	I honestly had no idea it came out. It's been pushed back for so long, and when the story came out, I was like, oh, it finally released.
4054000	4055000	Well, sorta.
4056000	4058000	It either did or it didn't.
4059000	4061000	There wasn't much fanfare about it, that's the thing.
4062000	4068000	It's like that furniture they bought at IKEA, and then they built it backwards accidentally, you know, like after all this time.
4069000	4071000	There's probably still a piece or two missing.
4072000	4073000	Why do I have screws left over?
4073000	4074000	It's a hack.
4075000	4076000	IKEA hack.
4077000	4087000	But that's the thing, seriously, when you look at major Sony titles coming out for the fourth quarter, they don't have a whole ton. It's Drive Club and LittleBigPlanet 3.
4088000	4092000	Wasn't Drive Club supposed to be this big super launch title for the PS4 and it's a year later?
4093000	4094000	Yeah, at one point.
4095000	4096000	It sorta just limps out of the gate with problems.
4096000	4102000	It kinda lowered expectations, but I mean, again, just because this game has all these problems right now, I mean, let's be real.
4103000	4105000	If the game kicks ass in a couple weeks, everybody will forget.
4106000	4107000	Oh, I'm totally gonna play it.
4108000	4112000	Two words. Diablo 3. Anything can be fixed in gaming now. Like, seriously, that's always gonna be...
4113000	4118000	No matter how fucked up a game is, I'm gonna be like, remember Diablo 3, y'all? Remember? That game was a hot fuckin' mess and now look at it.
4119000	4129000	Or, this is very familiar to me, like, remember Lair? Remember how that was supposed to be a fuckin' kickass launch title and it got delayed?
4130000	4133000	Was that the one with the flying dragons on the sixth axis? Oh, yeah. Boy, oh, boy.
4134000	4139000	Alright, Brad from Pod Culture talking about racing games in our chat room saying, a blur for the PlayStation 4 would be great.
4140000	4145000	Yes, it would. Boy, that really sucks that somebody had to close that studio. Fuckin' jerk.
4145000	4150000	I would buy somebody a second PlayStation 4 just so I can have somebody play a PS4 version of Blur.
4151000	4156000	Right? I guess I can kind of cross my fingers and toes that maybe somehow this whole, like, Sierra, I mean, Sierra's doing the Geometry Wars now.
4157000	4158000	Yeah, because that was Bizarre Creations, right?
4159000	4165000	Now, I know Criterion's working on some other sort of extreme sports game that's not Burnout, but god, I would love a new Burnout.
4166000	4171000	Yeah, that'd be nice. That'd be nice. Alright, let's move on. Now, remember how I talked about, hey, Sony.
4171000	4176000	Sony has a way of making you kind of, like, come around and worship at the altar of Sony, right?
4177000	4187000	Well, sure enough, they did, boy, they did a big one this week. Remember when VibRibbon showed up at E3 and we were all like, yes, VibRibbon, oh my god, they're going to announce a new VibRibbon, ah!
4188000	4192000	And then they didn't, and everybody was like, stop fucking being a tease, yo.
4192000	4210000	So, they ended up, actually, what happened this past week, Sony kind of, like, I don't want to say they apologized, but they did kind of come out and say, you know, when we were talking about it at E3, we knew it was out in Europe and Japan, we kind of forgot that it wasn't out in North America, so you know what?
4211000	4217000	It's out now on PlayStation 3 and PS Vita, so if you want to play VibRibbon, you can go get it right now on PlayStation 3.
4218000	4219000	No PS4?
4219000	4241000	Not on PS4, because, the reason is because, remember, VibRibbon is a PlayStation 1 game and it has all the features, you can actually eject, well, it's a download game, so there would be no disk in your PS3 drive unless you still have another game in there, but you can actually put a CD in the PlayStation 3 drive and it will do that whole custom soundtrack like it did before. Can't do that on the Vita, though.
4241000	4250000	I will admit that we partly bought our JPS2 so I could play VibRibbon without having to hold the thing down and do the other thing.
4251000	4252000	Paperclip and all that.
4253000	4254000	Yeah, on my PS1.
4255000	4260000	I'm kind of poor, so are they going to release it for the Commodore 64 anytime soon?
4261000	4266000	Probably not. I don't think the Sony game will be on the 3DS anytime soon, so I don't, unfortunately.
4266000	4286000	But, you know, it is, to finish answering the question why it's not on PlayStation 4, it's a PlayStation 1 game essentially being emulated, and keep in mind PlayStation 4 isn't playing emulated games at all right now. PlayStation 4 does have PlayStation Now, which someday will have the PS2 and the PS1 games in it too, but it's not there yet.
4287000	4291000	There's also the rumor that eventually it's going to have native PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 support, but...
4292000	4293000	That'd be tricky.
4294000	4295000	That'd be tricky.
4296000	4302000	Somebody could probably build a pretty kick-ass emulator, but I don't know, 2 and 3 would get pretty difficult, so we'll see what happens.
4303000	4308000	I mean, a Vita can play PlayStation 1 games, and fuck, PlayStation 4 should be able to play PlayStation 1 games.
4309000	4310000	It really should. It really should.
4311000	4315000	Bond's 006 in our chatroom saying, so is VibRibbon better than AudioSurf?
4316000	4321000	They're both pretty good. AudioSurf's only on PC though, and VibRibbon's not, so...
4321000	4328000	Speaking of which, if you're on a budget, you know, there's a PlayStation TV coming out in like a week, and you could play VibRibbon on that.
4329000	4330000	A PlayStation TV?
4331000	4334000	Yeah, it's a Vita without a screen that you plug into your TV for 99 bucks.
4335000	4341000	Ninety-nine dollars? Do you know how many things on the McDonald's dollar menu you can buy with 99 dollars?
4342000	4343000	Ninety-nine.
4344000	4345000	That's how many.
4346000	4347000	Tax.
4348000	4349000	Ooh, girl.
4349000	4351000	Ninety-nine in Oregon. Oh, alright.
4354000	4361000	Alright, so yeah, you check out VibRibbon now. I will admit, I didn't get around to downloading it, but I'm going to, because I'm very excited about it.
4362000	4369000	But it's like, I gotta go back and turn the PS3 on. I've been doing nothing but picks the cat on my PlayStation 4. Come on.
4370000	4376000	Well, thankfully my PS3 is hooked up, so I am definitely going to be getting VibRibbon as soon as I get a day off.
4377000	4382000	To be fair, back in the day, you were doing picks the cat on your 3DS as well.
4384000	4388000	You mean picks of the cat on my 3D? I see what you did there. That was a little bit of a highbrow joke.
4389000	4390000	Womp womp.
4391000	4393000	Boy, you are just comedy fucking gold tonight. Alright, let's move on.
4394000	4395000	Well, how about-
4396000	4398000	Feel like there needs to be a two drink minimum to listen to this show, Logie.
4399000	4400000	I'm already on my second drink.
4401000	4402000	I could have some more coffee, that'd be great.
4403000	4404000	Thanks Rob.
4404000	4405000	It's a settlement by the way, Logie.
4406000	4407000	Free Red Bull?
4408000	4409000	Yeah, it's like $15, because apparently Red Bull-
4410000	4411000	It's $10.
4412000	4415000	It's $10 or $15 in Red Bull product. You know which one Logie's opting for.
4416000	4419000	I'd just rather have the $10 and then go buy like a monster.
4420000	4425000	Because they came out and said, you know, hey, we mis-marketed Red Bull and it might be unhealthy for you. And Logie's like, yay, more.
4428000	4431000	Wait, wait, wait, wait. Did Red Bull decide this on their own or did people sue them for it?
4432000	4433000	It's a settlement.
4434000	4437000	It's a settlement because it doesn't actually turn you into some sort of pegasus or something.
4438000	4439000	You know, so unfortunately-
4440000	4441000	You don't grow a tail from breaking red.
4442000	4443000	You're not the one winged angel anymore.
4444000	4446000	I wonder if I could then do the same thing about Rockstar putting my husband in the hospital.
4447000	4449000	Oh, that's probably already happened.
4450000	4453000	Probably. I'll just have to tell him to look for a class action and we can get it on that.
4454000	4455000	A lot of Rockstars end up in the hospital, so.
4456000	4459000	And then, and then we'll probably just use it to buy coffee.
4460000	4463000	Logie, do we know what this means for the Flugtag?
4464000	4465000	Is that shut down?
4466000	4471000	I don't think so. I think they're still going crazy with, you know, all sorts of extreme sports things in the name of Red Bull.
4472000	4473000	Flying machines.
4474000	4475000	Four Locos okay though, right?
4476000	4477000	Oh, that's been banned for a while now.
4478000	4488000	Becky and I were actually having conversations like if our legal system actually used the common sense rule, how many of these class action lawsuits would never go through and how much smarter our population would probably be.
4489000	4491000	Think about the lawyers. They need jobs too.
4492000	4493000	I try not to. I get nauseous.
4494000	4495000	I'm sorry.
4496000	4502000	So anyway, there, we had mentioned the PS Vita before. There is going to be something very special coming out for Vita.
4503000	4504000	And that's Minecraft! Yay!
4505000	4512000	Basically it's going to be on PSN a day before it is in Europe.
4513000	4520000	And it's also basically anybody who has a copy of it on PS3 will get the Vita copy for free.
4520000	4526000	And that's also people who own physical as well as PSN versions.
4527000	4534000	And it's supposed to be out on November 11th. It's a cross offer so basically you buy one, you get the other.
4535000	4542000	You can upgrade the PS4 one for $5 more and you can do transfers between PS3 and Vita as well as your DLC.
4543000	4544000	So hooray Minecraft people!
4545000	4550000	God it would be even more awesome if you could play with people on the PS3 on the Vita.
4551000	4553000	Yeah, or even 3 and 4 would be kind of nice.
4554000	4555000	Or any of them, yes.
4556000	4558000	I have Minecraft on the PS4 but that's...
4559000	4562000	Well I understand why you wouldn't be able to with the PS4 because the worlds are bigger so that would be kind of like,
4563000	4565000	Hi, I'm outside the world. You can't come with me.
4565000	4570000	No, PlayStation 3 and the Vita one I think are pretty much the same.
4571000	4574000	God, I almost want a PlayStation TV for that.
4575000	4577000	But that would be such a waste of money because I have a PlayStation 3.
4578000	4581000	You're right, that would actually be a waste of money.
4582000	4586000	What is the goal of getting Minecraft on the PlayStation TV? To play Minecraft on your TV?
4587000	4588000	Wait, you can do that already!
4589000	4593000	I don't know. I wouldn't even want to do that because I have it on PC.
4593000	4595000	Exactly, and you can mod it on PC.
4596000	4599000	Are people still playing Minecraft? Like nobody's tired of it?
4600000	4605000	Oh yeah, go onto the PlayStation Live or go onto Twitch and there's still tons of people streaming Minecraft.
4606000	4608000	Apparently Microsoft thinks so.
4609000	4612000	You did hear Microsoft paid like 2 billion dollars.
4613000	4615000	Yeah, and I'm confounded by all of this.
4616000	4622000	I was walking through the toy aisle at Target the other day and there was a freaking foam Minecraft pickaxe.
4623000	4625000	And Lego sets too. I want those Lego sets.
4626000	4627000	There's tons of stuff.
4628000	4632000	Like Kmart had a bin of the, I was there buying toilet paper.
4633000	4637000	But they had, well because the toilet paper is the only thing there that's not out of style.
4638000	4642000	But they had a little bin of Minecraft plushies too, like the animals.
4643000	4646000	As long as there are 10 year olds alive, Minecraft will be relevant.
4647000	4651000	Yeah, I mean remember it is still really huge in the family friendly market, so to speak.
4651000	4658000	Zenthral in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, do people still play Minecraft? Does a bear shit in the woods?
4659000	4661000	There you go. Wow, I guess you just got told there.
4662000	4664000	A bear shits wherever it needs to shit.
4665000	4670000	If a bear wants to shit on the hood of your car, that's where a bear will shit.
4671000	4674000	And maybe the animals in Minecraft will soon shit. We'll see.
4675000	4679000	Who got told now? Ooh, bears can shit anywhere.
4679000	4683000	Well, before too long you're going to be able to Minecraft on anything too, so.
4684000	4685000	You're going to Minecraft on it.
4686000	4688000	Alright, let's travel around the world.
4689000	4690000	I'm done.
4691000	4693000	You can't even? Are you unable to?
4694000	4695000	This one can't.
4696000	4697000	Can this only be fixed to the pumpkin spice latte at this point?
4698000	4700000	You could go make me coffee again.
4701000	4705000	Let's travel around the world first and check out some release dates. Listen to her. Go get me coffee, Rob.
4706000	4708000	Wow, that's very, like, demanding.
4709000	4714000	I'm a great guest. No, I was kidding, Rob. I don't want any more of your coffee.
4715000	4717000	Okay. Well, I want some release dates. Let's get to it.
4719000	4725000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase DOG.
4726000	4732000	Alright, let's get to it. I'm extremely excited because this week we have Borderlands the Pre-Seeker coming out on PlayStation 3,
4733000	4736000	Xbox 360, and PC. Sorry people that have those newer systems.
4736000	4743000	You don't get to play Borderlands yet until they release the inevitable, like, HDR version of the Borderlands trilogy.
4744000	4747000	So, expect that probably in 2015 because that seems to be the trend.
4748000	4756000	Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, 3DS, and that's it.
4757000	4768000	God, why? Duck Dynasty for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, 3DS, and Wii U.
4769000	4771000	Rednecks play games too, remember.
4772000	4777000	As long as people are buying that, like, big game hunter and all that stuff, I'm sure there's a...
4778000	4779000	Somebody does.
4780000	4782000	Okay, so what's classier? Cabela's or Duck Dynasty?
4783000	4784000	Cabela's, actually.
4784000	4785000	Yes.
4786000	4787000	Now that we all agree.
4788000	4790000	Wow, that was a weird fucking conversation. Alright.
4791000	4798000	Let's see. The Evil Within coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
4799000	4803000	Sleeping Dogs, the definitive edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4804000	4805000	Oh my gosh.
4805000	4808000	Walking Dead complete first season on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4809000	4812000	Walking Dead season 2 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4813000	4815000	Poptropica, Forgotten Islands on 3DS.
4816000	4821000	Pets games, Pets Countryside and Pets Beach on 3DS.
4822000	4830000	I think this was delayed, but Senran Kagura, Shinobi vs. Limited, the Let's Get Physical edition, if I remember correctly.
4831000	4832000	The Olivia Newton-John edition.
4833000	4834000	I was just thinking the same thing.
4835000	4837000	It's on Vita.
4838000	4840000	Let's see what else here.
4841000	4845000	Tears to Tierra 2, Heir of the Overlord on PlayStation 3.
4846000	4857000	And they're doing it against the re-release of Need for Speed Rivals, the complete edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and Xbox One.
4858000	4860000	Oh gosh. There's a lot of stuff.
4861000	4862000	Well, we're getting into that holiday season.
4863000	4864000	That is it.
4865000	4867000	Alright, that's it. Well, traveling over to Japan, very different story.
4868000	4873000	There's a lot of releases on the 23rd, but for this week, the 16th, only the Vita is seeing releases right now.
4874000	4876000	Because you know the Vita, it's kind of a different story over in Japan.
4877000	4880000	There's lots and lots of releases in Japan for the Vita, and this week no exception.
4881000	4886000	Your releases this week on the PlayStation Vita, Dramatical Murder Re-Code in regular and limited edition.
4887000	4888000	Dramatical Murder.
4889000	4890000	I like that. I like that.
4891000	4896000	Let's see. Chaos Rings 3 Prequel Trilogy comes out from Square Enix on the Vita this week.
4897000	4900000	And lastly, Amnesia World Later Cross Crowd V Edition.
4901000	4902000	There it is.
4903000	4904000	Is that it?
4905000	4906000	I know, it really is.
4907000	4908000	Poor chopped cactus hairline.
4909000	4911000	What is Amnesia World? I forgot.
4916000	4917000	Where's that trombone?
4920000	4923000	We'll just have to flush that one down the toilet.
4932000	4936000	I have the fail ones bookmarked just for this program.
4937000	4938000	When it's time to be alive.
4939000	4941000	I wasn't going to break the fourth wall and be like, Irene, get away from that toilet.
4942000	4946000	You'll notice I don't have the win ones bookmarked, just the lose ones.
4947000	4948000	There's a reason.
4949000	4950000	Hey, let's go to Europe.
4951000	4952000	Sure. Let's go right now. Bye.
4953000	4955000	I'm actually going to do the next two weeks just because we won't be here.
4956000	4958000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Breaking news. Super important.
4959000	4960000	Very important. LocoPoco in chat.
4961000	4965000	Dramatical Murder is a BL slash yaoi game, Sky.
4966000	4971000	Whoa. Well, this Dramatical Murder just got a lot hotter.
4971000	4979000	Um, BRB going to get Dramatical Murder. Is it Sexy Murder? What is this?
4980000	4981000	Does it involve corn cobs?
4982000	4983000	Murder Dramatica.
4984000	4986000	Irene, what did you say over there?
4987000	4988000	Gonna murder that ass.
4989000	4990000	That's it.
4991000	4992000	This is the murder he wrote.
4997000	4999000	Murder that ass. You're the one that just ate McDonald's.
5002000	5004000	Hey, how about Europe?
5005000	5006000	Oh yeah, Europe. Hey.
5007000	5009000	Stop following me to the bathroom, you guys.
5010000	5012000	I forgot to take the microphone with you.
5013000	5018000	On the 14th of October, we have Peggle 2 for PS4, The Evil Within for a bunch of stuff.
5019000	5023000	On the 15th, we have VibRibbon in the UK for Vita and PS3.
5024000	5030000	On October 17th, Borderlands is a pre-sequel, which is super fun, and I suggest everybody get it because it's awesome.
5031000	5039000	F1 2014 on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360. On the 21st, Dreamfall Chapter is Book 1.
5040000	5042000	And then the Dreamfall Chapter is The Longest Journey.
5043000	5048000	On the 22nd, Chromia. The 23rd, Stealth Inc. 2.
5049000	5056000	24th, Bayonetta 2, both for Wii U. Just Dance 2015, which I know you're all excited about.
5057000	5059000	Shadow Warrior and Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth.
5059000	5063000	Back to Bayonetta real quick. Those are bundled together, correct? The first one comes with, okay.
5064000	5065000	Yeah, it's some type of like...
5066000	5068000	That is listed separate listings in the UK, so...
5069000	5075000	Yeah. Just so you know, by the way, Irene, your little quote has our chat room up in arms there.
5076000	5080000	And Dartitsuya says, yeah, I can't even right now. Congratulations, our chatters cannot even.
5081000	5083000	The listeners are unable to. They cannot.
5084000	5085000	You're welcome.
5086000	5087000	Pumpkin spice for all.
5087000	5088000	Rob.
5088000	5089000	Alright.
5089000	5090000	Rob.
5090000	5091000	Yes.
5091000	5092000	Rob.
5092000	5093000	What?
5093000	5094000	Rob.
5094000	5095000	What?
5095000	5096000	Coffee.
5096000	5097000	How about we do a couple more?
5097000	5098000	I found the ferret the other day.
5098000	5099000	How about we do...
5099000	5100000	Oh, lord, I thought we'd burn that thing. Alright.
5101000	5102000	Midna found the ferret.
5103000	5104000	Of course.
5104000	5105000	There was like four or five of them. They've got to be around.
5106000	5107000	The original one's at my house.
5108000	5112000	Some of them we gave to listeners, too. Like, very special, like, super fans.
5113000	5114000	So, anyway.
5114000	5115000	They're expensive to buy nowadays.
5115000	5116000	Yeah, they are.
5116000	5122000	I'm not talking about the guy from My Own Heart who is streaming Hot to Full Boyfriend, which I still do every Tuesday between five and six.
5123000	5125000	Did you see now there's a Kickstarter for a bear dating sim?
5126000	5127000	No.
5128000	5130000	And I'm not talking about, like, you know, what you'd see at the Bolt on Saturday, but I'm talking about...
5131000	5132000	No.
5133000	5134000	I got so much less exciting.
5135000	5136000	It doesn't get any better than dating pigeons.
5137000	5138000	Somebody wants to make a game where you date bears.
5139000	5141000	Well, good for them. I'm going to keep playing the pigeons.
5142000	5143000	Alright.
5144000	5145000	Can they shit anywhere?
5146000	5147000	We'll probably get them on the show and we'll ask, won't we?
5148000	5149000	Thank you.
5150000	5151000	Alright.
5152000	5153000	Barbara Walters over there asking the hard questions.
5154000	5155000	Just a couple...
5156000	5158000	In your game, can the bears shit wherever they want?
5159000	5162000	Do the bears have a choice of defecation location?
5163000	5165000	Is the shit high-res or is it in pixels?
5166000	5168000	Alright, a couple more stories for you guys.
5169000	5170000	That's it. I want to make a game called Pixel Shit.
5171000	5172000	The classic...
5172000	5175000	Help. The show is losing control. Help. Help.
5176000	5177000	You OLR dream game pixel shit.
5178000	5180000	I can't even right now. A couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.
5181000	5182000	Logie, help.
5183000	5185000	For some reason, when I hear it was a defecation location, it makes me think of...
5186000	5188000	Was it a conjunction junction or something?
5189000	5190000	Schoolhouse Rock.
5191000	5192000	That should be a Schoolhouse Rock song.
5193000	5200000	Anyways, so apparently Unity may or may not be up for sale.
5200000	5206000	It's kind of confusing. Some thoughts are, yeah, they're looking for someone to buy them.
5207000	5209000	It may be Google. Google might be offering them money.
5210000	5213000	No one seems to know. But it's possible that they may sell out.
5214000	5216000	I really wish this was a little bit more...
5217000	5219000	I don't know. Firm?
5220000	5225000	I think everyone's kind of on the lookout of companies acquiring other companies right now.
5225000	5233000	Especially since we've just had a few major ones with Twitch and Mojang, Oculus.
5234000	5240000	I've been hearing Google might be buying Unity for a while now.
5241000	5247000	But we'll see. I guess you'll just have to wait for the actual Unity was purchased by Google.
5248000	5250000	Apparently Google wants to buy something.
5251000	5252000	I always want to buy something.
5253000	5257000	Hey Google, want to buy an online network with some podcasts?
5258000	5262000	If they're looking to seriously get into...
5263000	5265000	I don't even really have to...
5266000	5268000	I don't know what the point would be in buying them.
5269000	5274000	Other than locking it down, more funding maybe. That'd be kind of cool.
5275000	5278000	I'm just worried that's going to go the route of one of these other companies.
5278000	5286000	I know one of the ones I saw in a lot of these articles citing renderware and stuff, the EA bought them and kind of shut them down.
5287000	5295000	So I don't know. But I like Unity. Hopefully if someone does buy them, they kind of leave them alone and just give them money.
5296000	5297000	Because that'd be nice.
5298000	5299000	Leave me alone and give me money.
5300000	5301000	That's a good company.
5302000	5303000	That sounds like my marriage.
5304000	5305000	No, no, no.
5306000	5317000	Definitely since you can export to Android and stuff, it's obviously something that pleases Google since you can have a lot more content on there.
5318000	5325000	And thank God that they're sane and don't require you to own an Apple to fucking publish to iOS. Thank you, Apple.
5326000	5328000	So, yeah.
5329000	5337000	Alright. Let's move on and talk about a game that I'm sure is going to be sucking down a lot of money because it has the name Final Fantasy in it.
5338000	5340000	So with that reason, people are going to be like, here's my money.
5341000	5345000	This is Final Fantasy Explorers, which is coming out soon in Japan. And this is...
5346000	5347000	Irene might be up your alley. I don't know because it is a 3DS game.
5348000	5350000	Actually, this might be more a Piper's thing if he's a big theater fan.
5351000	5353000	Final Fantasy Explorers, you heard much about this?
5353000	5354000	I have not yet.
5355000	5357000	Not yet? Alright. Final Fantasy Explorers is kind of like Final Fantasy meets Monster Hunter.
5358000	5359000	That's kind of what this is all about.
5360000	5361000	Because you know Monster Hunter is like huge over in Japan, right?
5362000	5365000	So they're making this game and it is coming out in Japan pretty soon.
5366000	5370000	But Final Fantasy Explorers is going to have some things that you don't typically see in 3DS titles.
5371000	5373000	For one of them, it's not going to have full 3D.
5374000	5376000	That's right. You're going to have a 3DS game with no 3D.
5377000	5378000	You can finally play a game on your 2DS.
5379000	5380000	Essentially, yes.
5380000	5384000	Well, now to be fair, I was kind of thinking, I was like, have there been other games that have done this?
5385000	5390000	And actually, yes. Pokemon X and Y had this too, where only the battles were in 3D, I think.
5391000	5393000	And then all the overworld stuff was in 2D, but let's be real.
5394000	5395000	You want to talk about a game that was for the 2DS?
5396000	5398000	That was just a Pokemon system was what that thing was, right?
5399000	5403000	So yeah, Final Fantasy Explorers, not going to feature 3D throughout the whole game.
5404000	5407000	However, it will feature support for, are you ready for this?
5408000	5409000	The Circle Pad Pro.
5410000	5412000	Did anybody pick one of those up when Kid Icarus was all the rage?
5413000	5414000	No.
5415000	5417000	But if you happen to have one, Final Fantasy Explorers will support that.
5418000	5426000	It should also be noted that the new 3DS and the features that are available on that system will also be supported by Final Fantasy Explorers.
5427000	5434000	Because the new 3DS will have that extra stick, so that can control the camera and the extra shoulder buttons will control the lock-on feature.
5435000	5440000	It should also be noted that the new 3DS still hasn't been confirmed for America, so...
5441000	5444000	But they like to wait until the last minute when announcing dates for things.
5445000	5446000	They kind of do, don't they?
5447000	5448000	I would not be surprised if we have that.
5449000	5455000	I mean, considering it's coming out in other places around the world this year, I would not be surprised if we get it this year.
5456000	5458000	You still think of the new 3DS as a possibility for this year?
5459000	5460000	I think maybe December.
5460000	5464000	I'm gonna guess that we'll get it before the end of the fiscal year.
5465000	5469000	I think we'll get it around the time that the next Pokemon game comes out, which is the end of November.
5470000	5471000	Okay.
5472000	5473000	But again...
5474000	5475000	What sells systems? Pokemon!
5476000	5478000	Pokemon could sell a lot of 2DSs too, you know?
5479000	5480000	Well, that's a win-win still.
5481000	5482000	That's true.
5482000	5485000	That's even more of a win for them because, guess what? You bought a 2DS.
5486000	5495000	And now if you really want to get the best bang for your buck to play the newest Pokemon game that'll come out in a year or so, you're gonna need the new 2DS.
5496000	5498000	Or the new 3DS. Or the new, new 3DS.
5499000	5502000	I really hope that they decide to maybe give it another name when it comes out here. I don't know.
5503000	5504000	They won't.
5505000	5510000	Alright, well let's travel back in time to a time when games, like, they weren't 3D.
5510000	5514000	You didn't have 3D games. Well, maybe you had Rad Racer. You didn't have that.
5515000	5521000	But it's time to visit gaming's archive and step into Jamie's vault before she puts the whole thing in a box.
5522000	5523000	Bunch of boxes.
5524000	5530000	And find one game notable of being the classic game of the week. And I noticed, Dark Soccer, your Capcom comes to an end this week.
5531000	5532000	I'd said that last week.
5533000	5534000	Oh, I forgot.
5535000	5537000	Because I have to put in a little bit more gap before I jump to CPS1.
5537000	5542000	Alright. So, uh, we're visiting something else this week, Dark Soccer. What is the classic game of the week?
5543000	5546000	Get Bass! Also known as Sega Bass Fishing.
5547000	5549000	Um, yeah. I picked it.
5550000	5556000	Basically, um, this was an arcade fishing game. It came out in 1997, um, for the Sega Model 3.
5557000	5564000	And it has been since ported to the Dreamcast, uh, it's on Windows, Xbox 360, PS3, and the Wii.
5564000	5571000	And this game was notable for coming with a special controller that you used as a fishing rod.
5572000	5576000	Um, I will be talking more about that later because it was awesome.
5577000	5579000	So basically, you just fish. That's all you do.
5580000	5584000	You, uh, you have to hook and reel and fish. You use different kinds of lures.
5585000	5590000	Uh, there's different stages of fishing, so you can actually get different kinds of fish based on what time you fish.
5591000	5592000	It's a big fishing sim.
5592000	5599000	And the thing is, I don't know how Sega did it, but they made it fun and not completely boring, like real fishing.
5600000	5607000	Um, especially when you would catch the fish and it would say, Fish Get! Well, on the Japanese version, anyway.
5608000	5616000	And then the person would go, Fish! So it's just such full of, uh, rather, uh, cornball stuff just from that era of Sega games.
5616000	5625000	Because you know what also else came out like soon after that was like Brave Firefighters and Jumbo Safari was out and all of those kind of weird games.
5626000	5632000	But, I don't even know why this game was so fun, but I don't really know many people who don't like this game.
5633000	5639000	It even had a sequel, which was Sega Bass Fishing Duel, which came out on PS2. It was a, uh, multiplayer.
5640000	5644000	And then there was a Rails crossover that was called Sega Bass Fishing of the Dead.
5645000	5652000	It was reported in 2012, but it was an April Fools joke. That would have, I would have absolutely bought it though.
5653000	5655000	And then of course we also after that had Sega Marine Fishing.
5656000	5661000	Now I will, this is why I picked this game. This is the game that gave us the fishing rod controller.
5662000	5664000	This is the game that created Rodcalibur.
5665000	5668000	I don't know if I've, I've probably told everybody what Rodcalibur is, I'll say it again.
5669000	5671000	About a thousand times on this show is Rodcalibur.
5671000	5675000	This is playing Soulcalibur on Dreamcast with the fishing rod.
5676000	5681000	You can swing the thing around like you're sword fighting and actually beat the game with the fishing controller.
5682000	5684000	Can you be, can you nunchuck me? Can you be Maxie?
5685000	5688000	I, actually I did beat it with Maxie, the first person I played with.
5689000	5691000	And then I also did beat it with Sophotia.
5692000	5697000	And, um, actually Waldo is remarkably good with the, uh, rod controller.
5698000	5700000	And all you do is swing it around like you're flailing to death.
5701000	5702000	And that's Rodcalibur.
5703000	5704000	The analog of button mashing.
5705000	5708000	Yes. I tried doing, um, DDR caliber once, that didn't work.
5709000	5715000	Uh, however, that's how I learned that my Dreamcast dance pads, that my, uh, corner buttons were analog.
5716000	5717000	Oh.
5718000	5719000	Sorry, I just...
5720000	5723000	I wanted that as, as, uh, my text tone for the longest time.
5724000	5728000	Would it have been wrong if in this game you could catch Echo the Dolphin?
5729000	5730000	Or what's that Seaman looking guy?
5731000	5734000	That's for, that's for Sega, that's for Sega poaching fishing.
5735000	5737000	That's for Sega deep sea poaching.
5738000	5740000	Are we sure this isn't bass fishing?
5743000	5744000	It was actually funny.
5745000	5747000	When I started, I looked up Get Bass first.
5748000	5751000	And, um, it actually was like nothing but bass playing videos.
5752000	5753000	Oh.
5754000	5756000	So then I had to put Sega Get Bass and then that's when I found it.
5756000	5759000	Get Bass, Get Bass and it's all Geddy Lee and...
5760000	5761000	Bootsy.
5762000	5763000	Bootsy.
5764000	5765000	I ain't Bootsy.
5766000	5768000	No, I found like two, two of the first videos out there were like Bootsy Collins.
5769000	5770000	So it was pretty cool.
5771000	5772000	It's because of parliament rules overall.
5773000	5774000	Yes.
5775000	5776000	I think, I'm looking at this and I think I still prefer Ocarina of Time.
5777000	5778000	I would, I would rather play that than this.
5779000	5783000	Well, you know, uh, we've been doing Classic Game of the Week since what, episode number 250?
5783000	5785000	So there's been about 300 classic games.
5786000	5787000	Pretty sure Ocarina of Time's been done.
5788000	5789000	So we're starting to, uh, you know, dig a little deeper.
5790000	5791000	These are the deep cuts.
5792000	5793000	These are the deep cuts.
5794000	5795000	Well, but...
5796000	5800000	As much as I've talked about Rod Caliber, I had to bring up the origins of Rod Caliber.
5801000	5803000	And this game is actually super fun if you're really drunk.
5804000	5806000	I still see shit like this in the arcade all the time.
5807000	5808000	And phish.
5809000	5811000	Rod Caliber is also an awesome porn star name.
5811000	5813000	I was going to say it sounds like a detective.
5814000	5816000	Like somebody you'd find on Matlock calling Rod Caliber.
5817000	5819000	What kind of Matlock are you watching?
5820000	5824000	That's on the, that's on the channels where you have to watch through the third party version of the show.
5825000	5827000	When we make Pixel shit it'll be starring Rod Caliber.
5828000	5829000	TV Land After Dark.
5830000	5831000	Is your PSP modded to play Rod Caliber?
5832000	5833000	Of course.
5834000	5836000	I'm going to get, uh, Bodhi to make Rod Caliber the game.
5837000	5838000	Very similar to Aseturf.
5839000	5840000	If you don't play, Rod Caliber plays you.
5841000	5845000	Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.
5846000	5847000	Sega Bass Fishing.
5848000	5849000	Phish!
5850000	5851000	Phish!
5852000	5853000	Alright, with that super bass.
5854000	5855000	I just, now I hear Nicki Minaj in my head.
5856000	5857000	Look at what you did.
5858000	5859000	I'm sorry.
5860000	5861000	Thank you.
5862000	5863000	Hey, but she's a great feminist icon.
5864000	5865000	Yeah, look at that booty.
5866000	5867000	Well, you know what?
5868000	5869000	My anaconda don't.
5869000	5870000	We're going to take a break.
5871000	5873000	And when we come back, who knows what song I'll burst into next.
5874000	5875000	We've got some rapid fire news as well.
5876000	5881000	The Fugu Question of the Week, Mailbag, FUs of the Week, your calls and so much more with our live studio audience here.
5882000	5886000	As we get into more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this quick break.
5887000	5888000	Don't go anywhere guys.
5888000	5902000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live with the 571st episode of our show for this October the 12th, 2014, already in progress.
5903000	5904000	We've had such a busy show so far tonight.
5905000	5907000	We're joined by our dear old friend of Orange Lounge Radio.
5908000	5911000	I'm not actually calling you old Princess Irene, but you know, the show is pretty old.
5912000	5915000	But from the Multitap podcast now.
5916000	5917000	And when do you guys put out new episodes?
5918000	5919000	Like when do you tape your shows and when do they go out?
5920000	5921000	I'm going to give that to Piper.
5922000	5924000	Piper's here from the same show.
5925000	5930000	Shoot. We usually record Sundays. We're never live though. That's not interactive.
5931000	5932000	So I think we try to put out Mondays.
5933000	5934000	Alright, cool. A lot of shows do Sundays.
5935000	5936000	So yeah, I know a lot of people.
5937000	5940000	There's a lot of people that I know that do their shows that are like, we listen to OLR, but we're taping then.
5941000	5942000	So I know how it goes.
5943000	5944000	As long as you put out.
5945000	5947000	That's fine. That's why we have the podcast so people can listen in all sorts of different ways.
5948000	5949000	It's a week so the marriage doesn't die.
5950000	5954000	And of course, JV Monn from New York City all the way to the other coast joining us here as well.
5955000	5957000	When's your show put out? Once a month. What do we do?
5958000	5960000	Every month or two. It's on iTunes, just Super Euro Power Hour.
5961000	5964000	Alright. So you're not going to tell us when the next episode's coming out? Just hurry up and wait?
5965000	5971000	I'm trying to get one out this week. Well, I'm trying to get one out this week because a friend of mine who's an indie Eurobeat producer lives in San Jose.
5972000	5973000	So it's just a quick drive.
5973000	5980000	And he's, for Super Eurobeat, he's known as Ken Blast, but if you're a My Little Pony fan and a Eurobeat fan, he goes by Eurobeat Brony.
5981000	5982000	Okay.
5983000	5986000	So if you type in like Eurobeat and the letter B, that's like the first thing you get on YouTube.
5987000	5988000	Alright.
5989000	5990000	He gets like 2 million plus views on each video.
5991000	5992000	Nice. Can we get a shout out?
5993000	5994000	He's doing something well.
5995000	6001000	So hey, since we had such a busy beginning of the show and if you didn't hear the first half, if you're just joining us now live on this Sunday evening,
6001000	6007000	definitely check out the podcast at some point. We had a great interview with Bodie Lee from Lunar Ray Games, talking about Time Spinner earlier on in the show.
6008000	6012000	That was awesome. In fact, it was so busy, I forgot housekeeping and a very important note.
6013000	6017000	And I mentioned this in a previous week, so just to make sure you guys know, we will not be here next week.
6018000	6020000	There will be no live OLR next week.
6021000	6024000	I might try to throw together like a best of or something for the podcast, but I really can't promise that.
6025000	6026000	It just depends on how much time I have during the week.
6026000	6033000	So sadly, I know a lot of you guys rely on OLR to get through your Monday and so forth. I'm very sorry we won't be here.
6034000	6045000	I will actually be in Las Vegas. I'm going to Final Fantasy Fan Fest this weekend, which is celebrating Final Fantasy XIV, which as you know is the MMO I kind of got addicted to ever since I left World of Warcraft.
6046000	6047000	Are you cosplaying?
6048000	6050000	No, probably not, because I don't have time to throw something together.
6051000	6052000	I can loan you my Homestuck cosplay.
6053000	6054000	Why would I dress in Homestuck?
6054000	6056000	I'm sure you'd make a great game.
6057000	6066000	Here's the thing. I want to do Hildebrand, which if you play Final Fantasy XIV is a hilarious character. He's all the funny quests.
6067000	6069000	But then I'm thinking like half the dudes will be cosplaying Hildebrand.
6070000	6071000	So you'd be his dad.
6072000	6080000	At first I thought you were making an age joke, but then I was like actually Hildebrand's dad is in one of the questlines. He's even like twice the awesome.
6081000	6082000	He doesn't wear pants either.
6082000	6089000	I have to tell you, you just wear the black hot pants. I have to tell you that the Hildebrand quest annoys me.
6090000	6091000	I don't think they're funny.
6092000	6093000	Really?
6094000	6095000	Stupid does not equate funny to me.
6096000	6097000	They're stupid funny to me. It's like Dumb and Dumber.
6098000	6103000	Yeah, and I tried to sit through one of those and left the theater when someone else paid.
6104000	6105000	You want to go see a sequel?
6106000	6110000	No. I feel bile rising up in my throat at the preview.
6110000	6116000	I love Jim Carrey. I will see anything Jim Carrey is in, and that's why I'm so mad that Kick-Ass 2 is still not on Netflix.
6117000	6122000	I was forced to watch The Explorers, and I really wish I hadn't.
6123000	6131000	I was going to tell you, I've had this idea for a long time of doing Final Fantasy XIV cosplay, but doing like low level craft cosplay.
6132000	6138000	As in just wearing like the stuff that, you know, because people do the real big elaborate ones, but you never have people just being the everyday people.
6138000	6144000	I really like the way the Gridania guards look. I think if I was going to cosplay something, I really like their masks and their armor and everything.
6145000	6146000	So you should do that. Be an NPC.
6147000	6148000	Okay, can I throw it together in four days before I leave?
6149000	6150000	I was just trying to say, all green clothing and bad posture?
6151000	6152000	Cactuar.
6153000	6154000	There you go.
6155000	6161000	Just get a green Snuggie and then sew it up in the back. You could do that. That wouldn't be too hard.
6162000	6163000	Oh my god, laziest cosplay ever.
6164000	6165000	A Cactuar?
6165000	6166000	That would be that bad.
6167000	6170000	You know, I'm not going alone. I'm going with Shane. What do you think you could convince him to cosplay as?
6171000	6174000	A Chocobo. Put a feather on his head.
6175000	6177000	If he's out there listening, he's going to be like, no.
6178000	6179000	Just carry a lantern around. You could be a lazy Tonberry.
6180000	6181000	Lazy Tonberry, yeah. There you go.
6182000	6187000	That actually, you know what? You know what? You know what? I could probably do a Tonberry head in a night.
6188000	6189000	Alright, we'll see. We'll see. I don't know.
6190000	6191000	We'll talk about it.
6192000	6198000	Unfortunately, if you want to get into, you know, wherever you're going, you kind of have to walk back and forth very slowly.
6199000	6200000	It's going to take you a while to get to where you're going.
6201000	6202000	I'll be Tonberry on Red Bull.
6203000	6213000	Anyhow, so we will be not here next week, but what a great time for you to sample other indie podcasts because there's lots of hardworking indie podcasters out there creating great content.
6214000	6215000	So our friends at Multitap, this is your week.
6216000	6217000	You could listen to us.
6218000	6220000	That's right. Listen to you guys. There you go. Are you going to get them for three hours?
6221000	6225000	Depending. We've done two-parters, so those end up close to four hours.
6226000	6227000	You could listen to two episodes.
6228000	6229000	Two episodes, and we release them in part the first and part the second.
6230000	6231000	Awesome.
6232000	6237000	Sounds like a plan. Sounds like a plan. So, yeah, we won't be here next week, but I will be back with all the details from Final Fantasy Fan Fest.
6238000	6245000	I'll try and get an interview. If I can get my butt up there and interview the developers, that would be fantastic. We'll see what happens.
6246000	6248000	So, there you go. That is why we will not be here next week.
6248000	6253000	But we are here this week, so we're trying to continue putting on a kick-butt show for you guys.
6254000	6256000	So let's get to it. Some rapid-fire news. Loki.
6257000	6261000	So, I just don't understand Nintendo sometimes, or actually most of the times.
6262000	6274000	But apparently, and I'm thinking that this is a little bit sensationalized, but apparently the GameCube adapter that they're putting out for Super Smash Bros. on Wii U only works with Super Smash Bros. on Wii U.
6274000	6290000	It will not work with existing Wii and Virtual Console games. Also, I don't know if it's going to allow you to use some in place of the Classic Controller or something.
6291000	6297000	I guess that was the thought, but now it's not. It's only going to be used for Smash Bros.
6298000	6305000	But I think it's only going to be used for Smash Bros. right now. I think later on they could come out with things that support it.
6306000	6313000	But I don't think they're going to release it only for Smash Bros. and say, ah, well, that's it. That's the last thing we're going to use it on.
6314000	6319000	I just can't see that. Maybe later on in a system update it will come out with support for it, but yeah, right now it's not.
6320000	6324000	I really think it should have been out of the gate, because you're really limiting your audience.
6325000	6334000	This is proprietary to our system, and then only proprietary to this game. That would be a waste, I think.
6335000	6346000	I think it would not be that difficult, because they had GameCube support for Virtual Console before, and all it's doing now is running through a stupid adapter that's converting it to USB.
6346000	6355000	How fucking hard can that be to get that to work? To shoehorn that in? I can't imagine it would be that hard. Just fucking map it to classic controller stuff.
6356000	6364000	I still feel like at some point we're inevitably going to get Virtual Console GameCube games, and this would be a very logical thing to use with it.
6364000	6373000	They're so backwards. It's just like, hey, it's not like a surprise that we're going to release this. You knew this for quite a long time.
6374000	6384000	You think you could have put one developer on shoehorning this into Virtual Console or for use with other games? I wouldn't have thought that would have been too difficult for you, but apparently it is.
6385000	6397000	Since clearly I'm never going to get a new F-Zero, because they're going to tease me by putting Mute City in Mario Kart or whatever the fuck they're doing, I can at least get F-Zero GX on Virtual Console would be nice.
6398000	6409000	And with that, of course, the rumored date of November 21st ended up being the release date for Super Smash Bros. in North America. Europe is getting it December 5th.
6410000	6413000	And, of course, the Amiibo characters will be coming out.
6414000	6419000	What do they do? We know they're coming, but why should I buy them?
6420000	6428000	They're literally AI characters that you can level up and that's it. It's fucking useless.
6429000	6436000	Cool. You know what? I have no qualms against getting some of those because they look cool and put them on your shelf and stuff, but as far as functionality goes, it's fucking stupid.
6437000	6441000	So, in other words, Amiibo is really more there for the figure collecting.
6442000	6446000	Yeah, it's figure collecting, but apparently later on you're going to be able to use it with Mario Kart and shit like that.
6447000	6457000	You know what it's for. It's just because they needed some shit to sell this stuff right now, and then later on when the new 3DS comes out with the fucking near-field communication shit, then it's going to drop.
6458000	6466000	Boom! New fucking Pokémon. Boom! Oh, look! Amiibo characters for every fucking Pokémon, and you know you're going to be buying every single one of those for $13 each.
6467000	6471000	Cha-ching! We're printing money again. That's where they're going to make their money. Fuck it. Who cares if the Wii U sucks?
6472000	6479000	You know what? We're making tons of money off these fucking toys. That is where they're going to go because it works for Activision and their goddamn Skylanders franchise.
6480000	6483000	Alright, calm down. We haven't calmed down until that press release comes out.
6484000	6489000	It's going to happen. Same with Nintendo DS and 3DS titles on the Wii U.
6490000	6492000	You know, if they can put Pikachu's face on it, they'll do it.
6493000	6495000	Yeah, Pikachu already. Pikachu's going to be one of those characters.
6496000	6506000	Alright, anyways, to go along with that, there was a little bit of speculation when Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker was coming out, and I remember saying that I don't fucking care when it comes out, but if you do care, it's coming out December 5th.
6507000	6508000	I care.
6508000	6514000	And it's going to be priced for $40, which, you know what? That's $20 too expensive, so just wait for the bargain.
6515000	6517000	But, Loki? Toadette's in it.
6518000	6522000	Oh, well I'm sorry. I guess that totally justifies the $40 price point then.
6523000	6524000	Now I don't care.
6525000	6527000	I was totally teasing. I hate Toadette. I really do.
6528000	6529000	I think it's whatever.
6530000	6532000	It's a totally irrational hatred. I can't explain it.
6533000	6535000	She's like one of those useless friend characters from Sonic.
6535000	6547000	Exactly. Toadette reminds me of one of Sonic's shitty friends. Like, she's in the wrong franchise. And I'm sorry if you're a Toadette fan, but I think, like, Double Dash just really left a bad taste in the beginning.
6548000	6552000	Toadette is just, it's all part of the same thing that they're doing with, like, even, like, Smash Bros.
6553000	6554000	Hold on, because Piper, it looks like I hurt Piper's feelings.
6555000	6557000	Specifically, if you're a Toadette fan, who the fuck are you?
6558000	6560000	You need to look at your life, look at your choices.
6560000	6565000	Hold on, hold on. Don't scare the listeners away. Just write us an email, tell us why we're wrong.
6566000	6570000	Okay, well I'm just saying that to participate at orangesonsradio.com, attention Piper.
6571000	6579000	It's a character they created to have more female characters so that people can play as it. So, you know, it's not alienating, you know, other audiences.
6580000	6582000	Can we get, like, Birdo? Because Birdo's fucking awesome.
6583000	6587000	Oh, I'm sorry. Birdo may be considered transgender or something like that, so fuck that shit.
6588000	6589000	Fuck that shit, because we're Nintendo.
6590000	6592000	And transgender needs representation as well.
6593000	6594000	That is true.
6595000	6600000	Hey, don't get me wrong. I think Captain Rainbow should be in the fucking Smash Bros., but, you know, where the fuck is that?
6601000	6604000	You know, we can't even get Captain Rainbow in there, because that was fucking awesome.
6605000	6610000	And Loki, I know you want Tingle in Smash Bros. I guess he's an assist trophy.
6611000	6615000	You know what? I think that would be funny. That would be kind of cool. Why not? Let's do that.
6616000	6617000	Tingle as a boss character.
6617000	6625000	I'd be down with that. Anyways, so, yeah. So, there's that. And then, what else? Let's see.
6626000	6633000	Oh, and, you know, in Japan it's already sold 2.8 million units, so that's pretty awesome.
6634000	6640000	So, cool. And then the, what was it? Lionhead.
6640000	6656000	Once again, thank God that Peter Molyneaux is not hyping this shit up, but, you know, if you care, Fable Legends is having their beta pretty soon, so you can actually register for that if you want to check out their game.
6657000	6666000	And it's at fablelegends.com slash beta sign up, and go ahead and check it out. I guess the beta is supposed to start October 16th.
6666000	6675000	So, cool. Honestly though, I've been so burnt out with Fable Games, I just can't.
6676000	6677000	Oh well.
6678000	6679000	You can't even.
6680000	6685000	I can't. I can't even. Seriously, I just don't care anymore.
6686000	6687000	Just getting Loki to say that on the show just made my night.
6687000	6698000	Alright. Moving on, let's talk about Factor 5. And Factor 5, apparently some news came out of what they were working on before they, you know, weren't working on it anymore.
6699000	6710000	Here's the thing. It was actually a Rogue Squadron trilogy remake for the Wii. That was the game that, interesting enough, it was starting on the Xbox, but Factor 5, like a lot of developers at the time, were like,
6710000	6717000	Oh hey, the Wii does motion control, and it's this crazy new thing everybody's into. So, yeah, that is what they did.
6718000	6724000	But unfortunately, financial hardship, legal snafus, budgetary restrictions, all ended up killing the game.
6725000	6737000	So, it should be noted that the former president of Factor 5, Julian Egbrecht, loves the Wii U, but its unpredictable trajectory and licensing troubles in general make a Star Wars Wii U game unlikely.
6737000	6744000	You know what else was noted about this game? Lightsaber battles used one-to-one motion controls. Wasn't that what everybody wanted on the Wii?
6745000	6754000	Yeah, and you didn't get anything like that until Wii Sports Resort came out. Because remember they had a lightsaber battle game and it was kinda crap.
6754000	6769000	If you are playing Diablo III Ultimate Evil Edition, this would be the console version of Diablo III, there was a patch this week that brought the game in line with the recent 2.1 patch on PC.
6770000	6781000	However, it's missing seasons. The big season, the whole thing I was talking about at the beginning of the show, I reached 70 on my seasonal hardcore character on PC, I won't be able to do that on console because they don't have seasons on console.
6781000	6795000	And they haven't really said why, but we were talking a little bit about this on Hoard House and Extaver said that it's probably because of the fact that people have already hacked Diablo III on console because it's not required to be online like the PC one is.
6796000	6808000	So therefore, people would cheat the shit out of the system, which unfortunately does make sense and I kinda wish, like I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I kinda wish you could like opt in to have Diablo III always online like while you're playing the season mode maybe.
6809000	6811000	Why can't season mode be online?
6812000	6814000	Yeah, or something like that. I'm kinda surprised.
6815000	6823000	They have that like Call of Duty, which pisses me off sometimes. They've got certain game modes, even though you're playing them single player or whatever, they have to be online.
6824000	6833000	Or like if you wanna play two player, it's gotta be played over online, you can't play it through LAN for some reason because of rankings and stuff. I don't see why they couldn't do this.
6833000	6846000	Yeah, I wish they could figure a way out because, you know, even those seasons, it's just seasons. It did make me go revisit the game and try a new character and do something I never did before, so it'll be fun to do on PS4 as well.
6847000	6857000	Anyway, in celebration of this patch, it should be noted that through the 17th, the console versions are getting some different little buffs, temporary buffs.
6857000	6865000	If you're playing on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, well you got screwed out of the patch because they said that they're not gonna be patching for the older systems.
6866000	6876000	But you will get a 100% experience boost for the whole week. On the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the treasure goblin spawn rate will be doubled.
6877000	6883000	So you get double trouble when it comes to treasure goblins for the week in celebration of this patch in Diablo III.
6883000	6891000	Hey, music game fans, if you're still following that whole community, Pump It Up 2015, that's gonna be a thing that's happening.
6892000	6908000	Ann DeMuro released a teaser trailer for this game this week where Pump It Up 2015 is gonna be a thing. However, the teaser trailer doesn't really show any features of the game, but it does show some of the artists joining the roster and it is slated for November 2014.
6909000	6911000	I wish Ann DeMuro was putting out DDR games.
6911000	6924000	Yeah, right. But I'm sure Jonas will be back in a future week on the show. In fact, I see him in chat right now. What's up? And he can fill us in on all the new features, which maybe we'll know more about Pump It Up because I know he's still playing that.
6925000	6926000	Let's see, Dark Sakura.
6927000	6937000	Well, in other news, how about a little big Planet 3 stuff? It's getting a new voice actor added to the roster as the main baddie for that. You get Hugh Laurie. How's that sound?
6938000	6939000	Yes.
6939000	6950000	Only if he says at some point, let's say my character falls down a pit or gets hit or something, he says it's not Lupus. It's the only way I'm gonna accept Hugh Laurie in the game.
6951000	6971000	Well, in other news, we have stuff about Hatsune Miku this year. Not only that Nomura Tetsuya made a version of her during a New York Ark exhibition that you can actually see running through October 19th, she was also on David Letterman.
6972000	6973000	Did you see it?
6974000	6975000	No, I didn't.
6975000	6982000	I saw it and it was super awkward. I'm sorry. It was so weird. J. V. Martin, are you a Hatsune Miku person?
6983000	6984000	He's the one that gave me my wall scroll.
6985000	6987000	I'm indifferent. I'm not a hater, but I'm not like, oh my god.
6988000	6995000	Yeah, I don't hate Hatsune Miku and actually the game is really fun, so I want to make that clear. It's just the whole scene on David Letterman. I was just like, this is so weird.
6996000	7004000	Sorry, guys. I know some of you are into it, but I was just like, this is the weirdest. The hologram just looked like a projection to me. It didn't look right.
7005000	7007000	The gorilla stuff, it looks the same way.
7008000	7012000	The gorilla stuff I have seen before, but it didn't look like that on Letterman. Granted, it probably had to be condensed.
7013000	7015000	I'm sure it looks better in person than on TV.
7016000	7017000	It probably does.
7018000	7030000	When I was borrowing those Hatsune Miku games, instead of one of the games, I actually got a concert DVD instead. It looked really good on the stage. I'm sure it would be just fine.
7030000	7036000	Some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. DarkTit Studio says, yeah, I'm not sure Dave got it TBH.
7037000	7044000	And Act F says, yeah, it was awkward. Sayao says, the audio was bad on Letterman. And Fifth Dream says, yeah, and the stage composition. I bet that stage.
7045000	7051000	Because everything looks bigger on TV, but in reality, Letterman's studio is probably not much bigger than the studio we do OLR in.
7052000	7054000	It's smaller than it looks like on TV.
7055000	7059000	Price is Right is like a small movie theater. It's tiny.
7060000	7073000	In other news, we have word from Obama urging the FCC to ban Fast Lanes and saying that he is unequivocally committed to net neutrality, so thanks Obama.
7074000	7076000	We can say unironically, thanks Obama.
7077000	7081000	I will not ever do the ironic thanks Obama, but in this case, I'm doing it completely unironically.
7081000	7085000	Just because I think that that's a meme that needs to die.
7086000	7097000	I like some of the gif files that people produce of that though, like from the really bad infomercials of like the woman that like drops all the Tupperware that falls on her and it just comes up and says, thanks Obama.
7098000	7104000	I'll tell you why it needs to die is because keep in mind how many people I know in Alabama.
7104000	7110000	And my family, and they still legitimately say that to everything that they don't like in government.
7111000	7115000	I know some people take it one step too far, but if you put the funny spin on it, I think it's great.
7116000	7119000	When you see it every day and people are not being ironic about it, it tends to get a little old.
7120000	7121000	You need to learn about the mute feature on Facebook.
7122000	7127000	You know what, you need to have it sitting, I bet, never mind, no one needs to sit in a room with my mom when she gets political.
7128000	7130000	That's a fate you don't wish on anyone, right?
7131000	7132000	I don't even wish it on me.
7132000	7140000	Well, you know what, we're going to sit in a virtual room with our listeners as we travel to our Facebook and Google Plus page and ask the foogle question of the week.
7147000	7153000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and of course we slam those words together, you get foogle.
7154000	7157000	I think that was you that asked earlier, what's a foogle? What the hell is that?
7157000	7164000	There it is. Here it is. So tonight, in honor of our guest, because I always like to do questions when I can that are kind of based around the guest.
7165000	7174000	Last week we had pinball, which by the way, follow up to that if you didn't see, the Addams Family pinball Kickstarter was a success, so that is going to happen.
7175000	7180000	I like to think we helped a little bit with that, but no, in all seriousness, they did make it, so we are going to get the Addams Family table.
7180000	7190000	Anyway, but that was last week. This week we had Bodhi of course from Lunar Ray Games earlier in the show, so we wanted to ask, what is your favorite new school, old school game?
7191000	7198000	Because, you know, Time Spinner is a new school game, but it definitely draws influences from Star Ocean, Symphony of the Night, Mega Man X.
7199000	7203000	So what is your favorite new game that has the feel of an old classic and why?
7204000	7206000	And I'll let you guys here in the studio answer this too, but first let's go to the listeners.
7206000	7215000	So over on Facebook, one of my favorite nicknames, William Murderface says, you like that Princess Irene, William Murderface?
7216000	7217000	Such a good show too.
7218000	7230000	It is. William Murderface says, I would have to say The First Witcher. It kind of feels like you're playing an old Neverwinter game with some elements of Diablo, a great story, and for the first time, somewhat innovative combat system.
7230000	7240000	You know, I'm not familiar with the Witcher series, but I was really impressed with what I saw of Witcher 3 at E3, specifically the art direction and the way the story was being told.
7241000	7249000	I was like, this is going to fill in a big gap for some like Skyrim and Oblivion, what the hell, Elder Scrolls. Why couldn't I think of that?
7250000	7251000	For Elder Scrolls fans, I feel like that's going to fill in a gap.
7251000	7260000	Anyway, Hitstun says, this is my favorite trend in video games. I love developers that revisit 90s gameplay styles with the design sensibilities we've learned in the past two decades.
7261000	7270000	I still want to play Freedom Planet, a new 2D mascot platformer on PC that got its start as a Sonic the Hedgehog fan game, and it shows.
7271000	7281000	Elliot B says, I loved Anodyne. I hope I said that right. Anodyne, which is a super creepy tribute to A Link to the Past. It's all framed in a Game Boy style square format.
7282000	7284000	Bonus answer, Super Time Force is great too.
7285000	7295000	SSG100Matt says, I played the hell out of Shadow Complex when it came out a while ago. The game was heavily inspired by Super Metroid, and it ultimately went on to inspire other similar styled games, i.e. The Swapper.
7296000	7306000	And Jonas replied and said, Rogue Legacy, that old school feeling of Metroidvania with randomized dungeons. Unpredictable and challenging every time you enter the dungeon.
7307000	7321000	Over on Google+, we had a few answers. And Act F says, Shovel Knight is probably the best new old game. It has all the stuff that made all the NES games great, stuffed into a fantastic game. Dust and Elysian Tail comes close too.
7322000	7329000	Tom W also said, Rogue Legacy, with the old feel of PS1 and GBA Castlevania games with a roguelike twist to modern conventions.
7330000	7335000	Reddertainment says, Does it count if Forza Horizon 2 reminds me a lot of Burnout Paradise?
7336000	7341000	Well, I don't know if Burnout is classic yet, but I guess it's getting there. Close enough.
7342000	7360000	And lastly, Josh Wai replies on Google and says, I find I'm very impressed by the Terry Cavana games VVVVVVVV and Super Hexagon. Of the former, my proudest moment was completing Veni Vindivici after literally days of trying.
7360000	7366000	That was a very hard-boarded VVVVVV and I loved VVVVVVVV. That game was amazing.
7367000	7373000	What about you guys? Your favorite new old game? Anybody? Don't all jump at once. Logie?
7374000	7375000	Cave Story?
7376000	7379000	Okay, good. Cave Story. And they kind of redid Cave Story several times.
7380000	7381000	Yeah, that was pretty good.
7382000	7383000	It's kind of meta there a little bit. Piper, you have an answer over there?
7384000	7396000	I had two. One that's kind of upcoming. I loved Guacamelee! recently, which is brilliant. I found myself just living Metroid through a lucha, which was all I wanted in life.
7397000	7400000	And the music is so fucking good in that game.
7401000	7408000	It is. And if you're looking closely, there's nothing but hundreds and hundreds of love notes to games in the past.
7408000	7414000	Yeah, all the memes and shit too. Like when you're in the towns, there's like Grumpy Cat and shit show up and it's great.
7415000	7423000	It's incredible. And then I love Myst clones for a reason. They're all live. They're not panel-based anymore, but Dear Esther was great. I'm looking forward to The Witness by Jonathan Blow.
7424000	7432000	They'll be similar. They're kind of puzzle-based like that. Or I guess they're kind of slower-paced portals without the physics-based puzzle in it.
7433000	7435000	Did you play Gone Home at all? Random question?
7435000	7438000	I have not. That's next to my list because people said it was good.
7439000	7443000	Yeah, it was very good. Very good. Princess Irene? I don't know if you have one?
7444000	7445000	Time spinner, duh.
7446000	7447000	Good answer.
7448000	7450000	Hold on. Are you on the payroll of that guy's company?
7451000	7453000	I should be voting no.
7454000	7457000	We've got to make sure we're ethical or we're not getting a lot of trouble.
7458000	7459000	Right.
7460000	7461000	JV1?
7462000	7463000	Super Time Force?
7463000	7466000	Somebody mentioned that in a Facebook comment too. What do you like about it?
7467000	7475000	It's kind of contra-ish because it's kind of just running and gunning. But then if you fuck up, you can just rewind and redo the level.
7476000	7484000	The humor is just very amusing. It'll just show up into a new time zone. It's like, time, your birthday, place, your mom.
7487000	7488000	Jamie, anything that comes to mind for you?
7489000	7490000	I'll say To The Moon.
7490000	7491000	Oh, okay.
7492000	7498000	That one is probably... And I like it because it's pure story. It's just pure story with a little bit of puzzle in it and the puzzles aren't terrible.
7499000	7509000	I honestly could do without the puzzle parts just because I love going through the whole story of it and I sadly had to put it aside for a lot of work and a bunch of other stuff that's coming on.
7510000	7513000	But as soon as we move, it's actually back up on the top of my list to finish.
7514000	7515000	Nice.
7516000	7517000	I have already had sob fests.
7518000	7519000	I was going to say, get the Kleenex.
7520000	7526000	Even in the first two sections of the game, I was like, that's so sad. The feels.
7527000	7529000	And of course, hot duffel boyfriend.
7530000	7532000	It's a dating sim, visual novel.
7533000	7534000	That's old school, but pigeons.
7535000	7539000	I thought of an answer that nobody's mentioned yet, even though it's kind of cheating. The new DuckTales game.
7540000	7541000	That's totally cheating.
7542000	7543000	Which is kind of.
7544000	7549000	Here's the thing. The only thing that really bugged me about the new DuckTales game, you might remember way back in my review, was the frickin' cut scenes.
7550000	7552000	Did we ever get away to skip... I don't know.
7553000	7555000	You press pause and you can hit skip movie.
7556000	7560000	Does it? I actually remember the first time I played through it, you couldn't do it. It annoyed the hell out of me.
7561000	7566000	But the new DuckTales was still very, very, very well done, so I was happy with that.
7566000	7570000	Alright, let us get back into some news. Thanks, you guys, for the answers.
7571000	7578000	And again, if you want to answer in a future week, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
7579000	7583000	Let's get back into some news and then we'll get to your calls and the mailbag and all that good stuff.
7584000	7585000	So, Loki, what do you got for us?
7586000	7587000	Oh, my eyes and how they roll.
7588000	7595000	So, you may remember back when we talked a little bit about Lindsay Lohan suing Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive because of...
7596000	7597000	Because she's out of money?
7598000	7613000	Well, yeah, definitely because she's out of money. Because she claimed that her likeness was used in the game for her character, Lacey Jones, which is like some sort of actress that was drinking and doing all sorts of promiscuous stuff and that kind of thing.
7613000	7631000	Well, now she's amended her lawsuit to change the claim. The claim now is not that she's, you know, that character, but in fact, this bikini-clad blonde woman that is on the game disc in promotional art and stuff like that.
7632000	7638000	There is no fucking way that Lindsay Lohan is this person. This person looks nothing like her at all.
7639000	7643000	I took serious issue with this because I thought I had heard something about them modeling her after Kate Upton.
7644000	7655000	Yeah, there is actually a photograph of, I think it was Kate Upton, that is almost in the same pose where they slightly changed some stuff and they kind of based it off of that.
7656000	7671000	So there's no way that this is Lindsay Lohan, but you know what, she's trying to change her plea, you know, her complaint, I guess, so that I guess they can allow for a different type of lawsuit in New York or something like that.
7672000	7678000	Fuck if I know. Obviously, she's not going to win this. There's no way in hell.
7678000	7686000	There is only one way to settle this. There's only one way this can probably be settled and that is Judge Judy has to do it. Come on, America. Come on, we want to see this.
7687000	7690000	Judge Judy has to sell this because you all want to see Judge Judy just rip into Lindsay Lohan.
7691000	7692000	Does she still work?
7693000	7696000	Judge Judy? Oh, God, she's still like the number one syndicated show on TV. She's bigger than Oprah.
7697000	7698000	Okay.
7699000	7700000	I know, right? Who knew?
7701000	7702000	Fuck me, you're right.
7703000	7711000	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com explicit or Jonas says Lilo fucking sues everything and she loses because of how bad her points are.
7712000	7723000	She sued Pitbull for using her name.
7724000	7725000	Well, thank you.
7726000	7730000	Thank you for the Lilo update. I didn't realize that Jonas was the go-to guy for my Lilo news.
7730000	7733000	I didn't realize Lilo was a thing.
7734000	7735000	Yeah, J-Lo.
7736000	7739000	There's no way. I mean, seriously, is this going to go into...
7740000	7741000	You just call me RO.
7742000	7750000	All the judge has to do is look at the picture, look at her, look at the picture, look at her and go, are you fucking kidding? Out? Seriously, there's...
7751000	7752000	In her prime...
7755000	7759000	No, not even in her prime would she look like this person. I mean...
7760000	7764000	I've seen the Playboy photos. There is no fucking way that she looks like this person.
7765000	7769000	I feel like you're suddenly our expert here in studio. Well, I've seen the photos.
7770000	7774000	There is literally no way that she looks like this person and definitely not now.
7775000	7776000	Fuck, no, not now. She just...
7779000	7780000	Is she going to sue Droopy Talk?
7781000	7784000	Are you this person in the game or are you this person? Because you know what?
7785000	7789000	I'm starting to think that, you know, you're based off of maybe a different character in the game, you know?
7790000	7793000	She certainly is based off of a character.
7794000	7799000	You know what? Lindsay, if you're listening to us, we have some advice for you. Stop.
7800000	7801000	Stop listening to us?
7802000	7807000	No, no, no, no. Just everything else that you think is a good idea, stop.
7808000	7816000	She would have had a better chance of arguing that she was based off of the character Trevor Phillips in Grand Theft Auto 5 versus, you know, this bikini model.
7817000	7818000	Because she's up on meth or whatever.
7818000	7824000	Suddenly I have this image of Lindsay Lohan lying in her bed with headphones on listening to O.L.R. and just a single tear falling down her face.
7825000	7827000	The people in Sacramento.
7828000	7830000	You would file a lawsuit against us for using her name.
7831000	7832000	For the record, Lindsay, I've never seen Mean Girls.
7833000	7842000	Okay, I know, I know, I know. I will see it at some point, but I still like that I can use that right now.
7843000	7844000	Hey, she was hot.
7845000	7850000	You say that on the week of the 10 year anniversary. Why don't you just pull down your pants and poop on it?
7851000	7857000	Because that means that after I'm done playing Hot to Full Boyfriend on Tuesday, someone has to bring the movie over.
7858000	7864000	She was hot pre-drugs. I mean, it's just after the drug thing, it just kind of went downhill. But before that, she had it going on.
7865000	7872000	That should be the new FBI warning that shows up on video games. Like, warning. Winners don't do drugs.
7872000	7874000	Warning, Lindsay Lohan was hot before drugs.
7875000	7877000	But Lindsay Lohan did.
7878000	7886000	I listen to the Kevin Smith podcast and they have a little jingle so they don't get sued. It's just the beginning of Desperado.
7887000	7894000	But they had somebody write in that said, Lindsay Lohan, why don't you come to your senses?
7895000	7896000	And then it just ends.
7897000	7900000	Every time I hear her name, I think that just goes straight through my head.
7901000	7906000	Rama in chat says, Mean Girls was better when it was called Heathers. Hey, look, I love Heathers too, but they are different.
7907000	7908000	Heathers is great.
7909000	7914000	Heathers was a very dark comedy. Mean Girls is like Tina Fey, which is like her own brand of comedy because she's so great.
7915000	7918000	30 Rock, all that. Like, if Tina Fey touches it, I'll probably see it.
7919000	7920000	But Heathers was awesome.
7921000	7924000	Explicit says same. Haven't seen the Mean Girls either.
7925000	7928000	Okay, do I have to have like a movie night here at Studio OLR? Because I think I do.
7929000	7930000	Right now.
7931000	7932000	I have to work in the morning.
7933000	7934000	Alright.
7935000	7936000	Goodnight everybody.
7937000	7940000	Goodnight everybody because this is so not fetch right now.
7941000	7953000	Okay, so she claims because she's worn a bikini that happens to be red and a hat that she is this person that's in the picture because this person has a hat on and in a different picture has a red bikini.
7954000	7955000	That's a different girl.
7955000	7957000	The other one was holding an iPhone or an Apple phone.
7958000	7963000	Alright, the Multitap Podcast will be back during the holiday season to do their rendition of Jingle Bell Rock.
7964000	7965000	So everybody look forward to that, just so you guys know.
7966000	7967000	Who are you with?
7968000	7970000	I thought you saw Mean Girls. You don't get a Jingle Bell Rock.
7971000	7972000	You're a liar.
7973000	7982000	Alright, moving on. Let's talk about Square Enix and their own lawsuit, although they are actually the ones suing SNK Playmore.
7982000	7985000	And this is because of copyright infringement accusations.
7986000	7988000	This is actually, okay, so here's the thing.
7989000	7996000	SNK sued Square Enix in May claiming that they used copyrighted SNK characters without permission in High School Girl.
7997000	7998000	This is a manga series.
7999000	8006000	SNK said that characters from the King of Fighters and Samurai Shodown were used over a hundred times and there was no permission for this.
8007000	8010000	So police collected evidence in August from Square Enix's offices.
8010000	8012000	What the hell kind of investigation does that look like?
8013000	8015000	We're here to investigate High School Girls?
8016000	8017000	Alright.
8018000	8020000	So anyway, Square Enix has been cooperating with the law.
8021000	8030000	Well now they are seeking an authoritative opinion from the Osaka District Court to determine that it is not infringed on SNK copyright and it will prove the point through several procedures.
8031000	8035000	So, sorry, not like a lawsuit in the sense that, you know, again this will end up in Judge Judy.
8035000	8041000	But basically, telling the judge to say, no, you shut up. No, you shut up. No, you shut up.
8042000	8044000	And then Judge Judy's like, y'all shut the fuck up.
8045000	8047000	That's right, why don't you both shut up. You're both dumb.
8048000	8052000	Which characters did they rip off of, allegedly?
8053000	8054000	I don't know.
8055000	8061000	They didn't rip off any character, or what was it? Well, I remember the SNK one originally was because they were playing Neo Geo in the comics.
8062000	8063000	Oh, what? That's dumb.
8063000	8069000	And I guess because they had, you know, the Neo Geo stuff in there and I guess they were playing King of Fighters that they referred to the characters in the comic.
8070000	8071000	Okay.
8072000	8073000	I don't know.
8074000	8075000	That's silly.
8076000	8077000	Shouldn't they be happy for free advertising?
8078000	8079000	No.
8080000	8081000	Are they even, like, really selling anything, though?
8082000	8083000	That might be why they need money.
8084000	8085000	Yeah.
8086000	8087000	Anyway, Dar Tetsuya in chat says, now there's an episode of Law and Order I'd like to see.
8088000	8089000	Aw, that's what I need on my sound effects board.
8090000	8091000	Bong bong.
8092000	8093000	Okay. Sorry.
8094000	8095000	They go back once again to, you know, the Lindsay Lohan thing.
8096000	8097000	Come on!
8098000	8104000	No, it's hilarious, though, because in there was in there one of their pieces of evidence.
8105000	8108000	If you type in Lindsay Lohan GTA 5, it pulls up the picture of that woman.
8109000	8115000	The second picture that's in there is of the actual picture that they based that picture off of.
8116000	8121000	And they also think that, you know, they'll see this character is Lacey Jonas or whatever in the thing.
8122000	8125000	That character that's a Bikini Mall is not that Lacey Jonas character from the game.
8126000	8128000	It's a completely separate person that doesn't even exist.
8129000	8131000	It's just an NPC character that they used.
8132000	8134000	It's like in Grand Theft Auto IV. They have the prostitute on there.
8135000	8137000	That was an NPC character that's not really in the game.
8138000	8139000	Just somebody random you can sleep with and then shoot.
8140000	8141000	Yes.
8142000	8143000	A mascot.
8144000	8145000	All right. Are you done?
8146000	8147000	I'm done. I'm done. I just thought it was funny.
8148000	8151000	Like they've shot holes in their own argument through this evidence that they had.
8152000	8153000	They're like, we don't care. She's paying us.
8154000	8156000	Amanda Bynes hasn't been in any video games, has she?
8157000	8158000	Did they make a video game out of EZA?
8159000	8160000	All right. All right. Moving on.
8161000	8162000	All right. Darzaga.
8163000	8164000	Well, this is actually super cool.
8165000	8169000	There's a journalism school that's actually using a grant to teach journalist game design.
8169000	8183000	By cool, it's interesting. Basically they're using, it's American University School of Communication is using a $250,000 grant from the Knight Foundation for programs to train journalists in game design.
8184000	8192000	So it's called Journalism Leadership Transformation with six positions, three working for journalists and three for journalism students.
8192000	8203000	So they enroll in the game design master's degree program, work in the game lab, and then help organize two different summits in Washington, D.C.
8204000	8215000	So basically it's, I'm not so sure that it's actually journalism, but see that's where it kind of gets me.
8215000	8222000	It's cool that there's going to be a degree program set up for that, but very, I think, odd that it's going to be done through a journalism school.
8223000	8230000	Now, if they had one on how to not report on video games like your Kotaku, then sign me up.
8231000	8232000	I mean, oh, I'm sorry. We already know how.
8233000	8238000	You know, I don't know. It's kind of cool and not so cool.
8238000	8247000	Interesting. Do you think that, I mean, there's obviously, without going too far down this rabbit hole, I just kind of want to step over it and peek in.
8248000	8254000	But do you think, I mean, there's a lot of talk about ethics and game journalism out there. Obviously we know that's a very big issue right now.
8255000	8258000	So, I mean, is there maybe a need for somebody to come in and set like these standards?
8259000	8265000	Because it seems like right now all these websites set their own standards. There's nothing like the AP rule book.
8265000	8275000	Well, and Reuters won't even consider any video game journalistic source as a true source because they don't meet the standards for journalistic integrity.
8276000	8281000	Well, now, I cannot imagine why Reuters would not give the video game community the time of day anyway.
8282000	8290000	Well, no, they said that they don't include it in the list of associated feeds that they use because they don't meet the standards.
8290000	8296000	They said if any single one of them fit the standards for journalistic integrity, they'd be happily included.
8297000	8298000	Like the Wikipedia of journalists.
8299000	8301000	Except Wikipedia typically has better information.
8302000	8312000	Sy Allen Chat has a good suggestion here. How not to be sensationalistic click bait 101. 29 reasons why you're a crappy journalist. Click here to learn more.
8313000	8315000	Only 29. With GIFs. Alright, anyway.
8316000	8318000	Alright, let's move on with some more news. Loki.
8318000	8324000	Alright, so this is kind of cool. I'm actually, you know, interested in purchasing this this way.
8325000	8330000	But Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, they're doing this kind of like what they did with Destiny a little bit, but slightly different.
8331000	8342000	They're having where you buy the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 version of the game and you get the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version for free.
8342000	8349000	And this is if you purchase the game digitally between, I guess, now and March 31st of next year.
8350000	8356000	And if you purchase that, you will not only get, you know, the current Gen 1, but the last Gen 1 as well.
8357000	8367000	And I guess on PlayStation 3, the way it's going to work is it's actually cross-buy, so you can, you know, purchase it that way and be able to play it on both systems.
8367000	8376000	And I think the Xbox 360 one is the same thing. So except they don't have cross-buy, you just get codes for both, which is awesome.
8377000	8383000	I'm, you know, looking forward to that because, you know, eventually I want to get PlayStation 4 with the people I play Call of Duty with.
8384000	8391000	They all have PlayStation 3, so that's awesome. I'm going to pick it up on PS3 and then when I get PS4, I'll play it on PS4.
8391000	8398000	That's really cool to see more and more publishers kind of doing this, especially with the Sun is starting to set on the PS3 and Xbox 360.
8399000	8406000	I mean, especially like next year, I really think next year you might get like one game, one big game, and that's really going to be it.
8407000	8414000	Like the Sun is starting to set on those systems, so, you know, it's nice that they have these upgrades for the people who aren't ready yet.
8414000	8423000	And I mean, even like when we went back to talking to Minecraft, they didn't have to give you the Vita version for free if you had the PlayStation 3 version, but it was cool that they did that.
8424000	8436000	I mean, I like how, you know, that seems to be kind of the norm with some of these digital games, you know, just like the stuff that's released specifically on the PlayStation Network, or even Xbox Live Arcade.
8436000	8450000	But now they've got it where, well actually I don't think they do much cross-buy stuff on Xbox Live, but at least on PlayStation Network though, now they're doing it with, you know, actual disc release games and stuff like that where you can get cross-buy stuff.
8451000	8458000	It would have been awesome if they did it with like Forza Horizon 2. I would have purchased it on 360 digitally if I got the Xbox One version.
8459000	8460000	Me too, absolutely.
8461000	8469000	Because I'll get an Xbox One at some point because I'm a consumer whore, but, like, it's probably just not going to happen. With all the conventions and shit this holiday, it's probably just not going to happen.
8470000	8475000	Which, speaking of conventions, I want to make sure we throw it out here at some point because somehow this completely missed our show roll tonight, like, oops.
8476000	8483000	But it was just announced a couple days ago, Sony's going to be having their own little expo show, the PlayStation Experience.
8483000	8490000	I'm sorry, I don't have the story in front of me, so I don't remember what the name of it was, but it's going to be the first weekend of December in Las Vegas.
8491000	8497000	We don't know a whole lot more about it yet, we just know it is going to cost money to go to. I think they were saying $90 for a two-day pass, something like that.
8498000	8500000	It's BlizzCon, essentially, but it's Sony.
8501000	8503000	Real quick, what do you guys kind of think about that?
8504000	8507000	I, it's, I don't know.
8508000	8510000	There'll be less to do, there'll be no cosplay, and no bonus Murloc.
8510000	8518000	Then BlizzCon? I don't know, I mean, Sony could also just be like, here's your chance to play the Morpheus before anyone else.
8519000	8527000	I could see, Sony could do a pretty decent grab bag of stuff, you know, they might have like a little big planet costume that only the convention goers can get.
8528000	8533000	There's similar things they can do that BlizzCon does, I don't know, it'd just be interesting.
8533000	8542000	I kind of wish we got more notice, because I'm sitting here going, well, if I wasn't going to Vegas, like, literally, like two months before this, then maybe I'd do it back to back.
8543000	8550000	I don't know, I still might, if I can make work, kind of work, I kind of want, maybe, we'll see, I have to hear more about what's going to be there, you know?
8551000	8557000	So, anyway, sorry, not to deviate too much, here's the story I really want to talk about, and that is about, you know, what's going on with Capcom,
8557000	8563000	and maybe some reasons why some of the games we want to be seeing out of Capcom are not happening.
8564000	8571000	And this is in an interview with gaming publication Famitsu, Yoshinori Ono from Capcom said this, quote,
8572000	8578000	If a game doesn't sell over two million copies, then we'd have to put the brakes on any plans for a sequel.
8579000	8583000	All that means is we weren't capable enough, and all we can do after that is reflect on the experience,
8583000	8587000	take what we can learn from it, and try to apply those lessons on some other title.
8588000	8594000	So, in other words, if your AAA title at Capcom doesn't sell over two million copies, no sequel.
8595000	8601000	Which, maybe this explains why suddenly we're not seeing a lot of the franchises we wish we were seeing out of Capcom.
8602000	8603000	Thoughts on hearing this?
8604000	8610000	This feels like the, was it Crystal Dynamics recently that did the Tomb Raider, and they were ultra disappointed.
8611000	8617000	I think it was under six million sales, so they were talking about not making, which I think they're making a sequel to now,
8618000	8620000	but they were talking about not doing it because they considered that a critical failure.
8621000	8626000	To be fair, I believe Square Enix had made the comment in that, because Crystal D was the developer,
8627000	8629000	and then Square Enix was the publisher, and I think the Square Enix guy made the comment,
8630000	8633000	but then through all the Steam sales and all this other stuff, you know, Tomb Raider,
8634000	8639000	I think they said, they came out later and somebody there had said, it's in the black, it made money,
8640000	8645000	to kind of dispel the damage that had been done by the other comments, you know?
8646000	8651000	But then, yeah, now we see that Microsoft obviously chipped in a pretty hefty amount of money to make the sequel happen,
8652000	8655000	because they're getting the exclusive window or whatever, so.
8656000	8661000	I think that Capcom doesn't really have room to be choosy right now,
8662000	8665000	because how many fucking franchises do they have that they're actually putting out stuff for?
8666000	8671000	Well, here's my thought too, is that in the film industry, sometimes you have direct-to-video sequels,
8672000	8678000	and they're intentionally low-budget because, you know, that they're not maybe going to make as much money as the first one did,
8679000	8683000	so I kind of question, like, I thought the Mega Man game that they were doing,
8684000	8686000	Mega Man Universe or whatever at one point was supposed to be like a DLC,
8686000	8691000	or, sorry, not DLC, but online-only, marketplace-only, digital title,
8692000	8696000	that was supposed to be kind of like a smaller thing, maybe got too big, I don't know,
8697000	8700000	but I kind of go, well, that's like a direct-to-video sequel in a way.
8701000	8705000	Well, I remember seeing a chart from them at one time, it was like eight core franchises that they had,
8706000	8712000	and it was, you know, Lost Planet, Dead Rising, Dead or Alive, Street Fighter,
8712000	8721000	well, I think they actually listed Street Fighter IV, Monster Hunter, I guess, in Japan.
8722000	8726000	I'm trying to think of what the other ones would be, Resident Evil.
8727000	8732000	So, I just, they don't have a lot of, I mean, they keep releasing sequels for these things,
8733000	8738000	but they don't have a lot of really brand-new franchises that they're kind of putting out there.
8738000	8741000	I mean, when's the last time we've seen, like, a new franchise from them, aside from,
8742000	8744000	I think Dead Rising was the last thing, or was that Lost Planet that came out?
8745000	8746000	Lost Planet, I think, came out after.
8747000	8752000	That might have been after. No, those were both 2006, because they were at the E3 demo thing, I think.
8753000	8757000	Weren't they demoing a free-to-play PlayStation 4 title, wasn't that Capcom,
8758000	8760000	or is that just because it was a familiar face?
8761000	8764000	I want to say there was something deep down, wasn't that it?
8765000	8766000	Oh, maybe. Oh, they had...
8766000	8767000	I thought so.
8768000	8770000	No, they had, what was it, they had an RPG that came out.
8771000	8773000	The Dragon's Dogma, I think, was Capcom.
8774000	8775000	I think that was Capcom.
8776000	8779000	Yeah, Dungeon Buster just brought up Dragon's Dogma in our chat room as well.
8780000	8784000	So, I mean, I don't know, I guess they could do that, I mean,
8785000	8787000	but, once again, I don't know if this is really going to affect a lot of things,
8788000	8794000	since they don't put out a lot of new IPs, it's just kind of, sequels and rehashes, I mean...
8794000	8797000	Deep down is the free-to-play Capcom title, by the way.
8798000	8800000	I guess we just won't get DuckTales 2.
8801000	8807000	Well, or somebody gets the license, like what WayForward did, where they did do DuckTales, so...
8808000	8811000	Alright, anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.
8812000	8816000	Every week you guys email us your thoughts to participate at orangelaungeradio.com,
8817000	8820000	and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag, and hopefully doesn't get too messy,
8820000	8823000	and coded in, you know, all the things that the listeners send to us,
8824000	8827000	but it seems like this week the mailbag was pretty empty, sad face.
8828000	8830000	Yes. So I have all two of them.
8831000	8833000	Oh, there was only one earlier when I looked, so...
8834000	8837000	Well, one of them is, oh my god, how long is this?
8838000	8840000	Alright, whatever, let's just dive in.
8841000	8842000	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
8843000	8847000	I wrote in last week about my roommate's experiences with the educational game making company, Galaxies.
8847000	8851000	You missed this during the show last week, by the way, DarkSakura, just so you know.
8852000	8854000	This is going to be a follow-up email to something that you unfortunately missed,
8855000	8856000	because you had to leave early last week.
8857000	8859000	And how poorly the CEO runs the company.
8860000	8864000	Rob expressed concern rightfully that my secondhand knowledge could be very well fabricated or inaccurate.
8865000	8867000	I appreciate Rob's shrewdness and due diligence as a reporter,
8868000	8869000	and wanted to present some quotes from Glassdoor,
8870000	8873000	a website which allows users to anonymously review their employers,
8873000	8876000	regarding the company, No Kato,
8877000	8882000	which the CEO of Galaxies, Osman Rashid, was CEO of prior to founding Galaxies.
8883000	8887000	The CEO is very intelligent, but too focused on maximizing productivity per employee.
8888000	8892000	Unfortunately, buying Jamba Juice on Thursdays isn't enough to deal with the insane demands.
8893000	8899000	The load on one person is probably equivalent to two or three full-time jobs at a normal company.
8899000	8903000	There's far too much work on everyone's plate. Mistakes happen. People get chewed out.
8904000	8905000	The result is stress and loathing.
8906000	8912000	Another quote, In a typical rush season, the CEO will request that all employees work seven days a week.
8913000	8917000	Many end up working 21 days straight, which is an enormous mental burden for anyone.
8918000	8919000	And illegal.
8920000	8923000	Employees get shredded by overly aggressive managers for mistakes that occur,
8924000	8926000	which are inevitable when you're working 80 plus hours a week.
8926000	8930000	I'm going to skip down to two more quotes.
8931000	8934000	Kiss the time with your family, your family, wife, and kids goodbye.
8935000	8941000	Kind of rough when you are running 110%, 365 days a year, and they pay you below the market rate.
8942000	8946000	Alright, and then this one's a pretty big quote here.
8947000	8951000	Some employees are not even informed during the hiring process about the work environment they might be facing.
8952000	8956000	Employees are forced to cancel their vacation plans for the bad planning of the management,
8957000	8961000	while the management and people related to the management go on vacation anytime.
8962000	8965000	Married employees could go to the brink or into divorce when working at this company.
8966000	8968000	If you have a family, don't even bother applying at this company.
8969000	8974000	Some managers are very bad. They harass on the phone, thinking they don't leave any trail behind for a lawsuit.
8975000	8977000	They advertise on their career section. Take time off is needed,
8977000	8981000	but they will not let you take the time off even when you really need it.
8982000	8986000	So there's pretty good evidence that this guy who started an educational game company,
8987000	8990000	because he was frustrated that his kids didn't have any good educational games to play,
8991000	8993000	does not understand how to run a company or keep people happy in the slightest,
8994000	8996000	and hasn't learned since his previous company.
8997000	8999000	Then again, he's a millionaire and sold his last company to Intel.
9000000	9003000	So as long as there are suckers who will work for him, he'll still get his.
9003000	9011000	However, I find it pretty hard to believe that the end product of galaxies will be more than a middling educational tool with the way the team seems to be led.
9012000	9017000	Sorry for the long email, but as someone who has worked in the game industry previously and values work slash life balance,
9018000	9025000	I wanted to step in and shed some light on what actually goes on behind happy press releases issued by the New York Science Foundation
9026000	9029000	promising rainbows, puppies, and scientific education to children who play this game.
9029000	9034000	Plus, I wanted to give Rob more evidence to corroborate the facts in the email I sent last week.
9035000	9036000	Yours truly is HP.
9037000	9044000	And just to be clear, it's not necessarily that I don't believe you, but I sort of have to so that we don't get sued.
9045000	9049000	It's the same reason why on TV they never say, oh, the murderer did this.
9050000	9057000	They say, allegedly, the alleged murderer did this, so that's why I have to take everything with a grain of salt.
9057000	9063000	I will just say this, very interesting third-party evidence. You make a very strong case.
9064000	9065000	You would do very well on Judge Judy, actually.
9066000	9069000	I posted the link to the no reviews in chat.
9070000	9079000	And, you know, you bring up a very tough issue, and that is even the games that are bad,
9079000	9084000	we know there's a lot of, and I don't, I have not played this game.
9085000	9090000	We only have the, as you said, the rainbows and puppies press release, really, to go off of that took us down the memory lane of educational games.
9091000	9092000	I can't judge the game until it comes out, whatever.
9093000	9095000	But I'm just saying, out there, there are both good games and bad games.
9096000	9106000	And even for the bad games, we hear about that sometimes there are just, you know, horrible conditions for employees to go through to make these games.
9106000	9114000	And it's like, oh my God, there needs to be some, we need ethics there, too. We need ethics in game development.
9115000	9121000	It's just like, you know, your game can wait two more months so that people can have an effing break once in a while, you know?
9122000	9126000	It's just ridiculous. I just think, this is why some games turn out bad.
9127000	9132000	They're rushed, and then these people don't get vacation, and then it affects the final product, you know?
9133000	9138000	But anyway, I could have a whole other tangent dedicated to that, but I'll control myself.
9139000	9140000	Last email.
9141000	9148000	Dear O.L.R., I freaking love Jonas and Diego. They are adorable as fuck, and I love hearing them talk about their experiences with the Smash community.
9149000	9153000	Please bring them back so I can continue to squee all the way from the land of video game happiness, Columbus, Ohio.
9154000	9159000	Love, Oscar. P.S., I'd love to exchange friend codes with you guys. Shoot me a message on Facebook.
9159000	9163000	How much do they pay Oscar to send that email? No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
9164000	9168000	No, they are a lot of fun, and they'll be back again, I know.
9169000	9177000	Just to define this for you, your guys' definition of an empty mailbag is like one to two emails more than MultiTap's mailbag.
9178000	9184000	Well, you know, I'm going to tell you this. Keep in mind, my friend, this is episode number 571 of Orange Launch Radio.
9185000	9186000	We're going to get steppin'.
9186000	9192000	Yeah, I was going to say, Irene was here for episode one. She was here for episode one, so she can tell you.
9193000	9196000	It took a long time before those emails started to come in.
9197000	9202000	We're making 500 of these this weekend. No vacation, no time off, nothing for you.
9203000	9209000	I remember for the first few episodes, for actually a long while, even the amount of listeners.
9210000	9213000	I mean, to be fair, podcasting was still kind of a new thing.
9213000	9215000	It was now. When OLR first started, podcasting didn't exist, really.
9216000	9223000	Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, you're kind of a trailblazer in that sense, but they weren't getting very many listeners, period.
9224000	9226000	We had 12. We had 12 listeners on the first episode.
9227000	9228000	About a dozen listeners.
9229000	9235000	That was through DDR Freak advertising, like mad, and me pimping it on Understation Live, which was the other show I did at the time.
9236000	9239000	And we got 12, and we were like, double digits for episode!
9240000	9250000	We were so fucking excited, and now, thanks to podcasting and iTunes and getting on that wave, we were fortunate enough to get a few more.
9251000	9262000	But yeah, I think consistency is very important. If you're there for the listeners, they'll start to incorporate you into their daily routine and so forth.
9262000	9263000	Sorry, Irene.
9264000	9268000	No, I was going to say, yeah, it takes time to build a listener base and to, you know, get your groove.
9269000	9270000	I'm just trying to encourage you guys as a mailbag.
9271000	9272000	What's that?
9273000	9274000	I'm just trying to encourage you through your mailbag woes.
9275000	9280000	No, we still, even when we only get two emails, we appreciate them very much. So, awesome, awesome.
9281000	9282000	Quality.
9283000	9288000	Well, if you want to send an email, maybe next week we'll get a compliment for our friends from Multitap Podcast, or maybe for JBMon.
9289000	9290000	Maybe next week we will, but we won't be here to read them.
9290000	9296000	Oh, that's right. We'll be here next week to read them. Well, maybe it'll pile up and we'll have four emails and we'll be back in two weeks.
9297000	9298000	I know.
9299000	9301000	And then Rob will have to threaten Kardashian music.
9302000	9307000	That's right. You know what, Piper, did you know that one week on the show, I said, if we don't get four emails, I'm playing music from Kim Kardashian Hollywood during the show.
9308000	9309000	And we did get four emails and Rob played it anyway.
9310000	9311000	And it was glorious.
9312000	9318000	I did because the chatters were like, you're not going to do it. You're not going to, I dare you to do it. I dare you. So, I was like, don't test me. Here we go.
9318000	9324000	And you know what they said? They said, I was expecting it to be a lot worse. The music's actually not bad in that game.
9325000	9326000	It was bad. It was bad.
9327000	9328000	Well, that one doesn't feel bad.
9329000	9330000	All right.
9331000	9335000	Hey, pump it up, people. Not pump it up. The other game that's not DDR.
9336000	9337000	In the groove?
9338000	9342000	In the groove. Yeah. You should do Kardashian music in your game.
9343000	9345000	In the groove, Kim Kardashian edition.
9345000	9346000	In the groove, Kim Kardashian edition.
9347000	9356000	All right. Anyway, this is very random train to go on. All right, let's get to the FUs of the week because also since episode one, we have always done the FUs of the week.
9357000	9367000	Why do we do the FUs of the week on a video game show? Because sometimes we get angry and this is our moment to let it all out of our systems so that we don't rage on some noob on Xbox.
9368000	9369000	Because fuck you, that's why.
9375000	9383000	Here is justice. Here is punishment. This is fucked up.
9384000	9401000	My FU goes towards people who are so absolutely married to their, and I'm using a quoting here, faction that they refuse to remotely give anybody of another ideology a chance.
9402000	9411000	If you are going to be as head in the ground as you accuse your opponents of being, guess what? You're part of the problem.
9412000	9419000	We need to stop dividing lines between people and actually have conversations and be grownups instead of being little children pointing fingers at each other. The end.
9420000	9422000	Well, I'm sorry, Jamie, but for the Horde and that's that.
9423000	9424000	And you're a stinky, poopy head.
9425000	9429000	Well, I just got told. All right. Loki.
9429000	9438000	Um, I guess this FU in my car needed to, well, not even needed to, a valve adjustment that cost five minutes.
9439000	9441000	A valve adjustment sounds like something the guy made up. I'm sorry.
9442000	9450000	No, it's not actually. I researched this in the past when I was having problems and it's just, it's something that Honda fits need after they get to about, you know, the mileage they have.
9451000	9452000	And it's just the only, it wouldn't be that.
9453000	9456000	You're laughing, but it's true. They fucking do that shit where they just make up.
9456000	9461000	You're low on the exam of Elvis. Hello. You're low on blinker fluid.
9462000	9470000	Unfortunately, it's just because it takes, they had, it's in the manifold and they have to disassemble like part of the engine that it takes three and a half hours to do that.
9471000	9474000	So that it's all labor. Thank you. Labor being so expensive.
9475000	9476000	All right. Good health ain't cheap. All right.
9477000	9482000	Let's see. My FU of the week goes to a couple of things. They both have to do with the show I was doing last night.
9482000	9489000	So my character, I had to wear a lot of makeup for my character last night and like most of it came off, but the fricking eyeliner will not come off.
9490000	9491000	And it looks, I just looked like an emo kid today.
9492000	9494000	You know, if you had told me this, I would have brought my makeup over.
9495000	9499000	I don't, I believe me, I've scrubbed with like Cetaphil and all that stuff like over and over. Like this stuff will not come off.
9500000	9501000	Rob, admit it. You look fabulous.
9502000	9510000	I know, but I look like I'm like going to go to a fallout boy concert or something. I just don't, it's not, sorry to all the fans out there, but it's just like, this isn't really my look.
9510000	9517000	I just look really tired. I don't know. Anyway, uh, let's go to our guests. JV Mon, you have some FUs of the week you want to get out?
9518000	9526000	Uh, FUs of the landlord of the store I work at because he's not renewing the lease because reasons. So as of February, I'll be out of a job.
9527000	9532000	And this is the second time that this has happened to me last year because I work for FYI. I don't care.
9533000	9540000	The story I worked at in Westchester last year, they closed down because the landlord's like, fuck you, we're not renewing the lease. You've been there 20 years, no one cares.
9541000	9545000	So I got transferred back to the store in the Bronx and now the landlord there is doing the exact same thing.
9546000	9547000	That's what FYE stands for, right? Fuck you, eh?
9548000	9549000	Pretty much.
9553000	9556000	I don't think a FYE is from Canada. Okay.
9557000	9565000	And fuck you to Alamo Car Rental because when I went to get my car on Friday, I had to wait about 40 minutes to get registered.
9566000	9572000	And then they made us wait outside because they had no cars, but they were still taking registration for more cars.
9573000	9581000	And I was kind of like, oh, a car just came back. Quick, get in and run. And it's just like, I haven't had coffee in like five hours and I'm crazy.
9582000	9584000	And they don't have Dunkin Donuts here, so I don't know what you're going to do.
9584000	9586000	Starbucks? They have Starbucks.
9587000	9592000	Alright, moving on. How about Piper? You got some FUs of the Week you want to get out here? Something to make you Yanksty?
9593000	9594000	Does it have to be personal or can it be like famous names?
9595000	9596000	You can do whatever you want it to be.
9597000	9599000	I've got three quick ones. Fuck you Lindsay Lohan, you know why.
9600000	9602000	You know what you did.
9603000	9609000	Fuck you Phil Fish, I'm still mad and Bodily is like way better. I'm not even being professional now, Bodily is cooler than you.
9609000	9615000	And fuck you whoever assembled my 3DS. I want it back and I still hate you.
9616000	9620000	Alright, you got to follow that Princess Irene, last but not least.
9621000	9635000	Um, fuck you to my cat. Because he's a dick. He keeps knocking over my digital frame and I just want to punch him in his little cat nose. Because he's a jerk.
9636000	9645000	Yes, I am cruel to my cat. Aww, not really. And then an ambiguous generic fuck you to school related things.
9646000	9648000	Alright. And that's it. Very ambiguous.
9649000	9650000	Yeah, no one or a thing in particular.
9651000	9656000	Act Deft by the way, who is our Mexican listener. One of our Mexican listeners. We have a couple.
9657000	9658000	Just the one.
9659000	9665000	Just the one. But no, he's been here like every week for a very long time. So we kind of call him the one in Mexico.
9666000	9669000	But Act Deft for FYE says fuck you SA.
9671000	9672000	So there you go.
9673000	9677000	Somewhere between fuck you A and fuck you SA.
9678000	9679000	Fuck you SA.
9681000	9682000	Two levels.
9683000	9684000	That's deep man.
9685000	9686000	At least it's not like fuck your eggs.
9687000	9690000	Alan Alchemy in chat says, OLR debuting the new Fall Out Boy single.
9691000	9694000	Quote, if you think this podcast is long you should see the reasons I'm breaking up with you.
9697000	9700000	That totally sounds like a Fall Out Boy song.
9701000	9706000	God, are they the ones that have that song? Like there's a song on the radio right now and I swear it sounds like Fall Out Boy is one of those bands.
9707000	9709000	But it samples like Tom Diner. Tom Steiner. Do you remember?
9710000	9711000	I think it is.
9712000	9714000	Oh my God. I got so angry when I heard that the first time because like, you know, I'm hearing it.
9718000	9722000	And I'm like, oh fuck yeah, it's Suzanne Vega. And then it's like, I'm so mad.
9724000	9727000	And I'm like, what did they do to Tom Steiner?
9728000	9732000	At least you don't have to hear it about 50 times a day at work because it's on our audio loop at work.
9733000	9735000	So I hear it about 50 times a shift.
9736000	9740000	And every time I get fooled because I'm like, yeah, Tom Steiner. Wait, no, I should know better by now.
9741000	9744000	Oh my God. If I had to go through that, fuck yeah, euthanasia.
9747000	9749000	I don't know. I don't know. Alright.
9751000	9755000	Anyway, we just got a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to open up the phones for you to call.
9756000	9761000	Yay. Tell us we're pretty. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Or maybe you have a question and you want to talk about something else in games.
9762000	9765000	You can look into our eyes longingly. Except you can't because we don't have a cam.
9766000	9771000	Yay. 2-800-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. But first, two more stories here. Loki.
9772000	9782000	So, since I was so excited about Forza Horizon 2, I'm a little disappointed that for whatever reason, I guess it's because they really want you to buy an Xbox One.
9783000	9788000	All the DLC that they're releasing for Forza Horizon 2 is only for the Xbox One.
9789000	9794000	The Xbox 360 version, not even part of the Forza rewards program thing that they have.
9796000	9804000	They basically just said, hey, we're currently planning to release DLC only for the Xbox One version of Forza Horizon 2.
9805000	9809000	Also, Forza rewards benefits are only available on the Xbox One version of Forza Horizon 2.
9810000	9814000	This means that Xbox 360 players will not receive Forza rewards credits or cars.
9815000	9821000	And they said progress in the 360 version of Forza Horizon 2 does not count towards your Forza reward tier level score.
9821000	9829000	Only progress in the Xbox One version of Forza Horizon 2 will count towards your overall Forza score and tier level and Forza rewards.
9830000	9831000	Yeah. Fuck you guys.
9832000	9839000	Thanks a lot, you know. It is your own fucking console. It's a first party game and you're not even supporting that shit.
9840000	9846000	You know how many people have an Xbox 360? It's like significantly more than have an Xbox One.
9847000	9849000	You're not going to win people over this way.
9849000	9850000	Yeah.
9851000	9856000	Like I want to get Forza Horizon 2, but you're right. All this stuff I'm hearing about how basically the 360 version is kind of gimped.
9857000	9859000	I'm like, well then I need to hold out until I have an Xbox One whenever that may be.
9860000	9863000	Exactly. And what if they do a game of the year edition later on like they did with Forza Horizon 5.
9864000	9865000	Or Forza 5, no.
9866000	9867000	Or any big game.
9868000	9869000	Alright.
9870000	9873000	Well, some sad news for those of you guys that like your magazines.
9873000	9881000	Like I know Dark Soccer loves her print media, but unfortunately another magazine going away and it's the official Nintendo Magazine in the UK.
9882000	9887000	We'll be shutting down on November 11th. This is announced by Future Publishing and Nintendo.
9888000	9891000	The magazine staff, however, good news, they're going to be shifted to other positions within the company.
9892000	9895000	So at least they're not using the, you know, redundancy. It's the UK, so it's redundancies.
9896000	9905000	Anyhow, from the website, quote, Nintendo will continue to speak directly to fans via Nintendo Direct, our social media, and online channels and public events.
9906000	9911000	Internet, internet, internet, expos. Right? Those are the four things they just said there.
9912000	9919000	So there it is. The unofficial Nintendo UK magazine stopped publishing in 2012, the same year that Nintendo Power ceased operations.
9920000	9926000	So that's unfortunate. The cool thing about this magazine, too, is I've seen some pictures when you stack the magazines all side by side.
9927000	9932000	Like the first hundred or so issues, like the Nintendo logo, and these last few were like a Wii U.
9933000	9935000	So they actually look kind of cool sitting on your shelf.
9936000	9938000	So that, you know, that sucks. That's a bummer.
9939000	9946000	And, you know, I don't know, like it's cool that you can get magazines on your iPad and all, but it's just not the same when sitting on the toilet.
9946000	9952000	It's not the same at all, because you're like, I have this expensive thing in here, and I don't want to get water on it accidentally.
9953000	9957000	All right. Anyway. There it is. Going away.
9958000	9960000	Darsaka, surely you're having a sad about that. I mean, I doubt you.
9961000	9966000	But I never actually read the UK magazine, so I'm slightly indifferent, but print media will always be awesome.
9967000	9970000	You can never digitize the smell of ink.
9971000	9978000	All right. Well, we are going to go to the Skype line, 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9979000	9980000	Let's see if anybody would like to call.
9981000	9983000	You can talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe there's something else you want to bring up.
9984000	9989000	I don't know. But the phones are open now, so let's get to it.
9990000	9995000	While we wait for your calls, let me check with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.
9996000	9997000	I'll bring up Twitter here.
9998000	9999000	Not yet.
10000000	10001000	They're going to do a comic for Valiant Hearts.
10002000	10003000	Are they?
10004000	10009000	I asked iOS game, and the thing that's coming out was it on PlayStation 4 and stuff, so they're doing...
10010000	10014000	Nice. That's right. Didn't the handheld Sony things do like comics? I remember the PSP did.
10015000	10022000	Well, yeah, and this is kind of cool because this is one of the... I think this was using that UBIARD engine, so that looked pretty neat.
10023000	10025000	Nice. All right. Well, we do have some calls coming in, so let's get to it.
10026000	10027000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10028000	10029000	It's Ranma.
10030000	10032000	Hey, everybody. I'm doing good. How is everybody there?
10033000	10036000	It's a full house tonight. We're great. A little hot in here, but you know.
10037000	10038000	Hey, Ranma.
10039000	10041000	You're still a dick, JB Mon.
10042000	10043000	Wait, why are you a dick? What'd you do?
10044000	10045000	For the buff boys comment.
10046000	10047000	Oh.
10048000	10049000	What else?
10050000	10051000	The private conversation on your Facebook that most of our listeners probably won't see. Sorry.
10052000	10054000	What's up, Ranma? To what do we owe this phone call?
10054000	10061000	Well, before we get into that, Rob, I want you to know you've had too much candy. You're not allowed to have any more.
10062000	10064000	But candy's delicious. Why can't I have candy?
10065000	10066000	I suggest I brought some over.
10067000	10073000	You know what? Fuck your rules. I'm eating candy right now. Fuck your rules. Fuck them.
10074000	10077000	Yeah, but that type of candy might get your ass beat, okay?
10078000	10079000	You're not the boss of me.
10080000	10081000	That's not my job.
10081000	10083000	Alright. What else is on your mind, buddy?
10084000	10093000	Oh, I was listening earlier. You were talking about the whole thing about Comic-Cons. I figured let me chime in real quick and give you the meat and potatoes of all of that.
10094000	10095000	Please.
10096000	10112000	See, I didn't go because I can't justify taking a day off of work just to stand eight hours on a line in a comic book shop for a three or four day badge where by the time I get to the front, they're sold out.
10113000	10115000	So that's my main reason for not going.
10116000	10120000	But as you saw, a picture went viral that a friend of mine took about the weapons.
10121000	10129000	Pretty much what was happening was you had a basic set of rules on the website, which did not reflect the rules on the mobile site.
10130000	10143000	So pretty much staff was pretty much confiscating weapons left and right, and people got upset that the confiscate weapons that people have been working on for days, weeks, hours, months, whatever.
10143000	10157000	Which I understand. But if the rules say that the weapons have to be made of cardboard or foam and you go out and start making things out of different materials to kind of make it stand out and they take it, you have no one except yourself but the blank.
10158000	10171000	Now, they were actually throwing them out for a little bit. The next day on Friday, they more or less cleared it up saying, well, if it looks too realistic, you're not going to be able to come into the Javits Center with it.
10171000	10174000	We're going to take it, tag it, and you'll be able to pick it up later.
10177000	10185000	This sounds like a mess, though. Doesn't that make you kind of question the organization of it, though? Especially with these people standing in line for forever. Come on.
10186000	10198000	Who has fun doing that? That pisses me off more than anything. I swear to God, if I go to BlizzCon and I have to stand in line all fucking day to get a badge, I'm going to be pissed right from the get-go after all the money paid for it or whatever.
10199000	10213000	Nothing drives me crazier than that stuff, so why couldn't they figure out a way to do that online and what have you. And then, you know, it's really crappy that they had that miscommunication between online and what have you. So, I don't know, that's kind of frustrating, too.
10214000	10231000	I know, and I've had a couple of staffers contact Comic-Con, and I posted the response emails on my website so people can see what was going on. It's pretty much, like I said, if it looks like a weapon, it will be confiscated, done and done.
10231000	10245000	But, Rob, you're sitting here complaining about what's going on with Comic-Con, which I understand, but I don't know if you know this, but the people that run Comic-Con are the same people that run PAX, so you shouldn't be surprised.
10245000	10264000	Touché. Brad from Pop Culture says, be glad you weren't at previous Dragon Cons. The line there used to be horrible. Yeah, I've heard stories. Yeah, thank God they fixed that up. This year was great. I walked right in. Just took me five minutes. It was awesome.
10265000	10281000	Which is good. I mean, a lot of conventions do that, but I'll admit, when I went to Comic-Con last year for one day, I got there about 10 o'clock that morning. I was in in about 15 minutes, because they kind of spread it out with the checkpoints in the Tap Your Badge.
10281000	10290000	And I guess this morning, yesterday, because it started raining pretty bad, arrows kind of huddled up together, and I'm just like, oh, good thing I'm not going.
10290000	10297000	Yeah, Bob Coffee in our chat says, be glad you weren't at Anime Expo this year. The line of, Line Con of Death. Yeah, I heard stories.
10297000	10310000	Oh, yeah, I kind of toyed with that. I made this meme called Line Con The Game, and it was like, easy, normal, hard, God Mode. I think I put that for God Mode, Anime Expo.
10311000	10322000	Now, the question everybody wants to know is, you know, for all the troubles of standing in line and having weapons confiscated, was there a ball pit to be given an hour in?
10322000	10328000	Um, actually, no. There was no ball pit this year.
10328000	10334000	What a failure of a con. Alright, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Some people might have...
10335000	10344000	Trust me, your sentiments, it's echoed across everybody, and you know how it is, I can't stand this, I'm not going, I'm not going.
10344000	10350000	Monthly, you going to Comic Con? Hell yeah, I'm going! Exactly right, exactly. I'll be back, heck yeah.
10350000	10356000	Alright, Rob, I'm going to let you go to see if we can get some more calls in, but thank you as always, and Anime Jam session Tuesday nights here at VOG.
10356000	10363000	Doing a complete roasting of Comic Con, so bring some food, bring some steaks, bring some marshmallows, the flame is going to be mighty high.
10363000	10367000	And bring some Kahlua. Did you see those marshmallow shots with Kahlua in them?
10367000	10373000	Uh, no, I got something better. What's that? Quickly. Deep fried tequila shots.
10373000	10378000	No, I'm not a tequila person. What? What is this? It sounds amazing.
10378000	10381000	Deep fried tequila shots, yeah. Well, you know they do deep fried Kool-Aid, why not?
10382000	10385000	Why do I not have this in me right now?
10385000	10393000	You bake this, you take Pal Cake, and you cut it up into little blocks, you let the tequila soak in it, and then you deep fry it!
10393000	10396000	And add powdered sugar, just like mom used to make.
10396000	10400000	When you cook it, wouldn't the alcohol boil? Alright, forget it.
10400000	10406000	No, because the Pal Cake soaks so much of it in, and when you deep fry it, it's not it.
10406000	10409000	Alright, this ain't a damn cooking show, we'll talk to you later.
10409000	10413000	That's because Logie didn't bring any bacon!
10413000	10415000	There might have been bacon on that burger.
10415000	10417000	Yeah, it wasn't very good either.
10417000	10419000	Alright. Rama, bye!
10419000	10420000	Bye!
10420000	10422000	Alright, 1877 Game O, L, R.
10422000	10430000	Well, see, that's the thing, I used to get, they had those special triple, third pound burgers or whatever, and then they converted them into their new quarter pounders.
10430000	10435000	And the quarter pounder one, the difference was that they used red onions in it and stuff like that.
10435000	10441000	But now, and there's science, now with white onions! So basically it's a fucking quarter pounder with bacon and they charge extra for it.
10441000	10446000	Well at least it's not those frickin' onions that were dehydrated and shit, that stuff was nasty.
10446000	10452000	The bacon was not good though, it tasted really weird, and the white onions are not good either because they've been sitting there all day long.
10452000	10461000	Actually, true story, you know that that's what makes potato salad go bad is not mayonnaise or the potatoes, it's the onions being set out in the sun.
10462000	10466000	Be very careful if you eat raw onions that have been sitting out. Just sayin'.
10466000	10474000	Well, I will not touch potato salad because of the mayonnaise word, and you all know how I feel about mayonnaise, can't stand it.
10474000	10475000	It's amazing?
10475000	10477000	Mayonnaise!
10477000	10481000	Amazingly barf when I eat it, cause stuff is nasty.
10481000	10483000	And today's opposite day, so you mean it's great.
10483000	10486000	Now I hear there's a potato salad that's made with mustard, I'm okay with that.
10486000	10496000	No wait, when I make potato salad, I actually will use mayonnaise and mustard in it, because mustard will offset sweetness in some of the other ingredients.
10496000	10500000	And it comes out very balanced and very nice, that's how we do it in the south, just sayin'.
10500000	10503000	The way Rob feels about mayonnaise is the way I feel about mustard.
10503000	10507000	I won't eat mustard on its own, cause I hate mustard, but in potato salad.
10507000	10511000	See, it does seem like people are in one camp or the other, like you don't have a lot of people that are both, except Jamie.
10511000	10514000	Mustard is an ingredient, not a condiment.
10514000	10520000	When I make potato salad, I make it with potato, bacon, butter, salt and pepper, and I bake it.
10520000	10522000	Oh wait, that's a big potato.
10524000	10526000	I don't like potato salad.
10526000	10527000	Yeah, Piper?
10527000	10529000	Not just say this isn't a cooking show.
10529000	10531000	I know, right? Well nobody's calling.
10531000	10533000	We always talk about food.
10533000	10537000	You can always talk about potatoes, like I don't care, you know.
10537000	10538000	Never mayonnaise.
10538000	10541000	Does food never come up on multi-tap podcasts? Never ever?
10541000	10542000	I don't know.
10542000	10543000	Microphones.
10543000	10544000	Microphones, don't forget.
10546000	10551000	I have to go back to the backlog. It's all on YouTube, but we have to have talked about food at some point.
10551000	10554000	I'll just have to listen to every episode and find out.
10554000	10556000	There's only like, nine.
10557000	10559000	We talk about alcohol, sometimes.
10559000	10560000	Okay, well there you go.
10560000	10561000	That's a food group.
10561000	10562000	That's a consumable.
10562000	10563000	What about the drunk cast coming up?
10563000	10565000	Oh yeah, we're gonna have a drunk cast coming up.
10565000	10568000	Ah, the days. Ah, the days. The days.
10568000	10571000	Try not to do what I did when you're running up the wall.
10571000	10572000	No, you're lying down.
10572000	10573000	Running up the wall.
10573000	10577000	No, no, yeah. I was lying down, kicking the wall, yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.
10577000	10581000	Keep in mind, this is an episode of OLR that happened, and I was so drunk.
10581000	10583000	And then Jamie went and passed out my bed.
10583000	10588000	I didn't pass out near bed. I was laying there sobering, and then Loki brought me waffles, and I felt better.
10588000	10590000	Yeah, Loki cooked waffles during the show.
10590000	10591000	That's awesome.
10591000	10592000	Why? Why not?
10592000	10596000	And I was sober like five seconds after eating a waffle.
10596000	10597000	That's super bacon.
10598000	10603000	Is it kind of like that one time, Rob, when you got drunk when we had a cast party for Rocky,
10603000	10608000	and you were laying on the ground leaving a voicemail for us, and someone threw a condom on your chest,
10608000	10611000	and you didn't know for like ten minutes that that condom was just sitting there?
10611000	10613000	Yeah, I think that was an understation live voicemail.
10613000	10614000	Was this Rocky or Rocky Horror?
10614000	10615000	Rocky Horror.
10615000	10616000	Yeah.
10616000	10619000	Could you imagine shadowcasting Rocky?
10619000	10621000	Adrian, I love you.
10621000	10623000	Condom dude on my chest, dude.
10624000	10630000	All right. Let's see. Go into some of the tweets that we have.
10630000	10633000	Oh my God, it's ringing. The phone's ringing. Oh my God.
10633000	10634000	Hi, Aaron. Aaron's on his radio. Who's this?
10634000	10635000	Hey, this is Eckdef.
10635000	10637000	Hey, Eckdef. How you doing?
10637000	10639000	Hey, pretty good. Pretty good.
10639000	10645000	I want to make a follow-up to Smash Brothers.
10645000	10647000	You want to make a what of Smash Brothers?
10647000	10648000	A follow-up. Sorry.
10648000	10652000	Oh, a follow-up. Yeah, sure. How has Smash Brothers been treating you this week?
10653000	10655000	Well, it has been pretty good.
10655000	10660000	Yesterday I went to a convention, speaking of,
10660000	10666000	and I entered a tournament with others playing Smash Brothers on the 3DS,
10666000	10672000	and I did pretty well, though here's my probably complaint about the game
10672000	10675000	and probably other people have said about it,
10675000	10681000	but it's an issue, and it's the local multiplayer.
10681000	10686000	It lags really bad in some aspects,
10686000	10693000	and it makes the game a little frustrating to play, even.
10693000	10696000	I have heard this, that Smash multiplayer will get laggy,
10696000	10700000	and I don't know if that's just because maybe the 3DS has an older communication technology in it,
10700000	10704000	or especially at a convention, you probably have a lot of interference.
10704000	10707000	The radio signals or whatever the hell the 3DS is using to communicate,
10707000	10714000	probably it's interfered with everybody's cell phone and credit card systems and the dealer's hall and all this other stuff.
10714000	10719000	Convention is probably one of the worst possible places to play a multiplayer game like that,
10719000	10724000	because I'm sure, especially in Smash, you have a lot of data being transferred back and forth real quick.
10724000	10730000	You guys were just playing a match before the show, Irene. Was it working for you guys?
10730000	10733000	Luxuriously. It was seamless.
10733000	10737000	Right, but that's maybe because we didn't have a lot of interference here going on at the time.
10737000	10742000	It worked beautifully. There were just the two of us, though, so it wasn't a four-player match.
10742000	10748000	You guys have a network in the studio, but there's not a whole lot going on.
10748000	10751000	So I'm assuming it's going to be something like that, technology-based.
10751000	10756000	So that could be a difference at Def, but it still sucks. I'm not trying to make excuses.
10756000	10760000	I'm just trying to be like, oh, this could be the reality.
10760000	10766000	And even then, it wasn't really that bad. It wasn't horrible.
10766000	10773000	But we were playing in some matches, and suddenly it just lagged out of nowhere.
10773000	10778000	But yeah, it was probably that. A lot of interference. A lot of people were playing.
10778000	10784000	There were at least, I think, 30 people playing on the tournament, so yeah.
10784000	10790000	With that many 3DSs, that's got to be an issue right there.
10790000	10792000	Surely there's some type of limitation.
10792000	10796000	But man, all that talk about conventions and playing the 3DS and all that,
10796000	10799000	it makes me miss the days of PictoChat.
10799000	10804000	I know that was an old-school DS thing, but remember penis chat at every convention you'd go to?
10804000	10807000	Oh my gosh. It's not really a thing anymore.
10807000	10812000	We were standing in line at E3 and realizing you were PictoChatting your friend who was two people behind you.
10812000	10817000	Exactly. And all these people you might see on the internet, you're PictoChatting with them,
10817000	10821000	and it's like, hey, here's a penis I drew. Ha ha ha.
10821000	10826000	So, anyway. Explicit in chat agrees with that 30 people is going to be an issue.
10826000	10828000	Well, how was the con otherwise?
10828000	10834000	It was pretty good. It was fantastic. A lot of things happening.
10834000	10842000	Especially in the gaming section. They had some people playing on PCs.
10842000	10846000	There was a Just Dance tournament, too. It was pretty good.
10846000	10850000	Did you get up there and shake your butt to some Just Dance songs?
10850000	10856000	I didn't get to play. I was kind of busy with the Smash tournament and other things,
10856000	10858000	and I sadly couldn't get in.
10858000	10861000	Wait. Did they have board games?
10861000	10863000	Oh yeah. A lot of them, too.
10863000	10870000	There was a section even for card games and board games, too. So yeah, it was a pretty good con.
10870000	10875000	A lot of things to do, but sadly I couldn't do that much.
10875000	10877000	But did they have Jenga?
10877000	10879000	Rob, get the fuck over Jenga.
10879000	10882000	No, I will never get the fuck. Okay, did they have Don't Break the Ice?
10882000	10886000	Okay, that one's legitimate. It's a little legitimate.
10886000	10889000	Remember, we had Don't Break the Jenga.
10889000	10891000	Yeah, Don't Break the Jenga.
10891000	10893000	What con was this?
10893000	10897000	It's Shinigami Fest. It's in Mexicali, Mexico.
10897000	10907000	So yeah, if you live in Southern California, you may visit it next year,
10907000	10911000	but for everyone else, it's going to be far.
10911000	10913000	Might be a little bit far. There you go.
10913000	10917000	Well, Act F, thanks so much for the call. Glad to hear you had a good time at the con.
10917000	10920000	3DS communication troubles outstanding.
10920000	10921000	Yeah.
10921000	10923000	Alright, take care, my friend.
10923000	10924000	Hey, thanks for having me.
10924000	10925000	Yeah, anytime. Bye-bye.
10925000	10926000	Bye.
10926000	10929000	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10929000	10932000	We can maybe squeeze in one more call, although we are running a little bit over,
10932000	10935000	so I do want to try to wrap up with some of these tweets here.
10935000	10937000	So if you want to get in, get in quick.
10937000	10940000	We have some tweets here. We have Alex P. Carson tweeted us saying,
10940000	10944000	Tuned in to OLR after a year-long hiatus.
10944000	10947000	Well, welcome back. Welcome back. Where the hell have you been?
10947000	10950000	I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. Things change.
10950000	10952000	People got other stuff to do and what have you.
10952000	10956000	I mean, you know, Princess Irene hasn't been here for like two years.
10956000	10957000	But seriously, don't leave again.
10957000	10961000	Yeah, I will find you. I'm just kidding. Alright.
10961000	10966000	Let's see. Satura tweeted us saying, and I probably, I always mispronounce your name,
10966000	10969000	and I'm so sorry, but tweeted us a story that says,
10969000	10973000	Sony working diligently, in quotes, on The Last Guardian.
10973000	10979000	Great news. Maybe that's what they're going to fucking get people to pay 90 bucks to go see for two days in Vegas.
10979000	10983000	It's a hoax again, dude. They've been talking about this for a decade and change.
10983000	10984000	Yeah, but...
10984000	10988000	Hey, I'm working diligently on The Last Guardian as well.
10988000	10995000	You know what? Finally, Duke Nukem Forever happened. Final Fantasy XV might actually happen.
10995000	10997000	Do you know, somebody put it in perspective.
10997000	11003000	Final Fantasy XIII versus what it was originally called, right, was announced before the iPhone.
11003000	11004000	Yes.
11004000	11005000	Isn't that crazy?
11005000	11008000	How many systems? Was it just two systems ago?
11008000	11010000	No, it was supposed to be when XIII came out.
11010000	11012000	XIII was early in the life of the PlayStation 3.
11012000	11016000	For a Final Fantasy game, Final Fantasy XIII came out really early in the console's life.
11016000	11018000	I thought they had pushed it because it was originally supposed to be a different one.
11018000	11022000	They had made several in between that, so it was originally supposed to be back a couple of seasons ago.
11022000	11025000	I think you're thinking of Agato, which was supposed to be the PSP one.
11025000	11026000	Agato became Zero.
11026000	11028000	Yeah, yeah. That's the one that changed.
11028000	11032000	But didn't they originally develop XIII for the PS2 and then switched it to the PS3?
11032000	11033000	They might have.
11033000	11039000	That's what I remember reading. It was like, because it took a while for XIII to come out, but that's because they had to switch it from being PS2 to PS3.
11039000	11041000	Could be. That actually would make a lot of sense.
11041000	11046000	But then, you look at Final Fantasy XII, which came out so late in the life, but...
11046000	11047000	So underrated.
11047000	11052000	It's so underrated, and I really hope that's in line to get the HD treatment at some point.
11053000	11056000	One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week, because I didn't get to play a lot of it.
11056000	11059000	But since no other calls are coming in, I'm going to shut down the Skype line.
11059000	11060000	I'll quickly talk about this.
11060000	11063000	Final Fantasy XIII came out on Steam this week, right?
11063000	11066000	So I did download that and check it out a little bit.
11066000	11068000	Oh my god, I needed... Get this.
11068000	11076000	The game is 56 gigs because it has the full English and Japanese audio, which I don't think the PlayStation 3 release had both.
11076000	11080000	But because I downloaded it early, it had to decrypt on my computer.
11080000	11084000	I had to free up 100 gigabytes on my hard drive to install this stupid game.
11084000	11085000	That's ridonculous.
11085000	11093000	And then, no, what's ridonculous is that you can either play in full screen mode, which has the wrong aspect ratio for my monitor, so it's all squished.
11093000	11097000	Or you can play in one resolutioned window, and you can't resize the window.
11097000	11100000	35 gigs of that is devoted to Zaza's hair.
11100000	11105000	But seriously, get the fuck out of here with that lazy fucking port.
11105000	11108000	They already have a hack to change the resolution.
11108000	11111000	So somebody else did Square's job for them, essentially.
11111000	11113000	That is bullshit. Come on.
11113000	11115000	It runs at a higher resolution, but here's the thing, though.
11115000	11119000	It looks like shit because all the cutscenes are still at 720.
11119000	11127000	And on top of that, the LOD textures and stuff are very low res, so it looks like shit when you up-res it.
11127000	11128000	You know what, though?
11128000	11130000	I will say this.
11130000	11138000	In that window, which wasn't the same size as my monitor, but in the window, the game did look really fucking good.
11138000	11142000	Because it runs very smoothly on the PC and so forth.
11142000	11143000	I will give it that.
11143000	11149000	It looked really fucking good, but I was really driven bonkers that I couldn't just make that fill my screen.
11149000	11150000	How fucking hard is that?
11150000	11151000	It's still there. I'm surprised.
11151000	11154000	I mean, I forget. Was it three or four disks?
11154000	11155000	I guess it was four disks.
11155000	11156000	It was four disks.
11157000	11160000	I don't know, but that would still be only, like, 45 gigs.
11160000	11164000	I've been trying to decide whether or not I actually want to get it.
11164000	11167000	I mean, my computer would probably run it really well, but at the same time...
11167000	11169000	I'll take the great assault, what I just gave you.
11169000	11171000	It's like free DLC or something.
11171000	11172000	Wait for a Steam sale.
11172000	11174000	Is Vanille really fucking annoying still?
11174000	11182000	I think Vanille is underrated because a lot of people base their judgment on Final Fantasy XIII off the first ten hours, which I understand.
11182000	11183000	I mean, that's a long fucking investment in the game.
11183000	11184000	Let me rephrase my question.
11184000	11185000	But these characters get better towards the end.
11185000	11187000	Is her voice acting still really fucking annoying?
11187000	11188000	Yes, of course.
11188000	11190000	Well, I just plan on playing it in Japanese anyway.
11190000	11192000	Yeah, play it in Japanese and it'll be less annoying.
11192000	11193000	I don't know.
11193000	11196000	Her Japanese voice actor is kind of annoying too.
11196000	11197000	Hope might be okay.
11197000	11209000	Just to kind of cap on it, I think they did this for Dark Souls 2 or Dark Souls 1 where it had some kind of bullshit resolution thing and some fan made a patch.
11209000	11213000	It was like a 128 kilobyte patch that made the whole game better.
11213000	11215000	So, this happens.
11215000	11216000	Let's see.
11216000	11218000	Alan Alchemy is jumping in saying,
11218000	11225000	Final Fantasy XIII for PC has a nasty bug where you get stutters and pauses if you don't have a USB controller plugged in.
11225000	11227000	Wow, that's crazy.
11227000	11232000	If I put a USB controller in, to be fair, you should be using one, but come the fuck on and that fixed it.
11232000	11236000	So, I'm sorry, this port has some serious problems.
11236000	11243000	And I think for me to buy another square port in the future, I need them to come out and say what they're going to do better next time.
11243000	11247000	I'm not buying anymore of their Steam ports blind.
11247000	11249000	That was a stupid decision on my part.
11249000	11254000	I will be perfectly honest though, I have no problem with fan made mods because, hello, I play Mass Effect.
11254000	11255000	Yeah, I know.
11255000	11265000	And don't get me wrong, I totally embrace the modding community and that's awesome, but when they're having to do the job that the porters should have done, I kind of have a problem with that.
11265000	11269000	So, anyway, not to end on a negative note, but oops.
11269000	11273000	Alright, anyway, no, we have a positive note because we had some great guests on the show tonight.
11273000	11278000	So I want to make sure, quickly, any of the last minute stories, anything, anything, anything, no?
11278000	11280000	Alright, then we'll close up shop here.
11280000	11284000	I want to thank, once again, Bodhi from LunaRay Games for coming on the show tonight.
11284000	11288000	Fantastic interview, best of luck with the game, really appreciate it.
11288000	11290000	And thank all of you here in studio as well.
11290000	11293000	I'm going to go around and get some final thoughts from you guys.
11293000	11299000	Jvmon, do you have a final thought before you head back over to New York City? In a week, I guess, but still.
11299000	11302000	I'm finally going to start playing Final Fantasy XIV again.
11302000	11303000	Good call, it's a fun game.
11303000	11304000	Join our server.
11304000	11305000	I did.
11305000	11306000	Play with us.
11306000	11307000	Oh, okay, play with us.
11307000	11308000	Rob just needs to add me.
11308000	11309000	Okay, well.
11309000	11313000	And I kind of miss playing Dance Central Spotlight, even though I hate the whole piecemeal garbage-ness.
11313000	11317000	I heard a lot of the dances are just kind of lifted from the older games, is that true?
11318000	11329000	Some of the moves are just ripped straight from Dance Central III, but it's still pretty and fun, even though the first song they force you to play is the Will.I.Am and Justin Bieber song.
11329000	11330000	That's so fucked up.
11330000	11334000	So even right there, I was like, eh, I almost want to never play this again.
11334000	11338000	Are you going to get the Fantasia game, though? Because I'm really curious to know how it is.
11338000	11339000	That's out in two weeks.
11339000	11341000	Yeah, that's really soon. So buy time next year.
11341000	11343000	I can't touch a game that includes Bieber.
11344000	11345000	It's like Bayonetta is coming out, too.
11345000	11346000	Yeah, that's true.
11346000	11347000	It's like Bayonetta, Fantasia.
11347000	11349000	Exciting time in gaming. I know, I know.
11349000	11351000	My wallet's weeping silently in my pants.
11353000	11355000	Any final thought for us tonight?
11356000	11357000	No.
11357000	11360000	All right, well, have a good rest of your trip here in Northern California.
11360000	11361000	Thank you.
11361000	11362000	And come back. We'll see you in a year.
11363000	11364000	Maybe sooner.
11364000	11365000	Oh, okay.
11365000	11366000	Maybe.
11366000	11367000	All right, I like that attitude.
11367000	11372000	All right, Piper, my new friend from the Multitap Podcast, thanks for being here tonight.
11372000	11374000	Thanks for having me. This was fun. I was looking forward to this.
11374000	11375000	Did you have fun? Good.
11375000	11376000	I did.
11376000	11377000	It was important. Best of luck with your show.
11377000	11378000	Jamie, stop distracting.
11379000	11380000	It was one of my mods.
11380000	11381000	Oh, okay.
11381000	11383000	Best of luck with the show and all that fun stuff.
11383000	11384000	Thank you.
11384000	11388000	I mean, even if nobody listens, we'll keep doing it because it's super fun.
11388000	11390000	That is the important thing. You know what?
11390000	11393000	And for so long, OLR. Because the first episode had 12 listeners.
11393000	11395000	The second episode had like nine.
11395000	11397000	I feel like the saddest human ever.
11397000	11400000	If all the rest of the crew quits, I'll probably just be talking.
11400000	11402000	Just like, hey, thanks for coming back again.
11402000	11406000	If you don't love doing it, then stop doing it.
11406000	11408000	And that's why there's so many people.
11408000	11412000	Especially when the podcast and all these corporate people were like,
11412000	11414000	we gotta do a podcast because that's where the money's at.
11414000	11416000	And you heard all these people so didn't want to be there.
11416000	11418000	I'm just like, get out of the pool. You're ruining it.
11418000	11421000	But if you're having fun doing it, then keep creating.
11421000	11425000	Even if you're in an echo chamber, it can be a lot of fun.
11425000	11429000	And listeners or not, if anybody ends up listening from this show,
11429000	11432000	come December, we're doing the Mean Girls jingle jam.
11432000	11434000	It's happening.
11434000	11436000	You have my attention.
11436000	11438000	We have two listeners for December.
11438000	11441000	There you go. See, you just got more listeners right there.
11441000	11446000	It is lovely to see you again, Princess Irene. Thank you so much for being here.
11446000	11449000	Thank you. I was very happy to be here.
11449000	11450000	Yeah.
11450000	11451000	It was great.
11451000	11455000	So we'll come back. Try not to wait two years before coming back, okay?
11455000	11456000	No promises.
11457000	11460000	Remind us again how to listen to a multi-tap podcast.
11460000	11462000	With your ears, stupid.
11464000	11467000	So you can go to FFOP.net.
11467000	11468000	FOP.net.
11468000	11470000	Yeah, which is Fistful of Potions.
11470000	11471000	Or Fistful of Potions.
11471000	11473000	Or FistfulofPotions.com.
11473000	11477000	Or I'm surprised with you, Irene, and I can say this because I've known you a very long time.
11477000	11479000	I'm surprised it's not Fistful of Pooh.
11479000	11481000	I didn't come up with this.
11481000	11483000	You know it would be Fistful of Pooh if I made that.
11483000	11485000	Come on now.
11485000	11487000	With a big monkey as the logo.
11487000	11488000	Exactly.
11488000	11489000	Pixel Shits.
11489000	11491000	Pixel Shits, the podcast.
11491000	11494000	That's going to be our offshoot podcast, yeah.
11494000	11498000	Multitapping to Google has two words. It's like the first thing that shows up.
11498000	11499000	Oh, wow.
11499000	11505000	Sweet. So yes, you can Google it as well and you can find us on Twitter at Multitap Podcast.
11505000	11510000	And I don't know why we have two website URLs, but who gives a shit?
11510000	11511000	Just ease of use.
11511000	11513000	I guess. Yeah, we're on the Facebooks.
11513000	11515000	Facebooks and Twitters.
11515000	11517000	Do you have an LO yet?
11517000	11521000	Everybody forgot about LO. Like LO just came and went, didn't it?
11521000	11523000	LO went goodbye.
11523000	11525000	LOL.
11525000	11527000	Oh, that was dumb.
11527000	11529000	Final thought for our listeners tonight.
11529000	11531000	Poop.
11531000	11535000	Piper, I didn't ask you properly your final thought. Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
11535000	11538000	I wish they all could be California girls.
11539000	11543000	My final thought tonight. As always, I say, support indie podcasting.
11543000	11546000	And if you didn't like this show, then at least check out another show.
11546000	11548000	Support the hardworking indie broadcasters out there.
11548000	11557000	And one thing I've kind of said this week is that if you really want to fight the corruption that you see out there in these big name websites,
11557000	11563000	and you want to fight that type of corruption you see out there, I think one of the best things you can do is create.
11563000	11567000	And if you want to go out there and create a podcast, know that we support you 100%.
11567000	11574000	And support your fellow indie broadcasters. Just make sure you create to support and not create to destroy.
11574000	11578000	Because if you create to shade other people and stuff, then you know what? Go sit on a tack.
11578000	11582000	Just don't even bother.
11582000	11583000	And don't poop on other podcasts.
11583000	11588000	Exactly. It's not classy. Be a classy broadcaster. Yes, Piper?
11588000	11591000	I had a thought to tack on to that. I heard, I used to...
11591000	11593000	Damn it, I'm good.
11594000	11599000	He listened or watched I guess a lot of Kevin Smith and I still do, and he was really inspiring with that.
11599000	11602000	So that's a good message where he says, I think people would ask him for support.
11602000	11606000	They'd say, what should I do to make this story or make this movie or would you help it?
11606000	11609000	And always his advice was just fucking do it, man.
11609000	11610000	That's right.
11610000	11612000	Just fucking do it.
11612000	11613000	Just fucking do it, man.
11613000	11620000	All right. And my proper final thought that I don't give you every week is I might kidnap that box of yummy chocolate.
11620000	11621000	What is that that you brought?
11621000	11622000	I brought it to leave here.
11622000	11623000	Chocolate baton.
11623000	11625000	It was like two dollars at Trader Joe's.
11625000	11628000	Thank you, Trader Joe's. Thank you, Based Trader Joe's.
11628000	11630000	No, thank you, me, because I paid my two bucks for it.
11630000	11633000	That's true. All right. Do you want a dollar or something?
11633000	11635000	No, I brought them for you to have.
11635000	11636000	Yay, gifts.
11636000	11638000	We can't keep food at my house because we're moving.
11638000	11641000	All right. Well, my gift to you is your final thought next. Start, Sakura.
11641000	11646000	I want to already be moved. I'm tired of the waiting for the date.
11646000	11648000	Moving sucks already and you haven't packed a box.
11648000	11663000	No, we've already started packing, actually. We got rid of a lot of DVDs, including some of our box sets like TNG and Futurama and The Simpsons and my entire run of Stargate SG-1.
11663000	11666000	But, however, we're now $150 richer because of everything.
11666000	11674000	And I actually gave the good DVDs to friends first because I'd rather just say, hey, I gave you this. Let me borrow it.
11674000	11675000	There you go.
11676000	11684000	Next up is the books, then the vault. Not looking forward to it, but we're going to a better place.
11684000	11685000	I know. It'll be fun.
11685000	11687000	Are you dying?
11687000	11688000	We're going to a better place.
11688000	11690000	She's not going to hell like you.
11690000	11693000	Yes, I'm dying my hair in two weeks.
11695000	11699000	Actually, I'm going fire red with purple tips.
11699000	11700000	Nice.
11700000	11702000	Because I can do that now where I work.
11702000	11704000	You're going to look like an anime character when you come back.
11705000	11707000	How long did I have fuchsia hair?
11707000	11708000	I know, I know.
11708000	11710000	And Smurf blue that did not look good.
11710000	11713000	But I found white hairs because I'm old.
11713000	11720000	And so I said that when I get a lot more of them, I'm actually going to bleach my hair out and dye it blue so I can be a crazy blue-haired old lady.
11720000	11722000	All right, we'll all be waiting.
11722000	11725000	All right, last but not least, Loki, your final thought.
11725000	11732000	I'm watching The Kid this weekend, so hopefully I get some more programming done during his naps.
11732000	11735000	Just do it. Remember, that was the advice earlier.
11735000	11736000	Just fucking do it.
11736000	11737000	Just fucking do it.
11737000	11739000	All right, have a great week off, everybody.
11739000	11741000	Remember, we're going to be off next week.
11741000	11744000	And if you guys happen to be in Vegas, come say hi.
11744000	11745000	I'll be at Fan Fest.
11745000	11749000	I'll either be on the show floor or I'll be at the bar.
11749000	11750000	You know what will be sad?
11750000	11751000	What?
11751000	11752000	No Tiara.
11752000	11754000	I know she's not in Vegas now.
11754000	11755000	Nope.
11755000	11757000	I don't know if I know anybody still in Vegas.
11757000	11758000	Everybody I knew that was there I think moved.
11758000	11762000	I have friends now through Tiara, but I won't be there until you can't meet any of those awesome people.
11762000	11764000	Fine, I won't.
11764000	11769000	So we'll see you guys all again in two weeks with an all new Orange Lounge Radio.
11769000	11770000	Have a great week, everybody.
11770000	11771000	We'll see you then.
11771000	11772000	Good night.
11772000	11775000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
