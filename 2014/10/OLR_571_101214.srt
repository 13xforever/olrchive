00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio Live with this episode number 571 for today which is October the 12th, 2014.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts joined by my co-host. Say hello here in studio to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi, how are you?

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I did a thing today.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What did you do today?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I slept a lot.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You slept a lot. Congratulations.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, I did another thing today but you'll find out about that during what I played.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh my, okay. Well, you had a very me day and I had a very you day because to reward myself because we have a big show tonight. Tonight it's like OLR is taped in front of a live studio audience. We have so many people here in the studio.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You left track.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But since we have a busy show tonight and I did a performance last night because as you know I do the shadow cast theater stuff although as I announced on the show a couple weeks ago that's all going to be winding down very soon. So my next to last show was last night.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So I rewarded myself with tacos today. So I had a very Jamie day.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Tacos are amazing.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Tacos are great. So there you go.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Tacos are amazing.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Awesome. Alright, also amazing. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hi.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hi, how are you Loki?

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Clean spam.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Clean spam. Are you getting attacked by the spam bots on your email account again?

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I just haven't checked in like a couple days and so I have a million messages.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Uh oh. And it's like, you know, would you like to enlarge your penis or would you like to enter the lottery in Nigeria or whatever spams?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, it's increase the value of your home. Mysterious water of life vanishes.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I love it when I get those emails that are like increase the value of your home. It's like, I'm a runner. Delete.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Delete. Alright, anyway, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern to the voice of Geeks Network,

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. We do have a very busy show tonight.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We have, as mentioned there in the intro, Bodhi Lee from Luna Ray Games going to join us in about 25 minutes here to talk all about what they're up to and their game time spinner.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's going to be awesome. But here in studio, we have a very packed house.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to get to it here. Kicking off tonight, introducing our guests. First off, this is a name you might recognize if you've been listening to OLR for a very, very, very long time,

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
but she hasn't been here in way too long. So welcome back to the show. Princess Irene is here tonight. Hi, Princess Irene.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hello. How are you? Doing pretty well. How about you? Good. Great. So we're all caught up. Let's move on. No, I'm kidding.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, okay. So for those that haven't heard you on the show before, you've been a gamer as long as I've known you, which has been a very long time.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I remember we used to play DDR together and all that fun stuff. What kind of games do you like? Like, what are your favorite sorts of games?

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, obviously, rhythm based games. That's kind of how we met. Well, not how we met, but a lot of our friends. I like RPGs. I like puzzle games.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sounding like the, I don't know, stereotypical like girl gamer or something, but, you know, it's kind of on an independent case.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I just judge it based on like what I see. So, yeah. But you also play a lot of like recent stuff too, because I noticed before we were getting started here,

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
there was like a Smash 3DS brawl going on during Bobby's show. So yes. Yeah. Is that what you've been into kind of lately?

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah. I mean, um, you know, I'm Poe, so we just got a 3DS last year. We actually got two of them, but, um, I've been loving it, you know, and I've been trying to catch up on, on a backlog of games on the 3DS.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So that's been great. And yeah, I got, um, Smash Brothers for my one year wedding anniversary. So isn't that romantic?

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, congratulations. No, it is. It's awesome. Yeah. And you're, well, your husband's a giant nerd too. So, you know,

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes. Yeah. The couple that plays together, stays together. Wink. Indeed. Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, you're getting a lot of welcomes there.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Like, yay, Irene. Yay. Hi Irene. Yay, Rice Princess. Yay, anniversaries. Cause you used to go by that name and then you switched cause you know, you can.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah. I wanted to be less racist. No, I'm kidding. Thanks for remembering me guys. Oh, hearts and feels.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So while you've been gone, this is interesting though, because while you've been gone, I mean, I don't think you've been on OLR in probably at least a year and a half. It's probably been almost longer.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think it's more than that. Yeah. It's been a while, but while you've been gone, you just decided to start your own show.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Not really. I was invited onto another show by another person who's here tonight. Um, and it's, it's just worked out. So yeah.

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, I th you know, we say support indie podcasting and I actually think that is like super fucking awesome that you're doing your own thing right now. Yeah. Cause you guys are focused on like retro type of games, right?

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Um, most, well, we don't really like to call yourself a retro cast, but it ends up being a retro cast cause we're all like really old gamers.

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's usually what it is. Everything, you know, new is crappy and everything old is good. So kind of pretty much that's not true. Yeah.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, it's appropriate that you're here tonight when we're going to be talking to somebody who's developing a new game, but very influenced by the retro stuff.

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've heard a thing or two about this game. Let's be real. You actually put this on my radar. I'm glad you did. I'm excited. Me too. Yeah.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right. Awesome. Well, let's talk to your cohost who's also joining us here tonight. Say hello everybody. I didn't ask if he has an alias. Do you have an alias that you use or should I call you by your name or what?

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The universal handle is usually the mad piper. Okay. Whatever you find. So mad piper it is. How are you doing? I'm well. Yeah. Yeah. Welcome to the show.

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thanks. I'm excited. All right. Tell us a little bit about what you and Irene do on your show.

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's called the multi-tap podcast. It's on the Fistful of Potions network. You guys have the VoG network here.

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's mainly just, I don't know if we even have a theme really. It's a lot of tangentry and it's loosely based around older video games or newer video games.

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Tangentry. Not familiar with tangentry. No, we only stick to business here. You're on the wrong show, buddy. I'm sorry to say.

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I probably won't talk a lot. Well, okay. Since you guys are retro fans, what are some of your retro classics?

64
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because I've known her forever, but I've only just met you, although I've heard your show. But what are some of your favorite classics?

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Goodness. I think I mention Super Mario RPG on every episode. Final Fantasy VII. Really like big ones, but there's some that just really stick out for me.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm really liking theater in them, though. But my poor 3DS is in the shop.

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What happened?

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So, I found out there's a numskull somewhere that built the 3DS and the motherboard is warped. So when it was in assembly, you know those little hooks that you can put a lanyard on?

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Thank you.

70
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So the motherboard was put on top of that. Or I guess one corner of the motherboard was kind of assembled on top of that. And so, it's having a hard time. It won't read the SD card anymore.

71
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now, you're getting some hellos in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

72
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Ochikawa says, hello Piper, great radio voice. Link to podcast?

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, hi.

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It would be, I guess, at fop.net. You can find it on the webpage.

75
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Wait, fop?

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, F-F-O-P.

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, okay. I thought he said something else for a minute there. I was like, the fap? What is this?

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The fap net? If you listen to the show, you'll understand. You'll feel a sudden urge.

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, this is for fop?

80
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is for fop.

81
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

82
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:11,000
fop.net, Fistful of Potions. Or I think spelled out fistfulofpotions.com. And then we're on the webpage or on iTunes or on YouTube. We have a playlist up on YouTube, so you can find it fairly easily.

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Nice. Awesome, awesome. So, tell us about what you talked about on your most recent episode, if people would check it out.

84
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We had actually, we went out of sequence, but we did episode Mighty No. 9 to celebrate Mighty No. 9 coming out, I guess, soon. So, we couldn't talk about that very much, so we just kind of talked a lot about Mega Man.

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's fine.

86
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We had nothing else. But it was a good time.

87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We were going to talk about Mighty No. 9, but then we realized nobody's played it, so we'll just talk about Mega Man. It works.

88
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

89
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Which one's the best Mega Man? Ooh.

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Ooh.

91
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You have to listen to the podcast.

92
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm asking you now.

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, man. For me?

94
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah.

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I like X.

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You like X?

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I like X.

98
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Really?

99
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But it's one of the few I've played.

100
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You dare to not say two or three?

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I've played one, two, and three, and X, and I think I loved X the most just from nostalgia's sake, from when I was little.

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It did the most for me. You got armor.

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, you did.

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Extra, not back to canisters, what are those? Energy capsules.

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think two will always be my favorite, but again, I think that's a nostalgia thing. Like, I had played one when it was new, but then two is that game you saw in Nintendo Power, and you were like, this looks like a frickin' cartoon.

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:35,000
These graphics are so amazing. Oh my God, my mind is blown. And then the game comes out, and it really does, like, for graphics of the time, looked so good. Like, some of those, like, I remember the giant fish in Bubble Man's stage. That was amazing for us, right?

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You gotta listen to the episode. One of our co-hosts is Bubble Man's number one fanboy.

108
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay. Alright.

109
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He said the right one.

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That is something. Bubble Man's fanboy.

111
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We also talk about Bubble Man's wiry remains.

112
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Nice. Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Somebody over there, Raginator, is quickly registering for fap.com, so there you go.

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, man.

114
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Agdeft says, I'm still waiting for Mega Man X20. Bochikawa says Mega Man 9. Oh, sorry, no, that's Mighty No. 9. So feels like classic Mega Man to me, even though you dash constantly everywhere.

115
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Now, some people have played it because there's that beta for the backers of a certain level on Steam, right?

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's none of us.

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's see. And Dungeon Buster agrees. Mega Man 2 is so good. Well, because you have good taste, sir. Alright.

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We're going to move on. I'm going to introduce one other guy we have here. I told you guys it was a full house here tonight.

119
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Not only do we have our friends here from the MultiTap podcast on FFFOP, but we have another old friend of OLR back tonight making his yearly visit to the studio.

120
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Say hello, everybody, to JB Mon.

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hello.

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
How you doing?

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Pretty good. You?

124
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Pretty good. You?

125
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Good. You just flew in from New York City the other day, right?

126
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah. My sister had gotten married this past weekend, so, you know, I figured I might as well show up.

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Might as well. Well, that's I mean, that's still really awesome because you usually when you come visit your sister, from what I recall, is in the Bay Area somewhere.

128
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah.

129
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And we're still a good two hour drive from the Bay Area. That's still, you know, dedication.

130
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Like an hour and a half, two hours, depending on traffic.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh, okay. So did you get a lot of wine at the wedding?

132
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah. It wasn't like free bar for like liquor or beer, but like wine. They were just like cases and cases and cases of wine.

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And, you know, today they were picking everything up. They had maybe like one or two bottles of wine left out of like 50, 15 cases.

134
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And all the kegs were still almost full.

135
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Nice. Nice.

136
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
My family likes wine.

137
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Now, our other guests were promoting a podcast, and I know you used to do one, but your podcast list right now, right?

138
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No, it started.

139
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, you did?

140
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, yay.

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's about one episode every month or so.

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay. All right. Hey. Do it when you do it.

144
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's still about Eurobeat.

145
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah.

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So.

147
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, we have a lot of fans of like DDR, and so if you like that kind of music, this is going to be right up your alley, right?

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah. And we've sort of been inspired by Orange Lounge Radio, so we kind of get on the tangent train all the time.

149
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Nice.

150
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because, you know, it's not a good podcast if you don't have tangents.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's very humbling to hear that, although to be fair, I don't think we invented the tangent here at Orange Lounge Radio.

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Hey, I'm giving you credit, so take it.

153
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You know what? I'll take it. I'll take it. That's awesome.

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So you guys, do you play a lot of the music, or you just talk about it, or how does that work?

155
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Both.

156
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Both?

157
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because, you know, you can't really just play the music straight for copyright reasons, so.

158
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Right.

159
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I like to think we got away with it for talking over it and keeping it in a low volume.

160
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You know, just skirting the issue completely.

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sure.

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's like, this is a gray area.

163
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is a gray area. But, I mean, you tend to play stuff from, like, the probably, let's be real, most people probably haven't heard.

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
At least in America.

165
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Right.

166
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah.

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So, you know.

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Although, recently in the past few years, Avex has been putting a lot of it on American iTunes.

169
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So, it's kind of like, years and years and years, US doesn't exist.

170
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And then, like, 2008, 9 happened. It's like, everything on iTunes at once.

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah.

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, that's been happening a lot with, like, video game soundtracks and other types of things that, you know, I remember we used to have to, you'd have the one corner of the comic book shop that would have, like, the import CDs from Japan.

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah.

174
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Where it's like, you have a Final Fantasy soundtrack and a, you know, a Hamasaki Ayumi CD, and that's about it.

175
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, and then they'd want, like, $70 for five songs, and it's like, you're smoking crack.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's still A-1 Comics.

177
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Is that, you still do that there?

178
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Except they do that for the bootlegs.

179
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, and then I remember when it was the giant Virgin Megastore in, and this is not a place to buy Virgins, it was, you know, Richard Branson.

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It was a Virgin Megastore in San Francisco, right, not far from the Metron, used to have, like, all the, not just the Japanese imports, but then it was all, like, the Euro, Euro singles.

181
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So, it's like, if there's, like, a Kylie Minogue song you haven't heard, they probably have it at the Virgin Megastore, right?

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I wasted a lot of money at Virgin Megastore.

183
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, you're a Kylie fan too?

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No, I was an import, I was a Ministry of Sound fan, and I used to pick up a bunch of different mix CDs from all these European imports, and they're, like, I spent hundreds of dollars there.

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
No, no, no, no. Let's rewind this a little bit to the same era for me in Alabama.

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay.

187
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, I could order this for $100 with shipping? I'm ordering the single.

188
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, my gosh, no way, no way. That's, like, that's how much it would cost to, like, get a game imported from Japan.

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I can order a Super Famicom game for only $120? Yes, I'll order the Sailor Moon S Fighting Game.

190
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
True story.

191
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, my gosh. Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see, Locopoco says, OLR perfected the tangent. Oh, well, thank you very much, I appreciate that.

192
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:46,000
SSG100Matt says, the things I'm hearing at a New York Comic Con is that it's a mess. Oh, JV Mon, you ran out of town the weekend New York Comic Con is happening, are you? How do you feel about that?

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Around the time I was going to buy tickets, my sister's like, by the way, my wedding's the weekend of the 11th, and I'm like, God damn it.

194
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You need to move your wedding.

195
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's kind of pretty much what I told her. I was like, it can't be the week before or after. She's like, nope, it's the 11th, and I'm like, well, you suck.

196
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And I'm not gonna lie, I sort of considered it. I was like, do I have to go for the whole weekend for the wedding? Can I just show up that morning?

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, then does that make it like, be honest, does it make you kind of feel better that you're hearing that New York Comic Con's a little bit of a mess?

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Because you're like, oh, since I couldn't go anyway, fuck them.

199
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That, and I hear there's like this whole nonsense with banned weapons, like if it wasn't made out of cardboard.

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I saw like garbage pails filled with weapons.

201
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, I think if it wasn't made out of cardboard or foam, they pretty much, I'm hearing conflicting reports, they either took it from you and threw it out or they took it from you and you got it back at the end of the day.

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Either way, that's like, people work hard on that stuff. That's kind of BS.

203
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, well, I mean, but if that's the policy of the con, you didn't read up on the policy or whatever.

204
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But I also heard that they had like conflicting policies, like their mobile site said one thing regarding weapons and the actual like PC site said something else.

205
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Maybe there's an overreaction too, because I don't know if you've been on Twitter this week or whatever, but people like legitimately went fucking crazy.

206
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
People went crazy on Twitter?

207
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I know, right?

208
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But did they have a ball pit? Was there a ball pit? Because that's really the most important part.

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hopefully Rama went. Hopefully Rama, actually, I think John from Critical Myth went, so we might get the ball pit report from John a little later.

210
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I know that Kayla went.

211
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay.

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So I can ask her. She's actually cosplaying a couple of people.

213
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We have spies.

214
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, well, I know that the big stink was about them confiscating cosplay props.

215
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Rana might have been too busy with that buff boys van outside of his place.

216
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's great that none of the listeners are going to know what that is. Let's see.

217
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

218
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Akdev says people went crazy on the internet? No way.

219
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Dungeon Buster says the arsenal of foam freedom. So like nerf weapons were banned too? That would be really sad.

220
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
No, I think like you could only get through if it was foam.

221
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh, okay. Well, that's good.

222
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Nerf off the place.

223
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Nerf weapons are fun. Like, why would you not have a nerf weapon? That's the honest question.

224
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They just stuck to the policy. It's nerf or nothing.

225
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Amazing. Alright, we're just about ten minutes out from our interview, but we're going to start tonight by going around and finding out for everybody here in studio.

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
How was your gaming week and what types of video games have you been playing this week?

227
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Kind of establishing our frame of reference here before we get too far into the show. DarkSakura, start us off.

228
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I played Super Smash Brothers because I woke up after Yom Kippur and found that waiting for me and I was like, ooh.

229
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So I've got that. I'm trying to remember to finish playing Bravely Default, which I've been sort of, because I've been so busy at work I haven't really had a chance to.

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Final Fantasy XIV, which I'm chopping down trees and stealing things from them. And today we did the thing. The thing.

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We broke out the ignition pads to test them with DDR Max. So Dan and I played DDR this morning.

232
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Wow. Like legit, like DDR Max on PS2?

233
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:18,000
On our JPS2, which is like, I can't, I'm old, I can't let my drawer out. You better sneak that disc in in five nanoseconds or that's going to go, no, I'm taking it back.

234
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Wow. So our PS2 first model still works. Barely. So that's what we've been doing.

235
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What made you decide to play that of all things? Was it just like...

236
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
To make sure our dance pads worked.

237
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's right. You guys have a move coming up.

238
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We picked up three ignition pads at the thrift store for six bucks.

239
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Really? I want one.

240
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Well, one of them was given away. We have two left. I didn't break yours.

241
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Why didn't you call me first?

242
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You knew I had those because I put it on the internet three years ago. Look what I got at the thrift store by my house.

243
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
All I'm hearing are excuses. No, I'm kidding. It's fine. It's fine.

244
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Let's be real. Me playing DDR is my big butt on the couch with the controller going up, down, left, right, up, up, up, down.

245
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, you know what? When I clean out the closet, when we start getting rid of parts of the vault, then I'll call you.

246
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We actually are going to be packing up the vault coming up this week.

247
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll help you move, but if games go missing...

248
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm not looking forward to packing the vault because we're not keeping the shelves.

249
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Moving is punishment for murder in some countries. I'm almost positive.

250
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm going to have to take pictures of the shelves and put them up somewhere before we disassemble the shelves and get rid of them.

251
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We're probably going to be getting bins for everything, so we're probably going to go off on tangents and say,

252
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let's see if this game still works. Let's see if this game still works.

253
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh, this is in the box. We could get $500 for this.

254
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You should make a YouTube series out of this. I'm telling you, this is a golden opportunity here.

255
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Effort.

256
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I know. I know. It's so difficult. Anything else quickly before we move on?

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I like pie.

258
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Ricky, how was your gaming week?

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I had programming. I didn't play anything.

260
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's still continuing on your programming request.

261
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Wait, this is your time between jobs right now, right?

262
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Well, not much. I start a week from Monday.

263
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay.

264
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Well, potentially start. It's either a week from Monday or three weeks from Monday.

265
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay, whatever they decide, yeah.

266
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But, I mean, just watching the kids.

267
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But, yeah, lots of programming. I've been programming tools to make levels.

268
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Nice.

269
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I finished that, and I was converting some stuff over to make it work with the new stuff.

270
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And I just found the mistake I made, so I had to go back and fix that.

271
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But, yeah, that's what I've been working on.

272
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I registered a site domain and a Twitter account.

273
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Can you unveil the name of your company now, or are we waiting on that?

274
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well, I don't really have a company yet.

275
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's placeholder because in order to file a trademark, you have to have evidence that you're using it.

276
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And so I have to have a website with the name of my game on it for a while.

277
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Got it.

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And then once I've done that, then I can file paperwork to register the name, the trademark.

279
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't know about trademarking the company. It's expensive.

280
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Seems like a lot. Yeah, yeah.

281
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We'll see.

282
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Just don't steal Loki's name or you're a dick.

283
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's basically how it boils down to, right?

284
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah, so I've got that, and I don't know.

285
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I've been just kind of bouncing around a bunch of different things.

286
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I looked for music earlier this week, but mainly just coding stuff.

287
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And now I'm pretty much still at the spot I was at.

288
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I was just getting a bunch of stuff.

289
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I was kind of trying to model the tools I'm making off of stuff that's the same kind of tools that they have for making levels in Minecraft.

290
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Kind of like the world builder stuff or voxel sniper or something like that.

291
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So I'm building similar things because that's what I've used before to make stuff in Minecraft, and that was super easy.

292
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And so since a lot of the stuff that I'm making for my levels is voxel based, even though it's not all cubes,

293
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I kind of based it off of that just to get some ideas for things to make it a little bit easier than plotting one block at a time, which would take fucking forever.

294
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So we'll see.

295
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I still haven't gotten actually tested yet because it hasn't worked yet because I still have to fix this other bug here.

296
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I changed something that I thought I needed to change, but I didn't.

297
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ah, bug testing. What the life.

298
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah.

299
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Alright.

300
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll move on to my gaming week, then we'll get to our guests here.

301
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
For my gaming week, I finally got my 70 hardcore character in Diablo 3 seasonal.

302
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Thank you very much.

303
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Finally, it took me forever, but because I was too afraid to play on high difficulties because I didn't want to die.

304
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But I did.

305
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That was my first hardcore character ever, and I made it all the way to 70 without dying on a demon hunter.

306
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So yay.

307
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So are you going to encase it in glass and make sure no one ever touches it?

308
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Pretty much.

309
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No.

310
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Now that I got that and that was the goal, now is where I'm going to start playing really stupid.

311
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So this character will die at some point because I'm going to keep pushing the envelope until...

312
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But that's okay because I reached the goal I wanted to reach and that's the important thing.

313
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So I got my stupid transmog stuff in Diablo.

314
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So that made me very happy.

315
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I also played the Bayonetta 2 demo.

316
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Again, I don't want to rate a game based off the demo, but let me just say, the Bayonetta 2 demo definitely reminded me like,

317
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
oh yes, you need this game day one.

318
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Because the first Bayonetta was so freaking great, and Bayonetta 2 definitely just kind of reminds you.

319
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
At least the demo is very short, it's like one playable level in like two boss fights.

320
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But it's just enough to remind you, oh god, this game is so over the top and amazing.

321
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Like, oh, I miss this shit.

322
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So, yeah, I'm definitely going to pick that up when that comes out.

323
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Otherwise, those were pretty much the bulk of my week.

324
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
A little bit of Final Fantasy XIV here and there.

325
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Destiny.

326
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh, one other game I want to mention actually that came out on PlayStation Plus that I've been playing an awful lot of.

327
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Because PlayStation Plus got some really good stuff this week.

328
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You have Dust and Elysian Tail, which I just started, but I've barely scratched the surface on that.

329
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Splunky, which I've played the crap out of on PC and PlayStation 3.

330
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But there was also another game in it, and I'm afraid this one's going to get overlooked.

331
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And I actually think it's one that's almost most deserving of your time.

332
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's Pix the Cat is the name, which is kind of a silly name, right?

333
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But this game is available on Vita and PlayStation 4, and it's not like a technical marvel.

334
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Like, the graphics are really things that probably could have been done on a PlayStation 2 or 3.

335
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But it has a very, like, classic arcade feel to it that makes it very addicting.

336
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And essentially it's kind of like Pac-Man mixed with, I don't know, more like Pac-Man Championship Edition kind of mixed with a puzzler sort of thing.

337
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Because what you do is you go around, you pick up these eggs, and then you drop them off in the little holes.

338
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But if you screw up and do it out of order where you don't pick up all the eggs first, then the eggs will crack and you don't get the bonus so your meter doesn't fill up as much.

339
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So it's about pushing a high score, like a classic arcade game is. Yeah, Irene?

340
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So this involves cats somehow?

341
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I don't know why it's called Pix the Cat because I don't remember actually seeing...

342
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, in the nostalgia mode it's a black and white cat with a little top hat.

343
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I was going to say, it looks like that's a cat in the picture.

344
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I guess a little bit. I don't remember it having a lot of cat traits to it.

345
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's got cat teeth and ears and a tail.

346
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Fair enough.

347
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But yeah, for some reason I'm super addicted to this game. I keep trying to rush the high scores and everything.

348
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And it's the loud techno music, and I swear they got the guy from Bejeweled to do some of the voices.

349
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You know, it's like, ultra combo.

350
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You know, that type of thing. He does some of the voices in this game too.

351
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You can change the voice to some of the...

352
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But you want Bejeweled guy who does all the...

353
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You got a perfect...

354
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You know, that type of stuff.

355
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah, that game is a surprising amount of fun.

356
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I've actually been playing that more than Spelunky or Dust, which surprised me because I thought I'd be playing the other two first.

357
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It just goes to show you that a game doesn't necessarily need to have all these extreme bells and whistles to be addicting.

358
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So, there you go.

359
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Quickly, let's check in with our guests here and see what types of games they've been playing this week.

360
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Irene.

361
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Well, I already mentioned Super Smash Brothers, so I don't really need to get into that because everyone already knows.

362
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm actually playing Oracle of Seasons because they had the Super Smash sale a couple of weeks ago.

363
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And I bought Ages and Seasons and they didn't have Link's Awakening on sale and I'm like, what the fuck, guys?

364
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But yeah, so that's been fun.

365
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Off and on Bravely Default, that's always an ongoing project.

366
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And that's pretty much it.

367
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Nice. So you are making good use of that 3DS.

368
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Absolutely.

369
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You don't just play that one game and then go back to something else like I've been doing way too much lately.

370
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I know you've never been poor, Rob, but it's what poor people do. They cherish what they have.

371
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah, right. I talked to you before the show about when the PS1 demo disc came, it was like, here's my game for the month. Yay!

372
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's the first stage of Parappa 50 times I can play. Yay!

373
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You and me both, sister.

374
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But how much, knowing that, where it's like, I'm going to play the first stage of Parappa 50 times, how much does it piss you off to see that Nintendo limits it to like 30 or whatever?

375
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It depends on the demo. I'm more sad that some of the demos are just kind of really, really...

376
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Like, we were talking about the feet rhythm demo where it was just two songs. I'm like, what the fuck is this?

377
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
This is ridiculous. Why just two songs? What the hell?

378
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But, you know, so I wouldn't get 30 plays out of that anyway because it's like, I'm bored.

379
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, realistically, I would never hit the 30 cap on these demos, but Bayonetta 2 is 15.

380
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
They're getting less. Pretty soon it's going to be like, you get three, they're making count.

381
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah, there's no real logical reason to limit it.

382
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It better be nice because pretty soon they're only going to have 15 games coming out in a year, you know, with all the third party support that they're losing.

383
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I was like, the Wii U had 15 games this year?

384
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Third party, yeah, there's lots of third party games.

385
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Fair enough.

386
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I mean, a lot of third party terrible games, but I mean, I don't know.

387
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Let me move on and check in with Piper. How was your gaming week? What types of games have you been playing this week?

388
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I've been working a rigorous job, growing a beard.

389
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's hard work.

390
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, my 3DS is broken. I had to take it in the shop, so I bought theater them and then didn't get to play it.

391
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I don't know what I can say here. My PSP got something done to it when it had undergone elective surgery.

392
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Okay, so you just kind of left it somewhere and then suddenly it was able to do these things it couldn't do before.

393
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
When I picked it back up, I can play any Mega Man or Nintendo game that I want on it.

394
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Oh my gosh, Mutant Powers. It got bitten by a spider.

395
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Right, so I've been abusing its mutant power on lunch breaks and reading comic books.

396
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Very controversial.

397
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's my week in gaming.

398
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
All right, retro gaming makes sense.

399
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You know what else can play any Nintendo game you want? This wonderful arcade cabinet that's sitting very underutilized right here.

400
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I know. I've still got to set this thing up. You must have missed the part where I had a show last night and I'm going to Vegas next week.

401
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So getting this thing finished is not on my priority list. Sorry, Logie.

402
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Oh, I see what it is. You're just better than the game.

403
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah.

404
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
To be fair, absolutely fair, it does not have Ms. World.

405
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I know. That's why I was like, let it collect dust if it didn't have Ms. Nude World.

406
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
At least I don't think it does. It might be on there.

407
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You know the minute I get it up and running, that's the first thing I'm going to make happen.

408
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Like, how do I get Ms. Nude World 96?

409
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay, well I just have to back up my collection from my arcade cabinet at home and bring it here and then that way it will have that on there.

410
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
All right. Which, by the way, if you've never heard of Ms. Nude World 96, I'll have to get into it another week.

411
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We've got to get to our guest here in a minute, but lastly here, JV Mon, how was your gaming week?

412
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Uh, Smash Brothers, Smash Brothers, Super Metroid with my boyfriend, and Dead Rising 3, Smash Brothers, and I think...

413
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Oh yeah, I played Smash Brothers.

414
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Okay, you did.

415
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Anybody's heard of Smash Brothers?

416
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I think I had heard a couple things about... Who's your go-to character right now?

417
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I don't know. I kind of just like to pick Random, although because I'm confused by him, I play the Duck Hunt dog a lot.

418
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Mm-hmm.

419
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Because I... Why?

420
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's kind of one of those, like, I just... I'm drawn to your strangeness type thing, right?

421
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Like, the duck and dog are usually enemies, so...

422
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
How do you feel...

423
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
They're friends now.

424
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
How do you feel about Smash on the 3DS as opposed to, you know, being on a console living room television?

425
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Because, you know, when I talked about it last week, I kind of said, you know, my biggest problem with Smash 3DS is that it's on the 3DS.

426
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I could sort of see that, but probably for a different reason.

427
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Half the fun of Smash is playing with somebody else, and when you're on a 3DS, you sort of kind of coordinate with somebody.

428
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's like, are you going to be online? Want to play Smash? No? Okay. Move on to the next person.

429
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Right.

430
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I mean, I have no problem with the small screen. I think it looks fine. I think it looks good. It's just...

431
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Playing by yourself can get boring.

432
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. Yes?

433
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'll tell you in chat.

434
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Okay.

435
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Are we going to settle this in Smash? Is that what's going to happen there? All right.

436
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
All right. Well, there we go. There's everybody's gaming week.

437
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But we are going to, actually, at this point, we're going to move on into our interview part of the show.

438
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Because we want to get here on the show.

439
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Bodhi Lee is going to join us from Lunar Ray Games, and they're currently creating the game Timespinner.

440
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Timespinner is a game created in the vein of Super Nintendo and PlayStation 1 classics like Castlevania, Savia the Night, Super Metroid, and Star Ocean.

441
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And Bodhi is going to join us right now. Bodhi, are you there?

442
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Hello.

443
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Hey. Thanks for joining us today. How are you doing?

444
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Good. How are you?

445
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I am great. We can actually see you. I'm waving hello, although you can't see it. I'm sorry.

446
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But we're running on a computer that's powered by a hamster, so I'm afraid to run a webcam.

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule in developing the game to join us here.

448
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
No problem.

449
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Now, for those that don't know about Timespinner, tell us a little bit about it.

450
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Timespinner is a 2D metroidvania about a young woman who travels through time to get revenge on an empire that killed her family.

451
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So this side sounds like a really nice, fluffy, happy kind of story, isn't it?

452
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
No, no, no. It's a little on the darker side.

453
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh, boy. Okay. Well, no, that's all right.

454
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And I noticed that Timespinner definitely has, like, an art style to it that feels very light. It's very retro, very sprite-based and so forth.

455
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
What made you decide to kind of go that direction with it?

456
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I've always liked pixel art, and so when I was making the game, well, actually, when I've been learning pixel art since, like, middle school, I've been trying to kind of incorporate all the styles of games that I like.

457
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So, for example, like, the game has some art influences from Final Fantasy Tactics and it has some from, like, the Castlevania games and, like, Star Ocean and other stuff.

458
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So I, as I learned, I just took my favorite parts of other games and that's how the game style, like, happened.

459
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Nice. So you actually, and I, you know, reading through your site on Lunar Ray Games and so forth, you mentioned there that you actually used to work for Bungie, which I'm sure a lot of people know with Halo and Destiny and all that.

460
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But you actually ended up, you know, kind of leaving that to start this endeavor. That's a huge life change. What made you decide to make that change?

461
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I think I just caught the indie bug.

462
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Last May of 2013, I saw a Kickstarter for a similar game to Time Spinner called Chasm. It's also pixel art, also Metroidvania, but it's also procedurally generated, which Time Spinner isn't really.

463
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And I didn't know that Kickstarter was something that you did for games. I thought it was something that you did if you were going to start a restaurant or something. Like, I started a small business. I didn't realize that you could be really successful with games.

464
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And so they did really well and I was super excited for the game. And the idea got in my head that, hey, I could do this too, since at this time I had been working on Time Spinner on my off time for probably like four years at that point.

465
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And eventually I would just spend the whole day at work daydreaming about doing that and I kind of lost interest. I like to use the word that I was cheating on Bungie with Time Spinner and I left Bungie to, you know, get married to someone else.

466
00:34:45,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I love it. You're having an affair, so you finally had to step up and admit that you've been cheating. So that's amazing. I love that. But you did very well on Kickstarter, you know, considering that this is, I mean, yes, it's been a project you've been working on for so long, but you did very well on Kickstarter for, you know, essentially this being your company's first game.

467
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
What do you think was part of that success? Why did people really buy into this? I mean, literally.

468
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I mean, since the Chasm Kickstarter, I've been backing games that were very similar to that for like the year leading up to my Kickstarter. And I was just studying all of them about what made them successful, what things they did that were good, what things were bad.

469
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And I tried to kind of hit on all of those good points and not hit the bad points. I think a big part of the allure specifically for Time Spinner was that it was darker and it had the 16-bit style of sprite art rather than like the more popular right now is like the 8-bit, like normal Nintendo's sprite art style.

470
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And also, I think that the trailer for the game was really kind of story heavy and just heavy in general. I felt like a lot of people related to that, or at least they were like, hey, this reminds me of kind of darker Castlevania games. So I'm going to get on board with this.

471
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I think there's just a lot of love out there for the Metroidvania type of game anyway. I know you say Metroidvania. I perk up right there. I go, is this something I should be looking at? Literally, I think that's how somebody sold me a copy of Rogue Legacy. They were like, Rob, it's Rogue but a Metroidvania. And I was like, purchase.

472
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Right. Interesting because you talk about you're inspired by these classics, but you're also inspired by a lot of indie games too. I mean, it sounds like you have these other indie Kickstarters. How else have indie games kind of influenced you in the indie movement?

473
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I mean, they're all inspiration in their own ways. Like Heartforth Alicia is like, I don't know if you've seen it, but it was out a couple months before my Kickstarter and it has like obscenely good sprite art.

474
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And that really inspires me to like, do better, like be a better artist. And like Chasm has really good gameplay. And I mean, just all these other Kickstarters and other indie games are really inspiring because people are doing their own thing. And I can do that too. And we can do it together.

475
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I think that's so amazing too, that you are essentially doing this yourself, especially when you go and you look at the trailer for the game, which I encourage people to do. Check out what's going on with the game over at timespinnergame.com.

476
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And you can check out the latest trailer and so forth and where you're at and all the artwork and all that. But you're essentially doing this yourself. I know you have some help with the music and voiceover and I don't want to neglect those types of contributions.

477
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But you know, a lot of that stuff when it comes to the art and the programming, you're doing that yourself. I mean, what's the hardest part about that one man band?

478
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I think the hardest part is that, I mean, for me, the hardest part is the inspiration for art. It's really hard when you want to make something, but you don't have the right inspiration to do it.

479
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Or when you go to make it, that it's not what you had originally imagined. And that sort of artistic failure is really frustrating. But that's really the only hard part. The programming part is really simple and easy since that's what I was trained to do in school.

480
00:38:45,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And yeah, that's probably the hardest part of the art. And after the Kickstarter, actually, another hard part is actually being kind of anxious, I guess is the word. Because there's now so much I have to do and it's all on me.

481
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And a lot of other Kickstarters have talked about this, how it's suddenly stressful, the fact that you have all these people behind you and they're expecting you to finish. And you're like, I was planning on doing this, but now I'm kind of anxious now.

482
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Right. Right. You know, Loki, here in studio, he's making his own game. And he's doing the one-man-band thing, too, with the exception of music and some of that stuff.

483
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Well, yeah, music right now is just all anything I can find in Creative Commons. I have no money.

484
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I was wondering if you had any, and then Loki didn't go to school for this, but this is what Loki does. He learns by doing type of things. I was wondering if you had any advice for Loki on making your first game.

485
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Just do it. The best way for me to learn things is by doing them and failing and learning from your mistakes. And also, if you need help with programming, just lots of Stack Overflow. That's generally what I do. Just Google, hey, how do I do this? And then Stack Overflow tells me what to do. I'm like, okay, got it, thanks.

486
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah, kind of the same place there. And same with coming up with assets and stuff. That's always difficult. So, yeah, I don't know. A lot of what we're doing, I'm kind of seeing a lot of the same stuff right now, just like, okay, you know.

487
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I try to cut corners of different things and then end up having to go back and learn the right way to do it. So, it's kind of fun.

488
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Now, Bodhi, I noticed one thing you do, you know, you talked a minute before about kind of like feeling that pressure about like, I have to deliver this game that these people backed. But I thought one kind of clever thing that you're doing with this and that kind of shows people like, yes, I am working, I didn't take your money and run to, you know, Tijuana, I'm actually working on this game, I'm doing it.

489
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You're doing live streams every week that really kind of like show the progress. There was one that I was catching on YouTube where I actually was watching you draw like one of the sprite art in the game and I thought that was really cool. How have the live streaming that you've done helped kind of contribute to the game?

490
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It's kind of a double-edged sword because like normally when I work on art, I will work on it for a bit and then like take a break, go on a walk or something and then come back to it.

491
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And with the live streams, I basically sit there for three hours straight and work. So, it's really good for productivity.

492
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And I actually kind of enjoy having people there, you know, talking to me while it's happening and then like suggesting things or giving me advice. Like, for example, at this week's stream, I was doing like a bird skeleton and there was like a guy who's kind of like a biologist.

493
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
He's helping me with all my bird anatomy.

494
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You're doing it wrong. Oh, no.

495
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:03,000
No, it was a good thing. Like I would be stuck on something and I would ask them like, so wait, how does this work? And they tell me I'm like, can that make sense? Got it.

496
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That can be a bullet point on the list of features now. Authentic bird anatomy.

497
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yes.

498
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:21,000
But I also really liked the idea that, I mean, in a way it takes the pressure off me because I don't feel like I'm like hiding from them.

499
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:31,000
A lot of Kickstarters, when they get delayed, a lot of people are like, oh, you are clear with the backers or something like that. Like you failed to be up front.

500
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And I feel like the streams are a really good way for me to be like, hey, this is me and I'm doing it. So, you can't ever say I'm not doing it because this is me every week.

501
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Now, what's really cool is that if you somehow miss the boat on the Kickstarter, which I'm hanging my head in shame, I totally missed the Kickstarter. I didn't find out about this until later.

502
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But no, this is cool because I can still buy the game. If I go to timespinnergame.com, you're still offering a lot of similar types of rewards on your site right now.

503
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Can you tell us a little bit about that? Like if people want to actually kind of pre-order the game, they can do that, right?

504
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Right, right. On that page, there's three of the lowest Kickstarter tiers, or at least similar to them. You get the game for the lowest tier with one in-game item.

505
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And then the next two tiers also have in-game items associated with them. And you also get a soundtrack for the second tier.

506
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And the second tier also comes with development forum access. So, on the development forum, it's a special part. I have a forum for the game, and then there's a smaller subsection that has me posting pictures of stuff I'm working on that I wouldn't post on Tumblr because it's not quite finished.

507
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But it still gives people an opportunity to see how the game's coming even beyond the livestreams.

508
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So, you are very upfront. I mean, you've got these livestreams, you've got a forum, and this is just you communicating with all this, too. You're very busy. No wonder this is a full-time job now for you. Amazing.

509
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Now, I have to thank Princess Irene here in studio because I mentioned I was unfortunately late to the party. I apologize. But actually, Princess Irene's the one that turned me on to what you're doing there with Timespinner.

510
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So, I was curious if Irene, because you've been following this project a little longer than I have, if you might have anything you want to ask. By the way, Bodhi is here live with us on Sunday night. So, if you have a question over at live.vognetwork.com, ask away, and I will relay some of those questions. Irene?

511
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Well, hi.

512
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Hi.

513
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Well, first, I just want to say thank you because this game looks amazing, and it's kind of pretty much an amalgamation of everything I've ever wanted in a game, and I'm happy that there's a female protagonist. I can say a lot of things about it.

514
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But, you know, I don't know that I really have a lot of pressing questions or anything. Maybe just how are you enjoying being your own boss?

515
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's good. I don't think I would want it any other way right now. I thought about maybe going back after I shipped the game to maybe work at a big studio, and I don't think I'd be as happy as I am right now, or at least satisfied with my work.

516
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Sure. I'm not sure what you had done at Bungie or Microsoft or anything, so is this more fulfilling for you, or is it more tedious than you thought it was going to be, or how is it in comparison?

517
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'd say working at Microsoft was considerably more tedious because I was doing tests. And also, both jobs, I didn't really have much power, and that was also kind of frustrating for me.

518
00:45:46,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm obviously a creative person, and not being able to be creative in my work was very frustrating. And it probably is one of the main reasons why I ended up leaving was because I wasn't able to be creatively fulfilled in my work.

519
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And now I can do that. I can imagine things and then make them, and that's my job. And that's pretty cool.

520
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Very awesome. And I'm jealous.

521
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Irene, I know you wanted to curb the love fest a little bit, but I'm genuinely curious, as a gaming fan, A, how did you find out about this, and B, what was it that just made you go like, yes!

522
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yes, mama!

523
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Say!

524
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Well, I heard about it through Heartforth, Alicia, which had another strong female protagonist, and it just, you know, it's sending the same signals to me.

525
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
You know, it's got RPG elements, and it's a magic-based system, and just, I don't know, obviously the whole 16-bit graphic thing is pretty cool.

526
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Here is all of Irene's favorite games, and then we're going to put it in a blender.

527
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Yes, I mean, literally, like Final Fantasy Tactics, and just like, wow, okay, where do I pay my money? Take it all. So, yeah.

528
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I mean, technically, the game is a blender of all my favorite games. Like, I'm just kind of regurgitating the story and my imagination onto the same canvas as those games.

529
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Let me ask you, I know we have another question here in studio. Sorry, Piper. I just thought of something that I definitely want to ask, because this is a very tricky thing.

530
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I mean, you're an indie developer of games. I'm an indie commenter, you know, of the games industry and so forth, and one thing that I'm always kind of worried about is, you know, if I listen to too many other podcasts,

531
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and I do try to listen to a variety of podcasts to support my indie people, but I'm afraid I'm going to tell a joke that some other podcaster used, or I'm going to do something that was already done in another podcast.

532
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Are you worried about, and maybe how do you kind of make sure you don't cross that line where you're just, like, copying another game? Like, how do you kind of keep yourself in check in that regard, like, between influence and copy?

533
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
That's actually kind of difficult, and in fact, it's something I kind of screwed up on on the Kickstarter.

534
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:13,000
On the very first day, people realized that some of my tilesets, like the environment art for a couple of the areas, was really similar to Symphony of the Night.

535
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And, like, I addressed that on the first day. I'm like, yeah, I was learning how to do tilesets, and I wanted to learn from Castlevania, but when I was, like, kind of emulating that style, I didn't put any personal inspiration into it, and so people caught on to that.

536
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So it is something you really have to be careful with, that even though you're taking inspiration from something, you need to mix a part of your own imagination into it to make it different.

537
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:56,000
But I think, like for art, you have to be very careful, but for gameplay features, like for how it plays, like, I think a lot of games kind of rely on just taking, like, flat out taking elements from other games.

538
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Like, games are starting to take Dark Souls elements from it, or just like all Metroidvanias, they're taking elements, and that's okay, that they're outright taking it.

539
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:19,000
As long as you add a little bit more to it, your own flair. And that's the most important part, I think, is adding to someone else's stuff is what makes it okay.

540
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Okay. Let me go over, we have a couple questions to chat, but I actually want to go over to Piper, here in studio, who also has a question.

541
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Hello.

542
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Hi.

543
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So I don't want to bulldoze the sentiment, I guess, but yeah, it's similar to everybody else, I'm in love with the project, I've been following it for some time as well, and it's a blender of basically everything that's, oh man, no words.

544
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm not a programmer, or have anything to do with the video games other than playing them, but I'm a writer, and I was curious as to if you get inspiration from doing this for a secondary project, if you have your mind on anything in the future, or if this is taking all of your time.

545
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I think every time I'm doing something creative, I always end up getting kind of tangent ideas that aren't with my current project, and I definitely have ideas for future games, and it just kind of happens.

546
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I just want to point out, the tangent train is not exclusive to podcasts, therefore, the tangent train is a very real thing, even in game development.

547
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Right.

548
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
There you go.

549
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Great.

550
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That's a great question.

551
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah, actually, let me dive into that a little bit, and then I'll get to these chat questions, but the writing, I mean, that's kind of something you have to do a little more originally.

552
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Where are you inspired with your writing, specifically, for the story?

553
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm going to be upfront.

554
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I'm really bad at dialogue and actual story words, so I'm actually bringing on someone to help me with that and kind of make the story a little more fleshed out.

555
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:14,000
But I really like world building, or at least the idea of creating worlds, and here's our history, and here's what happened on this world, and the people on it, and how the people are different from people in other worlds.

556
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And the actual Time Spinner universe takes place in a story that I've been kind of building since I was a kid, and future games that I make will definitely still carry on in that same game universe.

557
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Story, universe, yeah.

558
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Excellent.

559
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, Irene?

560
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Okay, yeah, just to, I guess, follow up on that.

561
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I know that you, well, at least I read that you've been, you've conceived of this idea many years ago, like nearly 20 years ago, and that you have this whole universe that this world is sort of kind of a part of, like tangential to.

562
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So if, I guess this is kind of a premature question to ask right now, but if Time Spinner, for some crazy reason, doesn't end up meeting the goals that you want it to, like if it's not your definition of successful, are you planning on continuing the story in the universe through maybe another venue?

563
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Like, I know your thing is game design, but maybe you could collaborate with someone else to continue the universe on, or, I mean, maybe that's, I don't know.

564
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I feel like the story of, like the story universe is really important to me. And, like, I would be sad if I had to drop it, even if I, like, Time Spinner didn't do well.

565
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
So yeah, I think I would still try to use that story somehow.

566
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
It's going to do amazing, you know, but it's just a hypothetical, yeah.

567
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I was going to say, Negative Nancy, he did amazing on the Kickstarter, so.

568
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You know, I just had to find a way to ask that, okay?

569
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Asking the tough questions, Barbara Walters over there.

570
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
All right, go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

571
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
We've got Dungeon Buster saying, it's great to hear about the streams.

572
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I've seen too many projects and good feelings wither on the vine because the devs fell out of updating their community.

573
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
But you've done very good at, you know, kind of keeping up with the forums and all this other stuff.

574
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So just kind of getting some props there in our chatroom.

575
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Thanks.

576
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And Dart Tetsuya says, any games in particular that inspired you in making Time Spinners?

577
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Well, I know we've talked an awful lot already about like, you know, Symphony of the Night and so forth.

578
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But maybe let me twist Dart Tetsuya's question a little bit here and ask you, is there maybe a game that people would be surprised to know?

579
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I mean, you can look at Time Spinner and go, oh, okay, there's that Metroidvania vibe to it.

580
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But is there a game that people might be surprised to know actually influenced Time Spinner?

581
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Huh.

582
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
That's kind of an interesting question.

583
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:49,000
There was I mean, there's a Castlevania game that in particular I'm taking really heavy influence from called Order of Ecclesia.

584
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
That was the best. Okay. That was the second best in that style.

585
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah. Like, I absolutely love that game and I cosplayed the main character and everything.

586
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But yeah, the huh.

587
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I mean, I was pretty upfront with the inspiration on the Kickstarter besides that.

588
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Like, that's the only game I didn't really mention in the Kickstarter.

589
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Okay. Well, okay.

590
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I think that one might be a little weird for people because Star Ocean is like an RPG that's not really Metroidvania-esque.

591
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
But I feel like I really like the story of the first one, even though some people thought it was a mess.

592
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But I enjoyed it.

593
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
All right. All right.

594
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Just a couple more questions here, and then we've got to let Bodhi get back to developing you guys.

595
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
But just a couple more questions here from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

596
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
SH21 Hunter Matt is asking, do you get burned out when you're working?

597
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
If so, what tactics do you use to get back on track?

598
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I do suffer a lot from burnout.

599
00:54:49,000 --> 00:55:01,000
The problem with me is that if I work on the same thing, for example, like if I'm doing a tileset for an area and I do it for like a week straight,

600
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
then I get sick of it and I don't want to work on it anymore and I'm not inspired anymore.

601
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
So what I do is I try to jump to a completely unrelated task.

602
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And since I do programming and art, that works out pretty well.

603
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So like my most recent burnout was on, just like I said, the tileset for like a city level I'm working on.

604
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:28,000
So what I did was I went completely tangential to work on the inventory menu.

605
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And that like broke me out of the burnout.

606
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So yeah, just hopping between completely different fields helps me out.

607
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And I'm actually trying to take weekends off, seeing if that helps. Maybe it won't. I don't know.

608
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
All right. Yeah, you got to have a day off once in a while.

609
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And I think that's, you know, despite the Kickstarter and I know there's that pressure to deliver and so forth,

610
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
if you don't have that mental wellness, then, you know, it's going to affect things negatively.

611
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So give yourself some time off once in a while.

612
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
ActDeaf in chat, speaking of that, let me ask this and I guess I'll wrap up after this question.

613
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
But ActDeaf says, how big is the pressure from being a Kickstarter backed project?

614
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And ActDeaf also clarifies, like, I don't want to sound rude.

615
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And I don't think that's necessarily a rude question.

616
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
But, you know, how is that kind of pressure from being a Kickstarter backed project?

617
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It's definitely a lot more pressure than before the Kickstarter.

618
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Like before the Kickstarter, I kind of was just working on stuff that I knew I needed to do.

619
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
But whenever I was inspired to do it, I would work on it.

620
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And then if I felt like this wasn't progressing very well, I just jumped to something else.

621
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Now, when I have like a release date, like that I've told people about, there is a lot of pressure and it's stressful.

622
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
But I'm doing okay. I'm managing.

623
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And yeah, I think it's going to work out.

624
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And I think the fact that I'm being fairly upfront with people, especially with like the live streams in the forum,

625
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
that even if I do slip, that it'll be okay. So I'm not freaking out too hard.

626
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
All right. Well, we're all rooting for you.

627
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And you've given yourself plenty of time to deliver a quality product.

628
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And it's looking like it's coming along really good so far.

629
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So we're all very hopeful here at OLR.

630
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Irene, want to close out here one more question?

631
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I do. And it's a really quick one.

632
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Top three favorite games ever go?

633
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Final Fantasy Tactics, Castlevania Symphony Night, and Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

634
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Like I've played those many times and I'm going to play them many times in the future.

635
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Let me ask you this since we ask a lot of our, I know I keep saying one more question.

636
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I lied.

637
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
We ask a lot of our guests that come here on OLR,

638
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
what have you been playing lately?

639
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Like, obviously, besides your own game, what have you been playing lately?

640
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Like any newer stuff? Or do you focus simply on retro stuff?

641
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Or is there anything kind of lately you've been playing?

642
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Lately, it's been a mix of AAA and Indie.

643
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So the last couple games have been, so I'm doing Destiny right now.

644
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Before that, it was like Dark Souls 2 and all of its never-ending DLCs.

645
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And then on the Indie side, like I recently fell into Don't Starve.

646
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I had to like beat Adventure Mode so that I would stop playing it.

647
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Because it's like, oh, I beat it and now I don't have to play it anymore.

648
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And also like Crypt of the Necrodancer and I've been playing like the Chasm Alpha, which is pretty fun too.

649
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
So it's a good mix of Indie and AAA, I think.

650
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
All right. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show tonight.

651
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I know we've taken up almost a half hour of your time, but we really appreciate you coming on here.

652
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
We really want to wish you the best of luck with the game.

653
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
This is really cool because most people come on here, you know, when the Kickstarter's in progress.

654
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
But, you know, you're funded. This game's going to happen. So this is really cool.

655
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And if people want to continue to check out the progress, they can head over to Timespinnergame.com.

656
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Anything else you want to throw out there, Bode? Like Twitter, Facebook?

657
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I don't know if there's other places online you want people to follow you.

658
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
It's everywhere basically at LunarRayGames.com.

659
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
So it's like on Twitter, it's at LunarRayGames and Facebook slash that.

660
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yeah, same on YouTube and Twitch. So that's where you can find me.

661
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Awesome. Well, we wish you the best of luck with Timespinner.

662
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And I know I will be pre-ordering the game.

663
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And I think some of us here in OLRS, you can thank Irene probably sold probably like five copies of the game here in studio.

664
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So there you go.

665
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yay!

666
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I can tell you one thing. I was watching the trailer again today and my husband walks past me and goes,

667
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
You're ordering this, right?

668
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yeah, I just bought it.

669
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Nice.

670
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You're welcome.

671
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Well, there it is. Best of luck and I hope we'll be able to check in with you again a little closer to the game's release and talk about the excitement of the big game release.

672
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yeah, sounds good.

673
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
All right, keep us posted. Thanks again for your time tonight, Bode, and best of luck with Timespinner.

674
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Yeah, thanks for having me.

675
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Have a good night.

676
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
All right, you too. Bye.

677
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Bye.

678
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
All right, that was, again, Bode Lee with Lunar Array Games, Timespinner.

679
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Early on in the interview, I accidentally said Timespinner because my fat finger typed an S.

680
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
But it's Timespinner, so be sure to check that out. Timespinnergame.com.

681
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Fantastic. Talk to him. That's great.

682
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And it's so interesting to kind of hear about the similarities between like what I do as an indie broadcaster and what he's doing as an indie developer and how many similarities.

683
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I like how he kind of talks about, you know, sometimes I just have to get up and walk away and I'm like, God, I've wanted to do that so many times during this show.

684
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Me too.

685
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
That's what I appreciate about him. He's rural, you know?

686
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Yeah.

687
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
He's keeping it rural.

688
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
He's the boss and all that stuff and none of that corporate BS with these indie games.

689
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Yeah. I can die now, by the way. That was great. I'm so happy.

690
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
But you must live to play the game.

691
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah. Yeah. But if I did die, you know, I'd be like, can you just send a copy to, well, actually be hell, I guess.

692
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yeah. Anyway, I'll get into that.

693
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You've taken it to a dark place here on OLR.

694
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
A little bit.

695
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Just send that care of the lake of fire.

696
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Anyway, thank you again for helping.

697
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Most people, I don't know if you know, but Princess Irene kind of really helped me get in touch and bring my attention to that whole thing. So I appreciate it.

698
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
You're welcome. Thank you for interviewing him.

699
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You're welcome. All right.

700
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Let's get into some gaming news from the indie world to the AAA world, everything in between.

701
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Let's get into some gaming news tonight. And please, to our guests here in studio, please raise your hand, grab a mic, feel free to comment on anything as we're going through tonight's news. Loki.

702
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Well, I have news about an online game starting with D that's having server problems. No, it's not Destiny. It's actually Drive Club.

703
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Drive Club, unfortunately, has had some problems with servers not working or not working at all.

704
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I don't know if anyone's actually been able to connect online and play with other people, but apparently it's really rough right now.

705
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,000
To kind of fix that, or at least work towards fixing that, they've started disabling features, I guess.

706
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So, unfortunately, some of the social features, I guess, have been disconnected, including challenges, updates, and I guess leaderboards and some of the other stuff like online multiplayer racing should be playable, although it's probably going to be a little bit tricky to get in line.

707
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And, of course, because of all these server problems, they halted the release of the PlayStation Plus version of Drive Club, so you won't be able to get that kind of piecemeal version of the game for, you know, Plus subscribers.

708
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:02,000
But it'll be coming later on. They just haven't said yet when that's going to be. So, that sucks, but...

709
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
God, every time I'm hearing about this game, I swear to God, the news is something like this.

710
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:27,000
You know, I just, I think, you know, the social features, I'm not really sure if it's that important. I'm not sure if it's anything like, you know, because when I think of Drive Club, I think of like Forza Horizon, and I don't know if it's just...

711
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Obviously, I don't think it's open world, so you're not racing with each other, but I don't know. It seems like the game was delayed because of social and online features before, and now it's being delayed, sort of, again.

712
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It seems like when it was released, it still wasn't quite ready yet. I just... I don't know. It's kind of disappointing.

713
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Do you think this game is hosed now because of all these problems? Because I kind of think Sony has this really amazing way of being able to, like, make people forget about fuck-ups.

714
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I mean, you know, remember the whole credit card breach, and they were like, oh, nobody actually had money stolen. Here's some free games. We'll just forget that ever happened, y'all.

715
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I don't think that it's hosed. I mean, it's only been a few days since the game came out. I hope it gets better quicker than, say, Battlefield 4.

716
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I just hope that they fix the problem quickly, because that kind of sucks, since it is a comparable racing title to Forza Horizon, and I don't know, Horizon just sounds more exciting to me.

717
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Why can't Forza Horizon be on the PlayStation 4? It'd be a perfect world.

718
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
But no, it's just that ActDeft in chat says Forza Horizon 2 wins this round, I think, so far.

719
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah, unfortunately. Well, there's things about that, too. I don't know. It's a little disappointing, because if I was going to get PlayStation 4, this would have been kind of one of the games I wanted to get, but it's not quite Forza Horizon or even, like, Gran Turismo.

720
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:01,000
But, you know, there will be other racing games coming out. I mean, there's plenty of other racing games. The Crew, I guess, is quite open world, so hopefully that's a little bit better.

721
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And then, also, was it, not Drive Club, but Project Cars is going to be coming out later in about a month or so, so there's options.

722
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I sort of think, too, because there's that PlayStation Plus angle with this game where they're going to give a significant portion of it or a very meaty demo or whatever away for free, and I use my quotey fingers, because, you know, you have to have a PlayStation Plus account.

723
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
But I think a lot of people that own Sony products now have one, because, well, A, you have to have it to play online now.

724
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Yeah, I was going to say, if you want to play Drive Club, you probably want to have that.

725
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Exactly, right? So, I kind of think, and, you know, there's a lot of people who are like, oh, this game failed. I'm not going to play this game now, and I'm like, yeah, you are.

726
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
If you have a PlayStation Plus account and they come out and it's free, you're going to download it.

727
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It's just like Destiny or Diablo 3 or Battlefield 4 people are still playing, even though it's just, how long did it take them to fix that shit? I mean, a long time.

728
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:05,000
So, I don't know, it's just, it might be one of those games that, like, I don't need to get right away, maybe wait for it to come down in price a little bit.

729
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Or, hey, you know what, if you really kind of, well, I don't know what the performance is going to be on this, you're probably going to have PlayStation Plus already.

730
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Just wait for the demo to come out. Check it out. If it's something that you want, buy it. If it's not, enjoy what free part of it you got.

731
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:30,000
There you go. I think for me, like, I just want to get in there and, like, control it to know, like, is this something that I can actually play? Like, Forza, Burnout, or Mario Kart, a little more arcade style?

732
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Or is this going to be like, you know, Gran Turismo, where I'm just consistently crashing into the wall?

733
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Well, that's the thing, is it's by the guys that did Motorstorm, and I loved, like, Motorstorm Apocalypse, which was a game that no one really cared for, but...

734
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
That was the one that came with the 3D TV, wasn't it?

735
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:52,000
They had one, yeah, that came with that, but no, it was a great game. I mean, it was one of those games that I bought a review copy or something like that.

736
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:01,000
It came out right before the whole network thing went down for, you know, a few weeks, and that was when they delayed the release of that, so I got to play it for, like, a month before it came out.

737
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:07,000
It was fantastic. I love that game, and I even like the other Motorstorm games, even though they're a little bit frustrating and whatever.

738
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
But I'm curious to see how this game is, you know, different, because obviously it's a different, you know, it's not an off-road racing game.

739
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I don't know.

740
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Now, I see JVMon in our chat room over there, inciting some Forza chat there throughout all this, so wait a minute, JVMon, what's going on here?

741
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Are you poo-pooing Drive Club and you're just like, who cares?

742
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I honestly had no idea it came out. It's been pushed back for so long, and when the story came out, I was like, oh, it finally released.

743
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Well, sorta.

744
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It either did or it didn't.

745
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
There wasn't much fanfare about it, that's the thing.

746
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It's like that furniture they bought at IKEA, and then they built it backwards accidentally, you know, like after all this time.

747
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
There's probably still a piece or two missing.

748
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Why do I have screws left over?

749
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It's a hack.

750
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
IKEA hack.

751
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:07,000
But that's the thing, seriously, when you look at major Sony titles coming out for the fourth quarter, they don't have a whole ton. It's Drive Club and LittleBigPlanet 3.

752
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Wasn't Drive Club supposed to be this big super launch title for the PS4 and it's a year later?

753
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Yeah, at one point.

754
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
It sorta just limps out of the gate with problems.

755
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
It kinda lowered expectations, but I mean, again, just because this game has all these problems right now, I mean, let's be real.

756
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
If the game kicks ass in a couple weeks, everybody will forget.

757
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Oh, I'm totally gonna play it.

758
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Two words. Diablo 3. Anything can be fixed in gaming now. Like, seriously, that's always gonna be...

759
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
No matter how fucked up a game is, I'm gonna be like, remember Diablo 3, y'all? Remember? That game was a hot fuckin' mess and now look at it.

760
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Or, this is very familiar to me, like, remember Lair? Remember how that was supposed to be a fuckin' kickass launch title and it got delayed?

761
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Was that the one with the flying dragons on the sixth axis? Oh, yeah. Boy, oh, boy.

762
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Alright, Brad from Pod Culture talking about racing games in our chat room saying, a blur for the PlayStation 4 would be great.

763
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Yes, it would. Boy, that really sucks that somebody had to close that studio. Fuckin' jerk.

764
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I would buy somebody a second PlayStation 4 just so I can have somebody play a PS4 version of Blur.

765
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Right? I guess I can kind of cross my fingers and toes that maybe somehow this whole, like, Sierra, I mean, Sierra's doing the Geometry Wars now.

766
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Yeah, because that was Bizarre Creations, right?

767
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Now, I know Criterion's working on some other sort of extreme sports game that's not Burnout, but god, I would love a new Burnout.

768
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yeah, that'd be nice. That'd be nice. Alright, let's move on. Now, remember how I talked about, hey, Sony.

769
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Sony has a way of making you kind of, like, come around and worship at the altar of Sony, right?

770
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Well, sure enough, they did, boy, they did a big one this week. Remember when VibRibbon showed up at E3 and we were all like, yes, VibRibbon, oh my god, they're going to announce a new VibRibbon, ah!

771
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And then they didn't, and everybody was like, stop fucking being a tease, yo.

772
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So, they ended up, actually, what happened this past week, Sony kind of, like, I don't want to say they apologized, but they did kind of come out and say, you know, when we were talking about it at E3, we knew it was out in Europe and Japan, we kind of forgot that it wasn't out in North America, so you know what?

773
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,000
It's out now on PlayStation 3 and PS Vita, so if you want to play VibRibbon, you can go get it right now on PlayStation 3.

774
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
No PS4?

775
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Not on PS4, because, the reason is because, remember, VibRibbon is a PlayStation 1 game and it has all the features, you can actually eject, well, it's a download game, so there would be no disk in your PS3 drive unless you still have another game in there, but you can actually put a CD in the PlayStation 3 drive and it will do that whole custom soundtrack like it did before. Can't do that on the Vita, though.

776
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I will admit that we partly bought our JPS2 so I could play VibRibbon without having to hold the thing down and do the other thing.

777
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Paperclip and all that.

778
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah, on my PS1.

779
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I'm kind of poor, so are they going to release it for the Commodore 64 anytime soon?

780
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Probably not. I don't think the Sony game will be on the 3DS anytime soon, so I don't, unfortunately.

781
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:26,000
But, you know, it is, to finish answering the question why it's not on PlayStation 4, it's a PlayStation 1 game essentially being emulated, and keep in mind PlayStation 4 isn't playing emulated games at all right now. PlayStation 4 does have PlayStation Now, which someday will have the PS2 and the PS1 games in it too, but it's not there yet.

782
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
There's also the rumor that eventually it's going to have native PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 support, but...

783
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
That'd be tricky.

784
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
That'd be tricky.

785
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Somebody could probably build a pretty kick-ass emulator, but I don't know, 2 and 3 would get pretty difficult, so we'll see what happens.

786
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I mean, a Vita can play PlayStation 1 games, and fuck, PlayStation 4 should be able to play PlayStation 1 games.

787
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
It really should. It really should.

788
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Bond's 006 in our chatroom saying, so is VibRibbon better than AudioSurf?

789
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
They're both pretty good. AudioSurf's only on PC though, and VibRibbon's not, so...

790
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Speaking of which, if you're on a budget, you know, there's a PlayStation TV coming out in like a week, and you could play VibRibbon on that.

791
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
A PlayStation TV?

792
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Yeah, it's a Vita without a screen that you plug into your TV for 99 bucks.

793
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Ninety-nine dollars? Do you know how many things on the McDonald's dollar menu you can buy with 99 dollars?

794
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Ninety-nine.

795
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
That's how many.

796
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Tax.

797
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Ooh, girl.

798
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Ninety-nine in Oregon. Oh, alright.

799
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Alright, so yeah, you check out VibRibbon now. I will admit, I didn't get around to downloading it, but I'm going to, because I'm very excited about it.

800
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:49,000
But it's like, I gotta go back and turn the PS3 on. I've been doing nothing but picks the cat on my PlayStation 4. Come on.

801
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Well, thankfully my PS3 is hooked up, so I am definitely going to be getting VibRibbon as soon as I get a day off.

802
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
To be fair, back in the day, you were doing picks the cat on your 3DS as well.

803
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
You mean picks of the cat on my 3D? I see what you did there. That was a little bit of a highbrow joke.

804
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Womp womp.

805
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Boy, you are just comedy fucking gold tonight. Alright, let's move on.

806
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Well, how about-

807
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Feel like there needs to be a two drink minimum to listen to this show, Logie.

808
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I'm already on my second drink.

809
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I could have some more coffee, that'd be great.

810
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Thanks Rob.

811
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
It's a settlement by the way, Logie.

812
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Free Red Bull?

813
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Yeah, it's like $15, because apparently Red Bull-

814
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
It's $10.

815
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
It's $10 or $15 in Red Bull product. You know which one Logie's opting for.

816
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I'd just rather have the $10 and then go buy like a monster.

817
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Because they came out and said, you know, hey, we mis-marketed Red Bull and it might be unhealthy for you. And Logie's like, yay, more.

818
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Did Red Bull decide this on their own or did people sue them for it?

819
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
It's a settlement.

820
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It's a settlement because it doesn't actually turn you into some sort of pegasus or something.

821
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
You know, so unfortunately-

822
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
You don't grow a tail from breaking red.

823
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
You're not the one winged angel anymore.

824
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I wonder if I could then do the same thing about Rockstar putting my husband in the hospital.

825
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Oh, that's probably already happened.

826
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Probably. I'll just have to tell him to look for a class action and we can get it on that.

827
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
A lot of Rockstars end up in the hospital, so.

828
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And then, and then we'll probably just use it to buy coffee.

829
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Logie, do we know what this means for the Flugtag?

830
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Is that shut down?

831
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I don't think so. I think they're still going crazy with, you know, all sorts of extreme sports things in the name of Red Bull.

832
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Flying machines.

833
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Four Locos okay though, right?

834
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Oh, that's been banned for a while now.

835
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Becky and I were actually having conversations like if our legal system actually used the common sense rule, how many of these class action lawsuits would never go through and how much smarter our population would probably be.

836
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Think about the lawyers. They need jobs too.

837
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I try not to. I get nauseous.

838
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I'm sorry.

839
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,000
So anyway, there, we had mentioned the PS Vita before. There is going to be something very special coming out for Vita.

840
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
And that's Minecraft! Yay!

841
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Basically it's going to be on PSN a day before it is in Europe.

842
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And it's also basically anybody who has a copy of it on PS3 will get the Vita copy for free.

843
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And that's also people who own physical as well as PSN versions.

844
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:34,000
And it's supposed to be out on November 11th. It's a cross offer so basically you buy one, you get the other.

845
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You can upgrade the PS4 one for $5 more and you can do transfers between PS3 and Vita as well as your DLC.

846
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
So hooray Minecraft people!

847
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
God it would be even more awesome if you could play with people on the PS3 on the Vita.

848
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Yeah, or even 3 and 4 would be kind of nice.

849
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Or any of them, yes.

850
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I have Minecraft on the PS4 but that's...

851
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Well I understand why you wouldn't be able to with the PS4 because the worlds are bigger so that would be kind of like,

852
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Hi, I'm outside the world. You can't come with me.

853
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
No, PlayStation 3 and the Vita one I think are pretty much the same.

854
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
God, I almost want a PlayStation TV for that.

855
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
But that would be such a waste of money because I have a PlayStation 3.

856
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
You're right, that would actually be a waste of money.

857
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
What is the goal of getting Minecraft on the PlayStation TV? To play Minecraft on your TV?

858
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Wait, you can do that already!

859
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I don't know. I wouldn't even want to do that because I have it on PC.

860
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Exactly, and you can mod it on PC.

861
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Are people still playing Minecraft? Like nobody's tired of it?

862
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Oh yeah, go onto the PlayStation Live or go onto Twitch and there's still tons of people streaming Minecraft.

863
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Apparently Microsoft thinks so.

864
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
You did hear Microsoft paid like 2 billion dollars.

865
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Yeah, and I'm confounded by all of this.

866
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I was walking through the toy aisle at Target the other day and there was a freaking foam Minecraft pickaxe.

867
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
And Lego sets too. I want those Lego sets.

868
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
There's tons of stuff.

869
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Like Kmart had a bin of the, I was there buying toilet paper.

870
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
But they had, well because the toilet paper is the only thing there that's not out of style.

871
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But they had a little bin of Minecraft plushies too, like the animals.

872
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
As long as there are 10 year olds alive, Minecraft will be relevant.

873
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yeah, I mean remember it is still really huge in the family friendly market, so to speak.

874
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Zenthral in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, do people still play Minecraft? Does a bear shit in the woods?

875
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
There you go. Wow, I guess you just got told there.

876
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
A bear shits wherever it needs to shit.

877
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
If a bear wants to shit on the hood of your car, that's where a bear will shit.

878
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And maybe the animals in Minecraft will soon shit. We'll see.

879
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Who got told now? Ooh, bears can shit anywhere.

880
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Well, before too long you're going to be able to Minecraft on anything too, so.

881
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
You're going to Minecraft on it.

882
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Alright, let's travel around the world.

883
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I'm done.

884
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
You can't even? Are you unable to?

885
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
This one can't.

886
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Can this only be fixed to the pumpkin spice latte at this point?

887
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
You could go make me coffee again.

888
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Let's travel around the world first and check out some release dates. Listen to her. Go get me coffee, Rob.

889
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Wow, that's very, like, demanding.

890
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I'm a great guest. No, I was kidding, Rob. I don't want any more of your coffee.

891
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Okay. Well, I want some release dates. Let's get to it.

892
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase DOG.

893
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Alright, let's get to it. I'm extremely excited because this week we have Borderlands the Pre-Seeker coming out on PlayStation 3,

894
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Xbox 360, and PC. Sorry people that have those newer systems.

895
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:03,000
You don't get to play Borderlands yet until they release the inevitable, like, HDR version of the Borderlands trilogy.

896
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
So, expect that probably in 2015 because that seems to be the trend.

897
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, 3DS, and that's it.

898
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:28,000
God, why? Duck Dynasty for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, 3DS, and Wii U.

899
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Rednecks play games too, remember.

900
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
As long as people are buying that, like, big game hunter and all that stuff, I'm sure there's a...

901
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Somebody does.

902
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Okay, so what's classier? Cabela's or Duck Dynasty?

903
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Cabela's, actually.

904
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Yes.

905
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Now that we all agree.

906
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Wow, that was a weird fucking conversation. Alright.

907
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Let's see. The Evil Within coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

908
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Sleeping Dogs, the definitive edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

909
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Oh my gosh.

910
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Walking Dead complete first season on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

911
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Walking Dead season 2 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

912
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Poptropica, Forgotten Islands on 3DS.

913
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Pets games, Pets Countryside and Pets Beach on 3DS.

914
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I think this was delayed, but Senran Kagura, Shinobi vs. Limited, the Let's Get Physical edition, if I remember correctly.

915
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
The Olivia Newton-John edition.

916
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I was just thinking the same thing.

917
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
It's on Vita.

918
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Let's see what else here.

919
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Tears to Tierra 2, Heir of the Overlord on PlayStation 3.

920
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:57,000
And they're doing it against the re-release of Need for Speed Rivals, the complete edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and Xbox One.

921
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Oh gosh. There's a lot of stuff.

922
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Well, we're getting into that holiday season.

923
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
That is it.

924
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Alright, that's it. Well, traveling over to Japan, very different story.

925
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,000
There's a lot of releases on the 23rd, but for this week, the 16th, only the Vita is seeing releases right now.

926
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Because you know the Vita, it's kind of a different story over in Japan.

927
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
There's lots and lots of releases in Japan for the Vita, and this week no exception.

928
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Your releases this week on the PlayStation Vita, Dramatical Murder Re-Code in regular and limited edition.

929
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Dramatical Murder.

930
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I like that. I like that.

931
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Let's see. Chaos Rings 3 Prequel Trilogy comes out from Square Enix on the Vita this week.

932
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And lastly, Amnesia World Later Cross Crowd V Edition.

933
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
There it is.

934
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Is that it?

935
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I know, it really is.

936
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Poor chopped cactus hairline.

937
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
What is Amnesia World? I forgot.

938
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Where's that trombone?

939
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
We'll just have to flush that one down the toilet.

940
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I have the fail ones bookmarked just for this program.

941
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
When it's time to be alive.

942
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I wasn't going to break the fourth wall and be like, Irene, get away from that toilet.

943
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
You'll notice I don't have the win ones bookmarked, just the lose ones.

944
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
There's a reason.

945
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Hey, let's go to Europe.

946
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Sure. Let's go right now. Bye.

947
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I'm actually going to do the next two weeks just because we won't be here.

948
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Breaking news. Super important.

949
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Very important. LocoPoco in chat.

950
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Dramatical Murder is a BL slash yaoi game, Sky.

951
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Whoa. Well, this Dramatical Murder just got a lot hotter.

952
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Um, BRB going to get Dramatical Murder. Is it Sexy Murder? What is this?

953
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Does it involve corn cobs?

954
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Murder Dramatica.

955
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Irene, what did you say over there?

956
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Gonna murder that ass.

957
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
That's it.

958
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
This is the murder he wrote.

959
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Murder that ass. You're the one that just ate McDonald's.

960
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Hey, how about Europe?

961
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Oh yeah, Europe. Hey.

962
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Stop following me to the bathroom, you guys.

963
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I forgot to take the microphone with you.

964
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
On the 14th of October, we have Peggle 2 for PS4, The Evil Within for a bunch of stuff.

965
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
On the 15th, we have VibRibbon in the UK for Vita and PS3.

966
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,000
On October 17th, Borderlands is a pre-sequel, which is super fun, and I suggest everybody get it because it's awesome.

967
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:59,000
F1 2014 on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360. On the 21st, Dreamfall Chapter is Book 1.

968
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
And then the Dreamfall Chapter is The Longest Journey.

969
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
On the 22nd, Chromia. The 23rd, Stealth Inc. 2.

970
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:16,000
24th, Bayonetta 2, both for Wii U. Just Dance 2015, which I know you're all excited about.

971
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Shadow Warrior and Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth.

972
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Back to Bayonetta real quick. Those are bundled together, correct? The first one comes with, okay.

973
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Yeah, it's some type of like...

974
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
That is listed separate listings in the UK, so...

975
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Yeah. Just so you know, by the way, Irene, your little quote has our chat room up in arms there.

976
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And Dartitsuya says, yeah, I can't even right now. Congratulations, our chatters cannot even.

977
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
The listeners are unable to. They cannot.

978
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
You're welcome.

979
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Pumpkin spice for all.

980
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Rob.

981
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Alright.

982
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Rob.

983
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Yes.

984
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Rob.

985
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
What?

986
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Rob.

987
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
What?

988
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Coffee.

989
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
How about we do a couple more?

990
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I found the ferret the other day.

991
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
How about we do...

992
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Oh, lord, I thought we'd burn that thing. Alright.

993
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Midna found the ferret.

994
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Of course.

995
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
There was like four or five of them. They've got to be around.

996
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
The original one's at my house.

997
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Some of them we gave to listeners, too. Like, very special, like, super fans.

998
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
So, anyway.

999
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
They're expensive to buy nowadays.

1000
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Yeah, they are.

1001
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I'm not talking about the guy from My Own Heart who is streaming Hot to Full Boyfriend, which I still do every Tuesday between five and six.

1002
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Did you see now there's a Kickstarter for a bear dating sim?

1003
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
No.

1004
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And I'm not talking about, like, you know, what you'd see at the Bolt on Saturday, but I'm talking about...

1005
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
No.

1006
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I got so much less exciting.

1007
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
It doesn't get any better than dating pigeons.

1008
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Somebody wants to make a game where you date bears.

1009
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Well, good for them. I'm going to keep playing the pigeons.

1010
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Alright.

1011
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Can they shit anywhere?

1012
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
We'll probably get them on the show and we'll ask, won't we?

1013
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Thank you.

1014
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Alright.

1015
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Barbara Walters over there asking the hard questions.

1016
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Just a couple...

1017
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
In your game, can the bears shit wherever they want?

1018
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Do the bears have a choice of defecation location?

1019
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Is the shit high-res or is it in pixels?

1020
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Alright, a couple more stories for you guys.

1021
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
That's it. I want to make a game called Pixel Shit.

1022
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
The classic...

1023
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Help. The show is losing control. Help. Help.

1024
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
You OLR dream game pixel shit.

1025
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I can't even right now. A couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.

1026
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Logie, help.

1027
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
For some reason, when I hear it was a defecation location, it makes me think of...

1028
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Was it a conjunction junction or something?

1029
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Schoolhouse Rock.

1030
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
That should be a Schoolhouse Rock song.

1031
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Anyways, so apparently Unity may or may not be up for sale.

1032
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It's kind of confusing. Some thoughts are, yeah, they're looking for someone to buy them.

1033
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
It may be Google. Google might be offering them money.

1034
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
No one seems to know. But it's possible that they may sell out.

1035
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I really wish this was a little bit more...

1036
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I don't know. Firm?

1037
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I think everyone's kind of on the lookout of companies acquiring other companies right now.

1038
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Especially since we've just had a few major ones with Twitch and Mojang, Oculus.

1039
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I've been hearing Google might be buying Unity for a while now.

1040
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
But we'll see. I guess you'll just have to wait for the actual Unity was purchased by Google.

1041
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Apparently Google wants to buy something.

1042
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I always want to buy something.

1043
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Hey Google, want to buy an online network with some podcasts?

1044
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
If they're looking to seriously get into...

1045
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I don't even really have to...

1046
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I don't know what the point would be in buying them.

1047
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Other than locking it down, more funding maybe. That'd be kind of cool.

1048
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I'm just worried that's going to go the route of one of these other companies.

1049
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I know one of the ones I saw in a lot of these articles citing renderware and stuff, the EA bought them and kind of shut them down.

1050
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:15,000
So I don't know. But I like Unity. Hopefully if someone does buy them, they kind of leave them alone and just give them money.

1051
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Because that'd be nice.

1052
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Leave me alone and give me money.

1053
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
That's a good company.

1054
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
That sounds like my marriage.

1055
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
No, no, no.

1056
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Definitely since you can export to Android and stuff, it's obviously something that pleases Google since you can have a lot more content on there.

1057
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:45,000
And thank God that they're sane and don't require you to own an Apple to fucking publish to iOS. Thank you, Apple.

1058
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
So, yeah.

1059
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Alright. Let's move on and talk about a game that I'm sure is going to be sucking down a lot of money because it has the name Final Fantasy in it.

1060
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So with that reason, people are going to be like, here's my money.

1061
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
This is Final Fantasy Explorers, which is coming out soon in Japan. And this is...

1062
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Irene might be up your alley. I don't know because it is a 3DS game.

1063
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Actually, this might be more a Piper's thing if he's a big theater fan.

1064
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Final Fantasy Explorers, you heard much about this?

1065
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I have not yet.

1066
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Not yet? Alright. Final Fantasy Explorers is kind of like Final Fantasy meets Monster Hunter.

1067
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
That's kind of what this is all about.

1068
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Because you know Monster Hunter is like huge over in Japan, right?

1069
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
So they're making this game and it is coming out in Japan pretty soon.

1070
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
But Final Fantasy Explorers is going to have some things that you don't typically see in 3DS titles.

1071
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
For one of them, it's not going to have full 3D.

1072
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
That's right. You're going to have a 3DS game with no 3D.

1073
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
You can finally play a game on your 2DS.

1074
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Essentially, yes.

1075
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Well, now to be fair, I was kind of thinking, I was like, have there been other games that have done this?

1076
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,000
And actually, yes. Pokemon X and Y had this too, where only the battles were in 3D, I think.

1077
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And then all the overworld stuff was in 2D, but let's be real.

1078
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
You want to talk about a game that was for the 2DS?

1079
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
That was just a Pokemon system was what that thing was, right?

1080
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
So yeah, Final Fantasy Explorers, not going to feature 3D throughout the whole game.

1081
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
However, it will feature support for, are you ready for this?

1082
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
The Circle Pad Pro.

1083
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Did anybody pick one of those up when Kid Icarus was all the rage?

1084
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
No.

1085
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
But if you happen to have one, Final Fantasy Explorers will support that.

1086
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:26,000
It should also be noted that the new 3DS and the features that are available on that system will also be supported by Final Fantasy Explorers.

1087
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Because the new 3DS will have that extra stick, so that can control the camera and the extra shoulder buttons will control the lock-on feature.

1088
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It should also be noted that the new 3DS still hasn't been confirmed for America, so...

1089
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
But they like to wait until the last minute when announcing dates for things.

1090
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
They kind of do, don't they?

1091
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I would not be surprised if we have that.

1092
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I mean, considering it's coming out in other places around the world this year, I would not be surprised if we get it this year.

1093
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
You still think of the new 3DS as a possibility for this year?

1094
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I think maybe December.

1095
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I'm gonna guess that we'll get it before the end of the fiscal year.

1096
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I think we'll get it around the time that the next Pokemon game comes out, which is the end of November.

1097
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Okay.

1098
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
But again...

1099
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
What sells systems? Pokemon!

1100
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Pokemon could sell a lot of 2DSs too, you know?

1101
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Well, that's a win-win still.

1102
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
That's true.

1103
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That's even more of a win for them because, guess what? You bought a 2DS.

1104
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And now if you really want to get the best bang for your buck to play the newest Pokemon game that'll come out in a year or so, you're gonna need the new 2DS.

1105
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Or the new 3DS. Or the new, new 3DS.

1106
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I really hope that they decide to maybe give it another name when it comes out here. I don't know.

1107
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
They won't.

1108
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Alright, well let's travel back in time to a time when games, like, they weren't 3D.

1109
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
You didn't have 3D games. Well, maybe you had Rad Racer. You didn't have that.

1110
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
But it's time to visit gaming's archive and step into Jamie's vault before she puts the whole thing in a box.

1111
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Bunch of boxes.

1112
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And find one game notable of being the classic game of the week. And I noticed, Dark Soccer, your Capcom comes to an end this week.

1113
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I'd said that last week.

1114
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Oh, I forgot.

1115
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Because I have to put in a little bit more gap before I jump to CPS1.

1116
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Alright. So, uh, we're visiting something else this week, Dark Soccer. What is the classic game of the week?

1117
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Get Bass! Also known as Sega Bass Fishing.

1118
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Um, yeah. I picked it.

1119
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Basically, um, this was an arcade fishing game. It came out in 1997, um, for the Sega Model 3.

1120
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:44,000
And it has been since ported to the Dreamcast, uh, it's on Windows, Xbox 360, PS3, and the Wii.

1121
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And this game was notable for coming with a special controller that you used as a fishing rod.

1122
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Um, I will be talking more about that later because it was awesome.

1123
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
So basically, you just fish. That's all you do.

1124
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
You, uh, you have to hook and reel and fish. You use different kinds of lures.

1125
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Uh, there's different stages of fishing, so you can actually get different kinds of fish based on what time you fish.

1126
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
It's a big fishing sim.

1127
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And the thing is, I don't know how Sega did it, but they made it fun and not completely boring, like real fishing.

1128
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Um, especially when you would catch the fish and it would say, Fish Get! Well, on the Japanese version, anyway.

1129
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And then the person would go, Fish! So it's just such full of, uh, rather, uh, cornball stuff just from that era of Sega games.

1130
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Because you know what also else came out like soon after that was like Brave Firefighters and Jumbo Safari was out and all of those kind of weird games.

1131
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:52,000
But, I don't even know why this game was so fun, but I don't really know many people who don't like this game.

1132
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:59,000
It even had a sequel, which was Sega Bass Fishing Duel, which came out on PS2. It was a, uh, multiplayer.

1133
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And then there was a Rails crossover that was called Sega Bass Fishing of the Dead.

1134
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:12,000
It was reported in 2012, but it was an April Fools joke. That would have, I would have absolutely bought it though.

1135
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
And then of course we also after that had Sega Marine Fishing.

1136
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Now I will, this is why I picked this game. This is the game that gave us the fishing rod controller.

1137
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
This is the game that created Rodcalibur.

1138
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I don't know if I've, I've probably told everybody what Rodcalibur is, I'll say it again.

1139
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
About a thousand times on this show is Rodcalibur.

1140
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
This is playing Soulcalibur on Dreamcast with the fishing rod.

1141
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,000
You can swing the thing around like you're sword fighting and actually beat the game with the fishing controller.

1142
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Can you be, can you nunchuck me? Can you be Maxie?

1143
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I, actually I did beat it with Maxie, the first person I played with.

1144
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
And then I also did beat it with Sophotia.

1145
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And, um, actually Waldo is remarkably good with the, uh, rod controller.

1146
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And all you do is swing it around like you're flailing to death.

1147
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
And that's Rodcalibur.

1148
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
The analog of button mashing.

1149
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Yes. I tried doing, um, DDR caliber once, that didn't work.

1150
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Uh, however, that's how I learned that my Dreamcast dance pads, that my, uh, corner buttons were analog.

1151
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Oh.

1152
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Sorry, I just...

1153
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I wanted that as, as, uh, my text tone for the longest time.

1154
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Would it have been wrong if in this game you could catch Echo the Dolphin?

1155
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Or what's that Seaman looking guy?

1156
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
That's for, that's for Sega, that's for Sega poaching fishing.

1157
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
That's for Sega deep sea poaching.

1158
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Are we sure this isn't bass fishing?

1159
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
It was actually funny.

1160
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
When I started, I looked up Get Bass first.

1161
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And, um, it actually was like nothing but bass playing videos.

1162
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Oh.

1163
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
So then I had to put Sega Get Bass and then that's when I found it.

1164
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Get Bass, Get Bass and it's all Geddy Lee and...

1165
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Bootsy.

1166
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Bootsy.

1167
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I ain't Bootsy.

1168
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
No, I found like two, two of the first videos out there were like Bootsy Collins.

1169
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So it was pretty cool.

1170
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It's because of parliament rules overall.

1171
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Yes.

1172
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I think, I'm looking at this and I think I still prefer Ocarina of Time.

1173
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I would, I would rather play that than this.

1174
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Well, you know, uh, we've been doing Classic Game of the Week since what, episode number 250?

1175
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
So there's been about 300 classic games.

1176
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Pretty sure Ocarina of Time's been done.

1177
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So we're starting to, uh, you know, dig a little deeper.

1178
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
These are the deep cuts.

1179
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
These are the deep cuts.

1180
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Well, but...

1181
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
As much as I've talked about Rod Caliber, I had to bring up the origins of Rod Caliber.

1182
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And this game is actually super fun if you're really drunk.

1183
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I still see shit like this in the arcade all the time.

1184
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And phish.

1185
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Rod Caliber is also an awesome porn star name.

1186
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I was going to say it sounds like a detective.

1187
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Like somebody you'd find on Matlock calling Rod Caliber.

1188
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
What kind of Matlock are you watching?

1189
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
That's on the, that's on the channels where you have to watch through the third party version of the show.

1190
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
When we make Pixel shit it'll be starring Rod Caliber.

1191
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
TV Land After Dark.

1192
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Is your PSP modded to play Rod Caliber?

1193
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Of course.

1194
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I'm going to get, uh, Bodhi to make Rod Caliber the game.

1195
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Very similar to Aseturf.

1196
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
If you don't play, Rod Caliber plays you.

1197
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

1198
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Sega Bass Fishing.

1199
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Phish!

1200
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Phish!

1201
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Alright, with that super bass.

1202
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I just, now I hear Nicki Minaj in my head.

1203
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Look at what you did.

1204
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I'm sorry.

1205
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Thank you.

1206
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Hey, but she's a great feminist icon.

1207
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Yeah, look at that booty.

1208
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Well, you know what?

1209
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
My anaconda don't.

1210
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
We're going to take a break.

1211
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
And when we come back, who knows what song I'll burst into next.

1212
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
We've got some rapid fire news as well.

1213
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,000
The Fugu Question of the Week, Mailbag, FUs of the Week, your calls and so much more with our live studio audience here.

1214
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
As we get into more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this quick break.

1215
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Don't go anywhere guys.

1216
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live with the 571st episode of our show for this October the 12th, 2014, already in progress.

1217
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
We've had such a busy show so far tonight.

1218
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
We're joined by our dear old friend of Orange Lounge Radio.

1219
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I'm not actually calling you old Princess Irene, but you know, the show is pretty old.

1220
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
But from the Multitap podcast now.

1221
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
And when do you guys put out new episodes?

1222
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Like when do you tape your shows and when do they go out?

1223
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I'm going to give that to Piper.

1224
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Piper's here from the same show.

1225
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Shoot. We usually record Sundays. We're never live though. That's not interactive.

1226
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
So I think we try to put out Mondays.

1227
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Alright, cool. A lot of shows do Sundays.

1228
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
So yeah, I know a lot of people.

1229
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
There's a lot of people that I know that do their shows that are like, we listen to OLR, but we're taping then.

1230
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
So I know how it goes.

1231
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
As long as you put out.

1232
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
That's fine. That's why we have the podcast so people can listen in all sorts of different ways.

1233
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
It's a week so the marriage doesn't die.

1234
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
And of course, JV Monn from New York City all the way to the other coast joining us here as well.

1235
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
When's your show put out? Once a month. What do we do?

1236
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Every month or two. It's on iTunes, just Super Euro Power Hour.

1237
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Alright. So you're not going to tell us when the next episode's coming out? Just hurry up and wait?

1238
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I'm trying to get one out this week. Well, I'm trying to get one out this week because a friend of mine who's an indie Eurobeat producer lives in San Jose.

1239
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
So it's just a quick drive.

1240
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:40,000
And he's, for Super Eurobeat, he's known as Ken Blast, but if you're a My Little Pony fan and a Eurobeat fan, he goes by Eurobeat Brony.

1241
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Okay.

1242
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So if you type in like Eurobeat and the letter B, that's like the first thing you get on YouTube.

1243
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Alright.

1244
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
He gets like 2 million plus views on each video.

1245
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Nice. Can we get a shout out?

1246
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
He's doing something well.

1247
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:01,000
So hey, since we had such a busy beginning of the show and if you didn't hear the first half, if you're just joining us now live on this Sunday evening,

1248
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:07,000
definitely check out the podcast at some point. We had a great interview with Bodie Lee from Lunar Ray Games, talking about Time Spinner earlier on in the show.

1249
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
That was awesome. In fact, it was so busy, I forgot housekeeping and a very important note.

1250
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
And I mentioned this in a previous week, so just to make sure you guys know, we will not be here next week.

1251
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
There will be no live OLR next week.

1252
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I might try to throw together like a best of or something for the podcast, but I really can't promise that.

1253
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
It just depends on how much time I have during the week.

1254
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:33,000
So sadly, I know a lot of you guys rely on OLR to get through your Monday and so forth. I'm very sorry we won't be here.

1255
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I will actually be in Las Vegas. I'm going to Final Fantasy Fan Fest this weekend, which is celebrating Final Fantasy XIV, which as you know is the MMO I kind of got addicted to ever since I left World of Warcraft.

1256
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Are you cosplaying?

1257
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
No, probably not, because I don't have time to throw something together.

1258
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I can loan you my Homestuck cosplay.

1259
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Why would I dress in Homestuck?

1260
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I'm sure you'd make a great game.

1261
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Here's the thing. I want to do Hildebrand, which if you play Final Fantasy XIV is a hilarious character. He's all the funny quests.

1262
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
But then I'm thinking like half the dudes will be cosplaying Hildebrand.

1263
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
So you'd be his dad.

1264
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:20,000
At first I thought you were making an age joke, but then I was like actually Hildebrand's dad is in one of the questlines. He's even like twice the awesome.

1265
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
He doesn't wear pants either.

1266
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I have to tell you, you just wear the black hot pants. I have to tell you that the Hildebrand quest annoys me.

1267
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I don't think they're funny.

1268
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Really?

1269
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Stupid does not equate funny to me.

1270
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
They're stupid funny to me. It's like Dumb and Dumber.

1271
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Yeah, and I tried to sit through one of those and left the theater when someone else paid.

1272
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
You want to go see a sequel?

1273
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
No. I feel bile rising up in my throat at the preview.

1274
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I love Jim Carrey. I will see anything Jim Carrey is in, and that's why I'm so mad that Kick-Ass 2 is still not on Netflix.

1275
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I was forced to watch The Explorers, and I really wish I hadn't.

1276
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I was going to tell you, I've had this idea for a long time of doing Final Fantasy XIV cosplay, but doing like low level craft cosplay.

1277
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:18,000
As in just wearing like the stuff that, you know, because people do the real big elaborate ones, but you never have people just being the everyday people.

1278
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I really like the way the Gridania guards look. I think if I was going to cosplay something, I really like their masks and their armor and everything.

1279
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So you should do that. Be an NPC.

1280
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Okay, can I throw it together in four days before I leave?

1281
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I was just trying to say, all green clothing and bad posture?

1282
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Cactuar.

1283
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
There you go.

1284
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Just get a green Snuggie and then sew it up in the back. You could do that. That wouldn't be too hard.

1285
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Oh my god, laziest cosplay ever.

1286
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
A Cactuar?

1287
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
That would be that bad.

1288
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
You know, I'm not going alone. I'm going with Shane. What do you think you could convince him to cosplay as?

1289
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
A Chocobo. Put a feather on his head.

1290
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
If he's out there listening, he's going to be like, no.

1291
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Just carry a lantern around. You could be a lazy Tonberry.

1292
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Lazy Tonberry, yeah. There you go.

1293
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:07,000
That actually, you know what? You know what? You know what? I could probably do a Tonberry head in a night.

1294
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Alright, we'll see. We'll see. I don't know.

1295
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
We'll talk about it.

1296
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Unfortunately, if you want to get into, you know, wherever you're going, you kind of have to walk back and forth very slowly.

1297
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
It's going to take you a while to get to where you're going.

1298
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I'll be Tonberry on Red Bull.

1299
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Anyhow, so we will be not here next week, but what a great time for you to sample other indie podcasts because there's lots of hardworking indie podcasters out there creating great content.

1300
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
So our friends at Multitap, this is your week.

1301
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
You could listen to us.

1302
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
That's right. Listen to you guys. There you go. Are you going to get them for three hours?

1303
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Depending. We've done two-parters, so those end up close to four hours.

1304
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
You could listen to two episodes.

1305
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Two episodes, and we release them in part the first and part the second.

1306
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Awesome.

1307
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Sounds like a plan. Sounds like a plan. So, yeah, we won't be here next week, but I will be back with all the details from Final Fantasy Fan Fest.

1308
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I'll try and get an interview. If I can get my butt up there and interview the developers, that would be fantastic. We'll see what happens.

1309
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
So, there you go. That is why we will not be here next week.

1310
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
But we are here this week, so we're trying to continue putting on a kick-butt show for you guys.

1311
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
So let's get to it. Some rapid-fire news. Loki.

1312
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,000
So, I just don't understand Nintendo sometimes, or actually most of the times.

1313
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:34,000
But apparently, and I'm thinking that this is a little bit sensationalized, but apparently the GameCube adapter that they're putting out for Super Smash Bros. on Wii U only works with Super Smash Bros. on Wii U.

1314
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:50,000
It will not work with existing Wii and Virtual Console games. Also, I don't know if it's going to allow you to use some in place of the Classic Controller or something.

1315
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I guess that was the thought, but now it's not. It's only going to be used for Smash Bros.

1316
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:05,000
But I think it's only going to be used for Smash Bros. right now. I think later on they could come out with things that support it.

1317
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:13,000
But I don't think they're going to release it only for Smash Bros. and say, ah, well, that's it. That's the last thing we're going to use it on.

1318
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I just can't see that. Maybe later on in a system update it will come out with support for it, but yeah, right now it's not.

1319
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I really think it should have been out of the gate, because you're really limiting your audience.

1320
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:34,000
This is proprietary to our system, and then only proprietary to this game. That would be a waste, I think.

1321
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I think it would not be that difficult, because they had GameCube support for Virtual Console before, and all it's doing now is running through a stupid adapter that's converting it to USB.

1322
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:55,000
How fucking hard can that be to get that to work? To shoehorn that in? I can't imagine it would be that hard. Just fucking map it to classic controller stuff.

1323
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I still feel like at some point we're inevitably going to get Virtual Console GameCube games, and this would be a very logical thing to use with it.

1324
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:13,000
They're so backwards. It's just like, hey, it's not like a surprise that we're going to release this. You knew this for quite a long time.

1325
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:24,000
You think you could have put one developer on shoehorning this into Virtual Console or for use with other games? I wouldn't have thought that would have been too difficult for you, but apparently it is.

1326
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Since clearly I'm never going to get a new F-Zero, because they're going to tease me by putting Mute City in Mario Kart or whatever the fuck they're doing, I can at least get F-Zero GX on Virtual Console would be nice.

1327
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And with that, of course, the rumored date of November 21st ended up being the release date for Super Smash Bros. in North America. Europe is getting it December 5th.

1328
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
And, of course, the Amiibo characters will be coming out.

1329
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
What do they do? We know they're coming, but why should I buy them?

1330
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:08,000
They're literally AI characters that you can level up and that's it. It's fucking useless.

1331
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Cool. You know what? I have no qualms against getting some of those because they look cool and put them on your shelf and stuff, but as far as functionality goes, it's fucking stupid.

1332
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
So, in other words, Amiibo is really more there for the figure collecting.

1333
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Yeah, it's figure collecting, but apparently later on you're going to be able to use it with Mario Kart and shit like that.

1334
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:37,000
You know what it's for. It's just because they needed some shit to sell this stuff right now, and then later on when the new 3DS comes out with the fucking near-field communication shit, then it's going to drop.

1335
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Boom! New fucking Pokémon. Boom! Oh, look! Amiibo characters for every fucking Pokémon, and you know you're going to be buying every single one of those for $13 each.

1336
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Cha-ching! We're printing money again. That's where they're going to make their money. Fuck it. Who cares if the Wii U sucks?

1337
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:59,000
You know what? We're making tons of money off these fucking toys. That is where they're going to go because it works for Activision and their goddamn Skylanders franchise.

1338
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Alright, calm down. We haven't calmed down until that press release comes out.

1339
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,000
It's going to happen. Same with Nintendo DS and 3DS titles on the Wii U.

1340
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
You know, if they can put Pikachu's face on it, they'll do it.

1341
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Yeah, Pikachu already. Pikachu's going to be one of those characters.

1342
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Alright, anyways, to go along with that, there was a little bit of speculation when Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker was coming out, and I remember saying that I don't fucking care when it comes out, but if you do care, it's coming out December 5th.

1343
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
I care.

1344
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:34,000
And it's going to be priced for $40, which, you know what? That's $20 too expensive, so just wait for the bargain.

1345
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
But, Loki? Toadette's in it.

1346
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Oh, well I'm sorry. I guess that totally justifies the $40 price point then.

1347
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Now I don't care.

1348
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I was totally teasing. I hate Toadette. I really do.

1349
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I think it's whatever.

1350
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
It's a totally irrational hatred. I can't explain it.

1351
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
She's like one of those useless friend characters from Sonic.

1352
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Exactly. Toadette reminds me of one of Sonic's shitty friends. Like, she's in the wrong franchise. And I'm sorry if you're a Toadette fan, but I think, like, Double Dash just really left a bad taste in the beginning.

1353
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Toadette is just, it's all part of the same thing that they're doing with, like, even, like, Smash Bros.

1354
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Hold on, because Piper, it looks like I hurt Piper's feelings.

1355
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Specifically, if you're a Toadette fan, who the fuck are you?

1356
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
You need to look at your life, look at your choices.

1357
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Hold on, hold on. Don't scare the listeners away. Just write us an email, tell us why we're wrong.

1358
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Okay, well I'm just saying that to participate at orangesonsradio.com, attention Piper.

1359
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:39,000
It's a character they created to have more female characters so that people can play as it. So, you know, it's not alienating, you know, other audiences.

1360
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Can we get, like, Birdo? Because Birdo's fucking awesome.

1361
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Birdo may be considered transgender or something like that, so fuck that shit.

1362
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Fuck that shit, because we're Nintendo.

1363
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
And transgender needs representation as well.

1364
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
That is true.

1365
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Hey, don't get me wrong. I think Captain Rainbow should be in the fucking Smash Bros., but, you know, where the fuck is that?

1366
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
You know, we can't even get Captain Rainbow in there, because that was fucking awesome.

1367
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
And Loki, I know you want Tingle in Smash Bros. I guess he's an assist trophy.

1368
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,000
You know what? I think that would be funny. That would be kind of cool. Why not? Let's do that.

1369
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Tingle as a boss character.

1370
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I'd be down with that. Anyways, so, yeah. So, there's that. And then, what else? Let's see.

1371
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Oh, and, you know, in Japan it's already sold 2.8 million units, so that's pretty awesome.

1372
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:40,000
So, cool. And then the, what was it? Lionhead.

1373
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Once again, thank God that Peter Molyneaux is not hyping this shit up, but, you know, if you care, Fable Legends is having their beta pretty soon, so you can actually register for that if you want to check out their game.

1374
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And it's at fablelegends.com slash beta sign up, and go ahead and check it out. I guess the beta is supposed to start October 16th.

1375
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:15,000
So, cool. Honestly though, I've been so burnt out with Fable Games, I just can't.

1376
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Oh well.

1377
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
You can't even.

1378
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:25,000
I can't. I can't even. Seriously, I just don't care anymore.

1379
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Just getting Loki to say that on the show just made my night.

1380
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Alright. Moving on, let's talk about Factor 5. And Factor 5, apparently some news came out of what they were working on before they, you know, weren't working on it anymore.

1381
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Here's the thing. It was actually a Rogue Squadron trilogy remake for the Wii. That was the game that, interesting enough, it was starting on the Xbox, but Factor 5, like a lot of developers at the time, were like,

1382
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Oh hey, the Wii does motion control, and it's this crazy new thing everybody's into. So, yeah, that is what they did.

1383
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,000
But unfortunately, financial hardship, legal snafus, budgetary restrictions, all ended up killing the game.

1384
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:17,000
So, it should be noted that the former president of Factor 5, Julian Egbrecht, loves the Wii U, but its unpredictable trajectory and licensing troubles in general make a Star Wars Wii U game unlikely.

1385
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:24,000
You know what else was noted about this game? Lightsaber battles used one-to-one motion controls. Wasn't that what everybody wanted on the Wii?

1386
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Yeah, and you didn't get anything like that until Wii Sports Resort came out. Because remember they had a lightsaber battle game and it was kinda crap.

1387
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:49,000
If you are playing Diablo III Ultimate Evil Edition, this would be the console version of Diablo III, there was a patch this week that brought the game in line with the recent 2.1 patch on PC.

1388
01:52:50,000 --> 01:53:01,000
However, it's missing seasons. The big season, the whole thing I was talking about at the beginning of the show, I reached 70 on my seasonal hardcore character on PC, I won't be able to do that on console because they don't have seasons on console.

1389
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:15,000
And they haven't really said why, but we were talking a little bit about this on Hoard House and Extaver said that it's probably because of the fact that people have already hacked Diablo III on console because it's not required to be online like the PC one is.

1390
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:28,000
So therefore, people would cheat the shit out of the system, which unfortunately does make sense and I kinda wish, like I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I kinda wish you could like opt in to have Diablo III always online like while you're playing the season mode maybe.

1391
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Why can't season mode be online?

1392
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Yeah, or something like that. I'm kinda surprised.

1393
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:43,000
They have that like Call of Duty, which pisses me off sometimes. They've got certain game modes, even though you're playing them single player or whatever, they have to be online.

1394
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Or like if you wanna play two player, it's gotta be played over online, you can't play it through LAN for some reason because of rankings and stuff. I don't see why they couldn't do this.

1395
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Yeah, I wish they could figure a way out because, you know, even those seasons, it's just seasons. It did make me go revisit the game and try a new character and do something I never did before, so it'll be fun to do on PS4 as well.

1396
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Anyway, in celebration of this patch, it should be noted that through the 17th, the console versions are getting some different little buffs, temporary buffs.

1397
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:25,000
If you're playing on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, well you got screwed out of the patch because they said that they're not gonna be patching for the older systems.

1398
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:36,000
But you will get a 100% experience boost for the whole week. On the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the treasure goblin spawn rate will be doubled.

1399
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:43,000
So you get double trouble when it comes to treasure goblins for the week in celebration of this patch in Diablo III.

1400
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Hey, music game fans, if you're still following that whole community, Pump It Up 2015, that's gonna be a thing that's happening.

1401
01:54:52,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Ann DeMuro released a teaser trailer for this game this week where Pump It Up 2015 is gonna be a thing. However, the teaser trailer doesn't really show any features of the game, but it does show some of the artists joining the roster and it is slated for November 2014.

1402
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I wish Ann DeMuro was putting out DDR games.

1403
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Yeah, right. But I'm sure Jonas will be back in a future week on the show. In fact, I see him in chat right now. What's up? And he can fill us in on all the new features, which maybe we'll know more about Pump It Up because I know he's still playing that.

1404
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Let's see, Dark Sakura.

1405
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Well, in other news, how about a little big Planet 3 stuff? It's getting a new voice actor added to the roster as the main baddie for that. You get Hugh Laurie. How's that sound?

1406
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Yes.

1407
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Only if he says at some point, let's say my character falls down a pit or gets hit or something, he says it's not Lupus. It's the only way I'm gonna accept Hugh Laurie in the game.

1408
01:55:51,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Well, in other news, we have stuff about Hatsune Miku this year. Not only that Nomura Tetsuya made a version of her during a New York Ark exhibition that you can actually see running through October 19th, she was also on David Letterman.

1409
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Did you see it?

1410
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
No, I didn't.

1411
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I saw it and it was super awkward. I'm sorry. It was so weird. J. V. Martin, are you a Hatsune Miku person?

1412
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
He's the one that gave me my wall scroll.

1413
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I'm indifferent. I'm not a hater, but I'm not like, oh my god.

1414
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Yeah, I don't hate Hatsune Miku and actually the game is really fun, so I want to make that clear. It's just the whole scene on David Letterman. I was just like, this is so weird.

1415
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Sorry, guys. I know some of you are into it, but I was just like, this is the weirdest. The hologram just looked like a projection to me. It didn't look right.

1416
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
The gorilla stuff, it looks the same way.

1417
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
The gorilla stuff I have seen before, but it didn't look like that on Letterman. Granted, it probably had to be condensed.

1418
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I'm sure it looks better in person than on TV.

1419
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
It probably does.

1420
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:10,000
When I was borrowing those Hatsune Miku games, instead of one of the games, I actually got a concert DVD instead. It looked really good on the stage. I'm sure it would be just fine.

1421
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. DarkTit Studio says, yeah, I'm not sure Dave got it TBH.

1422
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:24,000
And Act F says, yeah, it was awkward. Sayao says, the audio was bad on Letterman. And Fifth Dream says, yeah, and the stage composition. I bet that stage.

1423
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Because everything looks bigger on TV, but in reality, Letterman's studio is probably not much bigger than the studio we do OLR in.

1424
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
It's smaller than it looks like on TV.

1425
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Price is Right is like a small movie theater. It's tiny.

1426
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:53,000
In other news, we have word from Obama urging the FCC to ban Fast Lanes and saying that he is unequivocally committed to net neutrality, so thanks Obama.

1427
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
We can say unironically, thanks Obama.

1428
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I will not ever do the ironic thanks Obama, but in this case, I'm doing it completely unironically.

1429
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Just because I think that that's a meme that needs to die.

1430
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:17,000
I like some of the gif files that people produce of that though, like from the really bad infomercials of like the woman that like drops all the Tupperware that falls on her and it just comes up and says, thanks Obama.

1431
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I'll tell you why it needs to die is because keep in mind how many people I know in Alabama.

1432
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:30,000
And my family, and they still legitimately say that to everything that they don't like in government.

1433
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I know some people take it one step too far, but if you put the funny spin on it, I think it's great.

1434
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
When you see it every day and people are not being ironic about it, it tends to get a little old.

1435
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
You need to learn about the mute feature on Facebook.

1436
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:47,000
You know what, you need to have it sitting, I bet, never mind, no one needs to sit in a room with my mom when she gets political.

1437
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
That's a fate you don't wish on anyone, right?

1438
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I don't even wish it on me.

1439
01:58:52,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Well, you know what, we're going to sit in a virtual room with our listeners as we travel to our Facebook and Google Plus page and ask the foogle question of the week.

1440
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and of course we slam those words together, you get foogle.

1441
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I think that was you that asked earlier, what's a foogle? What the hell is that?

1442
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:24,000
There it is. Here it is. So tonight, in honor of our guest, because I always like to do questions when I can that are kind of based around the guest.

1443
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Last week we had pinball, which by the way, follow up to that if you didn't see, the Addams Family pinball Kickstarter was a success, so that is going to happen.

1444
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:40,000
I like to think we helped a little bit with that, but no, in all seriousness, they did make it, so we are going to get the Addams Family table.

1445
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Anyway, but that was last week. This week we had Bodhi of course from Lunar Ray Games earlier in the show, so we wanted to ask, what is your favorite new school, old school game?

1446
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Because, you know, Time Spinner is a new school game, but it definitely draws influences from Star Ocean, Symphony of the Night, Mega Man X.

1447
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,000
So what is your favorite new game that has the feel of an old classic and why?

1448
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
And I'll let you guys here in the studio answer this too, but first let's go to the listeners.

1449
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:15,000
So over on Facebook, one of my favorite nicknames, William Murderface says, you like that Princess Irene, William Murderface?

1450
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Such a good show too.

1451
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:30,000
It is. William Murderface says, I would have to say The First Witcher. It kind of feels like you're playing an old Neverwinter game with some elements of Diablo, a great story, and for the first time, somewhat innovative combat system.

1452
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:40,000
You know, I'm not familiar with the Witcher series, but I was really impressed with what I saw of Witcher 3 at E3, specifically the art direction and the way the story was being told.

1453
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:49,000
I was like, this is going to fill in a big gap for some like Skyrim and Oblivion, what the hell, Elder Scrolls. Why couldn't I think of that?

1454
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
For Elder Scrolls fans, I feel like that's going to fill in a gap.

1455
02:00:51,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Anyway, Hitstun says, this is my favorite trend in video games. I love developers that revisit 90s gameplay styles with the design sensibilities we've learned in the past two decades.

1456
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I still want to play Freedom Planet, a new 2D mascot platformer on PC that got its start as a Sonic the Hedgehog fan game, and it shows.

1457
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Elliot B says, I loved Anodyne. I hope I said that right. Anodyne, which is a super creepy tribute to A Link to the Past. It's all framed in a Game Boy style square format.

1458
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Bonus answer, Super Time Force is great too.

1459
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:35,000
SSG100Matt says, I played the hell out of Shadow Complex when it came out a while ago. The game was heavily inspired by Super Metroid, and it ultimately went on to inspire other similar styled games, i.e. The Swapper.

1460
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:46,000
And Jonas replied and said, Rogue Legacy, that old school feeling of Metroidvania with randomized dungeons. Unpredictable and challenging every time you enter the dungeon.

1461
02:01:47,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Over on Google+, we had a few answers. And Act F says, Shovel Knight is probably the best new old game. It has all the stuff that made all the NES games great, stuffed into a fantastic game. Dust and Elysian Tail comes close too.

1462
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Tom W also said, Rogue Legacy, with the old feel of PS1 and GBA Castlevania games with a roguelike twist to modern conventions.

1463
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Reddertainment says, Does it count if Forza Horizon 2 reminds me a lot of Burnout Paradise?

1464
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Well, I don't know if Burnout is classic yet, but I guess it's getting there. Close enough.

1465
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And lastly, Josh Wai replies on Google and says, I find I'm very impressed by the Terry Cavana games VVVVVVVV and Super Hexagon. Of the former, my proudest moment was completing Veni Vindivici after literally days of trying.

1466
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:46,000
That was a very hard-boarded VVVVVV and I loved VVVVVVVV. That game was amazing.

1467
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:53,000
What about you guys? Your favorite new old game? Anybody? Don't all jump at once. Logie?

1468
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Cave Story?

1469
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Okay, good. Cave Story. And they kind of redid Cave Story several times.

1470
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Yeah, that was pretty good.

1471
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
It's kind of meta there a little bit. Piper, you have an answer over there?

1472
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:16,000
I had two. One that's kind of upcoming. I loved Guacamelee! recently, which is brilliant. I found myself just living Metroid through a lucha, which was all I wanted in life.

1473
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
And the music is so fucking good in that game.

1474
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:28,000
It is. And if you're looking closely, there's nothing but hundreds and hundreds of love notes to games in the past.

1475
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Yeah, all the memes and shit too. Like when you're in the towns, there's like Grumpy Cat and shit show up and it's great.

1476
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:43,000
It's incredible. And then I love Myst clones for a reason. They're all live. They're not panel-based anymore, but Dear Esther was great. I'm looking forward to The Witness by Jonathan Blow.

1477
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:52,000
They'll be similar. They're kind of puzzle-based like that. Or I guess they're kind of slower-paced portals without the physics-based puzzle in it.

1478
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Did you play Gone Home at all? Random question?

1479
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I have not. That's next to my list because people said it was good.

1480
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Yeah, it was very good. Very good. Princess Irene? I don't know if you have one?

1481
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Time spinner, duh.

1482
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Good answer.

1483
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Hold on. Are you on the payroll of that guy's company?

1484
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
I should be voting no.

1485
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
We've got to make sure we're ethical or we're not getting a lot of trouble.

1486
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Right.

1487
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
JV1?

1488
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Super Time Force?

1489
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Somebody mentioned that in a Facebook comment too. What do you like about it?

1490
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:35,000
It's kind of contra-ish because it's kind of just running and gunning. But then if you fuck up, you can just rewind and redo the level.

1491
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:44,000
The humor is just very amusing. It'll just show up into a new time zone. It's like, time, your birthday, place, your mom.

1492
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Jamie, anything that comes to mind for you?

1493
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I'll say To The Moon.

1494
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Oh, okay.

1495
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:58,000
That one is probably... And I like it because it's pure story. It's just pure story with a little bit of puzzle in it and the puzzles aren't terrible.

1496
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I honestly could do without the puzzle parts just because I love going through the whole story of it and I sadly had to put it aside for a lot of work and a bunch of other stuff that's coming on.

1497
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
But as soon as we move, it's actually back up on the top of my list to finish.

1498
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Nice.

1499
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I have already had sob fests.

1500
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I was going to say, get the Kleenex.

1501
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Even in the first two sections of the game, I was like, that's so sad. The feels.

1502
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
And of course, hot duffel boyfriend.

1503
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
It's a dating sim, visual novel.

1504
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
That's old school, but pigeons.

1505
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
I thought of an answer that nobody's mentioned yet, even though it's kind of cheating. The new DuckTales game.

1506
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
That's totally cheating.

1507
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Which is kind of.

1508
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Here's the thing. The only thing that really bugged me about the new DuckTales game, you might remember way back in my review, was the frickin' cut scenes.

1509
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Did we ever get away to skip... I don't know.

1510
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
You press pause and you can hit skip movie.

1511
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Does it? I actually remember the first time I played through it, you couldn't do it. It annoyed the hell out of me.

1512
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:06,000
But the new DuckTales was still very, very, very well done, so I was happy with that.

1513
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Alright, let us get back into some news. Thanks, you guys, for the answers.

1514
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:18,000
And again, if you want to answer in a future week, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

1515
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Let's get back into some news and then we'll get to your calls and the mailbag and all that good stuff.

1516
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,000
So, Loki, what do you got for us?

1517
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Oh, my eyes and how they roll.

1518
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:35,000
So, you may remember back when we talked a little bit about Lindsay Lohan suing Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive because of...

1519
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Because she's out of money?

1520
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Well, yeah, definitely because she's out of money. Because she claimed that her likeness was used in the game for her character, Lacey Jones, which is like some sort of actress that was drinking and doing all sorts of promiscuous stuff and that kind of thing.

1521
02:06:53,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Well, now she's amended her lawsuit to change the claim. The claim now is not that she's, you know, that character, but in fact, this bikini-clad blonde woman that is on the game disc in promotional art and stuff like that.

1522
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:18,000
There is no fucking way that Lindsay Lohan is this person. This person looks nothing like her at all.

1523
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I took serious issue with this because I thought I had heard something about them modeling her after Kate Upton.

1524
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Yeah, there is actually a photograph of, I think it was Kate Upton, that is almost in the same pose where they slightly changed some stuff and they kind of based it off of that.

1525
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:51,000
So there's no way that this is Lindsay Lohan, but you know what, she's trying to change her plea, you know, her complaint, I guess, so that I guess they can allow for a different type of lawsuit in New York or something like that.

1526
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Fuck if I know. Obviously, she's not going to win this. There's no way in hell.

1527
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:06,000
There is only one way to settle this. There's only one way this can probably be settled and that is Judge Judy has to do it. Come on, America. Come on, we want to see this.

1528
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Judge Judy has to sell this because you all want to see Judge Judy just rip into Lindsay Lohan.

1529
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Does she still work?

1530
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Judge Judy? Oh, God, she's still like the number one syndicated show on TV. She's bigger than Oprah.

1531
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Okay.

1532
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I know, right? Who knew?

1533
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Fuck me, you're right.

1534
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com explicit or Jonas says Lilo fucking sues everything and she loses because of how bad her points are.

1535
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:43,000
She sued Pitbull for using her name.

1536
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Well, thank you.

1537
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Thank you for the Lilo update. I didn't realize that Jonas was the go-to guy for my Lilo news.

1538
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:53,000
I didn't realize Lilo was a thing.

1539
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Yeah, J-Lo.

1540
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
There's no way. I mean, seriously, is this going to go into...

1541
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
You just call me RO.

1542
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:10,000
All the judge has to do is look at the picture, look at her, look at the picture, look at her and go, are you fucking kidding? Out? Seriously, there's...

1543
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
In her prime...

1544
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,000
No, not even in her prime would she look like this person. I mean...

1545
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I've seen the Playboy photos. There is no fucking way that she looks like this person.

1546
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I feel like you're suddenly our expert here in studio. Well, I've seen the photos.

1547
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,000
There is literally no way that she looks like this person and definitely not now.

1548
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Fuck, no, not now. She just...

1549
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Is she going to sue Droopy Talk?

1550
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Are you this person in the game or are you this person? Because you know what?

1551
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I'm starting to think that, you know, you're based off of maybe a different character in the game, you know?

1552
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,000
She certainly is based off of a character.

1553
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:59,000
You know what? Lindsay, if you're listening to us, we have some advice for you. Stop.

1554
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Stop listening to us?

1555
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:07,000
No, no, no, no. Just everything else that you think is a good idea, stop.

1556
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:16,000
She would have had a better chance of arguing that she was based off of the character Trevor Phillips in Grand Theft Auto 5 versus, you know, this bikini model.

1557
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Because she's up on meth or whatever.

1558
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Suddenly I have this image of Lindsay Lohan lying in her bed with headphones on listening to O.L.R. and just a single tear falling down her face.

1559
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
The people in Sacramento.

1560
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
You would file a lawsuit against us for using her name.

1561
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,000
For the record, Lindsay, I've never seen Mean Girls.

1562
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Okay, I know, I know, I know. I will see it at some point, but I still like that I can use that right now.

1563
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Hey, she was hot.

1564
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:50,000
You say that on the week of the 10 year anniversary. Why don't you just pull down your pants and poop on it?

1565
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Because that means that after I'm done playing Hot to Full Boyfriend on Tuesday, someone has to bring the movie over.

1566
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:04,000
She was hot pre-drugs. I mean, it's just after the drug thing, it just kind of went downhill. But before that, she had it going on.

1567
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:12,000
That should be the new FBI warning that shows up on video games. Like, warning. Winners don't do drugs.

1568
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Warning, Lindsay Lohan was hot before drugs.

1569
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
But Lindsay Lohan did.

1570
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I listen to the Kevin Smith podcast and they have a little jingle so they don't get sued. It's just the beginning of Desperado.

1571
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:34,000
But they had somebody write in that said, Lindsay Lohan, why don't you come to your senses?

1572
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
And then it just ends.

1573
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Every time I hear her name, I think that just goes straight through my head.

1574
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Rama in chat says, Mean Girls was better when it was called Heathers. Hey, look, I love Heathers too, but they are different.

1575
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Heathers is great.

1576
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Heathers was a very dark comedy. Mean Girls is like Tina Fey, which is like her own brand of comedy because she's so great.

1577
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
30 Rock, all that. Like, if Tina Fey touches it, I'll probably see it.

1578
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
But Heathers was awesome.

1579
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Explicit says same. Haven't seen the Mean Girls either.

1580
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Okay, do I have to have like a movie night here at Studio OLR? Because I think I do.

1581
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Right now.

1582
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I have to work in the morning.

1583
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Alright.

1584
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Goodnight everybody.

1585
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Goodnight everybody because this is so not fetch right now.

1586
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Okay, so she claims because she's worn a bikini that happens to be red and a hat that she is this person that's in the picture because this person has a hat on and in a different picture has a red bikini.

1587
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,000
That's a different girl.

1588
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
The other one was holding an iPhone or an Apple phone.

1589
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Alright, the Multitap Podcast will be back during the holiday season to do their rendition of Jingle Bell Rock.

1590
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
So everybody look forward to that, just so you guys know.

1591
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Who are you with?

1592
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
I thought you saw Mean Girls. You don't get a Jingle Bell Rock.

1593
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
You're a liar.

1594
02:12:53,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Alright, moving on. Let's talk about Square Enix and their own lawsuit, although they are actually the ones suing SNK Playmore.

1595
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
And this is because of copyright infringement accusations.

1596
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
This is actually, okay, so here's the thing.

1597
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:16,000
SNK sued Square Enix in May claiming that they used copyrighted SNK characters without permission in High School Girl.

1598
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
This is a manga series.

1599
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:26,000
SNK said that characters from the King of Fighters and Samurai Shodown were used over a hundred times and there was no permission for this.

1600
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,000
So police collected evidence in August from Square Enix's offices.

1601
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
What the hell kind of investigation does that look like?

1602
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
We're here to investigate High School Girls?

1603
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Alright.

1604
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
So anyway, Square Enix has been cooperating with the law.

1605
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Well now they are seeking an authoritative opinion from the Osaka District Court to determine that it is not infringed on SNK copyright and it will prove the point through several procedures.

1606
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
So, sorry, not like a lawsuit in the sense that, you know, again this will end up in Judge Judy.

1607
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:01,000
But basically, telling the judge to say, no, you shut up. No, you shut up. No, you shut up.

1608
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
And then Judge Judy's like, y'all shut the fuck up.

1609
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
That's right, why don't you both shut up. You're both dumb.

1610
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Which characters did they rip off of, allegedly?

1611
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I don't know.

1612
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:21,000
They didn't rip off any character, or what was it? Well, I remember the SNK one originally was because they were playing Neo Geo in the comics.

1613
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Oh, what? That's dumb.

1614
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:29,000
And I guess because they had, you know, the Neo Geo stuff in there and I guess they were playing King of Fighters that they referred to the characters in the comic.

1615
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Okay.

1616
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I don't know.

1617
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
That's silly.

1618
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Shouldn't they be happy for free advertising?

1619
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
No.

1620
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Are they even, like, really selling anything, though?

1621
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
That might be why they need money.

1622
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Yeah.

1623
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Anyway, Dar Tetsuya in chat says, now there's an episode of Law and Order I'd like to see.

1624
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Aw, that's what I need on my sound effects board.

1625
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Bong bong.

1626
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Okay. Sorry.

1627
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
They go back once again to, you know, the Lindsay Lohan thing.

1628
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Come on!

1629
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:04,000
No, it's hilarious, though, because in there was in there one of their pieces of evidence.

1630
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,000
If you type in Lindsay Lohan GTA 5, it pulls up the picture of that woman.

1631
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:15,000
The second picture that's in there is of the actual picture that they based that picture off of.

1632
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,000
And they also think that, you know, they'll see this character is Lacey Jonas or whatever in the thing.

1633
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,000
That character that's a Bikini Mall is not that Lacey Jonas character from the game.

1634
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
It's a completely separate person that doesn't even exist.

1635
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
It's just an NPC character that they used.

1636
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
It's like in Grand Theft Auto IV. They have the prostitute on there.

1637
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
That was an NPC character that's not really in the game.

1638
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Just somebody random you can sleep with and then shoot.

1639
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Yes.

1640
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
A mascot.

1641
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
All right. Are you done?

1642
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,000
I'm done. I'm done. I just thought it was funny.

1643
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Like they've shot holes in their own argument through this evidence that they had.

1644
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
They're like, we don't care. She's paying us.

1645
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Amanda Bynes hasn't been in any video games, has she?

1646
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Did they make a video game out of EZA?

1647
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,000
All right. All right. Moving on.

1648
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
All right. Darzaga.

1649
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Well, this is actually super cool.

1650
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:09,000
There's a journalism school that's actually using a grant to teach journalist game design.

1651
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:23,000
By cool, it's interesting. Basically they're using, it's American University School of Communication is using a $250,000 grant from the Knight Foundation for programs to train journalists in game design.

1652
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:32,000
So it's called Journalism Leadership Transformation with six positions, three working for journalists and three for journalism students.

1653
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:43,000
So they enroll in the game design master's degree program, work in the game lab, and then help organize two different summits in Washington, D.C.

1654
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:55,000
So basically it's, I'm not so sure that it's actually journalism, but see that's where it kind of gets me.

1655
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:02,000
It's cool that there's going to be a degree program set up for that, but very, I think, odd that it's going to be done through a journalism school.

1656
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Now, if they had one on how to not report on video games like your Kotaku, then sign me up.

1657
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I mean, oh, I'm sorry. We already know how.

1658
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:18,000
You know, I don't know. It's kind of cool and not so cool.

1659
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Interesting. Do you think that, I mean, there's obviously, without going too far down this rabbit hole, I just kind of want to step over it and peek in.

1660
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:34,000
But do you think, I mean, there's a lot of talk about ethics and game journalism out there. Obviously we know that's a very big issue right now.

1661
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:38,000
So, I mean, is there maybe a need for somebody to come in and set like these standards?

1662
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Because it seems like right now all these websites set their own standards. There's nothing like the AP rule book.

1663
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Well, and Reuters won't even consider any video game journalistic source as a true source because they don't meet the standards for journalistic integrity.

1664
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Well, now, I cannot imagine why Reuters would not give the video game community the time of day anyway.

1665
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Well, no, they said that they don't include it in the list of associated feeds that they use because they don't meet the standards.

1666
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:16,000
They said if any single one of them fit the standards for journalistic integrity, they'd be happily included.

1667
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Like the Wikipedia of journalists.

1668
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Except Wikipedia typically has better information.

1669
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Sy Allen Chat has a good suggestion here. How not to be sensationalistic click bait 101. 29 reasons why you're a crappy journalist. Click here to learn more.

1670
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Only 29. With GIFs. Alright, anyway.

1671
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Alright, let's move on with some more news. Loki.

1672
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Alright, so this is kind of cool. I'm actually, you know, interested in purchasing this this way.

1673
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:50,000
But Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, they're doing this kind of like what they did with Destiny a little bit, but slightly different.

1674
02:18:51,000 --> 02:19:02,000
They're having where you buy the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 version of the game and you get the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version for free.

1675
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:09,000
And this is if you purchase the game digitally between, I guess, now and March 31st of next year.

1676
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:16,000
And if you purchase that, you will not only get, you know, the current Gen 1, but the last Gen 1 as well.

1677
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:27,000
And I guess on PlayStation 3, the way it's going to work is it's actually cross-buy, so you can, you know, purchase it that way and be able to play it on both systems.

1678
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:36,000
And I think the Xbox 360 one is the same thing. So except they don't have cross-buy, you just get codes for both, which is awesome.

1679
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:43,000
I'm, you know, looking forward to that because, you know, eventually I want to get PlayStation 4 with the people I play Call of Duty with.

1680
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:51,000
They all have PlayStation 3, so that's awesome. I'm going to pick it up on PS3 and then when I get PS4, I'll play it on PS4.

1681
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:58,000
That's really cool to see more and more publishers kind of doing this, especially with the Sun is starting to set on the PS3 and Xbox 360.

1682
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I mean, especially like next year, I really think next year you might get like one game, one big game, and that's really going to be it.

1683
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Like the Sun is starting to set on those systems, so, you know, it's nice that they have these upgrades for the people who aren't ready yet.

1684
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:23,000
And I mean, even like when we went back to talking to Minecraft, they didn't have to give you the Vita version for free if you had the PlayStation 3 version, but it was cool that they did that.

1685
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I mean, I like how, you know, that seems to be kind of the norm with some of these digital games, you know, just like the stuff that's released specifically on the PlayStation Network, or even Xbox Live Arcade.

1686
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:50,000
But now they've got it where, well actually I don't think they do much cross-buy stuff on Xbox Live, but at least on PlayStation Network though, now they're doing it with, you know, actual disc release games and stuff like that where you can get cross-buy stuff.

1687
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:58,000
It would have been awesome if they did it with like Forza Horizon 2. I would have purchased it on 360 digitally if I got the Xbox One version.

1688
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Me too, absolutely.

1689
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Because I'll get an Xbox One at some point because I'm a consumer whore, but, like, it's probably just not going to happen. With all the conventions and shit this holiday, it's probably just not going to happen.

1690
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Which, speaking of conventions, I want to make sure we throw it out here at some point because somehow this completely missed our show roll tonight, like, oops.

1691
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:23,000
But it was just announced a couple days ago, Sony's going to be having their own little expo show, the PlayStation Experience.

1692
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:30,000
I'm sorry, I don't have the story in front of me, so I don't remember what the name of it was, but it's going to be the first weekend of December in Las Vegas.

1693
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:37,000
We don't know a whole lot more about it yet, we just know it is going to cost money to go to. I think they were saying $90 for a two-day pass, something like that.

1694
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
It's BlizzCon, essentially, but it's Sony.

1695
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Real quick, what do you guys kind of think about that?

1696
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I, it's, I don't know.

1697
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
There'll be less to do, there'll be no cosplay, and no bonus Murloc.

1698
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Then BlizzCon? I don't know, I mean, Sony could also just be like, here's your chance to play the Morpheus before anyone else.

1699
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I could see, Sony could do a pretty decent grab bag of stuff, you know, they might have like a little big planet costume that only the convention goers can get.

1700
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,000
There's similar things they can do that BlizzCon does, I don't know, it'd just be interesting.

1701
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I kind of wish we got more notice, because I'm sitting here going, well, if I wasn't going to Vegas, like, literally, like two months before this, then maybe I'd do it back to back.

1702
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I don't know, I still might, if I can make work, kind of work, I kind of want, maybe, we'll see, I have to hear more about what's going to be there, you know?

1703
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:37,000
So, anyway, sorry, not to deviate too much, here's the story I really want to talk about, and that is about, you know, what's going on with Capcom,

1704
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:43,000
and maybe some reasons why some of the games we want to be seeing out of Capcom are not happening.

1705
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:51,000
And this is in an interview with gaming publication Famitsu, Yoshinori Ono from Capcom said this, quote,

1706
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:58,000
If a game doesn't sell over two million copies, then we'd have to put the brakes on any plans for a sequel.

1707
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,000
All that means is we weren't capable enough, and all we can do after that is reflect on the experience,

1708
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:07,000
take what we can learn from it, and try to apply those lessons on some other title.

1709
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:14,000
So, in other words, if your AAA title at Capcom doesn't sell over two million copies, no sequel.

1710
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Which, maybe this explains why suddenly we're not seeing a lot of the franchises we wish we were seeing out of Capcom.

1711
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Thoughts on hearing this?

1712
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:30,000
This feels like the, was it Crystal Dynamics recently that did the Tomb Raider, and they were ultra disappointed.

1713
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I think it was under six million sales, so they were talking about not making, which I think they're making a sequel to now,

1714
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
but they were talking about not doing it because they considered that a critical failure.

1715
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:46,000
To be fair, I believe Square Enix had made the comment in that, because Crystal D was the developer,

1716
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
and then Square Enix was the publisher, and I think the Square Enix guy made the comment,

1717
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,000
but then through all the Steam sales and all this other stuff, you know, Tomb Raider,

1718
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I think they said, they came out later and somebody there had said, it's in the black, it made money,

1719
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,000
to kind of dispel the damage that had been done by the other comments, you know?

1720
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:11,000
But then, yeah, now we see that Microsoft obviously chipped in a pretty hefty amount of money to make the sequel happen,

1721
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,000
because they're getting the exclusive window or whatever, so.

1722
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:21,000
I think that Capcom doesn't really have room to be choosy right now,

1723
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:25,000
because how many fucking franchises do they have that they're actually putting out stuff for?

1724
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Well, here's my thought too, is that in the film industry, sometimes you have direct-to-video sequels,

1725
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:38,000
and they're intentionally low-budget because, you know, that they're not maybe going to make as much money as the first one did,

1726
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:43,000
so I kind of question, like, I thought the Mega Man game that they were doing,

1727
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Mega Man Universe or whatever at one point was supposed to be like a DLC,

1728
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:51,000
or, sorry, not DLC, but online-only, marketplace-only, digital title,

1729
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
that was supposed to be kind of like a smaller thing, maybe got too big, I don't know,

1730
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:00,000
but I kind of go, well, that's like a direct-to-video sequel in a way.

1731
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Well, I remember seeing a chart from them at one time, it was like eight core franchises that they had,

1732
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:12,000
and it was, you know, Lost Planet, Dead Rising, Dead or Alive, Street Fighter,

1733
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:21,000
well, I think they actually listed Street Fighter IV, Monster Hunter, I guess, in Japan.

1734
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I'm trying to think of what the other ones would be, Resident Evil.

1735
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,000
So, I just, they don't have a lot of, I mean, they keep releasing sequels for these things,

1736
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,000
but they don't have a lot of really brand-new franchises that they're kind of putting out there.

1737
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
I mean, when's the last time we've seen, like, a new franchise from them, aside from,

1738
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I think Dead Rising was the last thing, or was that Lost Planet that came out?

1739
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Lost Planet, I think, came out after.

1740
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:52,000
That might have been after. No, those were both 2006, because they were at the E3 demo thing, I think.

1741
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Weren't they demoing a free-to-play PlayStation 4 title, wasn't that Capcom,

1742
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
or is that just because it was a familiar face?

1743
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I want to say there was something deep down, wasn't that it?

1744
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Oh, maybe. Oh, they had...

1745
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I thought so.

1746
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
No, they had, what was it, they had an RPG that came out.

1747
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
The Dragon's Dogma, I think, was Capcom.

1748
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
I think that was Capcom.

1749
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Yeah, Dungeon Buster just brought up Dragon's Dogma in our chat room as well.

1750
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:24,000
So, I mean, I don't know, I guess they could do that, I mean,

1751
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
but, once again, I don't know if this is really going to affect a lot of things,

1752
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:34,000
since they don't put out a lot of new IPs, it's just kind of, sequels and rehashes, I mean...

1753
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Deep down is the free-to-play Capcom title, by the way.

1754
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I guess we just won't get DuckTales 2.

1755
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Well, or somebody gets the license, like what WayForward did, where they did do DuckTales, so...

1756
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Alright, anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.

1757
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Every week you guys email us your thoughts to participate at orangelaungeradio.com,

1758
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:00,000
and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag, and hopefully doesn't get too messy,

1759
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,000
and coded in, you know, all the things that the listeners send to us,

1760
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,000
but it seems like this week the mailbag was pretty empty, sad face.

1761
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Yes. So I have all two of them.

1762
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Oh, there was only one earlier when I looked, so...

1763
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Well, one of them is, oh my god, how long is this?

1764
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Alright, whatever, let's just dive in.

1765
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

1766
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I wrote in last week about my roommate's experiences with the educational game making company, Galaxies.

1767
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:31,000
You missed this during the show last week, by the way, DarkSakura, just so you know.

1768
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
This is going to be a follow-up email to something that you unfortunately missed,

1769
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
because you had to leave early last week.

1770
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
And how poorly the CEO runs the company.

1771
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Rob expressed concern rightfully that my secondhand knowledge could be very well fabricated or inaccurate.

1772
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
I appreciate Rob's shrewdness and due diligence as a reporter,

1773
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,000
and wanted to present some quotes from Glassdoor,

1774
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
a website which allows users to anonymously review their employers,

1775
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
regarding the company, No Kato,

1776
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:02,000
which the CEO of Galaxies, Osman Rashid, was CEO of prior to founding Galaxies.

1777
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:07,000
The CEO is very intelligent, but too focused on maximizing productivity per employee.

1778
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Unfortunately, buying Jamba Juice on Thursdays isn't enough to deal with the insane demands.

1779
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:19,000
The load on one person is probably equivalent to two or three full-time jobs at a normal company.

1780
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,000
There's far too much work on everyone's plate. Mistakes happen. People get chewed out.

1781
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
The result is stress and loathing.

1782
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Another quote, In a typical rush season, the CEO will request that all employees work seven days a week.

1783
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Many end up working 21 days straight, which is an enormous mental burden for anyone.

1784
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
And illegal.

1785
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Employees get shredded by overly aggressive managers for mistakes that occur,

1786
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
which are inevitable when you're working 80 plus hours a week.

1787
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I'm going to skip down to two more quotes.

1788
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Kiss the time with your family, your family, wife, and kids goodbye.

1789
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Kind of rough when you are running 110%, 365 days a year, and they pay you below the market rate.

1790
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Alright, and then this one's a pretty big quote here.

1791
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Some employees are not even informed during the hiring process about the work environment they might be facing.

1792
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Employees are forced to cancel their vacation plans for the bad planning of the management,

1793
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
while the management and people related to the management go on vacation anytime.

1794
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Married employees could go to the brink or into divorce when working at this company.

1795
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
If you have a family, don't even bother applying at this company.

1796
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Some managers are very bad. They harass on the phone, thinking they don't leave any trail behind for a lawsuit.

1797
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
They advertise on their career section. Take time off is needed,

1798
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:41,000
but they will not let you take the time off even when you really need it.

1799
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,000
So there's pretty good evidence that this guy who started an educational game company,

1800
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
because he was frustrated that his kids didn't have any good educational games to play,

1801
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
does not understand how to run a company or keep people happy in the slightest,

1802
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
and hasn't learned since his previous company.

1803
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Then again, he's a millionaire and sold his last company to Intel.

1804
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:03,000
So as long as there are suckers who will work for him, he'll still get his.

1805
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:11,000
However, I find it pretty hard to believe that the end product of galaxies will be more than a middling educational tool with the way the team seems to be led.

1806
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Sorry for the long email, but as someone who has worked in the game industry previously and values work slash life balance,

1807
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:25,000
I wanted to step in and shed some light on what actually goes on behind happy press releases issued by the New York Science Foundation

1808
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,000
promising rainbows, puppies, and scientific education to children who play this game.

1809
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Plus, I wanted to give Rob more evidence to corroborate the facts in the email I sent last week.

1810
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Yours truly is HP.

1811
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:44,000
And just to be clear, it's not necessarily that I don't believe you, but I sort of have to so that we don't get sued.

1812
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:49,000
It's the same reason why on TV they never say, oh, the murderer did this.

1813
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:57,000
They say, allegedly, the alleged murderer did this, so that's why I have to take everything with a grain of salt.

1814
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:03,000
I will just say this, very interesting third-party evidence. You make a very strong case.

1815
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,000
You would do very well on Judge Judy, actually.

1816
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,000
I posted the link to the no reviews in chat.

1817
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:19,000
And, you know, you bring up a very tough issue, and that is even the games that are bad,

1818
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:24,000
we know there's a lot of, and I don't, I have not played this game.

1819
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,000
We only have the, as you said, the rainbows and puppies press release, really, to go off of that took us down the memory lane of educational games.

1820
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I can't judge the game until it comes out, whatever.

1821
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
But I'm just saying, out there, there are both good games and bad games.

1822
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:46,000
And even for the bad games, we hear about that sometimes there are just, you know, horrible conditions for employees to go through to make these games.

1823
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:54,000
And it's like, oh my God, there needs to be some, we need ethics there, too. We need ethics in game development.

1824
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:01,000
It's just like, you know, your game can wait two more months so that people can have an effing break once in a while, you know?

1825
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:06,000
It's just ridiculous. I just think, this is why some games turn out bad.

1826
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:12,000
They're rushed, and then these people don't get vacation, and then it affects the final product, you know?

1827
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:18,000
But anyway, I could have a whole other tangent dedicated to that, but I'll control myself.

1828
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Last email.

1829
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Dear O.L.R., I freaking love Jonas and Diego. They are adorable as fuck, and I love hearing them talk about their experiences with the Smash community.

1830
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Please bring them back so I can continue to squee all the way from the land of video game happiness, Columbus, Ohio.

1831
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Love, Oscar. P.S., I'd love to exchange friend codes with you guys. Shoot me a message on Facebook.

1832
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:43,000
How much do they pay Oscar to send that email? No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

1833
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:48,000
No, they are a lot of fun, and they'll be back again, I know.

1834
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Just to define this for you, your guys' definition of an empty mailbag is like one to two emails more than MultiTap's mailbag.

1835
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Well, you know, I'm going to tell you this. Keep in mind, my friend, this is episode number 571 of Orange Launch Radio.

1836
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,000
We're going to get steppin'.

1837
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Yeah, I was going to say, Irene was here for episode one. She was here for episode one, so she can tell you.

1838
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:16,000
It took a long time before those emails started to come in.

1839
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:22,000
We're making 500 of these this weekend. No vacation, no time off, nothing for you.

1840
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:29,000
I remember for the first few episodes, for actually a long while, even the amount of listeners.

1841
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:33,000
I mean, to be fair, podcasting was still kind of a new thing.

1842
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
It was now. When OLR first started, podcasting didn't exist, really.

1843
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, you're kind of a trailblazer in that sense, but they weren't getting very many listeners, period.

1844
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
We had 12. We had 12 listeners on the first episode.

1845
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,000
About a dozen listeners.

1846
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:55,000
That was through DDR Freak advertising, like mad, and me pimping it on Understation Live, which was the other show I did at the time.

1847
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:59,000
And we got 12, and we were like, double digits for episode!

1848
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:10,000
We were so fucking excited, and now, thanks to podcasting and iTunes and getting on that wave, we were fortunate enough to get a few more.

1849
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:22,000
But yeah, I think consistency is very important. If you're there for the listeners, they'll start to incorporate you into their daily routine and so forth.

1850
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Sorry, Irene.

1851
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,000
No, I was going to say, yeah, it takes time to build a listener base and to, you know, get your groove.

1852
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,000
I'm just trying to encourage you guys as a mailbag.

1853
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:32,000
What's that?

1854
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I'm just trying to encourage you through your mailbag woes.

1855
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:40,000
No, we still, even when we only get two emails, we appreciate them very much. So, awesome, awesome.

1856
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Quality.

1857
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Well, if you want to send an email, maybe next week we'll get a compliment for our friends from Multitap Podcast, or maybe for JBMon.

1858
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Maybe next week we will, but we won't be here to read them.

1859
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Oh, that's right. We'll be here next week to read them. Well, maybe it'll pile up and we'll have four emails and we'll be back in two weeks.

1860
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,000
I know.

1861
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
And then Rob will have to threaten Kardashian music.

1862
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:07,000
That's right. You know what, Piper, did you know that one week on the show, I said, if we don't get four emails, I'm playing music from Kim Kardashian Hollywood during the show.

1863
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
And we did get four emails and Rob played it anyway.

1864
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,000
And it was glorious.

1865
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I did because the chatters were like, you're not going to do it. You're not going to, I dare you to do it. I dare you. So, I was like, don't test me. Here we go.

1866
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:24,000
And you know what they said? They said, I was expecting it to be a lot worse. The music's actually not bad in that game.

1867
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,000
It was bad. It was bad.

1868
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Well, that one doesn't feel bad.

1869
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
All right.

1870
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Hey, pump it up, people. Not pump it up. The other game that's not DDR.

1871
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,000
In the groove?

1872
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:42,000
In the groove. Yeah. You should do Kardashian music in your game.

1873
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
In the groove, Kim Kardashian edition.

1874
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,000
In the groove, Kim Kardashian edition.

1875
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:56,000
All right. Anyway, this is very random train to go on. All right, let's get to the FUs of the week because also since episode one, we have always done the FUs of the week.

1876
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Why do we do the FUs of the week on a video game show? Because sometimes we get angry and this is our moment to let it all out of our systems so that we don't rage on some noob on Xbox.

1877
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Because fuck you, that's why.

1878
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Here is justice. Here is punishment. This is fucked up.

1879
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:41,000
My FU goes towards people who are so absolutely married to their, and I'm using a quoting here, faction that they refuse to remotely give anybody of another ideology a chance.

1880
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:51,000
If you are going to be as head in the ground as you accuse your opponents of being, guess what? You're part of the problem.

1881
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:59,000
We need to stop dividing lines between people and actually have conversations and be grownups instead of being little children pointing fingers at each other. The end.

1882
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Well, I'm sorry, Jamie, but for the Horde and that's that.

1883
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,000
And you're a stinky, poopy head.

1884
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Well, I just got told. All right. Loki.

1885
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Um, I guess this FU in my car needed to, well, not even needed to, a valve adjustment that cost five minutes.

1886
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
A valve adjustment sounds like something the guy made up. I'm sorry.

1887
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:30,000
No, it's not actually. I researched this in the past when I was having problems and it's just, it's something that Honda fits need after they get to about, you know, the mileage they have.

1888
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:32,000
And it's just the only, it wouldn't be that.

1889
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:36,000
You're laughing, but it's true. They fucking do that shit where they just make up.

1890
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:41,000
You're low on the exam of Elvis. Hello. You're low on blinker fluid.

1891
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Unfortunately, it's just because it takes, they had, it's in the manifold and they have to disassemble like part of the engine that it takes three and a half hours to do that.

1892
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,000
So that it's all labor. Thank you. Labor being so expensive.

1893
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:56,000
All right. Good health ain't cheap. All right.

1894
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Let's see. My FU of the week goes to a couple of things. They both have to do with the show I was doing last night.

1895
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:09,000
So my character, I had to wear a lot of makeup for my character last night and like most of it came off, but the fricking eyeliner will not come off.

1896
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,000
And it looks, I just looked like an emo kid today.

1897
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
You know, if you had told me this, I would have brought my makeup over.

1898
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I don't, I believe me, I've scrubbed with like Cetaphil and all that stuff like over and over. Like this stuff will not come off.

1899
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Rob, admit it. You look fabulous.

1900
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:30,000
I know, but I look like I'm like going to go to a fallout boy concert or something. I just don't, it's not, sorry to all the fans out there, but it's just like, this isn't really my look.

1901
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:37,000
I just look really tired. I don't know. Anyway, uh, let's go to our guests. JV Mon, you have some FUs of the week you want to get out?

1902
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Uh, FUs of the landlord of the store I work at because he's not renewing the lease because reasons. So as of February, I'll be out of a job.

1903
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:52,000
And this is the second time that this has happened to me last year because I work for FYI. I don't care.

1904
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:00,000
The story I worked at in Westchester last year, they closed down because the landlord's like, fuck you, we're not renewing the lease. You've been there 20 years, no one cares.

1905
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:05,000
So I got transferred back to the store in the Bronx and now the landlord there is doing the exact same thing.

1906
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
That's what FYE stands for, right? Fuck you, eh?

1907
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Pretty much.

1908
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:16,000
I don't think a FYE is from Canada. Okay.

1909
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:25,000
And fuck you to Alamo Car Rental because when I went to get my car on Friday, I had to wait about 40 minutes to get registered.

1910
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:32,000
And then they made us wait outside because they had no cars, but they were still taking registration for more cars.

1911
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:41,000
And I was kind of like, oh, a car just came back. Quick, get in and run. And it's just like, I haven't had coffee in like five hours and I'm crazy.

1912
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
And they don't have Dunkin Donuts here, so I don't know what you're going to do.

1913
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Starbucks? They have Starbucks.

1914
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Alright, moving on. How about Piper? You got some FUs of the Week you want to get out here? Something to make you Yanksty?

1915
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Does it have to be personal or can it be like famous names?

1916
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:56,000
You can do whatever you want it to be.

1917
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
I've got three quick ones. Fuck you Lindsay Lohan, you know why.

1918
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
You know what you did.

1919
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Fuck you Phil Fish, I'm still mad and Bodily is like way better. I'm not even being professional now, Bodily is cooler than you.

1920
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:15,000
And fuck you whoever assembled my 3DS. I want it back and I still hate you.

1921
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Alright, you got to follow that Princess Irene, last but not least.

1922
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Um, fuck you to my cat. Because he's a dick. He keeps knocking over my digital frame and I just want to punch him in his little cat nose. Because he's a jerk.

1923
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Yes, I am cruel to my cat. Aww, not really. And then an ambiguous generic fuck you to school related things.

1924
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Alright. And that's it. Very ambiguous.

1925
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Yeah, no one or a thing in particular.

1926
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Act Deft by the way, who is our Mexican listener. One of our Mexican listeners. We have a couple.

1927
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Just the one.

1928
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Just the one. But no, he's been here like every week for a very long time. So we kind of call him the one in Mexico.

1929
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,000
But Act Deft for FYE says fuck you SA.

1930
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
So there you go.

1931
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Somewhere between fuck you A and fuck you SA.

1932
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Fuck you SA.

1933
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Two levels.

1934
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:24,000
That's deep man.

1935
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:26,000
At least it's not like fuck your eggs.

1936
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, OLR debuting the new Fall Out Boy single.

1937
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Quote, if you think this podcast is long you should see the reasons I'm breaking up with you.

1938
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:40,000
That totally sounds like a Fall Out Boy song.

1939
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:46,000
God, are they the ones that have that song? Like there's a song on the radio right now and I swear it sounds like Fall Out Boy is one of those bands.

1940
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
But it samples like Tom Diner. Tom Steiner. Do you remember?

1941
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I think it is.

1942
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Oh my God. I got so angry when I heard that the first time because like, you know, I'm hearing it.

1943
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:02,000
And I'm like, oh fuck yeah, it's Suzanne Vega. And then it's like, I'm so mad.

1944
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:07,000
And I'm like, what did they do to Tom Steiner?

1945
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:12,000
At least you don't have to hear it about 50 times a day at work because it's on our audio loop at work.

1946
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
So I hear it about 50 times a shift.

1947
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And every time I get fooled because I'm like, yeah, Tom Steiner. Wait, no, I should know better by now.

1948
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Oh my God. If I had to go through that, fuck yeah, euthanasia.

1949
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
I don't know. I don't know. Alright.

1950
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Anyway, we just got a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to open up the phones for you to call.

1951
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Yay. Tell us we're pretty. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Or maybe you have a question and you want to talk about something else in games.

1952
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:45,000
You can look into our eyes longingly. Except you can't because we don't have a cam.

1953
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Yay. 2-800-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. But first, two more stories here. Loki.

1954
02:42:52,000 --> 02:43:02,000
So, since I was so excited about Forza Horizon 2, I'm a little disappointed that for whatever reason, I guess it's because they really want you to buy an Xbox One.

1955
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:08,000
All the DLC that they're releasing for Forza Horizon 2 is only for the Xbox One.

1956
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:14,000
The Xbox 360 version, not even part of the Forza rewards program thing that they have.

1957
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:24,000
They basically just said, hey, we're currently planning to release DLC only for the Xbox One version of Forza Horizon 2.

1958
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Also, Forza rewards benefits are only available on the Xbox One version of Forza Horizon 2.

1959
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:34,000
This means that Xbox 360 players will not receive Forza rewards credits or cars.

1960
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:41,000
And they said progress in the 360 version of Forza Horizon 2 does not count towards your Forza reward tier level score.

1961
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Only progress in the Xbox One version of Forza Horizon 2 will count towards your overall Forza score and tier level and Forza rewards.

1962
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Yeah. Fuck you guys.

1963
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Thanks a lot, you know. It is your own fucking console. It's a first party game and you're not even supporting that shit.

1964
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:06,000
You know how many people have an Xbox 360? It's like significantly more than have an Xbox One.

1965
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
You're not going to win people over this way.

1966
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Yeah.

1967
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Like I want to get Forza Horizon 2, but you're right. All this stuff I'm hearing about how basically the 360 version is kind of gimped.

1968
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
I'm like, well then I need to hold out until I have an Xbox One whenever that may be.

1969
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Exactly. And what if they do a game of the year edition later on like they did with Forza Horizon 5.

1970
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Or Forza 5, no.

1971
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Or any big game.

1972
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Alright.

1973
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Well, some sad news for those of you guys that like your magazines.

1974
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Like I know Dark Soccer loves her print media, but unfortunately another magazine going away and it's the official Nintendo Magazine in the UK.

1975
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:47,000
We'll be shutting down on November 11th. This is announced by Future Publishing and Nintendo.

1976
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:51,000
The magazine staff, however, good news, they're going to be shifted to other positions within the company.

1977
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,000
So at least they're not using the, you know, redundancy. It's the UK, so it's redundancies.

1978
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Anyhow, from the website, quote, Nintendo will continue to speak directly to fans via Nintendo Direct, our social media, and online channels and public events.

1979
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Internet, internet, internet, expos. Right? Those are the four things they just said there.

1980
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:19,000
So there it is. The unofficial Nintendo UK magazine stopped publishing in 2012, the same year that Nintendo Power ceased operations.

1981
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:26,000
So that's unfortunate. The cool thing about this magazine, too, is I've seen some pictures when you stack the magazines all side by side.

1982
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Like the first hundred or so issues, like the Nintendo logo, and these last few were like a Wii U.

1983
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
So they actually look kind of cool sitting on your shelf.

1984
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
So that, you know, that sucks. That's a bummer.

1985
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:46,000
And, you know, I don't know, like it's cool that you can get magazines on your iPad and all, but it's just not the same when sitting on the toilet.

1986
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:52,000
It's not the same at all, because you're like, I have this expensive thing in here, and I don't want to get water on it accidentally.

1987
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:57,000
All right. Anyway. There it is. Going away.

1988
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Darsaka, surely you're having a sad about that. I mean, I doubt you.

1989
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:06,000
But I never actually read the UK magazine, so I'm slightly indifferent, but print media will always be awesome.

1990
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:10,000
You can never digitize the smell of ink.

1991
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:18,000
All right. Well, we are going to go to the Skype line, 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1992
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Let's see if anybody would like to call.

1993
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
You can talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe there's something else you want to bring up.

1994
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:29,000
I don't know. But the phones are open now, so let's get to it.

1995
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:35,000
While we wait for your calls, let me check with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

1996
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I'll bring up Twitter here.

1997
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Not yet.

1998
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:41,000
They're going to do a comic for Valiant Hearts.

1999
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Are they?

2000
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:49,000
I asked iOS game, and the thing that's coming out was it on PlayStation 4 and stuff, so they're doing...

2001
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Nice. That's right. Didn't the handheld Sony things do like comics? I remember the PSP did.

2002
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Well, yeah, and this is kind of cool because this is one of the... I think this was using that UBIARD engine, so that looked pretty neat.

2003
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Nice. All right. Well, we do have some calls coming in, so let's get to it.

2004
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2005
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,000
It's Ranma.

2006
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Hey, everybody. I'm doing good. How is everybody there?

2007
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:16,000
It's a full house tonight. We're great. A little hot in here, but you know.

2008
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Hey, Ranma.

2009
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
You're still a dick, JB Mon.

2010
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:23,000
Wait, why are you a dick? What'd you do?

2011
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,000
For the buff boys comment.

2012
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Oh.

2013
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,000
What else?

2014
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,000
The private conversation on your Facebook that most of our listeners probably won't see. Sorry.

2015
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
What's up, Ranma? To what do we owe this phone call?

2016
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Well, before we get into that, Rob, I want you to know you've had too much candy. You're not allowed to have any more.

2017
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
But candy's delicious. Why can't I have candy?

2018
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:46,000
I suggest I brought some over.

2019
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:53,000
You know what? Fuck your rules. I'm eating candy right now. Fuck your rules. Fuck them.

2020
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Yeah, but that type of candy might get your ass beat, okay?

2021
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
You're not the boss of me.

2022
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,000
That's not my job.

2023
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Alright. What else is on your mind, buddy?

2024
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:13,000
Oh, I was listening earlier. You were talking about the whole thing about Comic-Cons. I figured let me chime in real quick and give you the meat and potatoes of all of that.

2025
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Please.

2026
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:32,000
See, I didn't go because I can't justify taking a day off of work just to stand eight hours on a line in a comic book shop for a three or four day badge where by the time I get to the front, they're sold out.

2027
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
So that's my main reason for not going.

2028
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:40,000
But as you saw, a picture went viral that a friend of mine took about the weapons.

2029
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Pretty much what was happening was you had a basic set of rules on the website, which did not reflect the rules on the mobile site.

2030
02:48:50,000 --> 02:49:03,000
So pretty much staff was pretty much confiscating weapons left and right, and people got upset that the confiscate weapons that people have been working on for days, weeks, hours, months, whatever.

2031
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Which I understand. But if the rules say that the weapons have to be made of cardboard or foam and you go out and start making things out of different materials to kind of make it stand out and they take it, you have no one except yourself but the blank.

2032
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:31,000
Now, they were actually throwing them out for a little bit. The next day on Friday, they more or less cleared it up saying, well, if it looks too realistic, you're not going to be able to come into the Javits Center with it.

2033
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:34,000
We're going to take it, tag it, and you'll be able to pick it up later.

2034
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:45,000
This sounds like a mess, though. Doesn't that make you kind of question the organization of it, though? Especially with these people standing in line for forever. Come on.

2035
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Who has fun doing that? That pisses me off more than anything. I swear to God, if I go to BlizzCon and I have to stand in line all fucking day to get a badge, I'm going to be pissed right from the get-go after all the money paid for it or whatever.

2036
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Nothing drives me crazier than that stuff, so why couldn't they figure out a way to do that online and what have you. And then, you know, it's really crappy that they had that miscommunication between online and what have you. So, I don't know, that's kind of frustrating, too.

2037
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:31,000
I know, and I've had a couple of staffers contact Comic-Con, and I posted the response emails on my website so people can see what was going on. It's pretty much, like I said, if it looks like a weapon, it will be confiscated, done and done.

2038
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:45,000
But, Rob, you're sitting here complaining about what's going on with Comic-Con, which I understand, but I don't know if you know this, but the people that run Comic-Con are the same people that run PAX, so you shouldn't be surprised.

2039
02:50:45,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Touché. Brad from Pop Culture says, be glad you weren't at previous Dragon Cons. The line there used to be horrible. Yeah, I've heard stories. Yeah, thank God they fixed that up. This year was great. I walked right in. Just took me five minutes. It was awesome.

2040
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:21,000
Which is good. I mean, a lot of conventions do that, but I'll admit, when I went to Comic-Con last year for one day, I got there about 10 o'clock that morning. I was in in about 15 minutes, because they kind of spread it out with the checkpoints in the Tap Your Badge.

2041
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:30,000
And I guess this morning, yesterday, because it started raining pretty bad, arrows kind of huddled up together, and I'm just like, oh, good thing I'm not going.

2042
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Yeah, Bob Coffee in our chat says, be glad you weren't at Anime Expo this year. The line of, Line Con of Death. Yeah, I heard stories.

2043
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Oh, yeah, I kind of toyed with that. I made this meme called Line Con The Game, and it was like, easy, normal, hard, God Mode. I think I put that for God Mode, Anime Expo.

2044
02:51:51,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Now, the question everybody wants to know is, you know, for all the troubles of standing in line and having weapons confiscated, was there a ball pit to be given an hour in?

2045
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Um, actually, no. There was no ball pit this year.

2046
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:14,000
What a failure of a con. Alright, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Some people might have...

2047
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Trust me, your sentiments, it's echoed across everybody, and you know how it is, I can't stand this, I'm not going, I'm not going.

2048
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Monthly, you going to Comic Con? Hell yeah, I'm going! Exactly right, exactly. I'll be back, heck yeah.

2049
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Alright, Rob, I'm going to let you go to see if we can get some more calls in, but thank you as always, and Anime Jam session Tuesday nights here at VOG.

2050
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Doing a complete roasting of Comic Con, so bring some food, bring some steaks, bring some marshmallows, the flame is going to be mighty high.

2051
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:47,000
And bring some Kahlua. Did you see those marshmallow shots with Kahlua in them?

2052
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:53,000
Uh, no, I got something better. What's that? Quickly. Deep fried tequila shots.

2053
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:58,000
No, I'm not a tequila person. What? What is this? It sounds amazing.

2054
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Deep fried tequila shots, yeah. Well, you know they do deep fried Kool-Aid, why not?

2055
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Why do I not have this in me right now?

2056
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:13,000
You bake this, you take Pal Cake, and you cut it up into little blocks, you let the tequila soak in it, and then you deep fry it!

2057
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:16,000
And add powdered sugar, just like mom used to make.

2058
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:20,000
When you cook it, wouldn't the alcohol boil? Alright, forget it.

2059
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:26,000
No, because the Pal Cake soaks so much of it in, and when you deep fry it, it's not it.

2060
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Alright, this ain't a damn cooking show, we'll talk to you later.

2061
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:33,000
That's because Logie didn't bring any bacon!

2062
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
There might have been bacon on that burger.

2063
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Yeah, it wasn't very good either.

2064
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Alright. Rama, bye!

2065
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Bye!

2066
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Alright, 1877 Game O, L, R.

2067
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Well, see, that's the thing, I used to get, they had those special triple, third pound burgers or whatever, and then they converted them into their new quarter pounders.

2068
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:55,000
And the quarter pounder one, the difference was that they used red onions in it and stuff like that.

2069
02:53:55,000 --> 02:54:01,000
But now, and there's science, now with white onions! So basically it's a fucking quarter pounder with bacon and they charge extra for it.

2070
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:06,000
Well at least it's not those frickin' onions that were dehydrated and shit, that stuff was nasty.

2071
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:12,000
The bacon was not good though, it tasted really weird, and the white onions are not good either because they've been sitting there all day long.

2072
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:21,000
Actually, true story, you know that that's what makes potato salad go bad is not mayonnaise or the potatoes, it's the onions being set out in the sun.

2073
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Be very careful if you eat raw onions that have been sitting out. Just sayin'.

2074
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Well, I will not touch potato salad because of the mayonnaise word, and you all know how I feel about mayonnaise, can't stand it.

2075
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:35,000
It's amazing?

2076
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Mayonnaise!

2077
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Amazingly barf when I eat it, cause stuff is nasty.

2078
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
And today's opposite day, so you mean it's great.

2079
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Now I hear there's a potato salad that's made with mustard, I'm okay with that.

2080
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:56,000
No wait, when I make potato salad, I actually will use mayonnaise and mustard in it, because mustard will offset sweetness in some of the other ingredients.

2081
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:00,000
And it comes out very balanced and very nice, that's how we do it in the south, just sayin'.

2082
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:03,000
The way Rob feels about mayonnaise is the way I feel about mustard.

2083
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:07,000
I won't eat mustard on its own, cause I hate mustard, but in potato salad.

2084
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:11,000
See, it does seem like people are in one camp or the other, like you don't have a lot of people that are both, except Jamie.

2085
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:14,000
Mustard is an ingredient, not a condiment.

2086
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:20,000
When I make potato salad, I make it with potato, bacon, butter, salt and pepper, and I bake it.

2087
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Oh wait, that's a big potato.

2088
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
I don't like potato salad.

2089
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Yeah, Piper?

2090
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Not just say this isn't a cooking show.

2091
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
I know, right? Well nobody's calling.

2092
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
We always talk about food.

2093
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:37,000
You can always talk about potatoes, like I don't care, you know.

2094
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Never mayonnaise.

2095
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:41,000
Does food never come up on multi-tap podcasts? Never ever?

2096
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:42,000
I don't know.

2097
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Microphones.

2098
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Microphones, don't forget.

2099
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:51,000
I have to go back to the backlog. It's all on YouTube, but we have to have talked about food at some point.

2100
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:54,000
I'll just have to listen to every episode and find out.

2101
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
There's only like, nine.

2102
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
We talk about alcohol, sometimes.

2103
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Okay, well there you go.

2104
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:01,000
That's a food group.

2105
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:02,000
That's a consumable.

2106
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:03,000
What about the drunk cast coming up?

2107
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Oh yeah, we're gonna have a drunk cast coming up.

2108
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Ah, the days. Ah, the days. The days.

2109
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Try not to do what I did when you're running up the wall.

2110
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:12,000
No, you're lying down.

2111
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Running up the wall.

2112
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:17,000
No, no, yeah. I was lying down, kicking the wall, yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.

2113
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Keep in mind, this is an episode of OLR that happened, and I was so drunk.

2114
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
And then Jamie went and passed out my bed.

2115
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:28,000
I didn't pass out near bed. I was laying there sobering, and then Loki brought me waffles, and I felt better.

2116
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Yeah, Loki cooked waffles during the show.

2117
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:31,000
That's awesome.

2118
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Why? Why not?

2119
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:36,000
And I was sober like five seconds after eating a waffle.

2120
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:37,000
That's super bacon.

2121
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Is it kind of like that one time, Rob, when you got drunk when we had a cast party for Rocky,

2122
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:48,000
and you were laying on the ground leaving a voicemail for us, and someone threw a condom on your chest,

2123
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:51,000
and you didn't know for like ten minutes that that condom was just sitting there?

2124
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Yeah, I think that was an understation live voicemail.

2125
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Was this Rocky or Rocky Horror?

2126
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:55,000
Rocky Horror.

2127
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:56,000
Yeah.

2128
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Could you imagine shadowcasting Rocky?

2129
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Adrian, I love you.

2130
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Condom dude on my chest, dude.

2131
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:10,000
All right. Let's see. Go into some of the tweets that we have.

2132
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Oh my God, it's ringing. The phone's ringing. Oh my God.

2133
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Hi, Aaron. Aaron's on his radio. Who's this?

2134
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Hey, this is Eckdef.

2135
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Hey, Eckdef. How you doing?

2136
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Hey, pretty good. Pretty good.

2137
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:25,000
I want to make a follow-up to Smash Brothers.

2138
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
You want to make a what of Smash Brothers?

2139
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,000
A follow-up. Sorry.

2140
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:32,000
Oh, a follow-up. Yeah, sure. How has Smash Brothers been treating you this week?

2141
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Well, it has been pretty good.

2142
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Yesterday I went to a convention, speaking of,

2143
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:46,000
and I entered a tournament with others playing Smash Brothers on the 3DS,

2144
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:52,000
and I did pretty well, though here's my probably complaint about the game

2145
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:55,000
and probably other people have said about it,

2146
02:57:55,000 --> 02:58:01,000
but it's an issue, and it's the local multiplayer.

2147
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:06,000
It lags really bad in some aspects,

2148
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:13,000
and it makes the game a little frustrating to play, even.

2149
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:16,000
I have heard this, that Smash multiplayer will get laggy,

2150
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:20,000
and I don't know if that's just because maybe the 3DS has an older communication technology in it,

2151
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:24,000
or especially at a convention, you probably have a lot of interference.

2152
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:27,000
The radio signals or whatever the hell the 3DS is using to communicate,

2153
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:34,000
probably it's interfered with everybody's cell phone and credit card systems and the dealer's hall and all this other stuff.

2154
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Convention is probably one of the worst possible places to play a multiplayer game like that,

2155
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:44,000
because I'm sure, especially in Smash, you have a lot of data being transferred back and forth real quick.

2156
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:50,000
You guys were just playing a match before the show, Irene. Was it working for you guys?

2157
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Luxuriously. It was seamless.

2158
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:57,000
Right, but that's maybe because we didn't have a lot of interference here going on at the time.

2159
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:02,000
It worked beautifully. There were just the two of us, though, so it wasn't a four-player match.

2160
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:08,000
You guys have a network in the studio, but there's not a whole lot going on.

2161
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:11,000
So I'm assuming it's going to be something like that, technology-based.

2162
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:16,000
So that could be a difference at Def, but it still sucks. I'm not trying to make excuses.

2163
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:20,000
I'm just trying to be like, oh, this could be the reality.

2164
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:26,000
And even then, it wasn't really that bad. It wasn't horrible.

2165
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:33,000
But we were playing in some matches, and suddenly it just lagged out of nowhere.

2166
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:38,000
But yeah, it was probably that. A lot of interference. A lot of people were playing.

2167
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:44,000
There were at least, I think, 30 people playing on the tournament, so yeah.

2168
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:50,000
With that many 3DSs, that's got to be an issue right there.

2169
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Surely there's some type of limitation.

2170
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:56,000
But man, all that talk about conventions and playing the 3DS and all that,

2171
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:59,000
it makes me miss the days of PictoChat.

2172
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:04,000
I know that was an old-school DS thing, but remember penis chat at every convention you'd go to?

2173
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,000
Oh my gosh. It's not really a thing anymore.

2174
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:12,000
We were standing in line at E3 and realizing you were PictoChatting your friend who was two people behind you.

2175
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:17,000
Exactly. And all these people you might see on the internet, you're PictoChatting with them,

2176
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:21,000
and it's like, hey, here's a penis I drew. Ha ha ha.

2177
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:26,000
So, anyway. Explicit in chat agrees with that 30 people is going to be an issue.

2178
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
Well, how was the con otherwise?

2179
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:34,000
It was pretty good. It was fantastic. A lot of things happening.

2180
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:42,000
Especially in the gaming section. They had some people playing on PCs.

2181
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:46,000
There was a Just Dance tournament, too. It was pretty good.

2182
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Did you get up there and shake your butt to some Just Dance songs?

2183
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:56,000
I didn't get to play. I was kind of busy with the Smash tournament and other things,

2184
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
and I sadly couldn't get in.

2185
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:01,000
Wait. Did they have board games?

2186
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
Oh yeah. A lot of them, too.

2187
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:10,000
There was a section even for card games and board games, too. So yeah, it was a pretty good con.

2188
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:15,000
A lot of things to do, but sadly I couldn't do that much.

2189
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
But did they have Jenga?

2190
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
Rob, get the fuck over Jenga.

2191
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:22,000
No, I will never get the fuck. Okay, did they have Don't Break the Ice?

2192
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:26,000
Okay, that one's legitimate. It's a little legitimate.

2193
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Remember, we had Don't Break the Jenga.

2194
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Yeah, Don't Break the Jenga.

2195
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
What con was this?

2196
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:37,000
It's Shinigami Fest. It's in Mexicali, Mexico.

2197
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:47,000
So yeah, if you live in Southern California, you may visit it next year,

2198
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:51,000
but for everyone else, it's going to be far.

2199
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
Might be a little bit far. There you go.

2200
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:57,000
Well, Act F, thanks so much for the call. Glad to hear you had a good time at the con.

2201
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:00,000
3DS communication troubles outstanding.

2202
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:01,000
Yeah.

2203
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
Alright, take care, my friend.

2204
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:04,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2205
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Yeah, anytime. Bye-bye.

2206
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Bye.

2207
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:09,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2208
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:12,000
We can maybe squeeze in one more call, although we are running a little bit over,

2209
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:15,000
so I do want to try to wrap up with some of these tweets here.

2210
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
So if you want to get in, get in quick.

2211
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:20,000
We have some tweets here. We have Alex P. Carson tweeted us saying,

2212
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:24,000
Tuned in to OLR after a year-long hiatus.

2213
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:27,000
Well, welcome back. Welcome back. Where the hell have you been?

2214
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:30,000
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. Things change.

2215
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
People got other stuff to do and what have you.

2216
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:36,000
I mean, you know, Princess Irene hasn't been here for like two years.

2217
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:37,000
But seriously, don't leave again.

2218
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:41,000
Yeah, I will find you. I'm just kidding. Alright.

2219
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Let's see. Satura tweeted us saying, and I probably, I always mispronounce your name,

2220
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:49,000
and I'm so sorry, but tweeted us a story that says,

2221
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:53,000
Sony working diligently, in quotes, on The Last Guardian.

2222
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:59,000
Great news. Maybe that's what they're going to fucking get people to pay 90 bucks to go see for two days in Vegas.

2223
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:03,000
It's a hoax again, dude. They've been talking about this for a decade and change.

2224
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Yeah, but...

2225
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Hey, I'm working diligently on The Last Guardian as well.

2226
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:15,000
You know what? Finally, Duke Nukem Forever happened. Final Fantasy XV might actually happen.

2227
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Do you know, somebody put it in perspective.

2228
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:23,000
Final Fantasy XIII versus what it was originally called, right, was announced before the iPhone.

2229
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:24,000
Yes.

2230
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:25,000
Isn't that crazy?

2231
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:28,000
How many systems? Was it just two systems ago?

2232
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
No, it was supposed to be when XIII came out.

2233
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
XIII was early in the life of the PlayStation 3.

2234
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:36,000
For a Final Fantasy game, Final Fantasy XIII came out really early in the console's life.

2235
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
I thought they had pushed it because it was originally supposed to be a different one.

2236
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:42,000
They had made several in between that, so it was originally supposed to be back a couple of seasons ago.

2237
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:45,000
I think you're thinking of Agato, which was supposed to be the PSP one.

2238
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Agato became Zero.

2239
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
Yeah, yeah. That's the one that changed.

2240
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:52,000
But didn't they originally develop XIII for the PS2 and then switched it to the PS3?

2241
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,000
They might have.

2242
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:59,000
That's what I remember reading. It was like, because it took a while for XIII to come out, but that's because they had to switch it from being PS2 to PS3.

2243
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
Could be. That actually would make a lot of sense.

2244
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:06,000
But then, you look at Final Fantasy XII, which came out so late in the life, but...

2245
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,000
So underrated.

2246
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:12,000
It's so underrated, and I really hope that's in line to get the HD treatment at some point.

2247
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:16,000
One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week, because I didn't get to play a lot of it.

2248
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:19,000
But since no other calls are coming in, I'm going to shut down the Skype line.

2249
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:20,000
I'll quickly talk about this.

2250
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:23,000
Final Fantasy XIII came out on Steam this week, right?

2251
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:26,000
So I did download that and check it out a little bit.

2252
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
Oh my god, I needed... Get this.

2253
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:36,000
The game is 56 gigs because it has the full English and Japanese audio, which I don't think the PlayStation 3 release had both.

2254
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:40,000
But because I downloaded it early, it had to decrypt on my computer.

2255
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:44,000
I had to free up 100 gigabytes on my hard drive to install this stupid game.

2256
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,000
That's ridonculous.

2257
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:53,000
And then, no, what's ridonculous is that you can either play in full screen mode, which has the wrong aspect ratio for my monitor, so it's all squished.

2258
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:57,000
Or you can play in one resolutioned window, and you can't resize the window.

2259
03:04:57,000 --> 03:05:00,000
35 gigs of that is devoted to Zaza's hair.

2260
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:05,000
But seriously, get the fuck out of here with that lazy fucking port.

2261
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:08,000
They already have a hack to change the resolution.

2262
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:11,000
So somebody else did Square's job for them, essentially.

2263
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
That is bullshit. Come on.

2264
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
It runs at a higher resolution, but here's the thing, though.

2265
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:19,000
It looks like shit because all the cutscenes are still at 720.

2266
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:27,000
And on top of that, the LOD textures and stuff are very low res, so it looks like shit when you up-res it.

2267
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:28,000
You know what, though?

2268
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
I will say this.

2269
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:38,000
In that window, which wasn't the same size as my monitor, but in the window, the game did look really fucking good.

2270
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Because it runs very smoothly on the PC and so forth.

2271
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:43,000
I will give it that.

2272
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:49,000
It looked really fucking good, but I was really driven bonkers that I couldn't just make that fill my screen.

2273
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:50,000
How fucking hard is that?

2274
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:51,000
It's still there. I'm surprised.

2275
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:54,000
I mean, I forget. Was it three or four disks?

2276
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:55,000
I guess it was four disks.

2277
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,000
It was four disks.

2278
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:00,000
I don't know, but that would still be only, like, 45 gigs.

2279
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:04,000
I've been trying to decide whether or not I actually want to get it.

2280
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:07,000
I mean, my computer would probably run it really well, but at the same time...

2281
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
I'll take the great assault, what I just gave you.

2282
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
It's like free DLC or something.

2283
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:12,000
Wait for a Steam sale.

2284
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
Is Vanille really fucking annoying still?

2285
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:22,000
I think Vanille is underrated because a lot of people base their judgment on Final Fantasy XIII off the first ten hours, which I understand.

2286
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:23,000
I mean, that's a long fucking investment in the game.

2287
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:24,000
Let me rephrase my question.

2288
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:25,000
But these characters get better towards the end.

2289
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
Is her voice acting still really fucking annoying?

2290
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:28,000
Yes, of course.

2291
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
Well, I just plan on playing it in Japanese anyway.

2292
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
Yeah, play it in Japanese and it'll be less annoying.

2293
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:33,000
I don't know.

2294
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:36,000
Her Japanese voice actor is kind of annoying too.

2295
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:37,000
Hope might be okay.

2296
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:49,000
Just to kind of cap on it, I think they did this for Dark Souls 2 or Dark Souls 1 where it had some kind of bullshit resolution thing and some fan made a patch.

2297
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:53,000
It was like a 128 kilobyte patch that made the whole game better.

2298
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
So, this happens.

2299
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:56,000
Let's see.

2300
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
Alan Alchemy is jumping in saying,

2301
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:05,000
Final Fantasy XIII for PC has a nasty bug where you get stutters and pauses if you don't have a USB controller plugged in.

2302
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
Wow, that's crazy.

2303
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:12,000
If I put a USB controller in, to be fair, you should be using one, but come the fuck on and that fixed it.

2304
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:16,000
So, I'm sorry, this port has some serious problems.

2305
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:23,000
And I think for me to buy another square port in the future, I need them to come out and say what they're going to do better next time.

2306
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:27,000
I'm not buying anymore of their Steam ports blind.

2307
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
That was a stupid decision on my part.

2308
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:34,000
I will be perfectly honest though, I have no problem with fan made mods because, hello, I play Mass Effect.

2309
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:35,000
Yeah, I know.

2310
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:45,000
And don't get me wrong, I totally embrace the modding community and that's awesome, but when they're having to do the job that the porters should have done, I kind of have a problem with that.

2311
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:49,000
So, anyway, not to end on a negative note, but oops.

2312
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:53,000
Alright, anyway, no, we have a positive note because we had some great guests on the show tonight.

2313
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:58,000
So I want to make sure, quickly, any of the last minute stories, anything, anything, anything, no?

2314
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
Alright, then we'll close up shop here.

2315
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:04,000
I want to thank, once again, Bodhi from LunaRay Games for coming on the show tonight.

2316
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:08,000
Fantastic interview, best of luck with the game, really appreciate it.

2317
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
And thank all of you here in studio as well.

2318
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:13,000
I'm going to go around and get some final thoughts from you guys.

2319
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:19,000
Jvmon, do you have a final thought before you head back over to New York City? In a week, I guess, but still.

2320
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:22,000
I'm finally going to start playing Final Fantasy XIV again.

2321
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:23,000
Good call, it's a fun game.

2322
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,000
Join our server.

2323
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:25,000
I did.

2324
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:26,000
Play with us.

2325
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:27,000
Oh, okay, play with us.

2326
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:28,000
Rob just needs to add me.

2327
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:29,000
Okay, well.

2328
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:33,000
And I kind of miss playing Dance Central Spotlight, even though I hate the whole piecemeal garbage-ness.

2329
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:37,000
I heard a lot of the dances are just kind of lifted from the older games, is that true?

2330
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:49,000
Some of the moves are just ripped straight from Dance Central III, but it's still pretty and fun, even though the first song they force you to play is the Will.I.Am and Justin Bieber song.

2331
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:50,000
That's so fucked up.

2332
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:54,000
So even right there, I was like, eh, I almost want to never play this again.

2333
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:58,000
Are you going to get the Fantasia game, though? Because I'm really curious to know how it is.

2334
03:08:58,000 --> 03:08:59,000
That's out in two weeks.

2335
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
Yeah, that's really soon. So buy time next year.

2336
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
I can't touch a game that includes Bieber.

2337
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:05,000
It's like Bayonetta is coming out, too.

2338
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:06,000
Yeah, that's true.

2339
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:07,000
It's like Bayonetta, Fantasia.

2340
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
Exciting time in gaming. I know, I know.

2341
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
My wallet's weeping silently in my pants.

2342
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
Any final thought for us tonight?

2343
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:17,000
No.

2344
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:20,000
All right, well, have a good rest of your trip here in Northern California.

2345
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:21,000
Thank you.

2346
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:22,000
And come back. We'll see you in a year.

2347
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:24,000
Maybe sooner.

2348
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Oh, okay.

2349
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:26,000
Maybe.

2350
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:27,000
All right, I like that attitude.

2351
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:32,000
All right, Piper, my new friend from the Multitap Podcast, thanks for being here tonight.

2352
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
Thanks for having me. This was fun. I was looking forward to this.

2353
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:35,000
Did you have fun? Good.

2354
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:36,000
I did.

2355
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:37,000
It was important. Best of luck with your show.

2356
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:38,000
Jamie, stop distracting.

2357
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:40,000
It was one of my mods.

2358
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:41,000
Oh, okay.

2359
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
Best of luck with the show and all that fun stuff.

2360
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
Thank you.

2361
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:48,000
I mean, even if nobody listens, we'll keep doing it because it's super fun.

2362
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,000
That is the important thing. You know what?

2363
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:53,000
And for so long, OLR. Because the first episode had 12 listeners.

2364
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
The second episode had like nine.

2365
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
I feel like the saddest human ever.

2366
03:09:57,000 --> 03:10:00,000
If all the rest of the crew quits, I'll probably just be talking.

2367
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:02,000
Just like, hey, thanks for coming back again.

2368
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:06,000
If you don't love doing it, then stop doing it.

2369
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:08,000
And that's why there's so many people.

2370
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:12,000
Especially when the podcast and all these corporate people were like,

2371
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,000
we gotta do a podcast because that's where the money's at.

2372
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,000
And you heard all these people so didn't want to be there.

2373
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,000
I'm just like, get out of the pool. You're ruining it.

2374
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:21,000
But if you're having fun doing it, then keep creating.

2375
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:25,000
Even if you're in an echo chamber, it can be a lot of fun.

2376
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:29,000
And listeners or not, if anybody ends up listening from this show,

2377
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:32,000
come December, we're doing the Mean Girls jingle jam.

2378
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
It's happening.

2379
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,000
You have my attention.

2380
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:38,000
We have two listeners for December.

2381
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:41,000
There you go. See, you just got more listeners right there.

2382
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:46,000
It is lovely to see you again, Princess Irene. Thank you so much for being here.

2383
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:49,000
Thank you. I was very happy to be here.

2384
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:50,000
Yeah.

2385
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:51,000
It was great.

2386
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:55,000
So we'll come back. Try not to wait two years before coming back, okay?

2387
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:56,000
No promises.

2388
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:00,000
Remind us again how to listen to a multi-tap podcast.

2389
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,000
With your ears, stupid.

2390
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:07,000
So you can go to FFOP.net.

2391
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:08,000
FOP.net.

2392
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,000
Yeah, which is Fistful of Potions.

2393
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:11,000
Or Fistful of Potions.

2394
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
Or FistfulofPotions.com.

2395
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Or I'm surprised with you, Irene, and I can say this because I've known you a very long time.

2396
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:19,000
I'm surprised it's not Fistful of Pooh.

2397
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
I didn't come up with this.

2398
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,000
You know it would be Fistful of Pooh if I made that.

2399
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
Come on now.

2400
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
With a big monkey as the logo.

2401
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:28,000
Exactly.

2402
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:29,000
Pixel Shits.

2403
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
Pixel Shits, the podcast.

2404
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:34,000
That's going to be our offshoot podcast, yeah.

2405
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:38,000
Multitapping to Google has two words. It's like the first thing that shows up.

2406
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:39,000
Oh, wow.

2407
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Sweet. So yes, you can Google it as well and you can find us on Twitter at Multitap Podcast.

2408
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:50,000
And I don't know why we have two website URLs, but who gives a shit?

2409
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:51,000
Just ease of use.

2410
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,000
I guess. Yeah, we're on the Facebooks.

2411
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
Facebooks and Twitters.

2412
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
Do you have an LO yet?

2413
03:11:57,000 --> 03:12:01,000
Everybody forgot about LO. Like LO just came and went, didn't it?

2414
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
LO went goodbye.

2415
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
LOL.

2416
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
Oh, that was dumb.

2417
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
Final thought for our listeners tonight.

2418
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
Poop.

2419
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:15,000
Piper, I didn't ask you properly your final thought. Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

2420
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:18,000
I wish they all could be California girls.

2421
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:23,000
My final thought tonight. As always, I say, support indie podcasting.

2422
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:26,000
And if you didn't like this show, then at least check out another show.

2423
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:28,000
Support the hardworking indie broadcasters out there.

2424
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:37,000
And one thing I've kind of said this week is that if you really want to fight the corruption that you see out there in these big name websites,

2425
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:43,000
and you want to fight that type of corruption you see out there, I think one of the best things you can do is create.

2426
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:47,000
And if you want to go out there and create a podcast, know that we support you 100%.

2427
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:54,000
And support your fellow indie broadcasters. Just make sure you create to support and not create to destroy.

2428
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:58,000
Because if you create to shade other people and stuff, then you know what? Go sit on a tack.

2429
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:02,000
Just don't even bother.

2430
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:03,000
And don't poop on other podcasts.

2431
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:08,000
Exactly. It's not classy. Be a classy broadcaster. Yes, Piper?

2432
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:11,000
I had a thought to tack on to that. I heard, I used to...

2433
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
Damn it, I'm good.

2434
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:19,000
He listened or watched I guess a lot of Kevin Smith and I still do, and he was really inspiring with that.

2435
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:22,000
So that's a good message where he says, I think people would ask him for support.

2436
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:26,000
They'd say, what should I do to make this story or make this movie or would you help it?

2437
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:29,000
And always his advice was just fucking do it, man.

2438
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:30,000
That's right.

2439
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
Just fucking do it.

2440
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:33,000
Just fucking do it, man.

2441
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:40,000
All right. And my proper final thought that I don't give you every week is I might kidnap that box of yummy chocolate.

2442
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:41,000
What is that that you brought?

2443
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:42,000
I brought it to leave here.

2444
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:43,000
Chocolate baton.

2445
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
It was like two dollars at Trader Joe's.

2446
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:48,000
Thank you, Trader Joe's. Thank you, Based Trader Joe's.

2447
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:50,000
No, thank you, me, because I paid my two bucks for it.

2448
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:53,000
That's true. All right. Do you want a dollar or something?

2449
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
No, I brought them for you to have.

2450
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:56,000
Yay, gifts.

2451
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:58,000
We can't keep food at my house because we're moving.

2452
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:01,000
All right. Well, my gift to you is your final thought next. Start, Sakura.

2453
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:06,000
I want to already be moved. I'm tired of the waiting for the date.

2454
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,000
Moving sucks already and you haven't packed a box.

2455
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:23,000
No, we've already started packing, actually. We got rid of a lot of DVDs, including some of our box sets like TNG and Futurama and The Simpsons and my entire run of Stargate SG-1.

2456
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:26,000
But, however, we're now $150 richer because of everything.

2457
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:34,000
And I actually gave the good DVDs to friends first because I'd rather just say, hey, I gave you this. Let me borrow it.

2458
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:35,000
There you go.

2459
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:44,000
Next up is the books, then the vault. Not looking forward to it, but we're going to a better place.

2460
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:45,000
I know. It'll be fun.

2461
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,000
Are you dying?

2462
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:48,000
We're going to a better place.

2463
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:50,000
She's not going to hell like you.

2464
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:53,000
Yes, I'm dying my hair in two weeks.

2465
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:59,000
Actually, I'm going fire red with purple tips.

2466
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:00,000
Nice.

2467
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,000
Because I can do that now where I work.

2468
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:04,000
You're going to look like an anime character when you come back.

2469
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,000
How long did I have fuchsia hair?

2470
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:08,000
I know, I know.

2471
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,000
And Smurf blue that did not look good.

2472
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:13,000
But I found white hairs because I'm old.

2473
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:20,000
And so I said that when I get a lot more of them, I'm actually going to bleach my hair out and dye it blue so I can be a crazy blue-haired old lady.

2474
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:22,000
All right, we'll all be waiting.

2475
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:25,000
All right, last but not least, Loki, your final thought.

2476
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:32,000
I'm watching The Kid this weekend, so hopefully I get some more programming done during his naps.

2477
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:35,000
Just do it. Remember, that was the advice earlier.

2478
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:36,000
Just fucking do it.

2479
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:37,000
Just fucking do it.

2480
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:39,000
All right, have a great week off, everybody.

2481
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
Remember, we're going to be off next week.

2482
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:44,000
And if you guys happen to be in Vegas, come say hi.

2483
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:45,000
I'll be at Fan Fest.

2484
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:49,000
I'll either be on the show floor or I'll be at the bar.

2485
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:50,000
You know what will be sad?

2486
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:51,000
What?

2487
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:52,000
No Tiara.

2488
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:54,000
I know she's not in Vegas now.

2489
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:55,000
Nope.

2490
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
I don't know if I know anybody still in Vegas.

2491
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:58,000
Everybody I knew that was there I think moved.

2492
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:02,000
I have friends now through Tiara, but I won't be there until you can't meet any of those awesome people.

2493
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
Fine, I won't.

2494
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:09,000
So we'll see you guys all again in two weeks with an all new Orange Lounge Radio.

2495
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:10,000
Have a great week, everybody.

2496
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:11,000
We'll see you then.

2497
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:12,000
Good night.

2498
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:15,000
