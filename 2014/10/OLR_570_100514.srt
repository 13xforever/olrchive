These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live here on October the 5th, 2014 with episode number 570 of our show.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts and we've got a really busy show for you guys tonight so let me get right to it and introduce our co-host. Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How are you?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're full.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm very full.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This yummy bread that you brought to the show that tastes like Cinnabon as bread.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But it's better than the Cinnabon bread.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Cinnabon does make a bread, a loaf of bread, and it's not nearly as good as the stuff.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why is it that every, and you know we love to talk food here at OLR so I'm going to start with this. This is tonight's kickoff topic. Why does every airport have a Cinnabon? What is it about planes?

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They want you to be in a food coma for the trip.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Clearly.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm so full of Cinnabon. I can't get out of my seat.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That means that fewer people are going to the bathroom.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hold on, I know Tech Master Loki over there has got to have an answer for this. Hi Tech Master Loki.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's because Cinnabon is awesome and normally it's just in the mall. I mean occasionally you'll find it in a strip mall but it's usually just in like a major shopping mall.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And so it's, and every time I go to an airport it's like, ooh Cinnabon. That's it. It's like, ooh Cinnabon. I got to get a Cinnabon.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I had a friend, this was about a year ago, was like, man I really want Cinnabon but I hate going to malls that go to the airport. It'll be faster.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And she went.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's actually kind of true.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It is true.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well she also lived closer to the airport.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Alright. We do tape live of course every Sunday night, excuse me, at the voice of Geeks Network.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
vaughanetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sunday nights.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And Dark Tetsuya in chat says, wow a whole minute before the food talk. That has to be a record.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hey Dark Tetsuya, shut up.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Look, like I said, it is a busy show tonight.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So we have, you know.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We need energy.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So yeah, we have, we got to get through some of these segments real quick.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Tonight, not only all that news that Jason mentioned in the intro there, but we have another interview this week.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And this is going to be great to talk about this because Dark Sakura, I know you love your pinball.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And so we have an awesome guest this week.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Unfortunately the scheduling didn't work out.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He couldn't be here live, but so we already actually taped this. It's already done.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But I did mention you quite a few times in the interview because of your love of pinball.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And you're okay.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But we have tonight, if you love pinball, stay tuned because we have Farsight Studios.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Bobby King from Farsight Studios is going to be joining us to talk about the pinball arcade.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Which is on like every platform.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Like I could start naming the platforms it's on.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Like oh it's on PS3 and PS4 and Xbox 360 and the Ouya.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And I mean it's on like every modern gaming console.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I actually will ask him about that in the interview a little bit later on in the program.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We'll get into that in about probably about an hour and a half.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We'll actually do that usually where we would have a break between parts A and B of our show.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We will get to that interview and lots of good stuff in that. So stay tuned for that.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Meanwhile we're going to get to our gaming weeks.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But we got to get to some kickoff topics.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I thought it was food.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No we're done with food chat for now.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You wouldn't stop burping so I had to end food chat.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Alright let's get to a couple kickoff topics tonight.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I thought since we do have Bobby coming on the show tonight to talk about the pinball arcade.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And the Kickstarter for the Addams Family table.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That they're trying to make happen.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Which I think they're like super close to their goal.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So maybe our listeners will be enough to push it over.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Wait wait wait. Goal!

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Goal!

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The Addams Family is like one of the few tables I don't see in your house.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes but we have the table that came as a result of Addams Family.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh really?

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Twilight Zone.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh I did not know that was a result of that.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Addams Family was such a runaway success.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They're like here's our list of licenses do whatever you want.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And he's like I'm going to make Twilight Zone.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And I'm going to make it a wide table and we're going to put MagnaRamps in it and all this stuff.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So yeah but Addams Family is one.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I do like Prop Addams Family.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Prop Cycle Addams Family.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh god. I didn't even think to ask about that during the interview.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a real bummer that you couldn't be here to ask about those types of things.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But I did ask about the gold edition Addams Family so we'll talk. We'll get into that later.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's too bad the Twilight Zone table didn't have the Twilight Zone song. The techno song.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes it did.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It did?

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No no it had the golden earring one.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No no see.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Loki is talking about the Twilight Zone that was in DDR.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think the table might have predated or been around the same time.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But they got like an all synth version of golden earrings Twilight Zone.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Twilight Zone is a rad table.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ten minutes long.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How did you get into pinball, Dark Sakura?

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Dan.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well actually I should take a step back.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why is it seen that pinball and video games tend to go hand in hand?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I mean technically they are different.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A pinball is not a video game.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But at the same time it's like okay I don't know many gamers who are like I hate pinball.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I don't know many pinball players who are like I hate video games.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They tend to be pretty closely related.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They're electronic entertainment.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You stand, you press buttons and things happen.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You have scores involved. It's a game.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So they are technically in the same genre.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Right.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Just variants of it.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Right.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Whereas one is kind of like a physics game in a way.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Pinball is kind of a physics game but that's not a bad thing at all.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's what's kind of fun about it.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think pinball went on two divergent paths.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You have, they all started with the same you know the ball goes and hits different things to what we know as pinball and then pachinko.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ooh.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
See I thought you were going to go towards like virtual pinball because a lot of my memories for pinball quite honestly have to do with virtual tables.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean I love the physical, don't get me wrong, I love the physical tables.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You know I remember when the roller rink, oh yeah I went there, would have pinball machines and that was a lot of fun.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hey I was only good at Frogger if I was on roller skates.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But I also remember pinball on the NES but also more importantly like okay those collections they had like I remember there was a collection on the Amiga.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Pinball Dreams I think and they brought it over to like early PCs like in the 90s and those collections were so flipping good.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think those actually exist on like iPhone now today.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I love that stuff.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well I'm counting virtual pinball in the same category as pinball because it's really just a, it's pinball facsimile.

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You know it's pinball simulation.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So just like you know some video games are simulations of other things.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Which is basically what the pinball arcade is.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But they do a great job and I like it because you know pinball tables can be hard to find in this day and age.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And you know unfortunately it is somewhat of a, I don't want to say a dying trend but it's popularity seems to not be where it was.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's just because arcades aren't that popular anymore.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes I think it's tied to that.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Not necessarily amongst the collectors.

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No not amongst the collectors, oh god no never.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The market is actually, the value of tables is really shooting up now.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But like where in town can I play a theater of magic? Not in somebody's house.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
See she was about to say something.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait not in somebody's house.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I could name four people's houses you could go play it at.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But see that's the problem.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's you know if I want to play theater of magic well now I can, I do have a way to do that.

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's like I can do the next best thing like literally.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay maybe it's not the physical table.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We could borrow somebody's again.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We do table swaps all the time.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You know what the problem is? It's because 7-11 doesn't have arcade games anymore.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's the problem.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's because arcades don't have arcade games anymore.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
7-11 was the first place I played Mortal Kombat 2.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You know what they have now? ATM machines. And that's not a fun game.

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's also redundant.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well it says ATM on the machines so you know.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's what the M stands for.

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I understand that.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's like saying pin number.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Department of Redundancy Department. How can I help you?

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Anyhow.

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hello I'd like to have an argument.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's quickly just to you know kind of throw this out there.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Because I'm going to ask this of Bobby later when he comes on.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And Jamie I know this might be, no actually I already know what you're going to answer this with.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But just for those that may not know.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What is your favorite pinball table of all time and why?

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
World Cup Soccer 94.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And why?

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Because it was the table I had at college when I went to the University of South Alabama.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And I was pretty damn good at it. And I have the table practically memorized.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm not as good as I used to be at it.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But it's one of, I'd probably say it's my favorite right now.

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It just has a lot of memories attached to it for me.

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If I was going to name another one I'd probably say Last Action Hero.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because that was the table that Dan and I played a lot when I was working at GNC back in the day.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
They had a Last Action Hero at GNC?

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No. We had to take...

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That would probably get me into a GNC.

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You want to get buffed like Schwarzenegger?

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I had to take the deposit and the deposit was right next to a Godfather's in Natomas.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think it's in Mt. Mike's now or something.

178
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I was going to say is Godfather still around? They all went under around here.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But Dan and I would go and pick up a cheap pizza and play Last Action Hero.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And Snow Brothers. They had Snow Brothers.

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's love. That's love right there. Cheap pizza and Snow Brothers.

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But then they changed out the Last Action Hero and then we started going there.

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because then I got my first full-time job.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Another one I'd actually have to say that I really, really, really like...

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Alright, last one. You can't name them all, Jamie.

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I actually really like Brighter Pin Bot.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's a good table.

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Brighter Pin Bot is a very good one. It's a classic.

189
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Some people will look over it, but it was a very interesting one in the series.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It had a lot of different tricks to it, so it was very cool.

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay, so my favorite table legitimately is, of all time, my favorite table really is The Addams Family.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And that's actually part of the reason I reached out to Farsight and wanted to invite them on the show.

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I personally am just excited of the idea that The Addams Family could get into the series alongside these other tables.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because for me, I think The Addams Family was the best table there ever was.

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But for me, see, I love the movie.

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And I was probably 12 or 13 when that movie came out, and I love the movie.

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And even still to this day, it's such a great movie, right?

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like Raul Julia was great in it.

199
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Angelica Huston is the perfect Morticia.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's just such great. Christina Ricci is Wednesday. Just an amazing film.

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will have to tell you something. Did you know the sound bite from The Addams Family made it into Twilight Zone?

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, I didn't know that.

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Greed.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Really? I never noticed that.

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And they had all those cool little references that actually tied into the movie.

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It didn't feel like it was some weirdly tacked on thing.

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It actually felt like an extension of the movie, but as a pinball table.

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You had the bookcase that was in the movie. You had the thing.

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You had the memushka. It was a big scene in the movie.

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And it's a big type of multi-ball or something in the table.

211
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I just love the way it ties in.

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But my second favorite table of all time would be Pinbot.

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And that might be partially because of the NES version.

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Which, granted, I understand to some people the NES version is super hokey.

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But to me as a kid, I loved it.

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Although I will say, Alan has really brought my love of the Elvira table up.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Actually, there's two Elvira tables.

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
There is.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I like them both.

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There was some of the madness, wasn't it?

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, they're both in the pinball market.

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But the Elvira tables, he has really raised my love of those tables as well.

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I had to double check, but yeah, it was designed by Pat Lawler.

224
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, there you go.

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
For the life of me, I knew it wasn't one of Steve Ritchie's.

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But yeah, it's one of Pat Lawler's ones.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Talk about the two best pinball designers.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Pat Lawler and Steve Ritchie.

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And Steve Ritchie is such a nice guy.

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, you met him at one of those California exchanges.

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I've met him a couple times. I hung out with his wife for like two hours one night.

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So, they're both really cool people.

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Alright, now I'm dying to know this.

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because, Loki, you don't talk a lot about pinball, but I know you've played some machines.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So, what's your favorite?

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
My favorite is Adam Stanley, actually.

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Because I used to play that at Qsar, where I worked and stayed a lot of the time.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So, you know, they had Adam's family there.

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I think they had Twilight Zone also.

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
They also had my second favorite game, which was Attack from Mars, I think.

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Attack from Mars is a good one.

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That was great.

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There's the classic and then there's the hologram.

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The hologram.

245
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The hologram was Revenge from Mars.

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Revenge from Mars. I'm sorry. Revenge from Mars.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So, that one was pretty cool.

249
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then, before that, I didn't really play a whole ton of pinball.

250
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So, I'd have to say, what was it? The default shareware table that was in Epic Pinball.

251
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, the Rockstar or something? Is that the one?

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No, no, it wasn't Rockstar. It was like a cyborg thing.

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Like some cyborg chick. I don't remember.

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, god. Epic Pinball was so good. Oh, my gosh.

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Did you guys ever play any, though, of the weird specialty tables?

256
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Like, there was the, what was the giant one?

257
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The Titan pinball?

258
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Not, like, physical? No.

259
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I remember, like, Rollerball on the NES. There was three screens.

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Have you ever been to the pinball museum in Las Vegas?

261
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No, but I'm going to Las Vegas.

262
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There's a pinball museum in Las Vegas?

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think that they moved it from the location I saw it at, but they have a pinball circus there.

264
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, there's a pinball museum now in Alameda.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I need to go.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But, like, you remember Hyperball?

267
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Or, uh, what was the one that I really liked?

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Black Hole.

269
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Where the ball goes and then you're playing it upside down.

270
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh, yeah, I played that at California Street. Good times.

271
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It was like Theater of Magic. That was pretty cool.

272
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Theater of Magic is a great one.

273
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It was very solid.

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The Genie. The one with the spinning lamp.

275
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What the hell is that one, Jamie?

276
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's like Aladdin's Tales from the Lamp.

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh, my god.

278
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It wasn't like an Arabian Nights.

279
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, my god. I can't remember the name of that table.

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I think it was Arabian Nights.

281
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, I think it was Arabian Nights.

282
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Or Black Rose.

283
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The one where you shoot a cannon.

284
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay, so quickly before we get to our gaming week,

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I want to kind of talk about this up front

286
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
because I know this is on a lot of your minds out there

287
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and that is the release of

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Smash Bros. on the 3DS.

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Got it.

290
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Smash Bros. for 3DS. Have you had a chance to play it yet, though?

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No, because I was sick yesterday

292
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and it was also Yom Kippur.

293
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Which I hope my fellow Jews out there had a good fast.

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Um, but I've actually been doing a lot of catch up today.

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And, Loki, you still don't even own a 3DS, right?

296
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't really have an opinion on this.

297
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Dan's been playing the crap out of it.

298
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, I know some of you guys,

299
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and I've played a little bit of it, too,

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
so I'm curious of your thoughts on the new Smash Bros.

301
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
in our chat room over at live.volgnetwork.com.

302
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And I've played a little bit of it

303
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and I'm always impressed at how much they cram

304
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
into a Smash Bros. game.

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Because you know it's not just, like,

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
clusterfuck rumble, free-for-all mode.

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
They also have, like, solo mode

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and hit the punching bag as far as you can.

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And bombs, and get the trophies.

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And adventure mode's really cool.

311
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Like, I'm always impressed at, like,

312
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
how many freaking modes they cram into the game.

313
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Like, it's so much.

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Is the adventure- do they have, like,

315
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
the adventure mode in this one? Is that, like-

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's not like it is, like, in the Wii one.

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
See, the Wii one is really awesome.

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I do like what they did here, though.

319
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They basically- you have a maze that you go through

320
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and you get five minutes or something in the maze

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and you try to collect as many items as you can

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and the items will increase your attack,

323
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
your roll, your jump, you know, all these various things.

324
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And the more you get of all that,

325
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
then you, at the end of the five minutes,

326
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
you do an epic battle with all the players

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
that were in the maze.

328
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So it's actually- it's a cool little minigame,

329
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
you know, for the 3DS. Keep in mind.

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And here's the one drawback to Smash on the 3DS,

331
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
is that- and I'm gonna get shit for this comment

332
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
from my Nintendo-loving friends,

333
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
but I'm sorry, guys.

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is opinion. Take it or leave it.

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you wanna, you know, throw in your two cents,

336
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
you can in our chat room.

337
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Or our email bag, participate at orangeontrated.com,

338
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
but here it is.

339
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The 3DS is just the wrong system for this game.

340
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And I kinda said this,

341
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you know, when I played the demo,

342
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I thought I was worried a little bit that this might be the case.

343
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I know Bobby Blackwolf on his show,

344
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
he talked about, you know,

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
his issues with it, especially

346
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
being on an older 3DS,

347
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
but like-

348
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I can't stand the circle pad, for one,

349
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
as a controller. Like, um,

350
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I love to use NES, and I

351
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
find that, like, I do the wrong

352
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
PK thing, because, like,

353
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
my up flick should've been a right-

354
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you know, like, I flicked the thing the wrong way,

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and it goes weird. And like, jumping

356
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
feels so weird

357
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
in this to me, and I- again, I think it's that stinking

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
circle pad. And I don't like that you can't

359
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
flip that and the D-pad, because the

360
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
D-pad is meant for taunts. Um,

361
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
so, I don't know. Um,

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
so that part of it is, uh,

363
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
uh, a little bit

364
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
annoying. But, for me,

365
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
here's the thing. This acts

366
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
as a great teaser, and a great

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
build-up for the Wii U version,

368
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
which will be the, like,

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
piece de resistance, for- for,

370
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
you know, for me. Like, that's- that's the one

371
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I really wanna get. I understand

372
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
why Nintendo kinda had to do the

373
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
3DS version, because, you know,

374
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
with the Wii U not being in as many homes

375
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
as- as maybe they'd want,

376
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
they can probably sell a lot more by

377
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
putting it on the 3DS. And there's gonna be people-

378
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
a lot of people that end up buying it on both.

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Um, but,

380
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
you know, I- I- again, there's a lot of

381
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
good in this game as well. Like, the character

382
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
customization is fun. And I-

383
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I actually liked designing the Miis an awful

384
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
lot, and I liked being able to make your own character and all this

385
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
stuff. Again, it's just, like, playing

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
all this makes me really excited to play it

387
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
on the system I think it was really

388
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
meant for, which is the Wii U.

389
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's my opinion. Take it or leave it.

390
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Uh, let's see, uh,

391
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

392
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Uh, Codeman

393
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
says, I'm waiting for Wii U, I don't own a

394
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
3DS. Uh, Codeman

395
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
says, are Ness and Lucas back

396
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
in the game? Um, Ness only,

397
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Lucas was cut out, and I was really

398
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
surprised they didn't do a palette swap

399
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
for Lucas on Ness, which,

400
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I understand they had their differences in the last game,

401
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
but they could've done a little bit of

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
fan service having Lucas as a palette swap, but

403
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
yeah, only Ness is in it. Um,

404
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Kaijuto in chat

405
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
suggests, if you have a problem with the circle pad

406
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
jump, use wire X.

407
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's true, I could do that, it's still,

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't know why, it just doesn't feel

409
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
right to me, because again, I

410
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
think, because of the way the circle pad is

411
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
designed, sometimes I end up jumping when I don't mean to jump.

412
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Like, I don't know. It's just

413
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
bleh. Uh,

414
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
S2100Matt says, apparently some people

415
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
broke their circle pads. Yeah, I saw some of that from

416
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Japan. Uh, S2100Matt

417
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
says, Smash Run has some cool fan

418
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
service moments when fighting old school

419
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and lesser known enemies. Yeah, man, the

420
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
trophies. There's some really

421
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
excellent trophies that really

422
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
dig deep into the Nintendo

423
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
universe, and for that matter,

424
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
uh, the Mega Man universe,

425
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
the Pac-Man universe, you know, and

426
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
all that with all the people that are

427
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
assisting, you know, cause Sega's involved, Capcom's

428
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
involved, Namco's involved, it's pretty impressive.

429
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Um, I wanna say this as well,

430
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
speaking of the other companies involved,

431
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I gotta say, one of the most

432
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
impressive things for me, like being able to play

433
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
it in the game that makes me so happy and so

434
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
frustrated at the same time,

435
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
playing Mega Man on

436
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that Dr. Wily stage. Like,

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
oh my god, it's so good,

438
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
like, like, but it makes

439
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
me so upset that they are

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
not doing another Mega Man game. Like,

441
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
they could just make a Mega Man game

442
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
like that, and I would be so happy,

443
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
but I just feel like it's never gonna

444
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
happen, and it makes me so sad.

445
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Have you played your Mii yet? I have

446
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
played as the Mii. My Mii's a little sword fighter.

447
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Dan, I think, went with the default

448
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
set for his. Uh-huh. I'm planning on doing

449
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
like a Sheik style, so.

450
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Uh, Kossan in

451
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
chat says, stands outside of NOA headquarters

452
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
with a sign that says, no Ice Climbers and

453
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
no Lucas equals no sale.

454
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Well, here's the thing. Um, Ice Climbers,

455
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and we talked about this on a previous week's

456
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
show, Ice Climbers apparently were

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
cut from the 3DS version because

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
it's a hardware issue, a hardware limitation,

459
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
or a hardware limitation, excuse me. If all

460
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
four people in the match were playing Ice

461
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Climbers, the system couldn't handle it.

462
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Maybe the new 3DS can handle it,

463
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
but the old 3DS's can't. And

464
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think we're seeing some things where the

465
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
3DS version of the game

466
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
changed a few things. In fact,

467
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
there were some stories that came out this week

468
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
about, like, what's going on with some

469
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
of the hardware limitations. Did you know

470
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
the 3DS is the reason that

471
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Sheik and Zelda were split into

472
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
separate characters? Uh, yeah,

473
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
that is in a translation from

474
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Sakurai's Famitsu column.

475
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Of course, Masahiro Sakurai, who's behind

476
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Super Smash Brothers, said, quote,

477
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's basically due to the 3DS limitations.

478
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It was impossible to have both characters

479
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
exist together as one on 3DS.

480
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
However, reaching that limit can

481
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
sometimes lead in good directions. Transforming

482
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
characters had the drawback of ambiguous

483
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
tactics and such, and I believe they've

484
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
become more fresh now.

485
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So, 3DS, the reason

486
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
why Sheik and Zelda were

487
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
split into separate characters.

488
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Kind of interesting.

489
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Not available on the

490
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
3DS, by the way, the Circle Pad

491
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Pro. Again,

492
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Masahiro Sakurai explained,

493
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Supporting the Circle Pad Pro requires

494
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
the use of some of the CPU's processing

495
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
load. From the information received

496
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
during the development of Kid Icarus Uprising, this

497
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
is quite a large load at around 5%.

498
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Kid Icarus Uprising and Smash

499
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
both use the maximum capability of the

500
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
device, so we had to abandon

501
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
the idea of the Circle Pad

502
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
support. I don't understand why that would

503
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
be. I mean,

504
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
aside from just, you know, the infrared

505
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
communication with it or something, but...

506
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Is it battery drain, maybe?

507
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's not battery drain, because it's got an

508
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
external battery, but it's

509
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
just... I think

510
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
it's because they're using infrared to

511
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
send signals back and forth with it.

512
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Instead of having to actually plug into

513
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
a port or something.

514
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Which is dumb. It's really

515
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
stupid, because it should be absolutely

516
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
no extra load since

517
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
it's just buttons. It's not doing any

518
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
sort of processing other than

519
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
reading the inputs coming from those buttons.

520
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But the fact that it has to

521
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
translate that data into something it can send over

522
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
IR and then re-translate that

523
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
back into something that the machine can understand is

524
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that's where your overhead comes through. And why

525
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
is it 5%? That's retarded. That

526
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
should be 5% for something so

527
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
stupid and simple.

528
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I honestly

529
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
think it's a power. It comes down to the power

530
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
source and the fact that the new one, since

531
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
it's built in, it's not going to drain from the same

532
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
power source. I really think that's what it comes down to.

533
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Alright, one other thing I want to say

534
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
on Smash for the 3DS.

535
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If for whatever reason you haven't bought it yet,

536
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I know some of you are holding off for Pay Day

537
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
or whatever the case may be,

538
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
keep in mind you will have to grab an

539
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
update before you can actually play the game.

540
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
There is a patch out there.

541
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You have to patch to 1.0.2.

542
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That will allow you to play online,

543
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I should say, because technically if your 3DS

544
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
never goes online, the game will never know it needs a patch.

545
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But you will have to get this patch to play

546
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
online. So you can do

547
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
that by, you can actually go into the

548
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
eShop on the 3DS and grab

549
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
the patch now. You don't need the game

550
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
to get the patch and

551
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
that will get some of you guys ahead of the game.

552
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So check that out if you think

553
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
you will be picking up Smash Bros. in the coming

554
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
days. So, there

555
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
you go. I hope you guys

556
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
are having fun with Smash Bros., those of you that do have

557
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
the game. So even though I said I'm not

558
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
so sure about the system and so forth, I still

559
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
think it's, I mean, you can't

560
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
say you don't get your money's worth out of this game.

561
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That's for sure. So there's a

562
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
lot there.

563
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Alright, let's move on to our

564
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
gaming weeks and what type of video games

565
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
we've been playing this week, I suppose besides

566
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Smash Bros., to sort of

567
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
establish our frame of reference on

568
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
what we're up to in the gaming world.

569
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
DarkSakura, how about you?

570
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Well, I did get Smash Bros.

571
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I haven't played it yet.

572
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I played Final Fantasy 14.

573
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I played some Mass Effect.

574
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I tried playing this

575
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
puzzle game on Steam. I forgot what it was called

576
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
but it sucked, so I stopped playing it.

577
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And I played some Fractal because

578
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I miss playing Fractal, make Blooms

579
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
not war. Fractal's really good.

580
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And then I've also been playing a lot

581
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
of Moonlight Mahjong at work

582
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
during lunch.

583
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It's actually ridiculously

584
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
fun because it makes my

585
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
brain do things. Is it actual Mahjong or is it

586
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
like that old, like the Solitaire Mahjong,

587
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
like that game Shanghai? Remember like

588
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in the early, late 90's

589
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
like every computer had Shanghai.

590
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's single player

591
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Mahjong puzzles.

592
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's the whole like moving the tiles? Okay, yeah.

593
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, you don't move them around, you just pick the matches.

594
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah, but it has to be like certain rules, right?

595
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Like you can only move the tiles left or

596
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
right to get them off the board. You can't move them up and down.

597
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Something like that. You just click on them.

598
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I know, but you can't click on any tile.

599
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
No, some of them you can only

600
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
move the ones off the sides or at the top.

601
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You can only click tiles that are fully

602
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
exposed, I believe. That's it, something like that.

603
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Like one or two times playing Mahjong.

604
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, I mean, it's got the rules in it

605
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
but you just click them and they go.

606
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And it makes my brain

607
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
not hurt anymore.

608
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And things.

609
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Alright. Loki, how was your

610
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
gaming week? I only really played a little

611
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
bit of Call of Duty multiplayer 2

612
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
because we finally did our game night again.

613
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And then

614
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
just worked on my game.

615
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That was pretty much it.

616
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm probably going to play some more stuff.

617
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I want to get a next gen system.

618
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's just

619
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
you know, having enough

620
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
extra money and having a job

621
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
to do that. Well, by the way,

622
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
thank you for bringing that up

623
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
because I wanted to at some point in the show congratulate

624
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
you. You got a job.

625
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah. Already. So, I mean, that's

626
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
amazing. Congratulations. I just don't start

627
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
yet. So, you know. You have a little

628
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
gap before you start. You have a little gap.

629
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Hey, you know what?

630
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Like a month gap, not nearly as bad.

631
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Dude, Alan was out of work for like a year

632
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and a half before he found something. And a lot of people

633
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
faced hard times like that. So, you know what?

634
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Enjoy the time off to work

635
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
on your game. Yeah.

636
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Hopefully. I'm still going to be applying for stuff.

637
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I still have interviews and stuff.

638
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
In fact, I'm doing a couple phone interviews

639
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
tomorrow. Make them fight over you.

640
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah. Whoever's going to

641
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
offer me the most money. So, that's really

642
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
what it comes down to. There you go.

643
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's almost something I want to do.

644
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So, I'm going to be doing that. But, yeah.

645
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I worked on my game a little bit more. Still working

646
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
on the editor.

647
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm almost done with it

648
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
because I was just trying to get a few tools

649
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
too. Because the editor's done as far

650
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
as what I needed for building

651
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
like ships and

652
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
the smaller things. But,

653
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
if I were to use that same editor

654
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
for building like a whole

655
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
level, it would take forever.

656
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So, I needed to build like

657
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
basically

658
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
tools that we would see since it's

659
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
voxel based.

660
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Similar tools you would see like in

661
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
World Build or something like that in Minecraft.

662
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Where it's really fast.

663
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Where you can just

664
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
design stuff

665
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
really fast with brushes and all

666
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
sorts of things. So, that's what I was coming

667
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
up with for my game right

668
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
now. So, I'm working on that so I can finish

669
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
actually start building some of the

670
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
assets for the game.

671
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And that's pretty much it. I'm almost done

672
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
with that one. I finally

673
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
start working on it some more. Hopefully

674
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
get something that I can actually show. Once

675
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
the editor's done. Alright. Can't wait to see it.

676
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Let's see. My

677
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
gaming week. I

678
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
played a lot of the same stuff

679
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
that you've heard me talk about before. Theatrythm.

680
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Because Smash didn't come out until Friday. So, early

681
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
in the week I was like, must play more Theatrythm.

682
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And I played a whole lot more.

683
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I even did some DLC.

684
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
They released the Mooglemog song

685
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
from Final Fantasy XIV in Theatrythm. And I love

686
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
that song. And then I had to get Crazy

687
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Chocobo. And I dedicate that to you

688
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Acteft.

689
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Crazy Chocobo from Final Fantasy

690
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
XIII-2 which is the heavy metal version

691
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
of the Chocobo theme that is

692
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
very divisive in people's opinions.

693
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And let's see.

694
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
What else did I play this week?

695
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I played more Diablo 3. I'm working on a hardcore

696
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
seasonal character. And I beat

697
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
story mode. And I'm all the way to level

698
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
52. And last night I

699
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
got very daring. Because it's a hardcore

700
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
character, right? So, I play it very conservative.

701
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Because in hardcore, once you die,

702
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
you die. Like it's done.

703
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Your character is done. You have to start over from the very beginning.

704
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So, I've been playing on

705
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
normal. Like easy, normal, not

706
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
amping it up difficulty. But last night I said

707
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
you know what? I'm feeling

708
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
a little risky. Now that I've beaten the story mode

709
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
at least once, I'm gonna play a little risky.

710
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So I amped up the difficulty one

711
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
notch to hard. And

712
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
it was definitely harder and kept me on my toes.

713
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I had an oh shit moment.

714
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But luckily my character is still alive.

715
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Junior Mintz, my hunter.

716
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Demon Hunter is still alive.

717
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I named him after a box of candy that was sitting on my desk

718
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
when I made him. So there you go.

719
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Junior Mintz is now level 52.

720
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And let's see.

721
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Other games I played this week.

722
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I played

723
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Final Fantasy 14

724
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
of course. Because I play a lot of that.

725
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And

726
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Destiny. That's the other one.

727
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I played more Destiny. I hit

728
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
level 20 in Destiny.

729
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And that ridiculous where you

730
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
have to get gear that has light on it

731
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
to level up. I really think that's the most

732
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
redonkulous thing I've heard.

733
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Level up a character past level cap.

734
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But whatever. I'm up to level 21

735
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
now. I'm like three quarters of the way through level

736
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
21 just praying I can get

737
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
a good loot drop to level up my stupid

738
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
character. I don't understand why it's called

739
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
a level cap if you can level up past

740
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
it. Because without the gear

741
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
you'll never level past it. It's all gear

742
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
based. Yeah I know. I can't stand it. I think

743
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
it's ridiculous design flaw.

744
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But that's my opinion. Not everybody

745
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
is going to agree with me. Hey Rob.

746
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I finally got around to naming my chocobo. Did you?

747
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Hot Wings. Hot Wings

748
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
is the name in Final Fantasy 14 right?

749
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
My chocobo's name is Hot Wings. Good times.

750
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Good times.

751
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So yeah. Then I was playing Destiny. And I've done like

752
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
some random online stuff with that.

753
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Including like doing some

754
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
strikes with like Shane and Extifer.

755
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Or my friend Ian from Koopa Club.

756
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You know. Whoever is on

757
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and can do stuff. We will do that.

758
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Dungeon Buster in chat

759
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
says 20 is the soft cap

760
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and the hard cap is 30.

761
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And then Alan letting everybody

762
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
know about this. That I did a live stream

763
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
of Final Fantasy 14 this week and I got

764
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
him to agree to do hunts. And he got

765
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
so mad he was real real mad.

766
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That is accurate. Alan was like let's do

767
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
a hunt. And I hate

768
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
hunts in Final Fantasy 14. I think they're ridiculous.

769
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I think they're way

770
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
too much of a necessity

771
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
for people to do to hit the cap if that's

772
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
what they want. And I think they made

773
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
they made them way too powerful.

774
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And they're just a joke. Because everybody

775
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
just cluster fucks the mob and the

776
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
thing is dead in like 5 seconds.

777
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You got like 60 people attacking this one thing.

778
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And yeah. So they called

779
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
it out like oh here's where the mob is.

780
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I ran to the wrong coordinates.

781
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
On accident. And so I was like 10

782
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
10 squares away on the

783
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
map or whatever. So as I'm running

784
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
to the right location the mob's already

785
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
dead. Like literally I walk

786
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
into the screen to see that the mob

787
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
just died. And I'm just like you know what? Fuck

788
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
hunts. And I logged out. And that was the end of my

789
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
livestream.

790
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But I don't have anger issues

791
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
or anything. I actually get to

792
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
make a hunt tomorrow.

793
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
For what? For treasure hunting.

794
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Sorry. Oh. Oh that. Oh that's

795
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
different. Yeah. Treasure hunts are different.

796
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm okay with the treasure hunts.

797
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Alright. Let us take care of

798
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
a few housekeeping things. I have a couple things to

799
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
mention. We will not

800
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
be here live on October

801
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
19th. That's two weeks from tonight.

802
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The reason why I will be at

803
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
speaking of all this Final Fantasy talk. I will be at

804
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Final Fantasy Fan Fest. And if I get to talk to

805
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Yoshida-san I'm gonna say hunts

806
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
suck. So. But I love your game.

807
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I love your game so much. That one part. Since I'm

808
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
not playing Final Fantasy 14 do they do any

809
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
of like the cool like holiday stuff that they

810
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
did in 11? I got a

811
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
bikini. Yeah they do. Cause my favorite was

812
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
that tree. The very first one that they did

813
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
with the tree that you couldn't kill because

814
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
there was a bug in it. And so

815
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
you just keep wailing on it and it's like

816
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
it just wouldn't die. They don't have like a

817
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
killer tree but they'll do like quests

818
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and you get rewards

819
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
like usually their costumes. Some of the

820
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
end game. I've noticed that some of the end game holidays

821
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
tend to be referencing

822
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
back to some Japanese holidays as well

823
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
as Western holidays. Yeah.

824
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So we're getting sort of the best of both.

825
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Like didn't they do something for Golden Week?

826
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Or they did the Midsummer

827
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
thing didn't they? They did the Midsummer thing for sure.

828
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah. So. Yeah.

829
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Um. But uh.

830
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You should

831
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
you should come play with us.

832
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
One of us. Alright.

833
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Do the thing. So we

834
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
will not be here in two weeks live

835
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
although we're hoping to have something on the feet.

836
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yes. Bodies. That might be a busy week

837
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
for a lot of us. So we will not be here October

838
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
19th. Um.

839
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000

Orange Lounge Radio. Before I get into

846
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
news. Before I get to our interview with Farsight

847
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Studio. I also want to talk about

848
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
some stuff that our pal Bobby Blackwolf

849
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
is up to. Speaking of interviews. It's

850
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
raining interviews here at VOG and we

851
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
love it. And Bobby has some of

852
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
his own going on. In fact

853
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
next week on his show. That's October 12th.

854
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
He's going to have Kyle Pittman

855
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
who's the creator of the recently

856
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
released Super Win the Game.

857
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Kyle used to be with Gearbox

858
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Software. He worked on Borderlands 2

859
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and now he's Indie. Also

860
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
this is interesting because Bobby has some ties

861
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
in with Kyle Pittman.

862
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
He's never actually spoken

863
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
to him. However

864
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
he's one half of the brothers that

865
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
made the game that Bobby did a

866
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
soundtrack for in 99.

867
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So this is an interesting reunion

868
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
of sorts. Even though they've never actually met.

869
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So that will be a fun interview. So check that out

870
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
next week on Bobby's show. He is of course

871
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
live before us

872
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
here at the Voice of the Geese Network. VOGnetwork.com

873
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Now tonight he wasn't live. He had

874
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
an interview from Siege with

875
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Snarfquest Tales

876
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and this is based on the comic

877
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
series by Larry

878
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Elmore who I know Dar Sockra is a big fan

879
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
of. Oh hell yeah. Dragon

880
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Lance. I thought for a second

881
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
there that it might have something to do with

882
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
the character from

883
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Thundercats. Wasn't it?

884
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
No not in this case. Not in this case.

885
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But yeah you can check out the

886
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
interview on Bobby's show. You can also check out the game

887
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
itself if you want. Snarfquesttales.com

888
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So check that

889
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
out. And oh my gosh

890
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
the interviews don't stop and we are

891
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
so excited because here at

892
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Orange Lounge Radio we actually

893
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
have another interview planned for next

894
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
week and this is pretty cool because this is some

895
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Indie stuff going on. But

896
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
we will have Bodhi from

897
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Lunar Ray Games on

898
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
the show next week live.

899
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
They're making a game called Time

900
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Spinner and it's a Metroidvania

901
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
type of game with some really cool like retro

902
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
looks to it. This game was on Kickstarter

903
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and did very well on Kickstarter.

904
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So we're going to check in and see how the game's coming

905
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
along and see what folks can

906
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
look forward to with that. And we will have

907
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
him on live next week.

908
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So the 12th is going to be a very

909
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
busy night Sunday nights here at VOG.

910
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Alright let's get into tonight

911
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
however with some gaming news.

912
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Loke you want to start us off with some news.

913
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yes. When I'm not eating

914
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
waffle fries I read the news.

915
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Waffle fries are pretty damn good. They're pretty good.

916
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So thanks

917
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
to I guess a lot of pressure from

918
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
consumers

919
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
gamers everywhere. There's

920
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
been some policy changes now

921
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
with Twitch including

922
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that they now want

923
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
broadcasters that are

924
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
broadcasting stuff with you know

925
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
sponsorship from

926
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
you know a company

927
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
basically to be transparent

928
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
about that. So if you're getting paid to

929
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
play something on

930
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Twitch by

931
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that publisher

932
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
that you say hey this is going to be

933
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
this is a sponsored

934
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
broadcast so that

935
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
people know that it's not just like

936
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
you know

937
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
it may

938
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
not be entirely unbiased I guess

939
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
if you will. You know they do

940
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
that like sponsored content I see that sometimes

941
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
on well you see that on Twitter

942
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
actually quite a bit. It's sort of like similar

943
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
like here at VOG when we and we

944
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
don't get to do a lot of reviews

945
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
because you know we don't most of our

946
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
staff makes podcasts so

947
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
we don't have a whole lot of dedicated writers

948
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
but like when we do

949
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
have the chance to review things we always

950
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
kind of put at the end of it like

951
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
you know either this was something we bought

952
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
this was something that was you know

953
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
we were given a key to you know it's like

954
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
the acquisition method just to

955
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
just to make sure everybody

956
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
understands you know throwing

957
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
it out there because honestly

958
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I think for a lot of people

959
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
like if it's free

960
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
versus if it's $60 could

961
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
sway your opinion one way or the other. Now when you

962
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
review a game and it was giving you free

963
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
you're really supposed to ask yourself

964
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
you know treat it like you paid the $60

965
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
for it and is it that value but

966
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
we still put that out there just to make sure everything

967
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
you know full disclosure. Well this I think is

968
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
a little bit more like you know say

969
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
you follow someone and even I think they

970
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
were talking about something and this may

971
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
have even come from YouTube where there's a lot of

972
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
content streamers out there that oh yeah we have

973
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
deals with some of these guys where you know

974
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
we will

975
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
be in like some sort of you know

976
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
partnership with this company

977
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
to do you know they're

978
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
going to pay us to do let's plays for this

979
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
game or something and a lot

980
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
of times they don't disclose that.

981
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So this you know is

982
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
kind of along the lines where you

983
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
know they want to make sure that it's

984
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
completely clear that you know

985
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
you're getting paid to do that. Same

986
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
goes with Steam. Steam now also

987
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
thanks to their new curator

988
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
you know feature

989
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
on there. Now they also

990
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
are requiring you to disclose

991
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
if you're a sponsored

992
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
curator so like you know if it's

993
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
a company that's you know

994
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
putting out a certain game

995
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and they have a Steam curation thing

996
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
that you know hey

997
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
let you guys know

998
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
that if you're paying somebody

999
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that feature that on their

1000
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
curator I guess

1001
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
curator page so if you

1002
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
basically you know it boils down to if

1003
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
you've accepted money or other

1004
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
compensation for making a product review

1005
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
or posting a recommendation

1006
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
you must disclose this fact for

1007
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in your recommendation.

1008
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And also

1009
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
this should not link or link to

1010
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
or promote any stores other than

1011
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Steam of course you know because

1012
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
they want the sales from their

1013
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
websites list yeah of course

1014
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
so I haven't explored

1015
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
setting that all up like is that something

1016
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I thought if I set up a curator

1017
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
page would people care? Like I kind of

1018
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I kind of think you all know my opinions on a lot of

1019
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
games anyway you know. And then honestly

1020
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I think a lot of well I thought the page was

1021
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
for groups only so like you had

1022
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
to I don't know if like if I could make my own

1023
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
curator page oh it would have to be like a vog

1024
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
yeah I think it has to be a group

1025
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I thought I don't know I haven't really

1026
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
looked too much into it but

1027
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I don't know

1028
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I mean it's good I guess that there's this transparency

1029
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
because that's what a lot of people have been complaining about

1030
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
so you know

1031
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
more power to them I guess.

1032
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Now before we move on

1033
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
since you brought up YouTube and that too

1034
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
you know one of the stories that

1035
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I don't think is on our show or otherwise tonight

1036
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
but there was these

1037
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
stories going around a lot of the gaming blogs about

1038
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
how there's people out there that are

1039
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
impersonating

1040
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
celebrity or

1041
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
professional YouTubers for lack of a better term

1042
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
to get free keys for games

1043
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
that they then flip and sell on

1044
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
eBay. Did you read about this?

1045
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Well they're not even selling them yeah not even just on eBay

1046
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
but like on like other

1047
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
key reseller sites you know

1048
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
some of which have

1049
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
in the past bought the cheap

1050
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
bundle stuff and flip it for

1051
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
you know more money. Yeah

1052
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I mean it's just unfortunately

1053
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
something you're going to run into I think even

1054
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
not even necessarily

1055
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
just

1056
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
you know just

1057
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
this type of thing but in people

1058
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
impersonating other people but even just like

1059
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
no name people just kind of asking

1060
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
hey can I have a key you know that type of thing

1061
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and they've kind of

1062
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
in the different stories I read that their advice

1063
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
was you know either A

1064
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
handle it through like a

1065
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
PR firm or something like that

1066
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
B you know handle it through

1067
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
like if it's you're getting

1068
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
requests from different YouTube

1069
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
guys that you

1070
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
follow up or have them make that

1071
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
request via like a

1072
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
message through YouTube

1073
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
you know send them like a

1074
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
you know a private message or whatever through YouTube

1075
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that way you can you know

1076
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
say OK this is actually from this person not

1077
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
just someone impersonating

1078
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
them. So

1079
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I mean that makes sense.

1080
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Unfortunately you know

1081
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
when you're you know sending out

1082
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
emails or letting people know

1083
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
PR and stuff that hey

1084
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
you know if you want to review this game I can get

1085
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
you a key for it and stuff and unfortunately

1086
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
people want handouts you know

1087
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
they want free stuff so they're going to do

1088
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
whatever they can to manipulate

1089
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
the system. Well it's not even the it's not even the free

1090
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
stuff it's the people that turn them around and

1091
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
resell them on these on these code sites and so forth

1092
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
like it's more than that it's stolen

1093
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
goods basically. Yeah crazy.

1094
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah because I read it was I forget what game it was

1095
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
but it was he'd actually

1096
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
saw it was available on this one site

1097
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
he's like well that's weird because I haven't even

1098
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
released it you know other than

1099
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
you know these reviewers

1100
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
so houses on it. Yeah

1101
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
the code. Yeah. Yeah. So

1102
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
wow. Yeah.

1103
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That's that's pretty pretty bad

1104
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
that people are you know singing

1105
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
that low to do that. But you know it's

1106
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm not completely surprised

1107
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
by it. And now

1108
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
just quickly to answer the curator question

1109
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
in our chatroom. Actf says a friend of mine

1110
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
set up his own curator page

1111
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
so yeah you can make your own. Groups

1112
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
have curator pages made by default

1113
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
so that might be. So VOG

1114
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
has its own curator page now but

1115
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
nobody has done recommendations since

1116
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
it's only for group admins. Oh I didn't

1117
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
know that that was a thing. But again

1118
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
like I don't know like

1119
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
what we would do because we're

1120
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
really about like a variety of games

1121
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
like should we do a list of these are games

1122
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that got a B or better review

1123
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
on VOG or yeah I don't know I don't know what we do

1124
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
so I think for now it'll stay

1125
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
blank. I don't know. I kind of

1126
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
feel like if you want to know our thoughts on games

1127
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
check out the podcast. But

1128
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
maybe we can think of a use for it.

1129
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Well hey hey I know we can do

1130
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
we can just wait for you know Aaron

1131
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
to port over

1132
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
you know bungee ferret tossing. There you go.

1133
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So once bungee ferret tossing makes us

1134
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
esteem it'll just be our list of one game

1135
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
you need to check out. Oh there you go. Absolutely I'm all for that.

1136
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Alright well here's a game

1137
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
a lot of people want to check out but some people

1138
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
are very frustrated by

1139
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the number of systems that

1140
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
it's on. Jamie you want to jump in here?

1141
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I just remember the other game I played.

1142
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Oh my gosh why? Hot to Full Boyfriend

1143
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
which I would totally give recommendations

1144
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
for since it's on Steam. Speaking of streaming

1145
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
and all that right? Yeah.

1146
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Alright. I don't know why I didn't think about it.

1147
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Well I have a feeling you're going to dig this game

1148
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
to Dark Sakura if you ever get a chance to play it.

1149
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You might have to come over here. Does it include dating pigeons?

1150
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Actually it might.

1151
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And it would be here at

1152
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
my house for sure

1153
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
because I actually have the Wii U

1154
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
so you could play Bayonetta 2

1155
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
which yeah see

1156
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
a lot of folks looking forward to that and I know I'm looking

1157
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
forward to this too.

1158
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Hideki Kamiya who's

1159
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
with Platinum Games one of the producers there

1160
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
has reiterated to fans

1161
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
this week that you know other publishers

1162
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
turned down Bayonetta 2

1163
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
only Nintendo stepped in to help.

1164
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's bullshit. I'm sorry.

1165
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I haven't even read the damn quote yet. I'm sorry.

1166
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Sit down.

1167
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I think I've discussed this many times before

1168
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
but here goes. First of all, we, Platinum

1169
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Games are developers and receive

1170
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
support from publishers by making games that they

1171
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
request or suggest. As for Bayonetta

1172
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
we developed the game after signing a deal with

1173
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Sega. Later it was decided to also

1174
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
develop the sequel so we started working on Bayonetta 2.

1175
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
When development had progressed

1176
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
to a certain degree and Sega's situation

1177
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
had turned into this isn't a good plan

1178
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
so development halted temporarily.

1179
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Without funding we didn't have the possibility

1180
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
to continue development but we wanted to get this

1181
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
partially developed Bayonetta 2 available to

1182
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
public one way or another so we offered it to various

1183
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
publishers but as it is a big title

1184
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
we couldn't find a partner company. Finally

1185
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Bayonetta 2 is about to get terminated completely

1186
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
when Nintendo came in and lent

1187
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
a hand we were able to restart the development

1188
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
we so desired. Finally the game was released

1189
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
last week in Japan so five years

1190
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
we were able to make Bayonetta 2 available

1191
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
to the public. Knowing those

1192
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
circumstances if someone is still angry

1193
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
for heading towards Nintendo I wonder what's

1194
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
the reason for that? Wouldn't you tell me in a way

1195
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
that's easy to understand? As I have

1196
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
said earlier if you want Bayonetta 2 on

1197
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
PS4 or Xbox One how about trying to

1198
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
ask Nintendo? If Nintendo doesn't

1199
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
say yes it's not going to happen.

1200
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
While you're at it try asking for Mario

1201
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and Zelda 2. Ooh!

1202
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Somebody's

1203
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
somebody had carried a little

1204
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
whip with that comment but he's right

1205
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
in a way. But Loki you claim

1206
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
shenanigans. I claim shenanigans because

1207
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
there's companies like Axes Games

1208
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
that will fucking pay to have

1209
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
almost anything localized. I mean

1210
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
just ridiculous

1211
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
niche games. This isn't a matter

1212
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
of localization though. Localization

1213
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
is way cheaper than development.

1214
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
There's a big difference.

1215
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I don't think Axes Games has

1216
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
quite the pockets. Now maybe

1217
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Atlas but maybe

1218
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
that's somebody that was approached we don't know.

1219
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Or here's another thing.

1220
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Fucking self-publish on

1221
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
PS4 or Xbox One. You can do

1222
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that you know. You don't need

1223
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
a publisher. But who

1224
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
pays for the development? You can't say

1225
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
oh I'll pay you when we're

1226
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
done. Like you can't do that.

1227
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You have to pay these people as the game is

1228
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
development. Who's going to pay for that?

1229
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Kickstarter it.

1230
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Well okay.

1231
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Now that could

1232
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
be an option. Now we could

1233
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Kickstarter it. But I think when this game was being

1234
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
developed that really hadn't

1235
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
gone through yet. So I don't know

1236
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Loki. Hold out hope for Bayonetta 3.

1237
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I hope they make

1238
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
their money back on you know. I hope they do

1239
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
too. On this

1240
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
game cause

1241
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
it's not looking good so far.

1242
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Let me put it that way. It's going to really suck

1243
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
if they invested so

1244
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
much into this game and

1245
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
it doesn't end up making

1246
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
that money back. I just hope

1247
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
the Wii U audience doesn't limit them. I hope

1248
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Bayonetta and Smash can kinda

1249
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
exist together. I just think

1250
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
they develop on

1251
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
PC

1252
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
and it gets ported to the Wii U.

1253
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I mean they don't develop on a Wii U.

1254
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It's just something they test on.

1255
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's developed on PC. It's fucking

1256
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
apparently really easy to port

1257
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
over to the PlayStation. I would imagine it's gotta be

1258
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
pretty easy to port on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

1259
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
being that they're more powerful systems.

1260
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But he's right. Nintendo paid for it.

1261
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's Nintendo's game. Nintendo will have to be the one

1262
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
to put it on the PC. Will Nintendo do that?

1263
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I mean they could.

1264
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I mean I just don't think

1265
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Nintendo will cause they're kinda stubborn like that.

1266
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It's like you'd have better luck

1267
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
getting a Mario game on the PC.

1268
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
They're not a company like Microsoft where

1269
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
oh Halo 2 had a PC version.

1270
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You know. Well

1271
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I guess

1272
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
it's just gonna

1273
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
just sell like you know Mad World

1274
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
did where you know it's

1275
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
a great game and you know both

1276
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Platinum games and you know more power to them

1277
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
but unfortunately it's just not something that's

1278
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
gonna sell a lot of copies. Or let's

1279
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
do crazy internet forum

1280
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
speak. Let's do crazy wank theories

1281
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
that people come up with like oh oh

1282
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
this is what's gonna happen. Oh oh you guys you guys

1283
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
this is what's gonna happen. This is what's gonna happen. Okay okay

1284
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you guys. Apple's gonna buy Nintendo

1285
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
and then Bayonetta 2 will be on

1286
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
the Mac. That's cause Apple and Nintendo

1287
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
they have to be in bed together. That's right. Apple and

1288
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Nintendo they're like the same. Like Nintendo

1289
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
is like Apple in Japan.

1290
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That's what's gonna happen. Loki that's what's gonna happen.

1291
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's gonna happen.

1292
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Well

1293
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
first off

1294
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
you know

1295
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
first off there's not a lot of games on them you know

1296
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
you know the Mac anyways

1297
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
but I mean I don't know. I could see them

1298
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
maybe putting out

1299
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
something for like you know

1300
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
another

1301
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you know iPad or something like that. I mean

1302
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
cause they're really pushing you know gaming.

1303
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Is there a Bayonetta on the fucking iPad?

1304
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Like it's just it doesn't. Why they've got like

1305
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
what is it Infinity Blade on the fucking iPad?

1306
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I just don't see it. You know it's an action game

1307
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I mean I don't know.

1308
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I don't know. I'm

1309
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'm looking forward very much to checking out

1310
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Bayonetta 2. I have a Wii U.

1311
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
This isn't a problem for me.

1312
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's the Xbox One exclusives that are

1313
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
bugging me right now like Forza Horizon 2. Oh yeah.

1314
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I wanted to play that shit. No yeah exactly.

1315
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Forza Horizon 2 I totally want that.

1316
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Alright. Uh

1317
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Moving on. Dark Soccer. What do you have for us?

1318
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Uh we do have uh something

1319
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
a new game coming out but not new new

1320
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
new new. It's uh Star Wars Arcade

1321
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Machine is gonna be coming out. Yes.

1322
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
They uh it's gonna be

1323
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
uh uh

1324
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
premiered at New York Comic Con

1325
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
and Namco Bandai will be bringing out the new

1326
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Star Wars Arcade. It's uh totally coin

1327
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
op so

1328
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
very surprising but I guess

1329
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
if they say it can be done it can be done. Prequels

1330
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
aren't in it right? I don't think so.

1331
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
But they said um there is

1332
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
a press unveiling on October 8th

1333
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
so we're not gonna

1334
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
see it until it's actually out so

1335
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
who knows. What kind of game

1336
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
is it though? What does it say?

1337
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Is it gonna be like

1338
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
well I mean they seem to

1339
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
do these Star Wars arcade games pretty

1340
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
regularly like you know there's the old school

1341
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Atari vector one right and then they had that one

1342
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
not that long ago well actually probably yeah

1343
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
it was a long time ago like 10 years at this point

1344
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
which was like the right when the

1345
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
prequels were probably like big where you

1346
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
like you had the big lightsaber thing

1347
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
the pod racer game was kind of okay. Stick in the

1348
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
middle that you would like fight lightsaber

1349
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
battles with. It was kind of neat.

1350
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I think the only good thing that ever came out of the prequels was

1351
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the pod racer game. Yeah. That was kind of

1352
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
fun. Other than that. And the new

1353
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Star Tours. Like believe it or not

1354
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
when you go to Jar Jar Binks' planet that's

1355
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
like the best one. I know

1356
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I know bite my tongue but seriously

1357
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
that's the best. That was the one that made me jump.

1358
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yeah. That ending. Yeah. I finally

1359
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
got Hoth did I tell you. Did you?

1360
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah. It took me forever to get Hoth.

1361
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Hoth is cool. Hoth was the best. Literally.

1362
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It is. It's literally

1363
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
cool. It's cold.

1364
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Anyway. You know who else

1365
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
is cool. These guys who like to drop

1366
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
into OLR occasionally and they're

1367
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
back with us tonight. They snuck into the

1368
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
studio through the door

1369
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and came back to say hi for another week

1370
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
but I'm glad they're here. Welcome back you guys

1371
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
from the big

1372
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
yes the big anime

1373
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
game room. Did I give that

1374
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
out of order? Anyway. Jonas and

1375
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Diego are back tonight. Did I say that right?

1376
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Hello. I think it's the big ass game

1377
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
anime room. The big ass game room?

1378
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
No it's the big anime game room.

1379
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Is it the big ass game room?

1380
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Some people in this room like ass an awful lot.

1381
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Sounds like room for future

1382
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
development.

1383
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
We got another A in there I guess.

1384
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Big ass ass. That's right.

1385
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Big ass anime. So how you guys doing?

1386
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
We're doing good. How are you doing?

1387
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
How are things? Good. You missed us talking

1388
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
about Smash. Have you guys

1389
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
checked out the new Smash on 3DS yet?

1390
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I've been trying to keep up on it right now and people are

1391
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
figuring out stuff left and right.

1392
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Even when the demo was out people were just figuring out things

1393
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
but as they unlock more characters

1394
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
they're just figuring out that some of these characters

1395
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
are somewhat broken from what I heard.

1396
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Uh oh. They're breaking the game as we

1397
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
speak right now.

1398
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It's only been out for a couple of days

1399
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
now and people had just

1400
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
a few tournaments locally around here and

1401
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
people were saying things. I'm seeing people who are appearing

1402
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
that I've never seen in my life that play games

1403
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
that are winning. Wait they're already

1404
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
having tournaments and this game came out on Friday?

1405
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Yes they are. What the

1406
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
hell?

1407
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah I had a couple of locals in some of the comic

1408
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
stores around here and uh

1409
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
yeah it's been pulling crowds. Oh my gosh.

1410
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Just on Saturday there was a big

1411
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
one in San Jose in the GameStop and it

1412
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
pulled enough. You literally would have like 30 hours

1413
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
to prepare for this. Oh my god.

1414
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You know somebody was like Red Bull

1415
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Red Bull just in my

1416
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
veins. They just want to get

1417
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Did Loki just get up to go get a Red Bull?

1418
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Oh my

1419
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
god. Product placement. They're just trying to

1420
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
unlock everything and figure out the game as fast as they can.

1421
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's still relatively new so like it's anyways

1422
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
game right now. Okay I'm struggling to

1423
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
unlock characters because I'm just really bad

1424
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
at Smash okay? And what the hell did they do

1425
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
to Meta Knight? Oh my god.

1426
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Meta Knight used to be my go to. Like I understand he was

1427
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
like so unbalanced like he was banned in tournaments

1428
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
and shit but like now he does this

1429
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
like torpedo shit. That just means he's bad ass

1430
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and you need to buff up everybody else.

1431
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Right? You know what Dan said

1432
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
yesterday? Huh. You know

1433
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I miss Jigglypuff.

1434
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Uh Jigglypuff's an unlock. Spoiler

1435
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
alerts. Okay. So you'll get Jigglypuff

1436
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
eventually. Keep playing. But Dan

1437
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
was just like I can't believe

1438
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
he said that. I miss

1439
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Jigglypuff. Really? What about Snake?

1440
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Does anyone miss Solid Snake being

1441
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
a little bit cause I thought

1442
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Snake was cool as a character but I understand

1443
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I understand like why.

1444
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
He's also on the game too.

1445
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
He's an unlock. Snake is in the

1446
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
new game as well. No.

1447
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I thought he was like a DLC or something

1448
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
like supposedly. No. He's either

1449
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
one of the two. They said he was gonna be in this game.

1450
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I think he was on a list for supposed

1451
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
DLC so but I do not believe

1452
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
he's an unlock in the base roster.

1453
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Yeah I'm pretty sure cause you wouldn't

1454
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
you wouldn't have a third party character. They already have the whole

1455
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
game unlocked in Japan I thought already.

1456
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Yeah no I don't think Snake is in there.

1457
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Sonic is though.

1458
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Which you know that was cool

1459
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
to have him back. Are his legs normal

1460
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
sized?

1461
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Or is that like you know a pallet swap where you can

1462
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
adjust the size of his legs. No

1463
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
his legs are not.

1464
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Act F says the last unlock

1465
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
is Jigglypuff. There you go.

1466
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Kaijuto in chat says Wii Fit Trainer

1467
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
kicks ass and Little Mac. I like

1468
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
all the different skins you can do

1469
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
because like with Little Mac

1470
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
you can like have the wire frame

1471
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
with Little Mac from the old school punch out.

1472
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Like did anybody play punch out in the arcades

1473
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
like back in the day before it was an NES game? Like it was a big

1474
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
wire frame character he used to play as.

1475
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So I thought that was really cool. Yeah that was a nice feature

1476
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
they did there. Yeah I love that. And

1477
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Bowser Jr. I didn't know this until

1478
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Shane was telling me about it. You can cycle

1479
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
through and Bowser Jr. all the

1480
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
pallet swaps are all of the Koopa

1481
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
kids with Bowser Jr.'s moves.

1482
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So you can play every single one of them.

1483
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That's amazing. And

1484
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
spoiler I'm totally glad that

1485
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Rob the Robot is back. Yes.

1486
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
That was a fun character to play as.

1487
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
It is, it is. So I just found

1488
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
a fun screenshot that I will link in the chat room

1489
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
of everyone who made the

1490
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
cast of

1491
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
King of the Hill

1492
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
as Mies. Oh as Mies.

1493
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
What the hell does that have to do with what we're talking about?

1494
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Oh it's in Smash Bros. It's Mies. I saw

1495
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
one with RuPaul's Drag Race characters

1496
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
as Mies. And I thought that was great. Someone had a

1497
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Neil deGrasse Tyson. Nice.

1498
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I saw a doctor.

1499
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Doctor Who. So I thought that was pretty cool.

1500
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Jonas how about you?

1501
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Have you been playing Smash at all?

1502
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I haven't gotten Smash yet because I'm just

1503
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
waiting for the Wii U version. I know everyone says

1504
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
get the 3DS version. But

1505
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
again the 3DS I have

1506
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
is actually my fiancé's.

1507
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And it's mainly for her Pokemon plays.

1508
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Because she's been

1509
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
playing more Pokemon competitively

1510
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
because of the upcoming regionals.

1511
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I actually think that's an okay

1512
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
perspective. Not everybody's going to agree with me

1513
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
but I also kind of put it out there during

1514
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
my little review of it. As I said

1515
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
the biggest problem with Smash Bros.

1516
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
is the platform that it's on. Honestly.

1517
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It's too much for the 3DS.

1518
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And I think it'll be great on

1519
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
the Wii U. For me this is like

1520
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
a demo for the Wii U version.

1521
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Don't get me wrong. Yes it's in the 3DS version.

1522
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
But I think this is just an opinion based.

1523
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I think in terms of

1524
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
processing power it was designed mainly for

1525
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the new Nintendo 3DS.

1526
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah. I mean this thing pushes

1527
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
the limits of the 3DS and kind of

1528
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
then some. Honestly it pushes it beyond

1529
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
because you can't even do Miiverse with it.

1530
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So.

1531
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
That's sad that we're already at

1532
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
the limits of this system

1533
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
what? A couple years from

1534
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
its release? It's been longer than you think.

1535
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I think 3DS has been out like what?

1536
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
5 years now I want to say?

1537
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
No. 4. Maybe 4.

1538
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
2010, 2011 I think.

1539
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Maybe 2010. About 4 years.

1540
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So. It was after

1541
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
well because I bought my 3DS after I was

1542
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
living at the house so it would have been

1543
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
2009 or

1544
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
after 2009 so it would have been 2010 or

1545
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
later. Yeah.

1546
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But yeah. I mean

1547
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
technology is a rapidly

1548
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
evolving industry. I mean look at a lot of

1549
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
phones. Like you know a lot of people talk

1550
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
about like the Apple like the iOS

1551
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
doesn't run on you know certain older

1552
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
phones and the same thing happens on Android

1553
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
you can't run the new

1554
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Kit Kat or whatever they call them. Little candy bar

1555
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
platforms on certain older Android

1556
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
devices like they just they have to be refreshed every few years.

1557
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm really looking forward to the

1558
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
3DX XL that's coming out

1559
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
on October 10th that's the old school

1560
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
NES controller. I

1561
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
have mixed feelings on that because I so

1562
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
like what bogs me about is that they didn't

1563
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
change the inside at all like they did with the

1564
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
advanced SP that looked like the NES

1565
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
so the outside just kind of looks like

1566
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
somebody put a sticker on it you know. That's

1567
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
the only but I love my retro

1568
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
NES too don't get me wrong but it's just

1569
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I wish they'd done a little more with it.

1570
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The only thing else that just kind of applies to is that the box

1571
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
that comes with it looks like the regular NES

1572
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
that's about all they just kind of add it to that

1573
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
so you have the controller which is the actual

1574
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
console itself and the box that's the

1575
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
NES. That's kind of cool. That part's cool.

1576
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Alright well

1577
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
we're going to move on with some news

1578
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
but by all means guys chime in as you

1579
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
hear things in the news you want to comment on so

1580
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
let's move on with some more news. Loki.

1581
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Sorry I was checking my progress

1582
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
on Clicker Heroes because I haven't played

1583
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
it in a week. I saw at least two

1584
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
people on Twitter like say

1585
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
God damn it Loki why did you have to bring up that game?

1586
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So I have was it uh

1587
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
yeah I can't even

1588
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I don't even know where was it

1589
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
2.56

1590
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
tillion it's earned

1591
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in gold. You made that word up.

1592
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Let's go. There's a key

1593
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
on the side because like I'm like I don't

1594
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
even know so yeah whatever.

1595
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Okay so

1596
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
this is kind of related

1597
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
to what we were just talking about with Star Wars. Yeah I know

1598
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
we went kind of on the Smash Brothers route

1599
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
there but apparently

1600
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Disney has pulled a few

1601
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Star Wars games off of the

1602
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
iOS and Google Play stores

1603
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
and Windows Store can't forget Windows.

1604
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah you can.

1605
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah that's like

1606
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I was talking about my phone sucking the other day

1607
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and my wife's like well she's like well I have

1608
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
a new phone. I'm like you have a Windows

1609
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
phone. It doesn't do

1610
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
anything. Okay like have you used your

1611
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
phone to use Facebook. No it makes

1612
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
calls. I'm like yeah

1613
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
that's about all this. Alright so

1614
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
anyways so Star Wars assault team

1615
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
has been

1616
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
removed. It was a free to play game and

1617
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
was it

1618
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I guess they're focusing now on

1619
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Star Wars Commander but the one I was

1620
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
kind of disappointed with is Nimblebits

1621
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Tiny Death Star was removed

1622
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and the best part about it is they didn't even fucking

1623
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
tell Nimblebit oh hey we removed your game.

1624
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
That was

1625
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
nice. That's

1626
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
that's so crazy. I actually

1627
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
have Tiny Death Star. I downloaded

1628
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
that because you know Tiny Tower was kind of cool.

1629
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Um you know I got a little

1630
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I kind of was over it after

1631
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
a couple days of play but for a free

1632
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
game you know it entertained me for a while but I'm very

1633
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
surprised especially with such a tie in

1634
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
like that with Tiny Tower they got rid of it. Why would you

1635
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
remove that? They want to focus

1636
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
on this Star Wars

1637
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Commander what the new one is called.

1638
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
That's the one they want to focus on. But it's not even the same

1639
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
type of game. I know it's weird isn't it?

1640
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Like you know

1641
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
casual like you know moms and stuff

1642
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
are probably not going to play Star Wars Commander

1643
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I mean well well I don't know because

1644
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Star Wars Commander apparently is doing insanely well.

1645
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Like and a lot of good feedback

1646
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
on the game you know and so forth so I

1647
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Is it like you know Smurf Village or

1648
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I haven't played it myself so I can't really

1649
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
comment on it but I've just I see a lot about it on

1650
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Facebook so anyways

1651
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
um yeah so they basically

1652
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
basically said hey we're very disappointed to see Tiny

1653
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Earth Star shuttered in less than a year after

1654
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
launch. We had no prior knowledge

1655
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
that the game was going to be removed

1656
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
and no longer even have

1657
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
a contract with Disney after recent layoffs.

1658
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Suffice to say

1659
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I guess if you're looking to partner

1660
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
with Disney this might not be the

1661
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
partnership you're looking for. Wow

1662
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
shady shade. So

1663
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
uh well you know what. Well

1664
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
earned advice. Well uh

1665
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
no Tiny Disneyland coming to your phones

1666
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
anytime soon I'm sure. Dude see that would have been awesome.

1667
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Right. That would have been awesome.

1668
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
That would have been so awesome. Maybe like um

1669
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I don't know

1670
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Jurassic Park's coming out pretty soon you know

1671
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Tiny Jurassic Park

1672
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I don't know. Tiny

1673
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Velociraptor

1674
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It's like you bred Tiny Raptors

1675
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Oh my god

1676
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Tiny Dinos

1677
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
that would be funny

1678
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Dungeon Buster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

1679
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
says I should check on my Tiny Death

1680
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Star and see how it's doing. Well someone

1681
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
might have blown it up apparently and that might have

1682
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
been Disney. Just flew an

1683
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
X-Winger. Just blew the damn thing up.

1684
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Alright anyhow

1685
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
uh moving on. A follow

1686
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
up to something we were talking about in a previous

1687
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
week. The Wii U is going to be

1688
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
getting a Minecraft clone

1689
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
or two and the

1690
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
developer yeah the developer behind the

1691
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Minecraft clone on the Wii U which is apparently

1692
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
called Ucraft is

1693
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Nexus Games

1694
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
that is. You guys laughing over there at that name?

1695
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Yeah yeah

1696
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
What's that Jonas?

1697
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
That company sounds familiar. Nexus

1698
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
No no not that Nexus Games

1699
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Nexus with an I

1700
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Nexus with an I Games

1701
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
No not the good Nexus Games

1702
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Hold on. Hold on. Jonas may be a fan of

1703
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Brick Blast U which is on

1704
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
the Nintendo eShop

1705
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Ok wrong game. That's fine. Wrong company

1706
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But they are working on

1707
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Ucraft for the Wii U

1708
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
and uh yeah

1709
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
saying it could arrive for the Nintendo eShop

1710
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
before Christmas. Don't

1711
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
have that set in stone however

1712
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
so uh that is in development

1713
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
however that's not the only

1714
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
one being made.

1715
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Stone Shire is also in

1716
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
development by the two man

1717
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
team over at Finger Gun Games

1718
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
which if you think about it though I mean

1719
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
you know one guy kind of made the original Minecraft

1720
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
so two people making a clone

1721
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I guess would make sense. Uh

1722
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
so there it is. Apparently this game will have dwarves

1723
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
elves, hobbits and goblins roaming

1724
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
the land. So just because we call it a Minecraft

1725
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
clone doesn't mean it is actually like a clone

1726
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
it might have its own stuff and this

1727
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
sounds like it may have some extra kind of

1728
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
stuff in it so you know

1729
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
don't write off these games just because we're calling

1730
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
the Minecraft clones. They might end up

1731
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
being actually kind of cool but we won't really

1732
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
know until we see more about them. Well we can call it

1733
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Minecraft-like like we do roguelikes

1734
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Sure I like that. Minecraft-like

1735
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Craft-like. Craft-like.

1736
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Now it sounds like we're talking about cheese

1737
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
like they're craft singles or anyways.

1738
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
It's not real cheese. That's like cheese

1739
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
food. That's what cheese eats.

1740
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Let me put it this way okay

1741
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and I not to throw shade

1742
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
because you know indie developers

1743
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
and stuff but if you

1744
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
look at the other games that this guy

1745
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
that Nexus has made that like that game

1746
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
that's on there it looks really

1747
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
uh

1748
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
low production quality. I mean

1749
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
don't get me wrong I understand it's a unity game

1750
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and stuff but it looks like

1751
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
they like kicked that out in maybe a

1752
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
week like spent no time on it

1753
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and seeing how many tutorials

1754
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
there are out there that make voxel

1755
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
like games. Hell I'm making a voxel like

1756
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
game but it's not necessarily going to be a

1757
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
voxel game just

1758
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I use it to build my models because I can't fucking

1759
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I can't 3D model for

1760
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
shit but I can build with Legos

1761
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
so hey let's do that.

1762
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So uh

1763
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
it's pretty easy to

1764
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
you know to build one of these things and there's a lot

1765
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
of tutorials out there so all you would have to do is

1766
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
build something for the Wii U get a

1767
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
dev kit and port it over. Unity does

1768
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
the porting for you.

1769
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
All you really got to do is sign up for Nintendo

1770
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
and get fucking dev kit to test it on that's it

1771
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and just looking at this

1772
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I mean

1773
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
it's got well the the other one had

1774
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
the default you know standard

1775
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
asset you know skybox

1776
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
and default

1777
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
shaders it really looks like it was

1778
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
thrown together in a few days

1779
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
so

1780
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
but hey you know what though um

1781
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
there will be better games out there I mean

1782
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
look at the xbox indie games there was

1783
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
how many minecraft clones a

1784
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
ton of fucking minecraft clones and you know what

1785
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
it's not a bad idea to do that

1786
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
because they made a ton of money

1787
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
they weren't great but people want to play

1788
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
minecraft so badly if that's their only

1789
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
option they're going to fucking buy it

1790
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
so they're going to make tons of money

1791
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
even if it's absolute shit

1792
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
well let's hope it's not though I hope

1793
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I hope it's good turn out pretty decent

1794
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
we'll kind of want to make a minecraft clone

1795
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
but not right now uh act

1796
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
deaf in chat says the trailer for you

1797
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
craft is hilariously awful the game

1798
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
looks okay but oh god the trailer

1799
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
they have a trailer apparently and

1800
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
kaijuto and chat says survival craft

1801
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
on the tablet is awesome so you know

1802
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
there's some clones that people people dig

1803
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I mean uh the one I was

1804
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
playing you see what I did there dig because it's

1805
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
minecraft I think it was a

1806
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
castle maker her

1807
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
and that was like a buck on indie games and it was

1808
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
it was fun it was a minecraft game with

1809
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
guns I mean the graphics weren't great but it

1810
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
was just kind of something to mess around

1811
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
with cool guns

1812
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
all right uh one more story and then

1813
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
we'll get to some release dates star sakura

1814
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
well you know I never remembered if

1815
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
it was west one

1816
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
or west stone I always thought was

1817
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
west one but the

1818
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
company that created wonder boy is filing for bankruptcy

1819
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
uh after 30

1820
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
years of being in business

1821
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
since 1986

1822
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
which is hard to think of the 80s as being

1823
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
30 years ago um

1824
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
but basically they have

1825
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
uh filed for

1826
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
bankruptcy um they actually uh

1827
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
the the wonder boy series

1828
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
was actually adapted

1829
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
into uh the nes

1830
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
adventure island so

1831
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
if you don't remember too much about

1832
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
and don't forget about you know

1833
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
wonder boy in monster world um

1834
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
you could actually play in the sega vintage

1835
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
collection monster world so

1836
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
it's a sad day

1837
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
we're sorry to see them go

1838
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I I actually used to love

1839
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
adventure island when I was younger

1840
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and like I was actually good at those type of games

1841
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and uh I'll give a shout out to my pal

1842
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
uh jeremy over at uh the koopa

1843
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
club podcast was doing some uh

1844
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
youtubes and and uh livestreams

1845
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
of adventure island he was talking about

1846
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
that wonder boy connection I was like oh yeah

1847
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
that's right the games were related and I never like you don't

1848
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
really realize that as a kid but like

1849
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
it's kind of cool to hear those connections now

1850
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
but very sad to hear about um

1851
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
them shutting down I think I've covered two of the wonder

1852
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
boy games for a classic game you probably

1853
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
have but that would imply that I have

1854
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
some type of memory or you know

1855
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
the sequels were on the master system

1856
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
sega genesis turbo graphics 16

1857
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
or as it was in japan the pc engine

1858
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
uh there was uh in japan

1859
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
only there was a monster world complete collection

1860
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
of the ps2 and then like

1861
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I said there was a sega vintage collection monster world

1862
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
uh dark tetsuya

1863
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

1864
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
man I loved wonder boy 3 the dragons

1865
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
trap or dragons curse on pc

1866
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
engine turbo graphics so yeah I'm legit

1867
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
sad frowny well I mean

1868
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
there's always what virtual console

1869
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
and so forth for those right I think

1870
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
uh wonder boy 3 had come out for those

1871
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
at some point I thought I saw that I could be wrong

1872
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
so alright

1873
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
well uh let's travel around the world

1874
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000

in a car the starter edition

1891
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
possibly you could do piecemeal

1892
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
edition because they're gonna have like you know

1893
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
where you can buy content

1894
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
for it and then or if you want

alien isolation was also on pc

1908
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
um the disc version

1909
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I'm not sure if this is the only way

1910
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
you can get this cause I thought this was free to play

1911
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
but project spark on xbox one

1912
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
is coming out um

1913
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I guess that's a disc

1914
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
version of the game although I thought it was free

1915
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
to play so I thought so too

1916
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I don't know maybe it's extra content or something

1917
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000

01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
so yeah

1931
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
uh let's see

1932
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
and uh finally

1933
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
forza motorsports 5

1934
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
racing or is it the

1935
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
game of the year edition on xbox one

1936
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
so a lot of re-releases there

1937
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
and that would be it

1938
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I thought there was more games this week but I guess that's it

1939
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
well let's travel over to japan and check out

1940
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
what's coming out there on the playstation 4

1941
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
drive club releases for them as well

1942
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
and fifa 15 this week in japan as well

1943
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
also that white playstation 4

1944
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
makes its way to japan this week all on

1945
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
october 9th the xbox one

1946
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000

1948
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
pack so maybe I'm

1949
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
thinking it's like what you said

1950
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
like a disc version with maybe some

1951
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
uh things included with it that you

1952
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
would buy otherwise uh over on

1953
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
the playstation 3 this week in japan also

1954
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
fifa 15 can you tell that it's gonna

1955
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
be out for everything and uh

1956
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
some major price reductions on the tales

1957
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
of series so you want

1958
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
graces f or vesperia or

1959
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
even zilia 2 which has been out in japan

1960
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
a little longer than it has been here those are all

1961
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
going into playstation 3 the best

1962
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
series so uh

1963
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
now's a good time to cap on that if you'd like

1964
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
uh on the xbox 360

1965
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000

maybe

1982
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000

vampires you have to fight them and

2025
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
undress them so that they're it's vampires

2026
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
that's right because they have to expose their

their body parts to the sun in order

2028
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000

we also have project spark

2034
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
which i misread as project spank

2035
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
hahaha

2036
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
that'd be a better game uh rise son

2037
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
of rome on pc and

2038
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
skylanders trap team on a bunch of

2039
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
stuff sleeping dogs

2041
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
bone and pc

2042
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
so with project spark you know

2043
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
i don't know if it's officially out already

2044
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
or if it's coming out this um

2045
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
tuesday

2046
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
time to penis what do you think

2047
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
you know how long before we get

2048
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
like how long to unlock all the

2049
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
the stuff needed to well

2050
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
i'm telling you there's a very good

2051
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
chance that the time to penis is actually going to be very short

2052
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
being that conquer is in the game

2053
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
so this is going to be a very short one

2054
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
do you guys know uh from from the uh big anime game room

2055
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
do you know about our time to penis estimations

2056
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
i don't know if you know this but any game that

2057
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
allows you any type of creativity

2058
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
we always ask the question how

2059
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
long till somebody puts a penis in it

2060
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
so that's probably around the time

2061
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
when picto chat came out and people were drawing

2062
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
penises all over the place

2063
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
literally they should have just called it penis chat

2064
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
right it wasn't a

2065
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
well obviously it was just part of the system

2066
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
but it wasn't a game but yeah that was just being thrown

2067
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
all over the place especially going to conventions

2068
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
people were just passing around pictures

2069
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
and sending them to each other that looked like penises

2070
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
the closest uh private part

2071
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
yeah or you know they they had that game

2072
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
ping pals it was just ping pals

2073
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
that's all it was you know

2074
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
do you ever remember reading vg cats

2075
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
yes i've heard of them

2076
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and they had the optimus prime versus megatron

2077
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
picto chat that was pretty funny

2078
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
did they show penis yes

2079
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
i think i don't remember but it was

2080
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
basically them just going back

2081
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
that's what picto chat was for

2082
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
at least you know picked it or was it uh

2083
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
was it ping pals

2084
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
it's better than like tinder pals or something like that

2085
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
tinder pals

2086
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
just a bunch of like little picto chat penises

2087
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
come up on the screen swipe left

2088
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
swipe left ooh swipe right

2089
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
a lot of other common things

2090
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
i saw with like a bell spout and they tried to put the

2091
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
penis in the mouth it was pretty bad

2092
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
i don't know what they were

2093
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
doing with pokemon at the time that's what they're doing

2094
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
that's what they're doing in smash brothers

2095
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
picture mode right now is like you know

2096
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
let's see how many sexual positions we can put these characters

2097
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
in anyway

2098
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000

01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
to as they put

2111
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
um simplify the company

2112
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
they went towards a simplified

2113
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
organization as they say it's never

2114
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
easy to consider changes like this

2115
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
but it's better to do them um

2116
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
sooner rather than later

2117
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
when we're in a good place to

2118
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
reignite growth so

2119
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
in other words they're not making as much money as they

2120
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
used to they need to cut jobs in order to

2121
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
be able to stay

2122
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
i guess in the black

2123
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
i'm thinking maybe like

2124
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
angry birds just probably maybe got

2125
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
like too big i don't know if that makes

2126
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
sense but like you know

2127
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
uh they have all these spin

2128
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
off games and angry birds is on like

2129
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
like all these different platforms and maybe

2130
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
maybe it just became too diluted

2131
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
like because when they talk about the whole like

2132
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
trying to

2133
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
bring it dark

2134
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
sakura stop showing pictures of picto chat one time

2135
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
time i mean they have angry

2136
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
birds transformers they have

2137
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
you know sorry after the conversation

2138
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
she just had it's a funny image in my mind

2139
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
i think wait if it

2140
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
we're talking about rovia here right yeah

2141
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
isn't this the same kind of um

2142
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
effect that happened with zinga

2143
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
where they got so big for a short

2144
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
time then tanked like

2145
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
because

2146
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
new trends come out and they haven't

2147
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
maintained their trends the big

2148
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
difference here though is that i understand

2149
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
why people like angry birds i never

2150
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
understood why people like farmville that's

2151
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
that's the big difference here to me people

2152
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
like angry birds because scorched earth isn't on

2153
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
fucking foam that's why they like angry

2154
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
birds and because

2155
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
gorillas was awesome but you know

2156
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
uh angry birds is a fun game i

2157
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
don't knock it it's a fun game it's a fun

2158
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
time waster but

2159
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
it's just i don't know

2160
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
uh there's only

2161
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
so much of it you can take before it gets kind of boring

2162
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
i guess um you know eventually

2163
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
people are gonna get tired of it and

2164
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
it's maybe just not you know

2165
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
rebranding it or something it's not really

2166
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
doing anything that's

2167
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
like saying offering different skins in

2168
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
minecraft sells more copies of the game

2169
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
maybe it does but i don't think

2170
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
it's gonna make a huge difference i think that's a tough

2171
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
thing for a lot of these mobile developers is

2172
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
that you know you gotta have

2173
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
i think more than one big franchise

2174
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
to really you know

2175
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
get out there you know and i know right now a lot

2176
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
of the focus is on king and candy crush

2177
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
saga but you know what that bubble that

2178
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
bubble's gonna burst someday too maybe not today

2179
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
but you know i think that's

2180
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
that's a huge problem with the mobile market too

2181
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
because at first oh angry birds is one of the

2182
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
one of the first few games out there

2183
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
but now that everybody's doing it

2184
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
yeah i mean no one expected

2185
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
flappy bird of all things to pop out

2186
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
it just popped out at random and people are starting to play

2187
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
the hell out of it that's true sometimes

2188
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
the the fans especially on mobile

2189
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
can be very fickle you know it's

2190
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
it's almost like going viral on youtube like

2191
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
you can't like you know these people all sit in

2192
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
a boardroom we have to do something

2193
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
that will go viral and it's like

2194
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
that's very hard to do

2195
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
like if you don't like put betty white in

2196
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
it or something that's not gonna happen

2197
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
just because you want it to like that has

2198
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
to happen organically yeah because i mean

2199
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
i understand that um like these

2200
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
companies it is the cheapest way to

2201
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
develop games like out there

2202
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
it saves money rather you know how like people

2203
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
develop games for like xbox one ps4

2204
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
and wii u and all that other consoles

2205
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and stuff or even pcs where

2206
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
the production might be more expensive

2207
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
for this one but the the problem

2208
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
with i think the mobile market at the moment

2209
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
like with especially with angry birds is

2210
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
that there's too much like way

2211
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
way too much in the market that

2212
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
people have to decide which one's gonna be

2213
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
the best one and it's

2214
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
hard to get noticed like you know when flappy

2215
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
bird was the big thing and you looked

2216
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
at like the top 100 games like 20 of

2217
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
them were flappy burglar like you had flappy

2218
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
miley for fuck's sake like

2219
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000

01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000

wait

2229
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
i'll probably draw another penis on

2230
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
peto chat

2231
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000

01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
this is um not really good

2234
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
news for nintendo one of their uh

2235
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
big titles possibly being delayed

2236
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
don't we don't have anything official

2237
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000

01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
and breathe out it's not smash brothers

2239
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
i'm talking about this time but it's

2240
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
captain toad treasure tracker

2241
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
oh and nobody is sad

2242
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
sorry i think some

2243
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
people are a little bit sad but

2244
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
i don't know uh please

2245
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
gamefly of all people which

2246
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
you know rents the games and so forth

2247
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
they changed their captain toad

2248
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
treasure tracker release date from

2249
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
2014 to march 2015

2250
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
uh it should

2251
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
be noted that gamefly has a pretty

2252
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
good record of being correct about

2253
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
these sorts of delays uh in

2254
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
the past no they don't oh look at you

2255
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
listen i came from the distribution

2256
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
industry since i'm not fucking working there

2257
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
anymore i love this now now you're gonna become unhinged

2258
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
now you officially don't work there now it's

2259
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
oh man loki's gonna give it all

2260
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
here's the thing

2261
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
here's what it comes down to nintendo

2262
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
probably they they announced stuff by

2263
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
quarter and so they've already

2264
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
announced their ship for fourth quarter

2265
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
it's not on there so they're probably assuming

2266
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
hey we haven't heard anything about this yet we're

2267
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
just gonna move it out of the year that's what i used to do

2268
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
it's like i have a bunch of shit that'd be on the

2269
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
the 31st of december it's all

2270
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
that to be announced fucking dates stuff

2271
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
guess where guess where uh

2272
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
captain toad treasure tracker was yeah

2273
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
i was right there so

2274
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
i just moved the shit you know

2275
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
to clear up my calendar or whatever

2276
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
i'm like because i want my release dates to be nice and clean

2277
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
so if i don't want all this tba shit at the end of

2278
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
the year so i just fucking move it to

2279
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
the next quarter so that's

2280
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
probably what i would do yeah

2281
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
they move shit on hunch

2282
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
a lot of the times they don't move stuff just because

2283
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
you know nintendo

2284
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
told them unless it was an actual

2285
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
release date in march or something

2286
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and i can see them moving it because

2287
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
it's not that essential of a title it can be

2288
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
put out anytime it's not like

2289
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
oh my god a moment buy a system for treasure

2290
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
no no one's fucking buying a system for that

2291
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
i can also see where nintendo

2292
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
may have a situation where it's like

2293
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
every fucking person in

2294
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
development is fucking making

2295
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
smash happening on the wii u

2296
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
by the holiday we don't give a fuck

2297
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
what has to be pushed back smash is

2298
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
coming out this holiday season i mean you literally

2299
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
could have a situation like that going on right now

2300
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
yeah so i'm just i

2301
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
i think that it's just tba i mean

2302
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
what date did they move into march that's what i

2303
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
want to know no uh it doesn't say

2304
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
okay well then

2305
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
fucking look this up

2306
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
yes because that game

2307
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
it doesn't surprise why they didn't make it as a dlc

2308
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
like add-on to like super mario

2309
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
3d world well i think people

2310
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
are assuming that all it's going

2311
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
to be is what you saw in 3d world

2312
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
and you know one thing nintendo

2313
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
games are pretty decent at i mean especially

2314
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
looking at again like smash brothers they

2315
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
have depth to them so i think there'll be

2316
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
more to expect in this game than

2317
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
just what you saw like that's the

2318
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
start that's the first world and then you'll have

2319
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
these more power-ups maybe you'll have co-op

2320
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
you know there'll be more to it we just haven't

2321
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
really seen what all that looks like i mean i'm not

2322
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
saying anything about nintendo like how they do things

2323
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
because i know they started changing their policies with

2324
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
like let's let's

2325
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
perfect example super luigi u

2326
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
which technically everyone thinks it's a different

2327
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
game but it's a

2328
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
specialized add-on where they added

2329
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
more like an actual package it's just

2330
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
really good dlc

2331
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
yeah so or even mario kart

2332
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
mario kart 8

2333
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
where they have the two

2334
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
two packs and it's so weird

2335
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
to see mario kart with dlc

2336
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
but at the same time it's kinda it's awesome at the

2337
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
same time you know usually i don't get excited

2338
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
about dlc but it seems like nintendo really

2339
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
knows how to do it right that's just my question

2340
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
with the whole totes um that toad game

2341
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
well because if they don't release it as a separate

2342
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
game then they can't do dlc for the toad game

2343
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
it's

2344
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
well hey i mean they haven't they still haven't

2345
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
announced the release date for smash brothers

2346
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
they haven't although

2347
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
i would think all these signs

2348
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
pointing to november 21st would be right but

2349
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
i would think so too but

2350
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
at the same time that 31st

2351
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
march date is a fucking placeholder

2352
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
date nintendo never releases

2353
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
a title on tuesday it's always a fucking

2354
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
friday or something oh so you went over to gamefly

2355
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
and it shows 31st of march it's the 31st

2356
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
yeah so there's that's placeholder

2357
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
that yeah that's what i would do

2358
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
is just move it out of the month look at that

2359
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
loki calling the news out

2360
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
is bull live on air look at that

2361
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
it's a good good thought alright

2362
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
well let's let's move to a simpler

2363
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000

2364
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000

you didn't really know when games were coming out

2367
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000

game of the week mega man the power battle

01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
also known as rockman the power battle

2394
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
and it was

2395
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
a uh basically an arcade game

2396
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
it was a spin off for the rockman series

2397
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
it came out in japan in 1995

2398
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and had a sequel called mega

2399
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
man 2 the power fighters

2400
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
uh the next year um

2401
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
the games reported to uh

2402
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
consoles in north america in 2004 as part of

2403
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
the mega man anniversary collection

2404
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
came out on ps2 uh gamecube

2405
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
and xbox

2406
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
and um was also part of the same

2407
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
compilation in japan as rockman power

2408
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
battle fighters for ps2

2409
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
there was also an adaptation of both

2410
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
games for neo geo pocket caller called

2411
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
rockman battle and fighters

2412
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
which was pretty pretty funny

2413
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
neo geo pocket caller game

2414
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
um so basically uh dr wily

2415
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
rebuilt the robot masters and

2416
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
he wants to take over the world so basically

2417
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
it's a fighting game with

2418
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
uh you can play as

2419
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
as uh

2420
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
mega man or rockman uh

2421
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
proto man or base why would he

2422
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
rebuild them why wouldn't he just build better

2423
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
ones he got a point there

2424
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
his

2425
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
eyebrows way too much

2426
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
um it's it's weighing down his brain

2427
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
so anyway um basically

2428
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
it's just like playing any

2429
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
mega man game you have your jump you have your shoot

2430
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
um you can hold it down

2431
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
for stronger blast you can hold it down while

2432
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
jumping makes you dash uh

2433
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
so you have those different mechanics in there

2434
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
um and as far as the stories that you do

2435
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
each one has a different

2436
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
uh series of stories

2437
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
for what for uh depending on who they

2438
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
fight so you've got

2439
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
um as

2440
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
stories for mega man one through two three through six

2441
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
and mega man seven

2442
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
um the level is

2443
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
you don't really do like a whole level

2444
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
you just have like

2445
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
some part of the level and then

2446
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
you fight your bad guys

2447
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and you actually have to go through um

2448
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
uh sort of a rock paper

2449
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
scissors kind of decision

2450
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
method for choosing the weapon

2451
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
i really like the redesign for uh

2452
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
with man in this one by the way

2453
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
it actually had a

2454
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
soundtrack released on december 1st 1995

2455
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
that was uh

2456
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
actually had some arranged

2457
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
uh pieces from other mega man games

2458
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
by uh Yamamoto

2459
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Setsuo and um Okugawa

2460
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Hideki and they were performed by

2461
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
so uh pretty cool stuff

2462
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
um

2463
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
as far as uh

2464
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
the reception of it

2465
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
gave it a pretty

2466
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
decent rating

2467
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
and uh basically

2468
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
got a 22 out of 40

2469
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
which is decent for

2470
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
so there you go

2471
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
rock man the power battle

2472
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
very cool and uh

2473
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
it was always awesome

2474
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
also a good choice this week as we have mega man

2475
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
fighting game right now it's nice to kind of go back

2476
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
and revisit mega man's brawling

2477
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
roots yes

2478
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
the only thing i didn't like about this game is that like

2479
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
mega man 7 or whatever got like its own

2480
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
dedicated thing but like 1 and 2

2481
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
should have had dedicated and 3 should have had dedicated

2482
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
i don't know maybe it's just me but i thought the

2483
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
robot masters in the earlier games were a little more memorable

2484
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
i just liked playing base

2485
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
yeah it was all about playing base in this one

2486
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
for me cause base was just

2487
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
bad ass alright there it is classic game

2488
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
of the week mega man or rock man

2489
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
the power battle again

2490
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
another one of capcom's

2491
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
arcade games

2492
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
at this point we are about to

2493
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
head over to our interview we did with

2494
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000

2495
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
the pinball arcade however

2496
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
since we are at about the halfway point of the show

2497
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
dark soccer is actually going to be bidding us adieu a little

2498
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000

the time out to be on the show tonight

2545
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
um so for those that might not

2546
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
be familiar with the pinball arcade

2547
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
i mean i know it's on just about every platform that's

2548
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
out there but if for some reason somebody doesn't know what it is

2549
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
tell us a little bit about the pinball arcade

2550
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
sure the pinball arcade

2551
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
came out um a couple years ago

2552
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
we actually launched in february of 2012

2553
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
and it's our goal to

2554
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
recreate all of the greatest pinball machines

2555
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
ever the real machines so we have

2556
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
licenses from williams and batley and

2557
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
and gottlieb and the start license

2558
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
includes that how data east and

2559
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
sega um

2560
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
so basically we have the rights to recreate

2561
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
pretty much every table there is

2562
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
however those are just the pinball rights

2563
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
and what we are looking

2564
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
for in the adams family kickstarter

2565
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
uh the ant employer rights to

2566
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
the movie the adams family

2567
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
um the adams family foundation

2568
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
rights for the the characters

2569
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
and then the uh specific actors

2570
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
so um yeah

2571
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
so it's now our goal to recreate

2572
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
these pinball tables so that

2573
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
pinball players from a whole new

2574
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
generation get to play them

2575
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
well let's since you brought up the adams family kickstarter

2576
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
and i know that's the big big focus right now

2577
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
and there's about a week left to go on the kickstarter

2578
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
when people are going to be hearing this

2579
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
um what exactly are you raising

2580
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
that money for on the kickstarter

2581
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
yeah so those

2582
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
that money is specifically for all those licenses

2583
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
i just mentioned they're for the

2584
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
the rights for the movie

2585
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
for the adams family and

2586
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
for the actors to get their likeness

2587
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
clearances um why is this

2588
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
table so important

2589
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
um the adams family was the best

2590
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
selling pinball table of all time

2591
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
uh it's it's over

2592
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
20,000 like real machines were made

2593
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
it's a really popular table it's really

2594
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
it's a great table it's a fun table it's a pat lawler

2595
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
classic um

2596
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
it's just um a

2597
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
table that any collection

2598
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
is going to be the best of uh

2599
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
pinball of all time really needs the adams family

2600
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
so we've been pushing really hard to get these licenses

2601
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
i seem to remember there was like

2602
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
a limited edition gold version

2603
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
or something of the adams family table as well

2604
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
is that all a part of this or just

2605
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
we're trying to just get the original classic table

2606
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
yeah the pinball

2607
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
of the adams family pinball

2608
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
machine did so well they came up with a limited

2609
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
edition um

2610
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
um there's a special ROM

2611
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
so some special rules were created

2612
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
and there's gold trim around them

2613
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
uh in the real world

2614
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
so we have the rights to

2615
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
recreate both so anyone who

2616
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
kick starts contributes

2617
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
um $100 or more will be

2618
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
a member of the gold club and be a gold

2619
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
backer and they'll get to

2620
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
play the gold edition in addition to the

2621
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
regular one oh very cool

2622
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
um do you have a particular favorite feature

2623
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
of the adams family table?

2624
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
um geez i like

2625
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
the mamushka i like

2626
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
how simple it is to understand that you're clearing

2627
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
out the rooms uh i like

2628
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
the flipper that's automatically you know

2629
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
working for you but the hand's really cool

2630
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
the thing

2631
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
um it was one of

2632
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
the first tables to have a DMD working

2633
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
so it's

2634
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
it's a really great presentation table

2635
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
it's just a lot of fun to play i just remember

2636
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
um really being drawn to it you know

2637
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
because this has probably been when the movie was out

2638
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
i was probably in about junior high or something when the movie

2639
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
came out and i just remembered like it tied in so well

2640
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
to the movie like i think a lot of other

2641
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
tables sometimes you can kind of

2642
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
like especially in gaming and video games in

2643
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
general you really feel like the movie or the game

2644
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
that goes with the add-on is such like a loose

2645
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
like a loose tie-in but this really felt

2646
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
like an extension of the movie to me

2647
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
right that's actually one of the reasons why we needed

2648
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
the paramount license because not only

2649
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
was it used in the adams family characters

2650
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
but they took actual script from the movie

2651
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
um they took story from the movie

2652
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
and built that into the pinball table machine

2653
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
design uh so it's one of the

2654
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
reasons why we had to get that license gotcha

2655
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
now i don't know if this is true or not but there were

2656
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
rumors circulating out there that

2657
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
the estate of rao julia was

2658
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
part of the holdout that the likeness

2659
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
was uh not wanting

2660
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
to be used has this all been resolved

2661
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
will we see rao julia in the game

2662
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
if if kickstarter yeah

2663
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
we have the likeness clearance and that's one of the

2664
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
the funds that we're trying to raise

2665
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
um so his widow was very

2666
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
um willing to work with us and

2667
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
we're very appreciative that we're able to use

2668
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
his likeness and i don't know

2669
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
if you know but his voice is used a lot

2670
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
in the table oh yeah the uh

2671
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
wms has a special audio recording with

2672
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
rao julia just for the pinball machine

2673
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
so it's

2674
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
it's a little over 100 wave files just

2675
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
his voice wow which is far

2676
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
more than any other character yeah you can't really

2677
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
talk about the mamushka without really hearing it in

2678
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
his voice the mamushka you know he's

2679
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
this very grandiose way of delivering

2680
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
lines right um

2681
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
now going going to the the

2682
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
pinball uh arcade collection

2683
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
in general um you know i

2684
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
i remember playing the

2685
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
i think you guys had a early version of this game

2686
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
on the we there wasn't there like a

2687
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
a pinball collection of some sort

2688
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
on the we as well right

2689
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
yeah we started doing pinball um table

2690
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
collections about 10 years ago and our

2691
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
first franchise was called the pinball hall of fame

2692
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
that's it yeah pinball hall of fame

2693
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
uh and we had the gotley collection and

2694
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
the williams collection and i think both of

2695
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
those made it to the we eventually

2696
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
i noticed you guys kind of

2697
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
really make it a point to have your game on a

2698
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
variety of systems i mean i could i could

2699
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
list where the pinball arcade is playable

2700
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
but it is literally everywhere from

2701
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
the playstation 4 to the uia

2702
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
and mobile phones many

2703
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
developers focus on one console

2704
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
plus steam or what have you

2705
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
why do you guys go for such that variety

2706
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
how how important is that for you

2707
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
well it's always been far

2708
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
sight bread and butter um you know

2709
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
the pinball arcade is our first

2710
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
published title that we've done ourselves publishing

2711
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
wise um with digital distribution

2712
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
as possible um but before

2713
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
that we were basically being contracted by publishers

2714
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
to make a game and one of the

2715
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
key selling points we had as a developer

2716
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
was that we could take a game and

2717
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
develop it on as many platforms as they wanted

2718
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
for very little incremental cost

2719
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
uh so we've carried over

2720
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
we have really good tools when it comes to cross platform

2721
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
development and since

2722
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
you know people want to play it on whatever device they have

2723
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
let's we felt that why not do

2724
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
it as long as there's a digital store

2725
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
to sell it to them we've

2726
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
created for them do you

2727
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
find that people tend to prefer

2728
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
like one over the other like

2729
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
mobile versus couch play

2730
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
on the playstation or do you

2731
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
do you kind of find that

2732
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
somebody who likes it one place might

2733
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
want to have all the versions that they have a

2734
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
something on the go and what have you

2735
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
yeah the bulk of our users just pick one

2736
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
um but we do have plenty of

2737
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
users who like will pick one console

2738
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
like one of the later consoles and our

2739
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
xbox one version um should be coming

2740
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
out here soon within a month or two

2741
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
um but most people want

2742
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
to have one mobile version and

2743
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
one not most people but our most

2744
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
hardcore fans will have one mobile version

2745
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
either the android or the ios

2746
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
and one home console

2747
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
and home console might be pc

2748
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
if you get to that home console of course

2749
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
um seems like most of the fans play it

2750
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
one one one device on the go

2751
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
and one device at home gotcha

2752
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
now um many pinball

2753
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
games i've played in the past like and i'm talking

2754
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
like pinball dreams on like

2755
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
nineties computers to other games today

2756
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
they're based off of new tables

2757
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
but you guys have really made it your

2758
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
thing to do pinball

2759
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
classics have you guys ever wanted

2760
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
to do an original table why do you

2761
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
stick to classics

2762
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
um well i can give you a whole

2763
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
history um back when

2764
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
we first started doing pinball machines the

2765
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
publisher crave actually asked us to

2766
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
create some original tables

2767
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
but i was um at the studio

2768
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
we had never done anything pinball related

2769
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
and even though we had some fans of

2770
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
pinball internally we weren't

2771
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
comfortable designing original tables

2772
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
so someone there at crave

2773
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
um bob bryant had the idea

2774
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
for us to license real tables

2775
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
and we create them because he's

2776
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
a huge fan of real pinball and wanted to play

2777
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
some of the favorite tables which he

2778
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
couldn't find anywhere right so that's really

2779
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
how it started so

2780
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
moving forward to today uh we

2781
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
actually have i don't know how much i

2782
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
can talk about this but we're

2783
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
working currently on an original table

2784
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
um and it should be

2785
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
coming out really soon

2786
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
um we're pretty excited about it

2787
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
and moving forward we actually

2788
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
have we're looking at some

2789
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
other license deals um to

2790
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
possibly uh include but these

2791
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
tables that we're going to be making are going to be

2792
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
powered with pinball arcade

2793
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
um they're going to be a you know separate

2794
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
you know standalone apps one at a time

2795
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
might have a link to the pinball arcade

2796
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
if you want to play some more pinball

2797
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
some more real pinball um

2798
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
but we're just starting to do it

2799
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
and there's a lot of people here internally since we've been

2800
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
making pinball for so long now

2801
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
and we've seen so many different designs come

2802
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
uh we've created

2803
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
and simulated that we are

2804
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
pretty excited here a lot of us

2805
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
to start making our own tables

2806
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
the first one that we're going to be doing is

2807
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
a relatively

2808
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
like a kind of like a stepping stone i guess

2809
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
we're taking an existing

2810
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
table and kind of modding it

2811
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
um because we're trying to get it

2812
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
out relatively fast

2813
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
but moving forward we've got a lot of ideas

2814
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
to do some more

2815
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
original table design and

2816
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
it seems like the

2817
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
the feeling here internally in the studio

2818
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
is to do

2819
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
tables that could exist in real life as opposed

2820
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
to the then approach which is

2821
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
make video gamey um

2822
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
pinball we're going to try to make tables

2823
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
that actually could really exist

2824
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
and make out our niche when it comes to original design

2825
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
you know and there are

2826
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
so few pinball machines

2827
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
that are really released every year now

2828
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
you know it's really you know ramped down in where we're at

2829
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
now so i mean it does feel like a natural

2830
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
progression that you know well these maybe these

2831
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
are the tables that they would be making if

2832
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
if you know there were uh

2833
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
as many physical pinball tables these days

2834
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
right right i mean

2835
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
there's two manufacturers still working

2836
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
um and maybe you know a couple more

2837
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
you know trying to get off the ground

2838
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
um but yeah zen's doing a pretty good

2839
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
job of licensing some cool properties

2840
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
and we hope to get in there too

2841
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
uh well best of luck with you guys

2842
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
uh in in that venture although i am

2843
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
going to hold out hope personally i know this might be a

2844
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
tricky one for you guys to get but that tron

2845
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
pinball table they just released is so rad

2846
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
i i really hope you

2847
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
guys can work something out with that

2848
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
yeah we have one really big fan

2849
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
of it here generally so we're

2850
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
we're working on that one it's a tough license

2851
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
all right i'm joining the club make that two fans

2852
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
all right uh now

2853
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
i'm sure a lot of people out there that are

2854
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
listening to this program they probably have downloaded

2855
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
the the free trials of pinball arcade

2856
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
that that come with uh

2857
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
one table right and they they wonder

2858
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
maybe i should go in and and buy

2859
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
another table but there's so many to choose

2860
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
from now i know this is a tough question

2861
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
but is is there one table out there

2862
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
in your collection that you think people

2863
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
need to play and check out like because maybe

2864
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
they don't have memories of it so you know

2865
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
it's one thing to kind of go in there like oh i got to get

2866
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
the star trek table because i'm a star trek fan but

2867
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
is is there something people might be missing

2868
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
like what is that one real

2869
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
hidden gem that people really need to

2870
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
check out in the collection

2871
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
yeah someone's not a big fan of

2872
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
real pinball they really should download the

2873
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
table pack one which is medieval madness

2874
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
and the pride of pinball because medieval

2875
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
madness is such a fun table

2876
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
so a lot of people's favorite table of all time

2877
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
um inside it's not a huge license

2878
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
you'll you know what's new to madness

2879
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
you won't even have heard of it if you're not into pinball

2880
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
right but it's it kind of has that money

2881
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
python feel for the comedy

2882
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
and it's really well designed

2883
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
it's just a really fun table our co-host

2884
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
our co-host dark soccer i believe

2885
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
had one of those in her house for for a while

2886
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
she had a bride of pinbot as well and that was

2887
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
that machine's a ton i actually pinbot is

2888
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
probably one of my i i will be honest

2889
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
adam's family is actually my favorite table of all

2890
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
time i have personally backed this kickstarter

2891
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
and i i really thank you yeah

2892
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
i really hope you guys get it uh but

2893
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
my second favorite is probably pinbot

2894
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
so you know i had to

2895
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
play the original pinbot or the bride of pinbot

2896
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
i prefer the original pinbot and part of

2897
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
that is probably my memories of the nes

2898
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
version as well which i know is like

2899
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
kind of wacky different but

2900
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
that was a little different but the physics

2901
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
weren't exactly yeah yeah

2902
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
as advanced as ours were they're 2d

2903
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
but it was it was fun it was really

2904
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
well done yeah when you're 10 years old you know

2905
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
you're not thinking about that stuff as much so it's

2906
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
you got a little more slack

2907
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
um i have another question here from our facebook

2908
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
community is the show where every gamer has

2909
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
a voice and we invited you guys to ask some questions

2910
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
and we had a derek over on our facebook community

2911
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
ask you about some very specific

2912
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
titles here so i don't even know if this is something you can

2913
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
you can comment on but uh when will

2914
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
raven hollywood heat and last

2915
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
action hero be released are there

2916
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
i and especially i look at last action hero

2917
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
and i kind of go okay so there's there's obviously some

2918
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
other big properties out there that people have

2919
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
their eye on are there other properties

2920
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
you guys are hoping to bring over that you have

2921
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
your eye on that you might kick start next

2922
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
um sure and actually i think

2923
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
i've already mentioned that

2924
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
um last action hero is

2925
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
one that we do have our eye on

2926
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
and we already have arnold's

2927
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
likeness um for terminator 2

2928
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
so that one is

2929
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
very possible the other two are tables

2930
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
i'm aware of um i can't say

2931
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
that they're in any short term plans

2932
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
but there are some good picks

2933
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
alright well uh

2934
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
thank you so much for joining us today bobby

i really appreciate it um before i let you

2936
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
go though there's a question we always

2937
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
ask the people who come on our show and that

2938
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
is what types of video games have you

2939
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
been playing this week and no fair naming

2940
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
your own games i know you gotta do

2941
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
a lot of plenty of those but what other video games

2942
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
are you playing lately

2943
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
um

2944
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000

2945
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
the only game i played this week is candy crush

2946
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
so you're the one

2947
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
keeping that game going

2948
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
i'm just teasing

2949
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000

2950
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
so like when i release more levels

ssga100matt saying at least

3011
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
in some way pinball machines will continue

3012
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
to exist the machines themselves

3013
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
and the parts might die out but at

3014
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
least they're archived this way

3015
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
so yeah that that's a very

3016
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
good way of looking at it and fifth dream

3017
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
says uh sky donated himself that's

3018
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
worth at least two tables yeah i

3019
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
yes i did donate myself

3020
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
uh and i i can't wait to

3021
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
uh play it again it looks looking very favorable that

3022
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
they'll make it now i just have to figure out which

3023
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
platform i'll get it on but probably

3024
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
playstation 4 because i have

3025
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000

01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
elvira tables are on playstation 4

3027

it's got padding and it's not

3043
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
wood so yeah it's it's a lot more

3044
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
comfy than the uh other chair over there and of course

3045
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
loki's still here with us yeah

3046
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
half partially because he's he's kind of

3047
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
engrossed in clicker heroes

3048
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
yeah there's no there's

3049
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
literally no point to me playing

3050
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
this right now and yet

3051
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
i am yeah that's well i'm not really

3052
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
playing it i'm just mainly saying levels

3053
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
done next levels done next

3054
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
that's me and diablo 3

3055
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
i mean

3056
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
i was just watching that game it

3057
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
looked like just stuff was falling from the sky and landing on the

3058
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
ground it's because my characters do so

3059
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
much damage that it kills them instantly

3060
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
there it is instant kill because i cheated

3061
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
because i didn't want to play this game and i

3062
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
thought hey if i cheated it would be

3063
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
it would be over faster you oh my

3064
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
god loki can't even play clicker

3065
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
heroes the right way he's got to cheat in

3066
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
that too i did play i hope you were

3067
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
putting cheat codes into your game

3068
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
or you know heaven help you when

3069
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000

3072
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
yeah i bet i bet we'll see how that goes all right

3073
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
uh hey i've gotten to the point now where

3074
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
stuff isn't dying instantly so that's

3075
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
that's good right before we get into

3076
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000

01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
saturday sunday that's in reno nevada

3087
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
oh yeah we're looking forward to that but earlier

3088
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
uh coming up this october the 10th we

3089
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
uh i myself had started

3090
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
up along with the group uh something called the

3091
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
ex games series

3092
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
uh it's something that we started a long time ago

3093
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
it's our locals here in sacramento

3094
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
and we really wanted to jump start that again

3095
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
and we uh somebody uh

3096
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
close by to uh where one of

3097
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
one of our staffers lives including me

3098
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
uh was a comic store that decided to

3099
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
help us out with their venue and allow us

3100
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
to jump start it right there and that was for

3101
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
uh flash flashback comics

3102
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
and collectibles nice yeah

3103
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
it's over by uh pretty much in antelope

3104
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
between antelope and north highlands

3105
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
so that won't do like our british listeners

3106
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
a lot of good probably to hear that but we do have some

3107
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
local folks here in california

3108
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
that might be able to stop by and check that out

3109
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
yeah they're already getting the word and people are just

3110
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
perking their ears up and saying what

3111
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
antelope what's over

3112
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
there and uh

3113
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
is that an animal?

3114
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
deer caught in the headlights

3115
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
sadly you do not find many antelope in

3116
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
antelope that's right that's right but you can

3117

that is simple to play but has but the in depth

3171
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000

01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
good because nobody likes jerks

3177
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000

3178
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
in fighting but really in any even when

3179

speaking of

3190
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000

3192
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000

3193
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
indirectly met each other and stuff

3194
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
for a tournament that we actually hosted in sacramento

3195
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000

island tournament oh it's awesome

3199
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000

01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
they wanted me to run a tournament

3201
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000

not in that fashion but

3206
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
we crossed streams

3207
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
don't cross the streams

3208
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000

3209
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000

3210
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000

3227
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
speaking of

3228
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
games for those

3229
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
those who are going to pacific media expo

3230
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
next month november

3231
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
i think it's like november

3232
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
i think it's 7th or 9th it's just a friday through sunday

3233
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
they are actually hosting the united

3234
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
states pump it up festival

3235
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
the u.s championships

3236
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
for pump it up

3237
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
and that's that's still a big thing too

3238
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
um u.s it's really hard to say if

3239
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
it's still big but i know in countries

3240
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
like mexico and south america that's still

3241
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
really big people keep forgetting

3242
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
that

3243
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
from that that said that the country they still play

3244
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
a lot maybe a few koreans and stuff but

3245
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
because some koreans still play

3246
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
because they still want to compete with um the

3247
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
competition i heard i heard pump was like

3248
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
still really huge in latin america so that's

3249
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
okay that makes a lot of sense are they the ones that took it

3250
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
away from korea um that was

3251
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
years ago when when they had the rule of no

3252
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
bar when they had the when

3253
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
when they actually started allowing bar i think

3254
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
that the competition started being a little bit

3255
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
more even not i'm saying anything

3256
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
bad about those who actually use the bar or not

3257
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
but that's been that's yeah again let's

3258
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
leave the drama from 10 years ago

3259
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
but again that's what that was a shift

3260
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
change of what statistics were showing

3261
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
during who is the top players

3262
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
but actually still mexico is still

3263
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
on the top 10 in terms of not tournaments

3264
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
but actual just um actually um

3265
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
act out one of our mexican listeners

3266
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
in chat saying yeah pump it up is still big here

3267
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
so very cool so i think

3268
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
the rankings are still top 10

3269
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
for just regular players

3270
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
for pump it up fiesta too

3271
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
all right so yep there is

3272
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
a united states championships coming

3273
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
up up on and it's supposed to be three

3274
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
times bigger than last year when they had

01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000

3276
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
for the first time at a convention

3277
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000

3278
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000

from broad cities

3364
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
it's a pretty diverse cast list so yeah

3365
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
it's pretty awesome considering i don't know

3366
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
them it looks neat

3367
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
in the picture at least

3368
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
i mean it looks like it's gonna be pretty high

3369
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
but i i don't know i just can't see what

3370
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
the plot's gonna be but you know what fuck i couldn't

3371
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
imagine what a lego movie was gonna be like and that

3372
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
ended up being pretty awesome so whatever

3373
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
true it's all good but are we gonna see

3374
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
like now anger birds the movie the game

3375
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
i mean cause you know

3376
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
is it gonna come full full circle again

3377
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
why not street further movie

3378
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
the game why not with the

3379
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
fighting game so

3380
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
i'd play that

3381
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
i at least try it

3382
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
once i mean cause it's something else

3383
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
it sounds like it'd be pretty cool

3384
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
uh this is kind of a neat little thing

3385
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
that they're adding to the halo master chief

3386
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
collection halo one and two

3387
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000

01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
versions of the game and those

3389
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000

01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
some pc exclusive weapons

3409
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
like i guess a flamethrower and they had a

3410
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
fuel rod gun or it's supposed to be coming

3411
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
um or you can filter

3412
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
them out because they're allowing you to

3413
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
do that kind of thing boy they're really trying to make this

3414
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
like the definitive halo aren't

3415
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000

3416
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000

3417
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
hey you know what this was a pretty cool

3418
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
game on uya although i didn't get it

3419
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
at the time because i was playing like a very very

3420
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
early version of it but one of the

3421
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
best games i guess on uya and

3422
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
it was at least one i had one

3423
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
was amazing frog it was a game where

3424
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
you just kind of hurt yourself as

3425
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
a frog bouncing off different

3426
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
things and stuff like that and it was only on uya but now

3427
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
now it's going to be coming

3428
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
to steam so you

3429
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
can check it out and they've got all sorts of

3430
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
fun stuff in there i guess it's actually

3431
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
it reminds me a lot of goat simulator it

3432
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
is like goat sim it is

3433
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
and they're going to have you know different

3434
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
um four player split

3435
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
screen um and all sorts of different

3436
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
other modes in there um

3437
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
so you know what i

3438
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
checked it out i'm going to have to

3439
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
check it out when it comes out

3440
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
alright well uh loki i think

3441
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
this is another game that really sounds like it's up your alley

3442
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
and it was something that was on kick

3443
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
starter and it made its goal

3444
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
and it's trinket games developing this

3445
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
it's called battle chef brigade

3446
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
just imagine like iron chef

3447
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
or top chef like what are those like

3448
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
iron chef the anime is pretty much

3449
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
it's like one of those epic cooking games like this is

3450
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
like hardcore cooking mama

3451
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
this is like cooking mama could be an iron

3452
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
chef in the same way like if you watch the trailer video

3453
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
that's on their kickstarter page it even opens

3454
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
like iron chef with the

3455
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
chairman eating a pepper

3456
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
that's awesome that's amazing oh actually

3457
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
uh the kickstarter is still going

3458
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
it already made it's 38,000 but the

3459
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000

3461
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
for the pc mac and

3462
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
linux yeah holy crap that's a long time

3463
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
yeah they're at 54,000

3464
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
uh right now of their 38,000 goal

3465
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000

3466
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
very well it looks awesome

3467
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
it's like yeah

3468
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
one part like cookie mama and then you

3469
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
have to hunt monsters and you get

3470
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
like resources from those monsters

3471
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
and uh it's

3472
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
definitely unique

3473
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
uh i love this their next stretch goal

3474
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
at 56,000 which they'll make

3475
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
is uh summons call forth

3476
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
incredible beings with powerful

3477
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
spells similar to final fantasy tactics

3478
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
what this is a fucking cooking game and

3479
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
you're gonna like summon shiva like

3480
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
instead of sick sticking it in the freezer it's like

3481
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
oh shiva get over here and snap i think

3482
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
though if they want to be really kind of cool

3483
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
with that they should like kind of

3484
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
combine both like final fantasy

3485
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
summons and like

3486
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
you know peeps chefs from

3487
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
iron chef in there like you know

3488
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
not that i want to give the example of bobby flay

3489
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000

3491
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000

okay cat core and shiva you know together

3493
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
or something like that they're like

3494
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
materia it's like spices

3495
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
recipes or something and and then like

3496
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
it all's like you you don't summon fourth

3497
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
you cook fourth and they get summoned and they do

3498
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
something or i don't know like a

3499
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
something crazy like that i need someone

3500
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
to slice these carrots oh let me summon

3501
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
there's a guy on there summon knights of the round

3502
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
and then you'll afk in 30 minutes if you read

3503
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
all the like different you know

3504
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
um descriptions of the characters there's a

3505
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
guy that's an undead zombie guy and he's able

3506
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
to summon forth like

3507
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
the undead and skeletons and stuff to

3508
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
help him cook devil's food cake

3509
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
it's pretty awesome i i don't know

3510
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
it just sounds like a ridiculous

3511
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
premise for a game but it

3512
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
also would i could totally say this being

3513
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
like an anime uh dart tatsumi in

3514
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
chat says that reminds me of trauma center

3515
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
the one on the wii where you could draw symbols

3516
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
during the operation to do spells and shit

3517
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
actually yeah kind of sounds like that

3518
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
with cooking let's examine some of the

3519
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
other stretch goals they've hit uh

02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
jungle a new steamy overgrown

3521

biome for you to hunt in oh

3522
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
because i guess you have to hunt your food before you cook it

3523
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
uh caverns where you catch bizarre

3524
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000

02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
with this you know get him in on the action because i bet

3537
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
you do it how about barefoot

3538
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Contessa i would like to see

3539
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000

3540
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
no she's

3541
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
controversial remember she's a little too controversial

3542
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
alright anyway uh

3543
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
also controversial could be

3544
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
video game movies that don't turn out so

3545
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
great so we're hoping dead rising

3546
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
turns out alright there's a dead rising digital

3547
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
film of course in production we've talked about it

3548
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
before but we have uh

3549
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
some more updates on what's going on

3550
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
and this is according to

3551
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
director zach

3552
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
libofsky sorry if i'm saying that wrong

3553
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
but that there will be familiar faces

3554
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
uh and i can't reveal too

3555
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
much but the character has covered wars

3556
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
you know which might be a tease that frank

3557
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
west is somehow in it he also

3558
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
uh described the movie as

3559
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
indiana jones with zombies

3560
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
well now that's a i better see some

3561
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
face melting if you're gonna use that comparison

3562
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
there so we'll see what happens there

3563
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
uh pretty much every person

3564
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
i know has already emailed me saying they want

3565
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
to be a zombie so i think we'll be fine

3566
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
it's like shot in the dead with zombies

3567
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
we're also planning a long one take

3568
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
action shot with hundreds of zombies

3569
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
which i'm very excited about online there's

3570
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
no ratings board there's no run time

3571
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
limit there are no rules

3572
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
this is an experiment for legendary and they've been

3573
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
very incredibly willing to take creative

3574
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
risks now i know that they were against our

3575
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
hardcore pornography

3576
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
zombie scene but there's no rules

3577
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
online this sounds like the type

3578
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
of movie that i'm gonna show my mom and you know

3579
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
i'm gonna say rob

3580
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
that is gross that is a

3581
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
gross movie um

3582
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
i don't know if she'd think this is gross

3583
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
because this seemed like it was more cartoon violence

3584
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
in these games but uh too bad dark

3585
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
soccer is still not here because i bet she'd be excited to know

3586
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
that strider 2

3587
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
that's right the uh arcade side

3588
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
scroller strider 2 will be on the

3589
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
playstation network uh coming out

3590
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
i believe october 7th

3591
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
is the big day that's available

3592
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
uh this is the arcade game from

3593
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
1999 and uh

3594
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
yeah very cool this is uh the ps1

3595
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
version of strider 2 also came

3596
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
with 1989's

3597
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
strider so that will be bundled then

3598
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
with the download so you get strider 1 and

3599
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
strider 2 originally on the playstation

3600
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
1 did they release that

3601
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
strider game that came out on the consoles

3602
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
like the new one on pc

3603
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000

3604
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
they did i believe it is on steam

3605
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
i could be wrong i could be wrong

3606
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000

02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
pinball games for pc or console

3657
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000

02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
the star trek next generation one having two

3659
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000

febreeze a over on facebook

3663
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
answers this question i played a fair

3664
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
share of pinball tables but never had the

3665
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
opportunity to spend enough time with them

3666
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
my local had two well maintained

3667
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
tables the adams family

3668
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
and playboy i forgot

3669
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
playboy had a table playboy

3670
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
table is gone now but i play the adams

3671
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
family every month it's the best

3672
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
machine i've ever played it never bores me

3673
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
on the digital side i like zen pinball the most

3674
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
motley crew on mega drive was cool too

3675
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
this answer reminded me we used to have an arcade

3676
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
that had the guns and roses pinball table

3677
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
that machine was the shit i wish that was

3678
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
one that they could pour it over where the little

3679
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
plunger was actually a big rose that you'd pull

3680
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
that was awesome

3681
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
and i played this wasn't that scandia

3682
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
uh they they might have one

3683
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
scandia but there used to be a little arcade in

3684
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
roseville where i grew up and i think it was

3685
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
supercade was what it was called and they had one

3686
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
there and they actually had the playboy table there

3687
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
too so i've actually played that game before i don't know why i was thinking

3688
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
the birdcage but that could have been something else

3689
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
it probably was back when birdcage had a

3690
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
i wish they had more nickel arcades

3691
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
the last nickel arcade

3692
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
we had was in downtown

3693
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
sacramento but that shut down like a year

3694
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
2001

3695
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
fyi wow that was a long

3696
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
time ago alright moving over to emily c

02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
different tables the actual table i love

3699

3700
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
theme here it was always very

3701
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
entertaining and challenging to me today it would

3702
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
suck the quarters out of my pockets as soon as i

3703
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
enter the room with one digitally i

3704
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
fell in love with pokemon pinball

02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
table is one of my favorites and farsight studios

3721
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
does a really good job recreating it

3722
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
i play the pinball arcade almost every time i

3723
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
turn on my playstation 3 well they'll be happy to hear

3724
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000

that's a local arcade apparently i put

3729
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
a ton of time in on that machine and on the nes

3730
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000

yeah sorry does that like a quote

3751
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
nuke on the pinball side but i played

3752
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
a couple people i keep forgetting names um

3753
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
is it the adams family the one where you have to

3754
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
like cycle cycle and

3755
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
charge the ball okay the here's the

3756
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
crazy thing they had an adams family

3757
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
thing that was like prop cycle

3758
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
meets adams family so somebody

3759
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
actually made that but that isn't

3760
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
officially the game oh okay i was like

3761
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
wait i've seen that before i was like wait is

3762
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
it what i thought it was yeah

3763
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
no when they when they uh poured it over

3764
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
i don't believe prop cycle will be involved

3765
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
i don't remember

3766
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
that i've never played that

3767
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
where they have the prop cycle thing yeah

3768
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
jamie knows i know they had that in california

3769
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
extreme at one point yeah yeah that's probably where

3770
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
she saw it yeah and i remember seeing

3771
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
that in reno at the time like when i was like

3772
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
it was like 15 years ago when i was playing

3773
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
where they had some really good

3774
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
pinball machines like um

3775
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
i noticed they had a street fighter one which is pretty fun

3776
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
oh yeah yeah it was a street fighter pinball

3777
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
and yeah but i just forget the names

3778
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
of it because all the people at first looked the same

3779
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
but they're actually it's pretty fun just

3780
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
forgetting the names of the problem sure sure as

3781
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
i said earlier i i'm definitely a fan

3782
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
of that pokemon pinball that

3783
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
was definitely addicting for a while and

3784
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
um at one point there was a back to the

3785
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
future pinball uh yes there was yeah i

3786
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
was kind of interested in that too that back to the future one

3787
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
and uh

3788
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
other than that i can't really recall anymore but

3789
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
i remember some some different ones that

3790
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
we did at like i mentioned the bird cage earlier

3791
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
because my brother would always drag me out there and some

3792
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
there was always like pinball machines all over the place because

3793
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
he's twice my age and all that so

3794
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
he'd always pull me aside and say

3795
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
we're gonna have fun and play some real video games

3796
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
and i'm glad i'm grateful for

3797
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
him for doing that because otherwise i wouldn't have

3798
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
you know touched all those fields right

3799
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
right yeah but it was fun definitely it was very addicting

3800
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
yeah definitely uh i see a lot of

3801
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
uh comments in our chat room talking about sonic

3802
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
spinball um another you know

3803
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
pinball video game oh god

3804
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
sonic spinball was so different though because like

3805
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
you you could kind of move

3806
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
sonic like if you weren't

3807
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
doing right like you could like jump up

3808
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
it's not real it's it's a combination

3809
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
of yeah it's like a combo

3810
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
it's like pinball quest or something

3811
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
and then the faces

3812
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
of that is kind of bs at some points

3813
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
yeah it is remember metroid pinball

3814
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
i do it was the

3815
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
first game well it was yeah it came

3816
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
with the rumble thing yeah good times

3817
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
alright thank you guys for answering our

3818
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
fugo question of the week we're gonna get back into

3819
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
some other news loki

3820
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
alright um so this is kind of

3821
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
neat uh playstation well it's

3822
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
not neat it kind of sucks actually uh

3823
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
thankfully it's not

3824
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
gonna be here uh but they're increasing the price

3825
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
of playstation plus for certain regions

3826
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
um not in north

3827
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
america though but in south america ukraine

3828
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
russia turkey and india

3829
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
regions um they're increasing

3830
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
the price because of various market

3831
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
conditions and of course

3832
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
they go on to reiterate again that this is

3833
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
not happening in north america

3834
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
um so

3835
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
i don't know

3836
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
it kind of sucks i guess for those

3837
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
regions that it's going up in price

3838
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
um i don't

3839
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
know if you can buy cards elsewhere

3840
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
in redeemum i don't think you can

3841
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
so

3842
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
um hmm

3843
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
oh well

3844
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
um i guess it is neat

3845
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
that we're not gonna get a price increase here

3846
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
at least yet yeah that would be something

3847
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
they sneak in after the holiday or something

3848
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
quote yet right

3849
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
yeah and unfortunately it's already happened

3850
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
uh on october

3851
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
first um

3852
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
so well that kind of sucks

3853
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
oh my god if they do like a crazy black

3854
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
friday deal again this year something like it remember

3855
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
last year they had like an insanely good black

3856
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
friday deal i don't know if they do black friday

3857
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
stuff in other countries like that but you know

3858
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
what um keep an eye out

3859
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
uh i guess in other regions because

3860
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
i'm sure that there's places

3861
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
where you can buy cards like that

3862
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
um they mark down the price

3863
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
and maybe you can get one for your region that's

3864
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
cheaper than what they're gonna

3865
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
you know do for

3866
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
it probably smart that they aren't

3867
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
doing that for north america because i think people would pitch

3868
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
a fit you know about it

3869
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
um especially that or like japan or

3870
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
something like that i think they would pitch a fit

3871
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
um about those

3872
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
prices going up and you know microsoft

3873
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
i'm sure get on board and say hey

3874
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
you know even though theirs is

3875
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
more expensive but i

3876
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
don't know it's still you don't want to raise

3877
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
prices out of the fact all right well let's

3878
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
hope they don't decide to do the same thing unless

3879
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
you know they're throwing in

3880
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
some features or something that makes

3881
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
the games they give away are pretty darn good though

3882
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
you gotta admit i mean playstation plus is

3883
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
a really great here's what i would like is you know

3884
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
maybe all those games that i

3885
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
have in my library if i could

3886
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
you know stream this that would be great

3887
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
i would love that yeah we should

3888
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
get that with like playstation plus or whatever

3889
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
where the ps1 games we bought should be

3890
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
streamable on ps4 when they get the

3891
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
ps1 and ps2 stuff working but hopefully

3892
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
that's sooner rather than later right or even like playstation

3893
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
3 stuff i mean there's stuff i have in my

3894
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
library that true that'd be nice

3895
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
true very true all right

3896
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
let's move on to talk about a new feature

3897
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
coming to the 3ds

3898
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
and uh we don't know when but it'll be sometime

3899
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
in this next month nintendo is going to be releasing

3900
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
a firmware update for the 3ds

3901
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
that will allow themes you

3902
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
know because speaking of playstation

3903
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
this is something that is on the playstation

3904
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
uh three at least and we know it's coming

3905
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
to the four and they can

3906
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
sell themes and make money off them

3907
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
so why not on the 3ds as well

3908
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
especially we're talking about with these new 3ds

3909
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
you can have all these like interchangeable face plates

3910
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
so you can have like 3ds that match your shoes

3911
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
well now why not the why not the

3912
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
internal theme yeah they're gonna have the themes that match

3913
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
those the face plates exactly

3914
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
so 50 themes gonna be

3915
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
offered in japan at the launch including

3916
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
a few from third parties

3917
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
they'll be like a monster hunter theme is apparently

3918
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
one of the things uh

3919
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
now here's the thing they're not gonna be free but they're

3920
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
priced at around either 100 or

3921
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
200 yen depending on what it is

3922
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
that's a buck or two roughly

3923
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
so they're gonna be cheap

3924
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
but that's still money for a theme

3925
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
but still though they charge money for themes

3926
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
um yeah if some were free

3927
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
that's cool if they do they have

3928
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
simple color set and simple

3929
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
clear color set are free

3930
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
oh color set

3931
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
fancy

3932
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
but if you want to get something

3933
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000

i eat like three plates of food and i burn it out

4099
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
like it's not a video game

online educational game galaxies

4220
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
on the show yesterday and

4221
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
the studio seemed very positive about it

4222
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
as someone who lives with someone who works

4223
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
on the game i hear firsthand every

4224
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
single day about how the ceo has no idea

4225
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
what he's doing has never made a game before

4226
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
and ignores the advice criticism and

4227
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
general sense from his entire team

4228
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
oh boy this

4229
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
is well we're getting some some

4230
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
tea spill on this one aren't we trying to

4231
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
relax these yeah it's that educational game

4232
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
we talked about a little bit last week now i just want to say

4233
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
i'm just going to put disclaimer out here because i just

4234
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
want to make sure the opinion that i'm reading

4235
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
here is the opinion of the listener and does not

4236
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
necessarily reflect that i'm just going to make

4237
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
because this is this sounds like some pretty

4238
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
this is some gossip so get your coffee

4239
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
and uh let's see see some more here

4240
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
on the email here um

4241
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
continuing on the email

4242
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
he will ask for mini games to be coded

4243
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
in a single day and then ask why

4244
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
there are bugs in it he tells people that they

4245
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
should work on the weekends because that's what successful

4246
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
companies do and he once hired an incompetent

4247
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
socially inept crybaby programmer

4248
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
while his lead programmer was out on

4249
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
maternity leave even though he the CEO

4250
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
doesn't know the first thing about programming or making a game

4251
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
he also told his team

4252
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
when they asked for dedicated QA staff

4253
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
so they could focus on building of the game that

4254
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
quote there's no reason why all of us can't

4255
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
QA our own work 100% of the time

4256
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
then he finally caved

4257
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
and said i think i have a 9 year old

4258
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
nephew who can QA this game for us

4259
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
oh boy uh finally i've played

4260
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
the game in various stages of completion

4261
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
and i can assure you that as an engineer

4262
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
who grew up playing educational games

4263
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
the game is pretty pitifully simple

4264
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
in terms of science concepts even

4265
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
compared to some educational games from the 90s

4266
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
and the mini games themselves take

4267
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
some creative liberties with how scientifically

4268
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
accurate they are i'll be surprised

4269
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
if the game ever ships and i'm pretty willing to

4270
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
bet that if it does ship it'll be about as good

4271
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
as the Duke Nukem forever of educational

4272
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
games wow my jaw is on the floor

4273
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
with like the fucking like reading to

4274
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
filth going on in this mail

4275
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
just thought you guys deserved

4276
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
a more accurate picture of the game

4277
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
than the PR spin the New York Science

4278
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Foundation puts on it because

4279
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
i think they're going to be pretty disappointed with the game

4280
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
if and when it actually does

4281
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
ship yours truly

4282
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
AZHP

4283
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
DAMN

4284
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
well uh

4285
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
i guess the only way to truly find

4286
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
out is to try the game for yourself once

4287
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
it comes out but that is um

4288
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
you know what let me say this

4289
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
let me try to pull

4290
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
what i possibly can out of this

4291
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
especially what it can apply to other stuff

4292
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
in the industry is that you know

4293
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
it does go to show that sometimes

4294
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
we get the feeling and i

4295
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
i don't know this guy and i don't know

4296
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
this company and i don't know you know

4297
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
the CEO or whatever but i have

4298
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
heard stories from other places about

4299
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
people in middle management at some of these

4300
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
companies who really don't seem to know

4301
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
a fucking thing about video games

4302
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
and the impression i'm getting

4303
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
from this email which you know again

4304
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
is i

4305
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
i can't endorse it officially

4306
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
but i can take it at face value

4307
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
i have heard from this listener before

4308
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
and they write pretty good emails

4309
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
i'm inclined to kind of go

4310
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
oh shit where there's smoke there's fire

4311
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
type of thing right so

4312
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
i mean we've heard about where people

4313
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
sometimes who are in the

4314
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
middle in the management so forth

4315
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
kind of don't seem to know what they're doing sometimes

4316
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
like and i get worried when i read that

4317
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
stuff about QA i think i have a

4318
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
9 year old nephew who can QA this game

4319
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
for us that's not QA

4320
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
that's like test marketing

4321
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
or you know because obviously if it's an

4322
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
educational game then fine 9 year olds who

4323
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
the game's targeting but that's that's not QA

4324
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
a 9 year old is not going to explore

4325
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
every single nook

4326
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
and cranny of the game to intentionally

4327
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
try to destroy it

4328
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
a 9 year old doesn't have that type of attention

4329
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
span that's your focus group

4330
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
that's your test audience that's not QA

4331
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
so

4332
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
that right there i kind of go uh oh

4333
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
jonas you're

4334
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
kind of sitting back here going

4335
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
i heard about like

4336
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
the email dimension i think did it mention that

4337
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
something about working like

4338
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
weekends and all that other stuff

4339
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
oh yeah oh yeah you can't just mimic what

4340
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
other companies do for your own success you got to figure it out

4341
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
yourself oh yeah yeah i thought there were

4342
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
laws like actually against that ever since the whole

4343
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
ea incident like not if your

4344
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
contractor whatever i mean you can

4345
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
i think they can make up their own

4346
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
like rules

4347
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
you know when i heard that i was like

4348
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
oh shit we're going back to the what caught

4349
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
ea into a big strangle

4350
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
of legal situations

4351
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
and i'm not sure if it's a repeat of

4352
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
that a lot of

4353
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
reaction in our chat room i mean there's just a lot

4354
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
of people going wow wow wow

4355
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
like it looks like we have a bunch of doge in our chat

4356
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
room right now wow wow such wow

4357
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
much anger wow but see we have

4358
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
bochi kawa says

4359
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
someone had a little bit of pent up aggression although i

4360
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
can believe all of it which is terrible

4361
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
dungeon buster says sadly it's a story that

4362
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
i've read too often about a few other

4363
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
companies it's not crunch it's over

4364
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
time we just won't be paying you over time

4365
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
and ssj100 matt says plenty

4366
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
of companies pull shady shit

4367
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
the stories i could tell you

4368
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
that is true this isn't necessarily something

4369
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
and i don't know if ssj100 matt

4370
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
meant gaming companies or when

4371
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
he says plenty of companies he means like

4372
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
companies all over like not just

4373
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
necessarily

4374
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
video games and i would

4375
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
believe it i believe there's a lot more industries

4376
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
than just video games where this kind of fuckery goes

4377
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
on so

4378
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
a burnt out employee

4379
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
is not a happy employee and a happy employee

4380
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
is going to or an unhappy

4381
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
employee excuse me is bound to make more

4382
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
bugs whether they want to or not that

4383
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
a nine year old is not going to find in the game just

4384
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
saying so you better

4385
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
find that right balance so

4386
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
yikes well you know what um

4387
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
although i hope that doesn't

4388
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
start too much controversy if anyone

4389
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
from that team happens to be

4390
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
listening feels differently

4391
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000

02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
that last email sure does make a good

4402
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
transition into one of our regular segments we do here

4403
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
on the show it is the FUs

4404
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
of the week

4405
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
uh Loki we'll start with you

4406
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
uh i feel the power outages because we keep

4407
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
having them for some reason i think

4408
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
someone ran into a power pole or something

4409
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
i don't know because i saw them fixing

4410
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
it the day after but we also had one this morning

4411
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
for no apparent reason and the thing

4412
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
it sucks is it shuts off you know

4413
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
the lights and the fans during the night

4414
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
you know that my son uses

4415
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
to keep himself asleep

4416
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
because he likes white noise and then

4417
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
everybody's up you know

4418
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
instead of us being able to sleep through

4419
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
the night so that kind of sucks

4420
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
i wish they would just fix that shit

4421
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
oh and and their ever helpful

4422
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
phone call which i don't even know how the

4423
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
hell they have my number anyways but

4424
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
they called me like an hour

4425
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
after the power outage was done

4426
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
like there's been a power outage

4427
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
i'm like no fucking shit really

4428
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
that was all the things turning off

4429
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
was that what that was i thought it was a ghost

4430
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
i mean seriously thank you

4431
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
smud for fucking calling

4432
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
me and telling me there was a fucking

4433
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
power outage like i couldn't fucking figure that out

4434
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
um i want to give an FU to

4435
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
destiny for not giving me better loot

4436
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
because i'd really like to level up past level 21

4437
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
so uh FU

4438
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
you crap loot system

4439
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
uh and uh let's see

4440
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
i guess my other FU of the week goes to

4441
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
just being like really busy

4442
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
and tired i mean it's a good busy i can't

4443
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
complain but i'm just i'm

4444
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
probably spreading myself too thin again

4445
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
but um yeah

4446
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
there you go

4447
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
real quick about destiny

4448
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
if i played that say in the xbox 360

4449
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
would my character level up and like

4450
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
if i bought that on playstation 4

4451
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
or does that only work for playstation 3 to playstation 4

4452
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
only works i believe from 3 to 4

4453
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
i do not believe it works the other way around

4454
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
but check the bungee forums just to see

4455
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
uh jonas my friend

4456
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
how about you

4457
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
uh big FU to the

4458
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
whiners of people on facebook saying

4459
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
oh they're changing the name policy where people can put

4460
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
fake names this is by the way

4461
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
in response to like the LGBT community

4462
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
who's actually like drag queens

4463
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
trying to protect themselves

4464
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
and you're telling me that

4465
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
and people are telling me uh

4466
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
that they have to put

4467
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
their real names

4468
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
so what's gonna happen with the protection of um

4469
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
the um the drag queens and all the

4470
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
LGBT trying to keep themselves in the sequence

4471
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
i'm not saying anything bad but people

4472
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
are not understanding the situation right

4473
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
i use a fake name on facebook and it's because

4474
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
um i have had situations

4475
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
where in my professional life i've had

4476
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
people try to look me up online

4477
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
and they have found things

4478
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
in my past that they then

4479
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
would bring up in the workplace

4480
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
which is not appropriate you know what i mean

4481
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
so i keep my life separate

4482
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
so i have every right to do that

4483
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
and what really pissed me off

4484
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
in that whole thing and so FU

4485
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
to Mark Zuckerberg because he said

4486
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
something where people who don't use their real name

4487
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
don't have integrity fuck

4488
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
you for that comment

4489
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
fuck you because you obviously

4490
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
don't know what it's like to have a stalker

4491
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
so be seated

4492
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
have 50 seats

4493
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
the funny thing is that one of the main people on facebook

4494
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
said they're gonna change that policy so

4495
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
expect actual people

4496
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
i know they will they're gonna change it

4497
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
cuz you know they got pre- don't fuck with

4498
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
drag queens that's like one of the first rule

4499
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
of the cosmos and i realize this effect

4500
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
far more than just drag queens

4501
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
but the drag queens are the ones that are gonna throw

4502
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
the first rock

4503
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
alright anyways back

4504
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000

to hey let's slice this tetris

4591
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
and make it into a sci-fi movie

4592
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000

moral combat moral combat annihilation

4594
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
now to be fair the moral combat movies were good

4595
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
but i don't know how the fuck they're gonna

4596
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000

02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
we have a story behind

4613
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
tetris which makes it much more

4614
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
an imaginative thing yes i remember battleship

4615
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
2 that wasn't a very good movie

4616
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
ok but if they don't

4617
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
have like kmfdm are they

4618
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
still around but if they if they don't have like

4619
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
kmfdm or some type of industrial band

4620
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
doing a remix of

4621
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
if they don't have

4622
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
like the industrial yes

4623
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
we need the rom zobby version

4624
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
of that

4625
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
heavy metal that's what we need

4626
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
like during a big action scene

4627
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
imagine tetris the movie

4628
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
i'm sorry it's it's a puzzle

4629
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
game you can't fucking make

4630
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
movies out of puzzle games

4631
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
it doesn't fucking work

4632
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
unless i do something really fucked up

4633
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
it's gonna be and if it does work

4634
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
oh my god can you imagine all the knockoffs we're gonna get

4635
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
then it's gonna be like sudoku

4636
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
the mini series on television

4637
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
scrabble that yeah

4638
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
right then it's like scrabble

4639
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
the you know the sitcom

4640
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
coming to cbs i think that

4641
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
the farthest you can go

4642
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
to make a movie is based off of

4643
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
a board game maybe and

4644
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
that's where clue was clue was good

4645
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
cult classic right was it

4646
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
they're doing one for well they did

4647
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
witch port but now they have an ouija movie as well

4648
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
what i mean come on that's just a fucking paranormal movie

4649
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
um they had

4650
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
jumanji which technically wasn't a board game

4651
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
but it was you know based on a book

4652
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
about about like ants in my

4653
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
pants or

4654
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
uh don't break the ice they're gonna

4655
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
have candy land

4656
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
could they do crossfire

4657
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
how about i would watch a crossfire movie how about

4658
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
cootie i would fucking watch

4659
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
crossfire it's gotta be the retro futuristic

4660
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
thing though like fucking rollerball i'd

4661
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
watch a crossfire

4662
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
exactly gotta have a remix of the fucking

4663
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
commercial hell yes

4664
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
maybe tetris will go like the shark

4665
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
nato route or something where it'll be

4666
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
end up being like super camp like if

4667
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
terra reed is cast in the tetris movie

4668
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
then maybe it'll turn out okay

4669
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
like if they if they aim for camp and so

4670
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
bad it's good that would actually be

4671
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
i know that there's like that he was at the

4672
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
youtube trailer or something like that that

4673
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
someone did a funny like haha it's a trailer

4674
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
for a tetris movie because it's so ridiculous

4675
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
okay i mean

4676
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
it's stupid yeah i just don't want

4677
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
to see a real tetris movie i don't think it's

4678
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
it it doesn't make any fucking sense

4679
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
if you won't make a sci-fi movie make a

4680
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
fucking sci-fi movie there's plenty of properties

4681
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
you can license that are actually sci-fi that

4682
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
makes sense but don't just like

4683
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
i can't like fucking say okay

4684
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
i'm gonna take the game of poker and i'm gonna make it into

4685
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
a war action film

4686
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
it doesn't fucking make any sense

4687
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
although that would probably make more sense

4688
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
than this see act deft in chat says

4689
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
don't wake daddy would be a horror movie

4690
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
um

4691
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
the legend of zaku in chat says

4692
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
uh hungry hungry hippos the movie

4693
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
you know

4694
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
obesity that could well could be kind of like

4695
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
jurassic park what about mousetrap

4696
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
where like there you go oh there you go

4697
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
that would be a pretty sweet you know that

4698
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
was just the opening five minutes of pewie's

4699
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
big adventure it's really just you know

4700
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
all the videos for okay go but

4701
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
i mean i don't know mr t i like

4702
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000

thank god featuring the twin towers

4705
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
no no

4706
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
bad bad slap that is

4707
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
bad taste oh my goodness

4708
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
this is exactly what i'm thinking like

4709
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
what did they do with the tetris movie of all

4710
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
things i thought the only thing that the tetris thing

4711
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
worked in was that you remember that they have that

4712
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
little concept video for pixels or whatever

4713
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
that adam sandler's not gonna take his shit on

4714
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
but remember where they had you know the tetris

4715
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
blocks you know falling down stuff and knocking

4716
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
out buildings and stuff like that that was kind of

4717
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
cool this adam sandler

4718
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
movie probably not so cool but whatever

4719
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
light bright wait adam sandler's

4720
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
in the tetris movie no he's in the pixels

4721
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
movie oh god he's in the pixels

4722
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
i was like

4723
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
no no no

4724
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
gee how could the tetris movie get

4725
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
any worse no he's in adam

4726
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
sandler's in it wow it got worse

4727
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
movie the pixels movie which is

4728
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
about all the like retro 80s like

4729
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
you know things coming alive

4730
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
all the arcade characters and then also

4731
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
um he's in candyland

4732
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
which is gonna be terrible too so

4733
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
all right all right uh moving

4734
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
on one more story here for you

4735
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
guys and uh this is just

4736
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
kind of one of those hmm isn't that interesting

4737
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
sort of stories well a few weeks

4738
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
ago on the show we talked about how there was

4739
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
a former nintendo employee

4740
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
dan adelman and he left nintendo

4741
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
he used to be the guy that would work

4742
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
very closely with the indies

4743
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
to get them onto the wii u uh e-shop

4744
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
and you know he's responsible for some of these

4745
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
big titles coming over to the wii u and he

4746
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
actually left uh nintendo

4747
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
well uh he actually

4748
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
announced this week uh a game called

4749
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
axiom verge that uh he

4750
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
is uh working on he's involved with

4751
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
the development of this game it's a metroid

4752
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
castlevania style action platformer

4753
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
and it's being developed by tom

4754
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
hap who's a petroglyph games employee

4755
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
who makes independent games

4756
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
but here's the twist the

4757
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
game is going to be exclusive to playstation

4758
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
oh wow

4759
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
i've actually played the game snap girl

4760
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
i actually played the game actually oh

4761
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
during e3 oh i didn't know it is

4762
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
they actually had a small demo it

4763
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
actually looks really good yeah yeah

4764
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
i'm all for it feels like it feels like

4765
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
the more bloody like aliens or

4766
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
i'm not sure about the abadox

4767
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
sorry the one with

4768
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
it's more like abadox and aliens

4769
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
mixed with metroid

4770
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
so yeah it's gonna be a playstation

4771
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
4 and vita and there was also

4772
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
a steam version that's in the works

4773
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
and uh you know dan edelman does say

4774
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
quote although i will always have a special place in my

4775
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
heart for nintendo fuck those guys no

4776
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
he didn't say that he said in my

4777
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
heart for nintendo this game is solely

4778
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
focused on playstation which

4779
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
surely you've gotta kind of go

4780
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
oh really

4781
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
but gotta get a ps4 now

4782
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
ah

4783
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
i was hoping there'd be a price reduction this year

4784
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
but they've been selling too well yeah they are they

4785
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
really are you probably won't see that

4786
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
probably just wait for some sort of bundle

4787
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
that you want i mean the other destiny one

4788
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
hopefully they'll have some new bundles or

4789
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
wait for microsoft to get desperate

4790
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
and cut the price of their console a little

4791
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
bit assuming it doesn't do well this

4792
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
year i mean till black friday yeah

4793
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
right isn't the xbox sort of

4794
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
like starting to get a little bit of the peak only

4795
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
because they don't include the connect

4796
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
um

4797
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
i mean it's not like

4798
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
you know xbox is not doing like

4799
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
awful but i mean

4800
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
microsoft wants to be doing better

4801
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
than they are that's for sure and they don't

4802
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
like this fact that they're lagging behind sony

4803
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
right now um so

4804
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
they're gonna probably you know

4805
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
if if halo doesn't really move some

4806
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
consoles and so forth they'll probably

4807
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
make a desperation move and that could be

4808
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
slashing the price of the console or maybe a

4809
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
redesign that would be cheaper parts who

4810
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
knows you know this is

4811
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
not before christmas not before

4812
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
christmas we're we're everything that's coming

4813
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
for the holidays you already know about at this point

4814
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
they're not going to do anything then but uh

4815
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
uh next year you never know what

4816
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
bundles they'll sell what games

4817
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
will be you know put together and so forth

4818
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
so all right well

4819
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
that does it for the news that

4820
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000

i don't care i cheated

4834
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
because i want to stop playing

4835
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
this game and the only way to do that is to finish

4836
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
it so i am going to finish

4837
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
it whatever means necessary and yes

4838
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
you know the only thing that cheating does

4839
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
it means i don't have to spend my life playing this fucking

4840
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
game so i am going to ruin it for myself

4841
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
so i stop playing it that was the goal

4842
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
goal accomplished

4843
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
except i am still fucking playing the game

4844
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
so apparently there's

4845
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
still a problem there somewhere

4846
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000

4872
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
videos on youtube for

4873
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
this crazy chocobo song on

4874
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
on teeter rhythm just to see how it

4875
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000

4876
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000

4878
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
what it is you know what i

4879
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
i will say this it is a lot more tolerable in a

4880
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
two minute chunk i will say that

4881
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
because they do have to crop it

4882
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
yeah it is a two minute song

4883
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
it's not that long so yeah

4884
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
it's pretty much the full song

4885
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
but yeah it's i don't know

4886
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
and i and i have said this

4887
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
before and before and

4888
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
and even i said it this week

4889
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
on twitter because uh i played a lot of

4890
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
teeter rhythm before uh smash released

4891
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
and

4892
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
and i really loved all the songs that

4893
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
they put from all the

4894
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
the final fan final fantasy

4895
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
13 series uh

4896
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
13 2 lightning returns especially

4897
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
lightning returns songs are really

4898
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
great yeah they really are yeah

4899
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
they are it kind of makes you want to play the game

4900
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
sorry uh i

4901
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
i still hear crazy chocobo

4902
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
and i'll go like uh yeah

4903
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
i don't know what went in

4904
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
the minds of of the composer there

4905
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
because yeah or or whoever

4906
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
worked on the soundtrack have you heard the

4907
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
titan song from final fantasy 14 because

4908
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
that's kind of a heavy metal song too

4909
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
i think so

4910
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
uh well at least from your streams

4911
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
i think i i have remembered that

4912
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
but yeah that's that's a good song because

4913
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
uh it

4914
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
at least i consider it a good song because it's

4915
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
uh at least it's

4916
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
coherent it's uh it's not

4917
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
played as funny yeah

4918
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
because like the crazy uh well not the

4919
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
crazy chocobo uh in particular

4920
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
all the the chocobo

4921
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
the chocobo songs are are

4922
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
funny are are simplistic

4923
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
are funny are are pretty much

4924
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
just to enjoy

4925
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
and crazy chocobo takes all that through

4926
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
the window and replace it with another thing that

4927
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
i i i i seriously

4928
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
seriously sorry can't

4929
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
comprehend why they did that well you know

4930
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
i in all fairness music is music

4931
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
and you know i sit here and i go how does

4932
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
one direction sell millions of

4933
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
albums it's not very good music but

4934
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
somebody out there likes it who's

4935
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
probably 12 years old but you know whatever

4936
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
so um

4937
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
uh is that it you just want to call and read me

4938
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
out for crazy chocobo or

4939
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
no i also want to talk about

4940
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
the smash brothers a bit because

4941
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
it's a really good game i thought you might what are your

4942
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
thoughts on it uh well you've

4943
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
pretty much uh nailed it at the

4944
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
beginning uh it has its flaws

4945
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
it's not perfect

4946
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
but it's the smash brothers

4947
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
it's it's an affordable it's

4948
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
something that i personally wanted since

4949
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
ever ever since the first

4950
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
measure probably melee

4951
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
that that we uh

4952
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
that that we should

4953
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
be able to play uh a smash

4954
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
or something on a portable yes uh whenever

4955
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
you uh whatever you go

4956
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
you have your if you have your 3ds in this

4957
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
case uh well you can play it

4958
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
and it's it's really good it's

4959
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
not a bad game it's not terrible

4960
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
it has again it's

4961
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
lost like the online component

4962
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
uh it's it's a little

4963
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
wonky especially uh with

4964
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
whoever you're playing

4965
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
with friends it's not it's

4966
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
pretty great i haven't had that

4967
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
many problems uh

4968
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
although i haven't played online with uh

4969
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
with strangers so i i don't know i

4970
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
i but the same thing i wouldn't

4971
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
i sorry i haven't

4972
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
been able to connect to a server or to

4973
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
uh to an image

4974
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
online that way so yeah

4975
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
uh yeah you know and it kind of makes me

4976
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
think like you know i said earlier in the show that the

4977
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
game uh maybe just isn't really

4978
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
for this particular console i mean it

4979
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
doesn't necessarily make it bad or whatever just

4980
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
you know i kind of think back like we've seen fighting

4981
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
games and games that were from

4982
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
um you know the the consoles

4983
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
ported to portable you know

4984
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
since we even had the original game boy

4985
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
like somebody put mortal combat

4986
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
on the original game boy

4987
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
and it's not that it was necessarily

4988
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
bad per se but it just

4989
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
really wasn't a game that was meant to be played on the game boy

4990
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
and that's kind of how i feel about

4991
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
smash and i realized some of the hardcore fans

4992
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
are going to be like no rob you're wrong this is a

4993
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
great thing because now we can play this

4994
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
whenever we want we don't have to have the tv

4995
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
and set it all up but i'm like yeah but you

4996
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
have to have four 3ds's and four

4997
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
copies of the game so

4998
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
you know maybe at conventions that'll work but

4999
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
i don't know i just

5000
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
i just see it as the as the

5001
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
appetizer for the main course

5002
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
that's coming in the wii u version oh yeah

5003
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
definitely though it's curiously because

5004
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
most of the people that are mostly

5005
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
hardcore for smash brothers

5006
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
say that the 3ds

5007
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
it's really awful and

5008
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
and they're waiting for the wii u

5009
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
version especially because

5010
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
yeah all the flaws that the

5011
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
3ds has probably the wii u

5012
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
will fix them let's hope oh yeah that's

5013
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
the again it's the portable

5014
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
component if you can

5015
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
deal with with the bad

5016
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
the good stuff really really shines

5017
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
and something to

5018
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
just to finish this call before

5019
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
it gets too long uh something that

5020
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
the other rhythm and the smash brothers

5021
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
really does really great it's the music

5022
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
player having a music player

5023
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
there having all the songs really

5024
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
great something that a lot of

5025
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
games should do and uh even

5026
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
theater of them will play the cut scenes as well

5027
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
with little movies for the songs that it's appropriate

5028
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
for which is a great feature

5029
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
so oh yeah but especially the music player because

5030
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
you can uh have the 3ds in

5031
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
sleep mode you can close it and

5032
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
and just hear the songs

5033
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
on your headphones so yeah

5034
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000

take on something um

5058
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
as you already know uh

5059
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
we've been uh you know

5060
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
seen a few more uh

5061
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
games appearing on scene recently

5062
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
I think uh what was it

5063
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
three four

5064
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
yeah three four seven

5065
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
yeah three four seven eight

5066
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
and they've announced 13 now

5067
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
yeah and plus

5068
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
uh what uh

5069
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
you love it and 14 are also on there

5070
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
well of course duh yeah

5071
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
uh now

5072
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
that being said what do

5073
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
you think the odds are

5074
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
that we'll see some of the other

5075
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
Final Fantasy games

5076
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
you know appearing schemes such as

5077
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
um I know

5078
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Final Fantasy 9 Final Fantasy

5079
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
10 10 2

5080
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
um well

5081
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
the ones you're naming

5082
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
maybe not so much but I think

5083
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
the likely candidates uh

5084
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
and this is probably gonna kind of strike you as kind of

5085
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
uh well oh okay uh I would say

5086
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
five and six are very likely candidates

5087
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
and the reason why I say that is because they've already

5088
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
done those android versions and

5089
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
all they did was convert those android and

5090
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
ios versions for three and four

5091
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
I see no reason why they won't do them for five and six

5092
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
however I'm gonna warn you

5093
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
the outsourced

5094
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
sprite work in five and six

5095
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
is somewhat questionable

5096
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
I'm not sure it's

5097
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
giving you quite the same pure experience

5098
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
but if you've never

5099
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
played the games before and you

5100
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
don't exactly have the means to go track

5101
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
down like a gameboy advance or an old

5102
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
super nintendo which at this point how do you

5103
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
um I would say

5104
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
at least it's better than nothing

5105
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
so uh if those games do come out to

5106
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
steam and you haven't experienced five or

5107
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
especially six for gods sake

5108
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
six is one of the best they've ever made

5109
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
in my opinion I like it but it's my favorite one

5110
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
but if I don't know if you've played the android one

5111
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
it's just kinda

5112
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
it doesn't feel right

5113
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
oh the little reboot one

5114
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
yeah the app games and stuff

5115
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
yeah cause the original sprites I actually

5116
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
enjoyed the original stuff and when they tried to

5117
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
kind of bring it up to date it didn't feel to have the same

5118
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
feeling as it did before yeah it's something like

5119
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
the soul really gets kind of lost

5120
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
six is yeah definitely in my heart

5121
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
the best one in my opinion it's kind of like a fuck you

5122
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
old people we're all for the new people kind of

5123
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
thing yeah I don't know I don't know what the rationale

5124
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
was behind that but that's

5125
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
where it stands with those games but you know

5126
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
for better or for worse with our opinion

5127
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
on that I believe five and six

5128
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
are highly likely candidates

5129
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
as far as nine and ten and those others

5130
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
see that's where we get tricky cause now the hardware

5131
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
gets trickier and final fantasy

5132
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
nine in particular never had a PC

5133
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
release there's a big thing

5134
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
here where seven and eight were actually released

5135
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
on the PC in the

5136
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
late 90s and early

5137
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
2000s yeah

5138
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
so those games were already out

5139
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
on the PC so again it was about adapting

5140
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
them they never did put nine on the PC

5141
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
for whatever reason so

5142
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
they would have to make

5143
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
a conscious decision to do that now

5144
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
I'm not sure that

5145
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
would happen I

5146
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
I think what's going to happen is where the

5147
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
iOS and Android goes

5148
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Steam's going to follow but then you know I

5149
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
would have never guessed that thirteen was

5150
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
going to come out thirteen coming to

5151
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Steam is kind of a huge surprise so you know

5152
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
what I guess anything's possible

5153
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
in that regard Spazinator but I

5154
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
would say five and six next if

5155
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
they all continue to sell well and if thirteen

5156
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
sells well maybe

5157
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
ten HD

5158
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
because they already clearly know how

5159
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
to port over PS3 code to run

5160
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
on the PC I would say ten

5161
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
HD would be your likely candidate next

5162
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
yeah I

5163
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
definitely hope that's the case because I

5164
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
love ten

5165
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
I beat it on to play season

5166
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
two god knows how many times

5167
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
yeah it's a good one it's a good one

5168
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
so great question though and

5169
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
I believe thirteen is on Steam this

5170
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
week right yeah

5171
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
in fact I got pre-ordered I just

5172
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
went in for the game to unlock so

5173
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
that's going to be nice to have the trilogy

5174
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
kind of all right there on the PC I think that'll be a lot

5175
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
of fun so

5176
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
alright well thanks for taking my calls

5177
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
definitely appreciate it alright take care

5178
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
of my friend alright bye-bye

5179
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
that was a good question there from Ragenator

5180
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
1877 game OLR our username

5181
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
on Skype orange lounge radio

5182
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

5183
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
and some of the thoughts they

5184
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
have Alan Alchemy reminds

5185
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
us we got the little EMU

5186
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
emulator for the LED Chocobo minigame

5187
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
for eight that's right that is there

5188
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
and Bob Coffee reminding us you can

5189
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
buy nine on the Playstation store easy

5190
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
and it works with the PS3, PSP

5191
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
and Vita we do have one more

5192
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
call coming in so this will probably be it for

5193
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
tonight let's go to the phones hi you're on orange

5194
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
lounge radio who's this hey what's up guys

5195
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
this is Kaijuto hey Kaijuto what's up my friend

5196
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
not much I'm gonna I'm gonna try

5197
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
to keep this real quick

5198
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
about what you said about the

5199
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
about the

5200
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
3DS not probably not being

5201
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
the console for the

5202
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
Smash Brothers sure

5203
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
I disagree that's fine mainly

5204
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
yeah mainly the main reason why I disagree is

5205
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
what I noticed about myself is

5206
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
I'm not a hardcore Smash

5207
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Brothers fan

5208
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
the only other Smash Brothers

5209
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
game that I own is Brawl and that was for

5210
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
the Wii so I'm not

5211
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
I'm not one of these people that have been

5212
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
playing for years and I've really gotten used to the

5213
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
GameCube controller you know

5214
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
I don't you know I don't come from that

5215
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
place so when I played on the 3DS

5216
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
I don't know what I'm missing

5217
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
I don't know what's changed and I'm able to adapt

5218
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
to the controls a lot better now

5219
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
I will agree that

5220
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
every now and then when I'm using the

5221
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
the circle pad I'll

5222
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
go to like maybe throw a punch and I think that I'm

5223
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
punching in the right direction I'll be

5224
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
punching somewhere else and that kind of gets frustrating

5225
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
but it's not something that happens

5226
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
all the time and it really doesn't affect

5227
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
my gameplay so I think that

5228
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
I think it's

5229
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
great to have it on the 3DS because I think that

5230
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
there may be a lot of little kids that are maybe

5231
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
like me which is funny to say but

5232
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
there's probably a lot of little kids that are like me who may

5233
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
have never played any of the other Smash Brothers

5234
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
games and this would be like a great little

5235
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
entry point for them you know

5236
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
and they could probably get used to it you know the

5237
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
controls on the 3DS really quickly

5238
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
and learn to play the game there you know I could

5239
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
I could remember being a little kid

5240
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
and trying to go to the arcade and trying

5241
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
to play Pac-Man on the

5242
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
big huge ass joystick and not being able

5243
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
to like reach the screen but when I got my little

5244
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
when I got my little tabletop Pac-Man

5245
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
I was able to kick ass on that I mean like

5246
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
literally just playing you know for hours

5247
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
and hours without dying and that's

5248
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
how I was used to playing but I know

5249
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
I'm pretty sure that there were adults who

5250
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
played in the arcade that was like what's this little

5251
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
tabletop shit you know like you know

5252
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
this isn't how you play you know

5253
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
this isn't Pac-Man

5254
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
you know what that's a really good comparison

5255
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
that is a really fair point I think in that

5256
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
respect especially I love that

5257
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
comparison with the tabletop Pac-Man

5258
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
where like when you're a little kid you don't care

5259
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
it's Pac-Man whereas like an adult

5260
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
gamer probably looks at that and goes what is that cheap

5261
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
knockoff garbage you know I don't

5262
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
think now obviously Smash Brothers is not

5263
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
knockoff garbage by any means it is still

5264
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
a good game I just believe

5265
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
it's biggest flaw is the system that it's

5266
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
on which is why I'm like I'm really excited for the Wii U

5267
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
version but you bring up a great point

5268
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
there's gonna be kids out there with like a 2DS

5269
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
even that like this is the way they're

5270
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
gonna play the game because maybe their

5271
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
family just doesn't have a Wii U or

5272
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
the little kid can't exactly monopolize

5273
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
the TV with their game console

5274
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
so this 2DS version is what

5275
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
they get so hook them early

5276
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
yeah exactly and I'm also

5277
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
about the porting issue

5278
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
you know from what you had mentioned earlier

5279
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
about you know how they had to take some

5280
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
characters out and tweak a few things just so

5281
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
that it's able to be played on the 3DS

5282
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
I feel that it's not really a

5283
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
direct port you know it's more of like

5284
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
it's more customized for the 3DS

5285
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
which I think is also a good thing and one

5286
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
last question I'll take this off the air

5287
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
but how do you guys think

5288
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
that it's gonna play on the Wii U with that

5289
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
I know that they have the GameCube

5290
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
controller that they're gonna

5291
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
apply to it but how do you feel that people

5292
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
are gonna be able to play with that big ass

5293
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
Etch A Sketch controller

5294
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
you know what I know a lot of people

5295
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
I know a lot of people rag on the

5296
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
gamepad but it honestly doesn't bother me

5297
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
like when I'm holding it like maybe it's

5298
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
just because I don't know maybe because I'm

5299
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
an older guy who's got big

5300
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
hands maybe like when I'm holding the gamepad

5301
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
it's just not really an issue to me but I don't

5302
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
I don't think about like

5303
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
I don't know why but when I'm holding like I hold

5304
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
my Xbox controller with two

5305
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
hands so when I hold the Wii U controller

5306
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
with two hands it really actually feels like a

5307
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
similar configuration it's just my hands

5308
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
are further apart but they

5309
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
it doesn't feel weird or anything

5310
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
cause the way the tablet's

5311
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
weighted or whatever like it feels very natural

5312
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
the Wii U controller is actually I

5313
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
think it's a great feel and I know some people

5314
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
think like what that thing is huge but

5315
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
it works I don't know I don't know

5316
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
and eventually I think sorry I didn't mean to cut you

5317
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
it eventually feels like it'll

5318
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
come down to preference just like when

5319
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
it transferred to the Wii

5320
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
when Brawl came out and now you have the

5321
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
nunchuck and everything and people have their preference

5322
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
and seeing that big controller

5323
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
actually the way I look at it I see it as like

5324
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
old school game gear if I think about it

5325
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
but it's pretty much like towards that

5326
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
it's just what they're feeling

5327
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
bringing back the old controllers

5328
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
the gaming controllers will bring back more

5329
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
feel to the old school stuff but that's

5330
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
because that was their preference too and that was just

5331
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
the demand but I don't really see any

5332
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
difference to people getting used to the new controllers

5333
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
and such but at least what is great

5334
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
about the Wii U version

5335
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
is that you get a choice you know

5336
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
and you can even use what we're hearing

5337
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
your 3DS as the controller if you want

5338
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
for the Wii U version so if you

5339
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
totally think I'm off base

5340
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
with what I'm saying and you enjoy the 3DS

5341
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
as a controller then you're going to be able to use that

5342
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
with the Wii U version so I think

5343
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
that's great that you're at least going to have those

5344
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
choices that you simply can't

5345
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
have on the 3DS and that's just the

5346
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
limitation of a portable gaming system

5347
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
right yeah

5348
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
I agree with that yep so

5349
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
thanks for taking my call you are welcome and a great show

5350
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
as always and have a good night quickly

5351
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
quickly favorite character in Smash gotta know

5352
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
has to be the Wii Fit Trainer

5353
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
I mean I kicked ass today

5354
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
with that like I haven't lost with her yet

5355
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Rob the Robot is pretty good too but

5356
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
I'm hearing a lot about the Wii Fit Trainer

5357
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
the Wii Fit Trainer is one of my favorites as well

5358
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
like the Wii Fit Trainer is an awful lot of fun

5359
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
what about the dog from Duck Hunt? I haven't unlocked him yet

5360
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
I unlocked him but I haven't used

5361
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
him yet but I don't know it feels weird

5362
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
fighting the dog as much as I hate that dog

5363
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
it

5364
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
just feels weird to fight he has a duck on his

5365
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
back and it's just weird

5366
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
it's a weird character it looks like it should have been

5367
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
Nintendo or something

5368
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
Nintendo there you go that would have been something

5369
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
alright my friend thanks for the call appreciate it

5370
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
alright goodnight and take care buddy

5371
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
that was a great comparison

5372
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
that's why we love to hear from the listeners

5373
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
and take the calls live is because you know I might be

5374
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
sitting here saying one thing about the game but

5375
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
that comparison with the old school and I remember

5376
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
those things vividly in my head those 80's

5377
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Pac-Man table tops and you can even see these

5378
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
like E3 at the museum and so forth

5379
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
they just like you look at

5380
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
like what a shitty port but

5381
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
again when you're younger it's like

5382
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
it's the real thing it's awesome

5383
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
on top of like the casual discussions I mean

5384
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
for 3DS if people will buy

5385
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
if they prefer more on the gun

5386
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
that people have preference of controls

5387
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
I do agree on him as well

5388
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
as he said about besides the competitors

5389
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
it's actually catering to the fans

5390
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
of actually Smash itself

5391
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
because as he says as a kid

5392
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
now they can have it handheld they can take it where they want to go

5393
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
rather than taking a humongous system which they can't

5394
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
which definitely will apply

5395
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
to them as well and then you know though it's a different

5396
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
entire game

5397
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
they'll get used to that too and still have fun

5398
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
it's still Smash Brothers

5399
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
as the thing you'll always have that

5400
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
and the developers

5401
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
themselves said it's a fine balance

5402
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
between the casual brawl

5403
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
and the competitive melee

5404
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
to the upcoming

5405
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
Smash games and sometimes with our

5406
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
conventions we try to separate that too that's the one thing

5407
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
that some of our staff applied

5408
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
is that you have these kids that go to these

5409
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
conventions and they want to play the game but then

5410
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
you have the competitors there at the same time they're mashed

5411
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
in there but then they're not having fun

5412
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
so what one of our staff has done

5413
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
is made two separate tournaments

5414
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
a kind of a peewee division to separate

5415
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
them where they can use items and so forth because

5416
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
they want to play with that stuff they want to have fun

5417
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
not to show that the parents look at

5418
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
this and say that I think my child just wasted

5419
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
his money just to go here and get

5420
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
bummed off by these kids that

5421
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
just are not showing any

5422
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
sportsmanship towards the game

5423
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
especially to the little kids as well

5424
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
but that's why we separate the two sometimes

5425
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
just to have the fun

5426
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
now in the online mode you have for fun and for

5427
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
glory and that sounds almost exactly what you're talking about

5428
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
there is how you're kind of splitting things

5429
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
that's how it should be actually that's how it should be

5430
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
because there's two different scenes

5431
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
great wow

5432
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
very cool to kind of hear how that plays into

5433
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
the tournament stuff that you guys do there

5434
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
let's see actdeft in chat says why didn't I

5435
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
get asked that question about my favorite character

5436
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
because you would have picked Kirby

5437
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
or clearly if you know actdeft

5438
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
you know he loves Kirby or maybe

5439
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
I suppose maybe it could have been Meta Knight

5440
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
or Dedede or one of the other characters in those games

5441
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
but I kind of just have a feeling here

5442
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
alright anyhow

5443
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
that is about going to do it for another

5444
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
episode of Orange on its Radio it's been a long show tonight

5445
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
but a fantastic show

5446
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
I want to once again thank Bobby King

5447
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
and Farsight Studios and wish them

5448
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
the best of luck with the Addams Family Kickstarter

5449
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
which as we saw in our Fugu Question of the Week tonight

5450
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
there's a lot of love for the Addams Family out there

5451
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
so if you don't mind

5452
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
putting down the money now to make sure you're going to get

5453
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
a copy of the table when they finish that

5454
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
then they can get all that licensing they need to finish it up

5455
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
and it looks like, although it looks really good

5456
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
remember they have to hit that goal

5457
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
or they don't get any of it

5458
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
so we're going to keep our fingers and toes crossed for them

5459
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
DarkSaraka

5460
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
sadly she's already left

5461
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
but she will be back next week on the show

5462
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
we already got her final thought earlier

5463
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
Diego, Jonas, thanks for being back again tonight

5464
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Always a pleasure

5465
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
It's been fun having you guys drop in over the past couple months

5466
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
and it's good to hear what you guys are up to

5467
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
good luck with all the tournaments

5468
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
and having to work Smash 3DS into your rotation now

5469
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
Looking forward to it on October the 10th

5470
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
it's already getting pretty hyped

5471
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
and I'll be looking, definitely

5472
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
That'll be a lot of fun

5473
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
Final thoughts tonight, Jonas, I'll start with you

5474
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
your final thought

5475
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
With October being busy and with Smash coming up

5476
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
I want to see how this develops

5477
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
and how it can integrate for future events

5478
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
so

5479
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
and I'll be honest

5480
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
hopefully with the upcoming Smash comes up

5481
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
people can stop talking about

5482
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
too heavily

5483
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
people can say Project M

5484
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
don't get me wrong, it's a game for people who could cater to that

5485
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
but I can't have that requested

5486
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
because we don't want to be in trouble with legal issues

5487
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
it's what it is

5488
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
with the whole

5489
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
hacked version

5490
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
Diego, your final thought tonight

5491
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
Like I said, kind of going off what he said

5492
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
about upcoming games and such

5493
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
we got a lot of stuff on our plate that we hopefully would present out

5494
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
to the community as we try to do

5495
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
throughout the years

5496
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
and definitely looking forward to not just Smash

5497
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
but also November when Pokemon

5498
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
Omega, Ruby and Sapphire

5499
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
Alpha, that's definitely going to be a big thing

5500
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
because Pokemon is another big scene too

5501
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
oh yes

5502
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
and when that comes out, and I've never played the third version

5503
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
and I'm glad they brought it out in 3D

5504
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
and I will definitely be the first time ever

5505
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
I'll play that

5506
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
I always try to get into Pokemon

5507
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
and I usually get to the first or second gym

5508
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
and then I just, I can't

5509
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,000
and the games won't allow me to not collect

5510
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
every single Pokemon along the way

5511
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
even though Shane, who's very into Pokemon

5512
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
won't tell me, don't play it that way

5513
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
and I tell you, the game has changed

5514
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
so much since it first came out

5515
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
because everything, as people say, was so much broken

5516
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
but it's definitely a deep game

5517
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
speaking of Pokemon

5518
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
I thought you had discussed

5519
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
of course the Pokemon Regionals

5520
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:45,000
coming up next week

5521
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
now will be the last of the Pokemon

5522
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
X1

5523
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
until they start moving on to Pokemon

5524
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire

5525
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
so that should be a fun series

5526
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
of tournaments going on for Regionals

5527
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
you guys are going to be

5528
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
tournamented out by the time Christmas comes around

5529
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
but I guess I can't really

5530
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
so many things that get in order

5531
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
well thank you guys again for being here

5532
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
I'm sure next month or so

5533
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000
thank you for having us again

5534
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
you're welcome, anytime

5535
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
it's always good to have the mixed perspectives

5536
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
where would we be without you guys?

5537
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:19,000
if we have gotten to topless marijuana

5538
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
Rosalina, without you guys

5539
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,000
I don't know

5540
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
I forgot the order of how that all started

5541
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
Loki, my friend, your final thought tonight

5542
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,000
I'm confused, I went to this Nexus

5543
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
games website and they have their

5544
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:33,000
Brickblast U game which they

5545
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
on the one side it says

5546
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
Family Fun Entertainment

5547
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,000
and for some reason they have a mature rating

5548
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
marked on that, which I don't think that

5549
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,000
even went through the ESRB and I'm pretty sure

5550
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
they mocked that up because it also says

5551
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
their website and

5552
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
quality stuff that you can

5553
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
look forward to in a Minecraft clone

5554
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,000
coming soon

5555
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
yeah, and my

5556
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
final thought is I'm going to work on my games more

5557
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
alright, good luck with that

5558
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
as I do every show, I'm just going to say

5559
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
please help spread the word about

5560
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
Orange Launch Radio, if you enjoyed the show

5561
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
please tell a friend or five or fifty

5562
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
about the program, five star

5563
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
reviews on the website where you found

5564
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
this show goes along with iTunes

5565
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:15,000
Stitcher Radio, all those places

5566
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,000
go a very long way in helping people

5567
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
discover the show, remember we don't have a mega

5568
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
budget behind the show, all we have is you

5569
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,000
guys, our OL army as we say to help spread

5570
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
the word, definitely, definitely, we will definitely

5571
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000
same one will be on October

5572
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:29,000
10th, we'll definitely spread that out, heck yes

5573
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,000
especially for our next coming streams definitely

5574
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:33,000
we'll give you a shout out, awesome

5575
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:35,000
once again we apologize for not bringing more people

5576
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:37,000
but we're still working on that

5577
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
it's not that big of a space

5578
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,000
I do still have

5579
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
a final thought I want to get out here but I do

5580
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,000
want to, well let me give my final thought here

5581
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
this was a little bit more of a personal note

5582
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
and it's going to come off as a little bit random

5583
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,000
but it's something kind of important I want to make sure I mention

5584
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,000
because I've told

5585
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
the cast and the people of this directly

5586
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
impacts about it so now I can be a little more

5587
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:59,000
public with this, but

5588
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:01,000
as you guys know, I have

5589
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:03,000
before I got to

5590
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:05,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5591
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
I used to do another show

5592
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:09,000
Understation Live with Travis and Jessica

5593
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:11,000
I was born of the Rocky Horror

5594
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
Picture Show community and you know

5595
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,000
cult movies and cult cinema that's something

5596
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
I've done on and off since 1998

5597
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
and even until

5598
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:21,000
these past few years I've been working very closely

5599
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,000
with a local group with the Sacramento

5600
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:25,000
Horror Film Fest which is actually going on next weekend

5601
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
which is why I can't go to

5602
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,000
your shindig but that's going on

5603
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:31,000
next weekend

5604
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,000
you know that whole thing keeps me very busy

5605
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:35,000
but I kind of got to this

5606
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
point where it was like alright I'm doing more

5607
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:39,000
and more and more broadcasting I'm doing more

5608
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:41,000
and more with this I've got too much on my plate

5609
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:43,000
something's got to give so I

5610
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
actually have made a decision

5611
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
to end my 16 year career

5612
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
with the Rocky Horror Picture Show

5613
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:51,000
so Halloween is going to be my

5614
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
farewell show as the director and

5615
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
as a regular performer so if you are

5616
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,000
in the Sacramento area and you need plans for Halloween

5617
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,000
I encourage you to come on out

5618
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
because that's actually going to be my final

5619
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
show so which

5620
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
is you know it's a little bit difficult personally

5621
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
especially all the history and the fact that like

5622
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
wow would I be here where I am with OLR if it wasn't

5623
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
for that and I don't know

5624
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
but the

5625
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
good thing about that is that this will

5626
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
allow me to continue to focus

5627
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,000
on broadcasting

5628
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,000
and this hobby and

5629
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
you know doing more things like

5630
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
livestream and more things like YouTube and

5631
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
all of that and VOG

5632
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
and so forth so and that doesn't mean I

5633
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
still won't continue to support my

5634
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
friends over at the SAC Horror Film Fest and in the

5635
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
Rocky Horror Community and cult cinema in general

5636
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:37,000
I just have to support them in other ways

5637
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,000
now instead of unnecessarily getting on stage

5638
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:41,000
so that's just why I wanted to get off my chest

5639
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
so thank you guys very much for indulging

5640
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:45,000
me there and

5641
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,000
I will say next week on the show

5642
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,000
stay tuned because

5643
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000
we have an awesome interview with Lunar Ray

5644
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
Games as I talked about earlier in the show

5645
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:55,000
also coming to the studio

5646
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,000
I can't promise this because

5647
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:59,000
sometimes you know her schedule changes but

5648
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000
Princess Irene returning to

5649
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,000
the show next week so

5650
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:05,000
she's going to be here in studio we haven't had her in a long time

5651
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,000
Jonas is just like what?

5652
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:09,000
Princess Irene is going to be here next week and I believe

5653
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,000
JV Mon is back from

5654
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:13,000
New York City here next

5655
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:15,000
week so I mean next week is an action packed

5656
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
show so be here in seven days

5657
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
to do it I know Jonas is like shit I should

5658
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:21,000
have been here next week

5659
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
but then we went and had you guys here this week

5660
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000

5661
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
alright so thank you guys

5665
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:35,000
good night

5666
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
no they were all still true

5667
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:31,000
you
