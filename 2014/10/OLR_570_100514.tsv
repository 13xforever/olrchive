27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live here on October the 5th, 2014 with episode number 570 of our show.
44000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts and we've got a really busy show for you guys tonight so let me get right to it and introduce our co-host. Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	56000	How are you?
56000	57000	You're full.
57000	58000	I'm very full.
58000	62000	This yummy bread that you brought to the show that tastes like Cinnabon as bread.
62000	64000	But it's better than the Cinnabon bread.
64000	68000	Cinnabon does make a bread, a loaf of bread, and it's not nearly as good as the stuff.
68000	78000	Why is it that every, and you know we love to talk food here at OLR so I'm going to start with this. This is tonight's kickoff topic. Why does every airport have a Cinnabon? What is it about planes?
78000	80000	They want you to be in a food coma for the trip.
80000	81000	Clearly.
81000	85000	I'm so full of Cinnabon. I can't get out of my seat.
85000	88000	That means that fewer people are going to the bathroom.
88000	93000	Hold on, I know Tech Master Loki over there has got to have an answer for this. Hi Tech Master Loki.
93000	102000	It's because Cinnabon is awesome and normally it's just in the mall. I mean occasionally you'll find it in a strip mall but it's usually just in like a major shopping mall.
103000	113000	And so it's, and every time I go to an airport it's like, ooh Cinnabon. That's it. It's like, ooh Cinnabon. I got to get a Cinnabon.
113000	121000	I had a friend, this was about a year ago, was like, man I really want Cinnabon but I hate going to malls that go to the airport. It'll be faster.
121000	122000	And she went.
122000	124000	That's actually kind of true.
124000	125000	It is true.
125000	128000	Well she also lived closer to the airport.
128000	134000	Alright. We do tape live of course every Sunday night, excuse me, at the voice of Geeks Network.
134000	137000	vaughanetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
137000	139000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sunday nights.
139000	145000	And Dark Tetsuya in chat says, wow a whole minute before the food talk. That has to be a record.
145000	147000	Hey Dark Tetsuya, shut up.
147000	151000	Look, like I said, it is a busy show tonight.
151000	152000	So we have, you know.
152000	153000	We need energy.
153000	156000	So yeah, we have, we got to get through some of these segments real quick.
156000	162000	Tonight, not only all that news that Jason mentioned in the intro there, but we have another interview this week.
162000	168000	And this is going to be great to talk about this because Dark Sakura, I know you love your pinball.
168000	169000	Yes.
169000	171000	And so we have an awesome guest this week.
171000	173000	Unfortunately the scheduling didn't work out.
173000	177000	He couldn't be here live, but so we already actually taped this. It's already done.
177000	181000	But I did mention you quite a few times in the interview because of your love of pinball.
181000	183000	And you're okay.
184000	191000	But we have tonight, if you love pinball, stay tuned because we have Farsight Studios.
191000	196000	Bobby King from Farsight Studios is going to be joining us to talk about the pinball arcade.
196000	199000	Which is on like every platform.
199000	201000	Like I could start naming the platforms it's on.
201000	205000	Like oh it's on PS3 and PS4 and Xbox 360 and the Ouya.
205000	208000	And I mean it's on like every modern gaming console.
208000	212000	And I actually will ask him about that in the interview a little bit later on in the program.
212000	215000	We'll get into that in about probably about an hour and a half.
215000	220000	We'll actually do that usually where we would have a break between parts A and B of our show.
220000	224000	We will get to that interview and lots of good stuff in that. So stay tuned for that.
224000	227000	Meanwhile we're going to get to our gaming weeks.
227000	230000	But we got to get to some kickoff topics.
230000	232000	I thought it was food.
232000	234000	No we're done with food chat for now.
234000	237000	You wouldn't stop burping so I had to end food chat.
237000	241000	Alright let's get to a couple kickoff topics tonight.
241000	247000	I thought since we do have Bobby coming on the show tonight to talk about the pinball arcade.
247000	250000	And the Kickstarter for the Addams Family table.
250000	253000	That they're trying to make happen.
253000	255000	Which I think they're like super close to their goal.
255000	258000	So maybe our listeners will be enough to push it over.
258000	260000	Wait wait wait. Goal!
260000	261000	Goal!
261000	266000	The Addams Family is like one of the few tables I don't see in your house.
266000	270000	Yes but we have the table that came as a result of Addams Family.
270000	271000	Oh really?
271000	272000	Twilight Zone.
272000	273000	Oh I did not know that was a result of that.
273000	276000	Addams Family was such a runaway success.
276000	280000	They're like here's our list of licenses do whatever you want.
280000	283000	And he's like I'm going to make Twilight Zone.
283000	287000	And I'm going to make it a wide table and we're going to put MagnaRamps in it and all this stuff.
287000	289000	So yeah but Addams Family is one.
289000	291000	I do like Prop Addams Family.
291000	292000	Prop Cycle Addams Family.
292000	295000	Oh god. I didn't even think to ask about that during the interview.
295000	298000	It's a real bummer that you couldn't be here to ask about those types of things.
298000	303000	But I did ask about the gold edition Addams Family so we'll talk. We'll get into that later.
303000	308000	It's too bad the Twilight Zone table didn't have the Twilight Zone song. The techno song.
308000	309000	Yes it did.
309000	310000	It did?
310000	312000	No no it had the golden earring one.
312000	313000	Oh.
313000	314000	No no see.
314000	318000	Loki is talking about the Twilight Zone that was in DDR.
318000	319000	Oh.
319000	325000	I think the table might have predated or been around the same time.
325000	330000	But they got like an all synth version of golden earrings Twilight Zone.
330000	332000	Twilight Zone is a rad table.
332000	333000	Ten minutes long.
335000	338000	How did you get into pinball, Dark Sakura?
338000	339000	Dan.
339000	341000	Well actually I should take a step back.
341000	344000	Why is it seen that pinball and video games tend to go hand in hand?
344000	346000	I mean technically they are different.
346000	347000	A pinball is not a video game.
347000	352000	But at the same time it's like okay I don't know many gamers who are like I hate pinball.
353000	355000	And I don't know many pinball players who are like I hate video games.
355000	357000	They tend to be pretty closely related.
357000	358000	They're electronic entertainment.
358000	362000	You stand, you press buttons and things happen.
362000	364000	You have scores involved. It's a game.
364000	368000	So they are technically in the same genre.
368000	369000	Right.
369000	371000	Just variants of it.
371000	372000	Right.
372000	374000	Whereas one is kind of like a physics game in a way.
374000	377000	Pinball is kind of a physics game but that's not a bad thing at all.
377000	379000	That's what's kind of fun about it.
379000	381000	I think pinball went on two divergent paths.
382000	383000	Yeah.
383000	390000	You have, they all started with the same you know the ball goes and hits different things to what we know as pinball and then pachinko.
390000	391000	Ooh.
391000	398000	See I thought you were going to go towards like virtual pinball because a lot of my memories for pinball quite honestly have to do with virtual tables.
398000	401000	I mean I love the physical, don't get me wrong, I love the physical tables.
401000	406000	You know I remember when the roller rink, oh yeah I went there, would have pinball machines and that was a lot of fun.
406000	408000	Hey I was only good at Frogger if I was on roller skates.
408000	416000	But I also remember pinball on the NES but also more importantly like okay those collections they had like I remember there was a collection on the Amiga.
416000	423000	Pinball Dreams I think and they brought it over to like early PCs like in the 90s and those collections were so flipping good.
423000	426000	I think those actually exist on like iPhone now today.
426000	429000	So I love that stuff.
430000	442000	Well I'm counting virtual pinball in the same category as pinball because it's really just a, it's pinball facsimile.
442000	445000	You know it's pinball simulation.
445000	451000	So just like you know some video games are simulations of other things.
451000	453000	Which is basically what the pinball arcade is.
453000	462000	But they do a great job and I like it because you know pinball tables can be hard to find in this day and age.
462000	470000	And you know unfortunately it is somewhat of a, I don't want to say a dying trend but it's popularity seems to not be where it was.
470000	473000	It's just because arcades aren't that popular anymore.
473000	474000	Yes I think it's tied to that.
474000	476000	Not necessarily amongst the collectors.
476000	478000	No not amongst the collectors, oh god no never.
478000	483000	The market is actually, the value of tables is really shooting up now.
483000	488000	But like where in town can I play a theater of magic? Not in somebody's house.
488000	491000	See she was about to say something.
491000	492000	Wait not in somebody's house.
492000	495000	I could name four people's houses you could go play it at.
495000	496000	But see that's the problem.
496000	500000	It's you know if I want to play theater of magic well now I can, I do have a way to do that.
500000	504000	It's like I can do the next best thing like literally.
504000	505000	Okay maybe it's not the physical table.
505000	507000	We could borrow somebody's again.
508000	511000	We do table swaps all the time.
511000	515000	You know what the problem is? It's because 7-11 doesn't have arcade games anymore.
515000	516000	That's the problem.
516000	518000	It's because arcades don't have arcade games anymore.
518000	520000	7-11 was the first place I played Mortal Kombat 2.
520000	523000	You know what they have now? ATM machines. And that's not a fun game.
523000	524000	That's also redundant.
527000	529000	Well it says ATM on the machines so you know.
529000	531000	That's what the M stands for.
531000	532000	I understand that.
532000	533000	That's like saying pin number.
534000	537000	Department of Redundancy Department. How can I help you?
538000	539000	Anyhow.
539000	540000	Hello I'd like to have an argument.
542000	545000	Let's quickly just to you know kind of throw this out there.
545000	549000	Because I'm going to ask this of Bobby later when he comes on.
549000	554000	And Jamie I know this might be, no actually I already know what you're going to answer this with.
554000	556000	But just for those that may not know.
556000	559000	What is your favorite pinball table of all time and why?
559000	561000	World Cup Soccer 94.
561000	562000	And why?
562000	566000	Because it was the table I had at college when I went to the University of South Alabama.
566000	569000	And I was pretty damn good at it. And I have the table practically memorized.
569000	571000	I'm not as good as I used to be at it.
571000	575000	But it's one of, I'd probably say it's my favorite right now.
575000	578000	It just has a lot of memories attached to it for me.
578000	582000	If I was going to name another one I'd probably say Last Action Hero.
582000	588000	Because that was the table that Dan and I played a lot when I was working at GNC back in the day.
588000	590000	They had a Last Action Hero at GNC?
590000	592000	No. We had to take...
592000	595000	That would probably get me into a GNC.
595000	598000	You want to get buffed like Schwarzenegger?
598000	603000	I had to take the deposit and the deposit was right next to a Godfather's in Natomas.
603000	606000	I think it's in Mt. Mike's now or something.
606000	609000	I was going to say is Godfather still around? They all went under around here.
609000	614000	But Dan and I would go and pick up a cheap pizza and play Last Action Hero.
614000	617000	And Snow Brothers. They had Snow Brothers.
617000	622000	That's love. That's love right there. Cheap pizza and Snow Brothers.
622000	626000	But then they changed out the Last Action Hero and then we started going there.
626000	629000	Because then I got my first full-time job.
629000	633000	Another one I'd actually have to say that I really, really, really like...
633000	636000	Alright, last one. You can't name them all, Jamie.
636000	638000	I actually really like Brighter Pin Bot.
638000	639000	That's a good table.
639000	641000	Brighter Pin Bot is a very good one. It's a classic.
641000	647000	Some people will look over it, but it was a very interesting one in the series.
647000	651000	It had a lot of different tricks to it, so it was very cool.
651000	659000	Okay, so my favorite table legitimately is, of all time, my favorite table really is The Addams Family.
659000	663000	And that's actually part of the reason I reached out to Farsight and wanted to invite them on the show.
664000	671000	I personally am just excited of the idea that The Addams Family could get into the series alongside these other tables.
671000	674000	Because for me, I think The Addams Family was the best table there ever was.
674000	677000	But for me, see, I love the movie.
677000	682000	And I was probably 12 or 13 when that movie came out, and I love the movie.
682000	686000	And even still to this day, it's such a great movie, right?
686000	688000	Like Raul Julia was great in it.
688000	692000	Angelica Huston is the perfect Morticia.
692000	697000	It's just such great. Christina Ricci is Wednesday. Just an amazing film.
697000	702000	I will have to tell you something. Did you know the sound bite from The Addams Family made it into Twilight Zone?
702000	704000	No, I didn't know that.
704000	705000	Greed.
705000	708000	Really? I never noticed that.
708000	712000	And they had all those cool little references that actually tied into the movie.
712000	716000	It didn't feel like it was some weirdly tacked on thing.
716000	721000	It actually felt like an extension of the movie, but as a pinball table.
721000	723000	You had the bookcase that was in the movie. You had the thing.
723000	725000	You had the memushka. It was a big scene in the movie.
725000	729000	And it's a big type of multi-ball or something in the table.
729000	731000	I just love the way it ties in.
731000	734000	But my second favorite table of all time would be Pinbot.
734000	737000	And that might be partially because of the NES version.
737000	740000	Which, granted, I understand to some people the NES version is super hokey.
740000	742000	But to me as a kid, I loved it.
742000	748000	Although I will say, Alan has really brought my love of the Elvira table up.
748000	750000	Actually, there's two Elvira tables.
750000	752000	There is.
752000	754000	I like them both.
754000	756000	There was some of the madness, wasn't it?
756000	758000	Well, they're both in the pinball market.
758000	762000	But the Elvira tables, he has really raised my love of those tables as well.
762000	765000	I had to double check, but yeah, it was designed by Pat Lawler.
765000	767000	Oh, there you go.
767000	770000	For the life of me, I knew it wasn't one of Steve Ritchie's.
770000	772000	But yeah, it's one of Pat Lawler's ones.
772000	776000	Talk about the two best pinball designers.
776000	778000	Pat Lawler and Steve Ritchie.
778000	780000	And Steve Ritchie is such a nice guy.
780000	782000	Yeah, you met him at one of those California exchanges.
782000	785000	I've met him a couple times. I hung out with his wife for like two hours one night.
785000	787000	So, they're both really cool people.
787000	789000	Alright, now I'm dying to know this.
789000	792000	Because, Loki, you don't talk a lot about pinball, but I know you've played some machines.
792000	793000	So, what's your favorite?
793000	795000	My favorite is Adam Stanley, actually.
795000	801000	Because I used to play that at Qsar, where I worked and stayed a lot of the time.
801000	806000	So, you know, they had Adam's family there.
807000	809000	I think they had Twilight Zone also.
809000	816000	They also had my second favorite game, which was Attack from Mars, I think.
816000	818000	Attack from Mars is a good one.
818000	819000	That was great.
819000	821000	There's the classic and then there's the hologram.
821000	822000	The hologram.
822000	823000	The hologram was Revenge from Mars.
823000	825000	Revenge from Mars. I'm sorry. Revenge from Mars.
825000	827000	Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
827000	829000	So, that one was pretty cool.
829000	834000	And then, before that, I didn't really play a whole ton of pinball.
834000	840000	So, I'd have to say, what was it? The default shareware table that was in Epic Pinball.
840000	842000	Oh, the Rockstar or something? Is that the one?
842000	845000	No, no, it wasn't Rockstar. It was like a cyborg thing.
845000	847000	Like some cyborg chick. I don't remember.
847000	850000	Oh, god. Epic Pinball was so good. Oh, my gosh.
850000	854000	Did you guys ever play any, though, of the weird specialty tables?
854000	857000	Like, there was the, what was the giant one?
857000	859000	The Titan pinball?
859000	861000	Not, like, physical? No.
861000	864000	I remember, like, Rollerball on the NES. There was three screens.
864000	867000	Have you ever been to the pinball museum in Las Vegas?
867000	869000	No, but I'm going to Las Vegas.
869000	871000	There's a pinball museum in Las Vegas?
871000	875000	I think that they moved it from the location I saw it at, but they have a pinball circus there.
875000	877000	Well, there's a pinball museum now in Alameda.
877000	879000	I need to go.
879000	881000	But, like, you remember Hyperball?
881000	884000	Or, uh, what was the one that I really liked?
884000	886000	Black Hole.
886000	889000	Where the ball goes and then you're playing it upside down.
889000	891000	Oh, yeah, I played that at California Street. Good times.
891000	893000	It was like Theater of Magic. That was pretty cool.
893000	895000	Theater of Magic is a great one.
895000	897000	It was very solid.
897000	899000	The Genie. The one with the spinning lamp.
899000	901000	What the hell is that one, Jamie?
901000	903000	It's like Aladdin's Tales from the Lamp.
903000	905000	Oh, my god.
905000	907000	It wasn't like an Arabian Nights.
907000	909000	Oh, my god. I can't remember the name of that table.
909000	911000	I think it was Arabian Nights.
911000	913000	Yeah, I think it was Arabian Nights.
913000	915000	Or Black Rose.
915000	917000	The one where you shoot a cannon.
918000	921000	Okay, so quickly before we get to our gaming week,
921000	923000	I want to kind of talk about this up front
923000	925000	because I know this is on a lot of your minds out there
925000	927000	and that is the release of
927000	929000	Smash Bros. on the 3DS.
929000	930000	Got it.
930000	932000	Smash Bros. for 3DS. Have you had a chance to play it yet, though?
932000	934000	No, because I was sick yesterday
934000	936000	and it was also Yom Kippur.
936000	938000	Which I hope my fellow Jews out there had a good fast.
938000	942000	Um, but I've actually been doing a lot of catch up today.
942000	945000	And, Loki, you still don't even own a 3DS, right?
945000	947000	I don't really have an opinion on this.
947000	949000	Dan's been playing the crap out of it.
949000	951000	Yeah, I know some of you guys,
951000	953000	and I've played a little bit of it, too,
953000	955000	so I'm curious of your thoughts on the new Smash Bros.
955000	957000	in our chat room over at live.volgnetwork.com.
957000	959000	And I've played a little bit of it
959000	963000	and I'm always impressed at how much they cram
963000	965000	into a Smash Bros. game.
965000	967000	Because you know it's not just, like,
967000	969000	clusterfuck rumble, free-for-all mode.
969000	971000	They also have, like, solo mode
971000	974000	and hit the punching bag as far as you can.
974000	976000	And bombs, and get the trophies.
976000	978000	And adventure mode's really cool.
978000	980000	Like, I'm always impressed at, like,
980000	982000	how many freaking modes they cram into the game.
982000	984000	Like, it's so much.
984000	986000	Is the adventure- do they have, like,
986000	988000	the adventure mode in this one? Is that, like-
988000	990000	It's not like it is, like, in the Wii one.
990000	992000	See, the Wii one is really awesome.
992000	994000	I do like what they did here, though.
994000	996000	They basically- you have a maze that you go through
996000	998000	and you get five minutes or something in the maze
998000	1000000	and you try to collect as many items as you can
1000000	1002000	and the items will increase your attack,
1002000	1004000	your roll, your jump, you know, all these various things.
1004000	1006000	And the more you get of all that,
1006000	1008000	then you, at the end of the five minutes,
1008000	1010000	you do an epic battle with all the players
1010000	1012000	that were in the maze.
1012000	1014000	So it's actually- it's a cool little minigame,
1014000	1016000	you know, for the 3DS. Keep in mind.
1016000	1018000	And here's the one drawback to Smash on the 3DS,
1018000	1020000	is that- and I'm gonna get shit for this comment
1020000	1022000	from my Nintendo-loving friends,
1022000	1024000	but I'm sorry, guys.
1024000	1026000	This is opinion. Take it or leave it.
1026000	1028000	If you wanna, you know, throw in your two cents,
1028000	1030000	you can in our chat room.
1030000	1032000	Or our email bag, participate at orangeontrated.com,
1032000	1034000	but here it is.
1034000	1036000	The 3DS is just the wrong system for this game.
1036000	1038000	And I kinda said this,
1038000	1040000	you know, when I played the demo,
1040000	1042000	I thought I was worried a little bit that this might be the case.
1042000	1044000	I know Bobby Blackwolf on his show,
1044000	1046000	he talked about, you know,
1046000	1048000	his issues with it, especially
1048000	1050000	being on an older 3DS,
1050000	1052000	but like-
1052000	1054000	I can't stand the circle pad, for one,
1054000	1056000	as a controller. Like, um,
1056000	1058000	I love to use NES, and I
1058000	1060000	find that, like, I do the wrong
1060000	1062000	PK thing, because, like,
1062000	1064000	my up flick should've been a right-
1064000	1066000	you know, like, I flicked the thing the wrong way,
1066000	1068000	and it goes weird. And like, jumping
1068000	1070000	feels so weird
1070000	1072000	in this to me, and I- again, I think it's that stinking
1072000	1074000	circle pad. And I don't like that you can't
1074000	1076000	flip that and the D-pad, because the
1076000	1078000	D-pad is meant for taunts. Um,
1078000	1080000	so, I don't know. Um,
1080000	1082000	so that part of it is, uh,
1082000	1084000	uh, a little bit
1084000	1086000	annoying. But, for me,
1086000	1088000	here's the thing. This acts
1088000	1090000	as a great teaser, and a great
1090000	1092000	build-up for the Wii U version,
1092000	1094000	which will be the, like,
1094000	1096000	piece de resistance, for- for,
1096000	1098000	you know, for me. Like, that's- that's the one
1098000	1100000	I really wanna get. I understand
1100000	1102000	why Nintendo kinda had to do the
1102000	1104000	3DS version, because, you know,
1104000	1106000	with the Wii U not being in as many homes
1106000	1108000	as- as maybe they'd want,
1108000	1110000	they can probably sell a lot more by
1110000	1112000	putting it on the 3DS. And there's gonna be people-
1112000	1114000	a lot of people that end up buying it on both.
1114000	1116000	Um, but,
1116000	1118000	you know, I- I- again, there's a lot of
1118000	1120000	good in this game as well. Like, the character
1120000	1122000	customization is fun. And I-
1122000	1124000	I actually liked designing the Miis an awful
1124000	1126000	lot, and I liked being able to make your own character and all this
1126000	1128000	stuff. Again, it's just, like, playing
1128000	1130000	all this makes me really excited to play it
1130000	1132000	on the system I think it was really
1132000	1134000	meant for, which is the Wii U.
1134000	1136000	That's my opinion. Take it or leave it.
1136000	1138000	Uh, let's see, uh,
1138000	1140000	go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1140000	1142000	Uh, Codeman
1142000	1144000	says, I'm waiting for Wii U, I don't own a
1144000	1146000	3DS. Uh, Codeman
1146000	1148000	says, are Ness and Lucas back
1148000	1150000	in the game? Um, Ness only,
1150000	1152000	Lucas was cut out, and I was really
1152000	1154000	surprised they didn't do a palette swap
1154000	1156000	for Lucas on Ness, which,
1156000	1158000	I understand they had their differences in the last game,
1158000	1160000	but they could've done a little bit of
1160000	1162000	fan service having Lucas as a palette swap, but
1162000	1164000	yeah, only Ness is in it. Um,
1164000	1166000	Kaijuto in chat
1166000	1168000	suggests, if you have a problem with the circle pad
1168000	1170000	jump, use wire X.
1170000	1172000	That's true, I could do that, it's still,
1172000	1174000	I don't know why, it just doesn't feel
1174000	1176000	right to me, because again, I
1176000	1178000	think, because of the way the circle pad is
1178000	1180000	designed, sometimes I end up jumping when I don't mean to jump.
1180000	1182000	Like, I don't know. It's just
1182000	1184000	bleh. Uh,
1184000	1186000	S2100Matt says, apparently some people
1186000	1188000	broke their circle pads. Yeah, I saw some of that from
1188000	1190000	Japan. Uh, S2100Matt
1190000	1192000	says, Smash Run has some cool fan
1192000	1194000	service moments when fighting old school
1194000	1196000	and lesser known enemies. Yeah, man, the
1196000	1198000	trophies. There's some really
1198000	1200000	excellent trophies that really
1200000	1202000	dig deep into the Nintendo
1202000	1204000	universe, and for that matter,
1204000	1206000	uh, the Mega Man universe,
1206000	1208000	the Pac-Man universe, you know, and
1208000	1210000	all that with all the people that are
1210000	1212000	assisting, you know, cause Sega's involved, Capcom's
1212000	1214000	involved, Namco's involved, it's pretty impressive.
1214000	1216000	Um, I wanna say this as well,
1216000	1218000	speaking of the other companies involved,
1218000	1220000	I gotta say, one of the most
1220000	1222000	impressive things for me, like being able to play
1222000	1224000	it in the game that makes me so happy and so
1224000	1226000	frustrated at the same time,
1226000	1228000	playing Mega Man on
1228000	1230000	that Dr. Wily stage. Like,
1230000	1232000	oh my god, it's so good,
1232000	1234000	like, like, but it makes
1234000	1236000	me so upset that they are
1236000	1238000	not doing another Mega Man game. Like,
1238000	1240000	they could just make a Mega Man game
1240000	1242000	like that, and I would be so happy,
1242000	1244000	but I just feel like it's never gonna
1244000	1246000	happen, and it makes me so sad.
1246000	1248000	Have you played your Mii yet? I have
1248000	1250000	played as the Mii. My Mii's a little sword fighter.
1250000	1252000	Dan, I think, went with the default
1252000	1254000	set for his. Uh-huh. I'm planning on doing
1254000	1256000	like a Sheik style, so.
1256000	1258000	Uh, Kossan in
1258000	1260000	chat says, stands outside of NOA headquarters
1260000	1262000	with a sign that says, no Ice Climbers and
1262000	1264000	no Lucas equals no sale.
1264000	1266000	Well, here's the thing. Um, Ice Climbers,
1266000	1268000	and we talked about this on a previous week's
1268000	1270000	show, Ice Climbers apparently were
1270000	1272000	cut from the 3DS version because
1272000	1274000	it's a hardware issue, a hardware limitation,
1274000	1276000	or a hardware limitation, excuse me. If all
1276000	1278000	four people in the match were playing Ice
1278000	1280000	Climbers, the system couldn't handle it.
1280000	1282000	Maybe the new 3DS can handle it,
1282000	1284000	but the old 3DS's can't. And
1284000	1286000	I think we're seeing some things where the
1286000	1288000	3DS version of the game
1288000	1290000	changed a few things. In fact,
1290000	1292000	there were some stories that came out this week
1292000	1294000	about, like, what's going on with some
1294000	1296000	of the hardware limitations. Did you know
1296000	1298000	the 3DS is the reason that
1298000	1300000	Sheik and Zelda were split into
1300000	1302000	separate characters? Uh, yeah,
1302000	1304000	that is in a translation from
1304000	1306000	Sakurai's Famitsu column.
1306000	1308000	Of course, Masahiro Sakurai, who's behind
1308000	1310000	Super Smash Brothers, said, quote,
1310000	1312000	It's basically due to the 3DS limitations.
1312000	1314000	It was impossible to have both characters
1314000	1316000	exist together as one on 3DS.
1316000	1318000	However, reaching that limit can
1318000	1320000	sometimes lead in good directions. Transforming
1320000	1322000	characters had the drawback of ambiguous
1322000	1324000	tactics and such, and I believe they've
1324000	1326000	become more fresh now.
1326000	1328000	So, 3DS, the reason
1328000	1330000	why Sheik and Zelda were
1330000	1332000	split into separate characters.
1332000	1334000	Kind of interesting.
1334000	1336000	Not available on the
1336000	1338000	3DS, by the way, the Circle Pad
1338000	1340000	Pro. Again,
1340000	1342000	Masahiro Sakurai explained,
1342000	1344000	Supporting the Circle Pad Pro requires
1344000	1346000	the use of some of the CPU's processing
1346000	1348000	load. From the information received
1348000	1350000	during the development of Kid Icarus Uprising, this
1350000	1352000	is quite a large load at around 5%.
1352000	1354000	Kid Icarus Uprising and Smash
1354000	1356000	both use the maximum capability of the
1356000	1358000	device, so we had to abandon
1358000	1360000	the idea of the Circle Pad
1360000	1362000	support. I don't understand why that would
1362000	1364000	be. I mean,
1364000	1366000	aside from just, you know, the infrared
1366000	1368000	communication with it or something, but...
1368000	1370000	Is it battery drain, maybe?
1370000	1372000	It's not battery drain, because it's got an
1372000	1374000	external battery, but it's
1374000	1376000	just... I think
1376000	1378000	it's because they're using infrared to
1378000	1380000	send signals back and forth with it.
1380000	1382000	Instead of having to actually plug into
1382000	1384000	a port or something.
1384000	1386000	Which is dumb. It's really
1386000	1388000	stupid, because it should be absolutely
1388000	1390000	no extra load since
1390000	1392000	it's just buttons. It's not doing any
1392000	1394000	sort of processing other than
1394000	1396000	reading the inputs coming from those buttons.
1396000	1398000	But the fact that it has to
1398000	1400000	translate that data into something it can send over
1400000	1402000	IR and then re-translate that
1402000	1404000	back into something that the machine can understand is
1404000	1406000	that's where your overhead comes through. And why
1406000	1408000	is it 5%? That's retarded. That
1408000	1410000	should be 5% for something so
1410000	1412000	stupid and simple.
1412000	1414000	I honestly
1414000	1416000	think it's a power. It comes down to the power
1416000	1418000	source and the fact that the new one, since
1418000	1420000	it's built in, it's not going to drain from the same
1420000	1422000	power source. I really think that's what it comes down to.
1422000	1424000	Alright, one other thing I want to say
1424000	1426000	on Smash for the 3DS.
1426000	1428000	If for whatever reason you haven't bought it yet,
1428000	1430000	I know some of you are holding off for Pay Day
1430000	1432000	or whatever the case may be,
1432000	1434000	keep in mind you will have to grab an
1434000	1436000	update before you can actually play the game.
1436000	1438000	There is a patch out there.
1438000	1440000	You have to patch to 1.0.2.
1440000	1442000	That will allow you to play online,
1442000	1444000	I should say, because technically if your 3DS
1444000	1446000	never goes online, the game will never know it needs a patch.
1446000	1448000	But you will have to get this patch to play
1448000	1450000	online. So you can do
1450000	1452000	that by, you can actually go into the
1452000	1454000	eShop on the 3DS and grab
1454000	1456000	the patch now. You don't need the game
1456000	1458000	to get the patch and
1458000	1460000	that will get some of you guys ahead of the game.
1460000	1462000	So check that out if you think
1462000	1464000	you will be picking up Smash Bros. in the coming
1464000	1466000	days. So, there
1466000	1468000	you go. I hope you guys
1468000	1470000	are having fun with Smash Bros., those of you that do have
1470000	1472000	the game. So even though I said I'm not
1472000	1474000	so sure about the system and so forth, I still
1474000	1476000	think it's, I mean, you can't
1476000	1478000	say you don't get your money's worth out of this game.
1478000	1480000	That's for sure. So there's a
1480000	1482000	lot there.
1482000	1484000	Alright, let's move on to our
1484000	1486000	gaming weeks and what type of video games
1486000	1488000	we've been playing this week, I suppose besides
1488000	1490000	Smash Bros., to sort of
1490000	1492000	establish our frame of reference on
1492000	1494000	what we're up to in the gaming world.
1494000	1496000	DarkSakura, how about you?
1496000	1498000	Well, I did get Smash Bros.
1498000	1500000	I haven't played it yet.
1500000	1502000	I played Final Fantasy 14.
1502000	1504000	I played some Mass Effect.
1504000	1506000	I tried playing this
1506000	1508000	puzzle game on Steam. I forgot what it was called
1508000	1510000	but it sucked, so I stopped playing it.
1510000	1512000	And I played some Fractal because
1512000	1514000	I miss playing Fractal, make Blooms
1514000	1516000	not war. Fractal's really good.
1516000	1518000	And then I've also been playing a lot
1518000	1520000	of Moonlight Mahjong at work
1520000	1522000	during lunch.
1522000	1524000	It's actually ridiculously
1524000	1526000	fun because it makes my
1526000	1528000	brain do things. Is it actual Mahjong or is it
1528000	1530000	like that old, like the Solitaire Mahjong,
1530000	1532000	like that game Shanghai? Remember like
1532000	1534000	in the early, late 90's
1534000	1536000	like every computer had Shanghai.
1536000	1538000	It's single player
1538000	1540000	Mahjong puzzles.
1540000	1542000	It's the whole like moving the tiles? Okay, yeah.
1542000	1544000	Well, you don't move them around, you just pick the matches.
1544000	1546000	Yeah, but it has to be like certain rules, right?
1546000	1548000	Like you can only move the tiles left or
1548000	1550000	right to get them off the board. You can't move them up and down.
1550000	1552000	Something like that. You just click on them.
1552000	1554000	I know, but you can't click on any tile.
1554000	1556000	No, some of them you can only
1556000	1558000	move the ones off the sides or at the top.
1558000	1560000	You can only click tiles that are fully
1560000	1562000	exposed, I believe. That's it, something like that.
1562000	1564000	Like one or two times playing Mahjong.
1564000	1566000	Yeah, I mean, it's got the rules in it
1566000	1568000	but you just click them and they go.
1568000	1570000	And it makes my brain
1570000	1572000	not hurt anymore.
1572000	1574000	And things.
1574000	1576000	Alright. Loki, how was your
1576000	1578000	gaming week? I only really played a little
1578000	1580000	bit of Call of Duty multiplayer 2
1580000	1582000	because we finally did our game night again.
1582000	1584000	And then
1584000	1586000	just worked on my game.
1586000	1588000	That was pretty much it.
1588000	1590000	I'm probably going to play some more stuff.
1590000	1592000	I want to get a next gen system.
1592000	1594000	It's just
1594000	1596000	you know, having enough
1596000	1598000	extra money and having a job
1598000	1600000	to do that. Well, by the way,
1600000	1602000	thank you for bringing that up
1602000	1604000	because I wanted to at some point in the show congratulate
1604000	1606000	you. You got a job.
1606000	1608000	Yeah. Already. So, I mean, that's
1608000	1610000	amazing. Congratulations. I just don't start
1610000	1612000	yet. So, you know. You have a little
1612000	1614000	gap before you start. You have a little gap.
1614000	1616000	Hey, you know what?
1616000	1618000	Like a month gap, not nearly as bad.
1618000	1620000	Dude, Alan was out of work for like a year
1620000	1622000	and a half before he found something. And a lot of people
1622000	1624000	faced hard times like that. So, you know what?
1624000	1626000	Enjoy the time off to work
1626000	1628000	on your game. Yeah.
1628000	1630000	Hopefully. I'm still going to be applying for stuff.
1630000	1632000	I still have interviews and stuff.
1632000	1634000	In fact, I'm doing a couple phone interviews
1634000	1636000	tomorrow. Make them fight over you.
1636000	1638000	Yeah. Whoever's going to
1638000	1640000	offer me the most money. So, that's really
1640000	1642000	what it comes down to. There you go.
1642000	1644000	It's almost something I want to do.
1644000	1646000	So, I'm going to be doing that. But, yeah.
1646000	1648000	I worked on my game a little bit more. Still working
1648000	1650000	on the editor.
1650000	1652000	I'm almost done with it
1652000	1654000	because I was just trying to get a few tools
1654000	1656000	too. Because the editor's done as far
1656000	1658000	as what I needed for building
1658000	1660000	like ships and
1660000	1662000	the smaller things. But,
1662000	1664000	if I were to use that same editor
1664000	1666000	for building like a whole
1666000	1668000	level, it would take forever.
1668000	1670000	So, I needed to build like
1670000	1672000	basically
1672000	1674000	tools that we would see since it's
1674000	1676000	voxel based.
1676000	1678000	Similar tools you would see like in
1678000	1680000	World Build or something like that in Minecraft.
1680000	1682000	Where it's really fast.
1682000	1684000	Where you can just
1684000	1686000	design stuff
1686000	1688000	really fast with brushes and all
1688000	1690000	sorts of things. So, that's what I was coming
1690000	1692000	up with for my game right
1692000	1694000	now. So, I'm working on that so I can finish
1694000	1696000	actually start building some of the
1696000	1698000	assets for the game.
1698000	1700000	And that's pretty much it. I'm almost done
1700000	1702000	with that one. I finally
1702000	1704000	start working on it some more. Hopefully
1704000	1706000	get something that I can actually show. Once
1706000	1708000	the editor's done. Alright. Can't wait to see it.
1708000	1710000	Let's see. My
1710000	1712000	gaming week. I
1712000	1714000	played a lot of the same stuff
1714000	1716000	that you've heard me talk about before. Theatrythm.
1716000	1718000	Because Smash didn't come out until Friday. So, early
1718000	1720000	in the week I was like, must play more Theatrythm.
1720000	1722000	And I played a whole lot more.
1722000	1724000	I even did some DLC.
1724000	1726000	They released the Mooglemog song
1726000	1728000	from Final Fantasy XIV in Theatrythm. And I love
1728000	1730000	that song. And then I had to get Crazy
1730000	1732000	Chocobo. And I dedicate that to you
1732000	1734000	Acteft.
1734000	1736000	Crazy Chocobo from Final Fantasy
1736000	1738000	XIII-2 which is the heavy metal version
1738000	1740000	of the Chocobo theme that is
1740000	1742000	very divisive in people's opinions.
1742000	1744000	And let's see.
1744000	1746000	What else did I play this week?
1746000	1748000	I played more Diablo 3. I'm working on a hardcore
1748000	1750000	seasonal character. And I beat
1750000	1752000	story mode. And I'm all the way to level
1752000	1754000	52. And last night I
1754000	1756000	got very daring. Because it's a hardcore
1756000	1758000	character, right? So, I play it very conservative.
1758000	1760000	Because in hardcore, once you die,
1760000	1762000	you die. Like it's done.
1762000	1764000	Your character is done. You have to start over from the very beginning.
1764000	1766000	So, I've been playing on
1766000	1768000	normal. Like easy, normal, not
1768000	1770000	amping it up difficulty. But last night I said
1770000	1772000	you know what? I'm feeling
1772000	1774000	a little risky. Now that I've beaten the story mode
1774000	1776000	at least once, I'm gonna play a little risky.
1776000	1778000	So I amped up the difficulty one
1778000	1780000	notch to hard. And
1780000	1782000	it was definitely harder and kept me on my toes.
1782000	1784000	I had an oh shit moment.
1784000	1786000	But luckily my character is still alive.
1786000	1788000	Junior Mintz, my hunter.
1788000	1790000	Demon Hunter is still alive.
1790000	1792000	I named him after a box of candy that was sitting on my desk
1792000	1794000	when I made him. So there you go.
1794000	1796000	Junior Mintz is now level 52.
1796000	1798000	And let's see.
1798000	1800000	Other games I played this week.
1800000	1802000	I played
1802000	1804000	Final Fantasy 14
1804000	1806000	of course. Because I play a lot of that.
1806000	1808000	And
1808000	1810000	Destiny. That's the other one.
1810000	1812000	I played more Destiny. I hit
1812000	1814000	level 20 in Destiny.
1814000	1816000	And that ridiculous where you
1816000	1818000	have to get gear that has light on it
1818000	1820000	to level up. I really think that's the most
1820000	1822000	redonkulous thing I've heard.
1822000	1824000	Level up a character past level cap.
1824000	1826000	But whatever. I'm up to level 21
1826000	1828000	now. I'm like three quarters of the way through level
1828000	1830000	21 just praying I can get
1830000	1832000	a good loot drop to level up my stupid
1832000	1834000	character. I don't understand why it's called
1834000	1836000	a level cap if you can level up past
1836000	1838000	it. Because without the gear
1838000	1840000	you'll never level past it. It's all gear
1840000	1842000	based. Yeah I know. I can't stand it. I think
1842000	1844000	it's ridiculous design flaw.
1844000	1846000	But that's my opinion. Not everybody
1846000	1848000	is going to agree with me. Hey Rob.
1848000	1850000	I finally got around to naming my chocobo. Did you?
1850000	1852000	Hot Wings. Hot Wings
1852000	1854000	is the name in Final Fantasy 14 right?
1854000	1856000	My chocobo's name is Hot Wings. Good times.
1856000	1858000	Good times.
1858000	1860000	So yeah. Then I was playing Destiny. And I've done like
1860000	1862000	some random online stuff with that.
1862000	1864000	Including like doing some
1864000	1866000	strikes with like Shane and Extifer.
1866000	1868000	Or my friend Ian from Koopa Club.
1868000	1870000	You know. Whoever is on
1870000	1872000	and can do stuff. We will do that.
1872000	1874000	Dungeon Buster in chat
1874000	1876000	says 20 is the soft cap
1876000	1878000	and the hard cap is 30.
1878000	1880000	And then Alan letting everybody
1880000	1882000	know about this. That I did a live stream
1882000	1884000	of Final Fantasy 14 this week and I got
1884000	1886000	him to agree to do hunts. And he got
1886000	1888000	so mad he was real real mad.
1888000	1890000	That is accurate. Alan was like let's do
1890000	1892000	a hunt. And I hate
1892000	1894000	hunts in Final Fantasy 14. I think they're ridiculous.
1894000	1896000	I think they're way
1896000	1898000	too much of a necessity
1898000	1900000	for people to do to hit the cap if that's
1900000	1902000	what they want. And I think they made
1902000	1904000	they made them way too powerful.
1904000	1906000	And they're just a joke. Because everybody
1906000	1908000	just cluster fucks the mob and the
1908000	1910000	thing is dead in like 5 seconds.
1910000	1912000	You got like 60 people attacking this one thing.
1912000	1914000	And yeah. So they called
1914000	1916000	it out like oh here's where the mob is.
1916000	1918000	I ran to the wrong coordinates.
1918000	1920000	On accident. And so I was like 10
1920000	1922000	10 squares away on the
1922000	1924000	map or whatever. So as I'm running
1924000	1926000	to the right location the mob's already
1926000	1928000	dead. Like literally I walk
1928000	1930000	into the screen to see that the mob
1930000	1932000	just died. And I'm just like you know what? Fuck
1932000	1934000	hunts. And I logged out. And that was the end of my
1934000	1936000	livestream.
1936000	1938000	But I don't have anger issues
1938000	1940000	or anything. I actually get to
1940000	1942000	make a hunt tomorrow.
1942000	1944000	For what? For treasure hunting.
1944000	1946000	Sorry. Oh. Oh that. Oh that's
1946000	1948000	different. Yeah. Treasure hunts are different.
1948000	1950000	I'm okay with the treasure hunts.
1950000	1952000	Alright. Let us take care of
1952000	1954000	a few housekeeping things. I have a couple things to
1954000	1956000	mention. We will not
1956000	1958000	be here live on October
1958000	1960000	19th. That's two weeks from tonight.
1960000	1962000	The reason why I will be at
1962000	1964000	speaking of all this Final Fantasy talk. I will be at
1964000	1966000	Final Fantasy Fan Fest. And if I get to talk to
1966000	1968000	Yoshida-san I'm gonna say hunts
1968000	1970000	suck. So. But I love your game.
1970000	1972000	I love your game so much. That one part. Since I'm
1972000	1974000	not playing Final Fantasy 14 do they do any
1974000	1976000	of like the cool like holiday stuff that they
1976000	1978000	did in 11? I got a
1978000	1980000	bikini. Yeah they do. Cause my favorite was
1980000	1982000	that tree. The very first one that they did
1982000	1984000	with the tree that you couldn't kill because
1984000	1986000	there was a bug in it. And so
1986000	1988000	you just keep wailing on it and it's like
1988000	1990000	it just wouldn't die. They don't have like a
1990000	1992000	killer tree but they'll do like quests
1992000	1994000	and you get rewards
1994000	1996000	like usually their costumes. Some of the
1996000	1998000	end game. I've noticed that some of the end game holidays
1998000	2000000	tend to be referencing
2000000	2002000	back to some Japanese holidays as well
2002000	2004000	as Western holidays. Yeah.
2004000	2006000	So we're getting sort of the best of both.
2006000	2008000	Like didn't they do something for Golden Week?
2008000	2010000	Or they did the Midsummer
2010000	2012000	thing didn't they? They did the Midsummer thing for sure.
2012000	2014000	Yeah. So. Yeah.
2014000	2016000	Um. But uh.
2016000	2018000	You should
2018000	2020000	you should come play with us.
2020000	2022000	One of us. Alright.
2022000	2024000	Do the thing. So we
2024000	2026000	will not be here in two weeks live
2026000	2028000	although we're hoping to have something on the feet.
2028000	2030000	Yes. Bodies. That might be a busy week
2030000	2032000	for a lot of us. So we will not be here October
2032000	2034000	19th. Um.

2054000	2056000	is up to. Speaking of interviews. It's
2056000	2058000	raining interviews here at VOG and we
2058000	2060000	love it. And Bobby has some of
2060000	2062000	his own going on. In fact
2062000	2064000	next week on his show. That's October 12th.
2064000	2066000	He's going to have Kyle Pittman
2066000	2068000	who's the creator of the recently
2068000	2070000	released Super Win the Game.
2070000	2072000	Kyle used to be with Gearbox
2072000	2074000	Software. He worked on Borderlands 2
2074000	2076000	and now he's Indie. Also
2076000	2078000	this is interesting because Bobby has some ties
2078000	2080000	in with Kyle Pittman.
2080000	2082000	He's never actually spoken
2082000	2084000	to him. However
2084000	2086000	he's one half of the brothers that
2086000	2088000	made the game that Bobby did a
2088000	2090000	soundtrack for in 99.
2090000	2092000	So this is an interesting reunion
2092000	2094000	of sorts. Even though they've never actually met.
2094000	2096000	So that will be a fun interview. So check that out
2096000	2098000	next week on Bobby's show. He is of course
2098000	2100000	live before us
2100000	2102000	here at the Voice of the Geese Network. VOGnetwork.com
2102000	2104000	Now tonight he wasn't live. He had
2104000	2106000	an interview from Siege with
2106000	2108000	Snarfquest Tales
2108000	2110000	and this is based on the comic
2110000	2112000	series by Larry
2112000	2114000	Elmore who I know Dar Sockra is a big fan
2114000	2116000	of. Oh hell yeah. Dragon
2116000	2118000	Lance. I thought for a second
2118000	2120000	there that it might have something to do with
2120000	2122000	the character from
2122000	2124000	Thundercats. Wasn't it?
2124000	2126000	No not in this case. Not in this case.
2126000	2128000	But yeah you can check out the
2128000	2130000	interview on Bobby's show. You can also check out the game
2130000	2132000	itself if you want. Snarfquesttales.com
2132000	2134000	So check that
2134000	2136000	out. And oh my gosh
2136000	2138000	the interviews don't stop and we are
2138000	2140000	so excited because here at
2140000	2142000	Orange Lounge Radio we actually
2142000	2144000	have another interview planned for next
2144000	2146000	week and this is pretty cool because this is some
2146000	2148000	Indie stuff going on. But
2148000	2150000	we will have Bodhi from
2150000	2152000	Lunar Ray Games on
2152000	2154000	the show next week live.
2154000	2156000	They're making a game called Time
2156000	2158000	Spinner and it's a Metroidvania
2158000	2160000	type of game with some really cool like retro
2160000	2162000	looks to it. This game was on Kickstarter
2162000	2164000	and did very well on Kickstarter.
2164000	2166000	So we're going to check in and see how the game's coming
2166000	2168000	along and see what folks can
2168000	2170000	look forward to with that. And we will have
2170000	2172000	him on live next week.
2172000	2174000	So the 12th is going to be a very
2174000	2176000	busy night Sunday nights here at VOG.
2176000	2178000	Alright let's get into tonight
2178000	2180000	however with some gaming news.
2180000	2182000	Loke you want to start us off with some news.
2182000	2184000	Yes. When I'm not eating
2184000	2186000	waffle fries I read the news.
2186000	2188000	Waffle fries are pretty damn good. They're pretty good.
2188000	2190000	So thanks
2190000	2192000	to I guess a lot of pressure from
2192000	2194000	consumers
2194000	2196000	gamers everywhere. There's
2196000	2198000	been some policy changes now
2198000	2200000	with Twitch including
2200000	2202000	that they now want
2202000	2204000	broadcasters that are
2204000	2206000	broadcasting stuff with you know
2206000	2208000	sponsorship from
2208000	2210000	you know a company
2210000	2212000	basically to be transparent
2212000	2214000	about that. So if you're getting paid to
2214000	2216000	play something on
2216000	2218000	Twitch by
2218000	2220000	that publisher
2220000	2222000	that you say hey this is going to be
2222000	2224000	this is a sponsored
2224000	2226000	broadcast so that
2226000	2228000	people know that it's not just like
2228000	2230000	you know
2230000	2232000	it may
2232000	2234000	not be entirely unbiased I guess
2234000	2236000	if you will. You know they do
2236000	2238000	that like sponsored content I see that sometimes
2238000	2240000	on well you see that on Twitter
2240000	2242000	actually quite a bit. It's sort of like similar
2242000	2244000	like here at VOG when we and we
2244000	2246000	don't get to do a lot of reviews
2246000	2248000	because you know we don't most of our
2248000	2250000	staff makes podcasts so
2250000	2252000	we don't have a whole lot of dedicated writers
2252000	2254000	but like when we do
2254000	2256000	have the chance to review things we always
2256000	2258000	kind of put at the end of it like
2258000	2260000	you know either this was something we bought
2260000	2262000	this was something that was you know
2262000	2264000	we were given a key to you know it's like
2264000	2266000	the acquisition method just to
2266000	2268000	just to make sure everybody
2268000	2270000	understands you know throwing
2270000	2272000	it out there because honestly
2272000	2274000	I think for a lot of people
2274000	2276000	like if it's free
2276000	2278000	versus if it's $60 could
2278000	2280000	sway your opinion one way or the other. Now when you
2280000	2282000	review a game and it was giving you free
2282000	2284000	you're really supposed to ask yourself
2284000	2286000	you know treat it like you paid the $60
2286000	2288000	for it and is it that value but
2288000	2290000	we still put that out there just to make sure everything
2290000	2292000	you know full disclosure. Well this I think is
2292000	2294000	a little bit more like you know say
2294000	2296000	you follow someone and even I think they
2296000	2298000	were talking about something and this may
2298000	2300000	have even come from YouTube where there's a lot of
2300000	2302000	content streamers out there that oh yeah we have
2302000	2304000	deals with some of these guys where you know
2304000	2306000	we will
2306000	2308000	be in like some sort of you know
2308000	2310000	partnership with this company
2310000	2312000	to do you know they're
2312000	2314000	going to pay us to do let's plays for this
2314000	2316000	game or something and a lot
2316000	2318000	of times they don't disclose that.
2318000	2320000	So this you know is
2320000	2322000	kind of along the lines where you
2322000	2324000	know they want to make sure that it's
2324000	2326000	completely clear that you know
2326000	2328000	you're getting paid to do that. Same
2328000	2330000	goes with Steam. Steam now also
2330000	2332000	thanks to their new curator
2332000	2334000	you know feature
2334000	2336000	on there. Now they also
2336000	2338000	are requiring you to disclose
2338000	2340000	if you're a sponsored
2340000	2342000	curator so like you know if it's
2342000	2344000	a company that's you know
2344000	2346000	putting out a certain game
2346000	2348000	and they have a Steam curation thing
2348000	2350000	that you know hey
2350000	2352000	let you guys know
2352000	2354000	that if you're paying somebody
2354000	2356000	that feature that on their
2356000	2358000	curator I guess
2358000	2360000	curator page so if you
2360000	2362000	basically you know it boils down to if
2362000	2364000	you've accepted money or other
2364000	2366000	compensation for making a product review
2366000	2368000	or posting a recommendation
2368000	2370000	you must disclose this fact for
2370000	2372000	in your recommendation.
2372000	2374000	And also
2374000	2376000	this should not link or link to
2376000	2378000	or promote any stores other than
2378000	2380000	Steam of course you know because
2380000	2382000	they want the sales from their
2382000	2384000	websites list yeah of course
2384000	2386000	so I haven't explored
2386000	2388000	setting that all up like is that something
2388000	2390000	I thought if I set up a curator
2390000	2392000	page would people care? Like I kind of
2392000	2394000	I kind of think you all know my opinions on a lot of
2394000	2396000	games anyway you know. And then honestly
2396000	2398000	I think a lot of well I thought the page was
2398000	2400000	for groups only so like you had
2400000	2402000	to I don't know if like if I could make my own
2402000	2404000	curator page oh it would have to be like a vog
2404000	2406000	yeah I think it has to be a group
2406000	2408000	I thought I don't know I haven't really
2408000	2410000	looked too much into it but
2410000	2412000	I don't know
2412000	2414000	I mean it's good I guess that there's this transparency
2414000	2416000	because that's what a lot of people have been complaining about
2416000	2418000	so you know
2418000	2420000	more power to them I guess.
2420000	2422000	Now before we move on
2422000	2424000	since you brought up YouTube and that too
2424000	2426000	you know one of the stories that
2426000	2428000	I don't think is on our show or otherwise tonight
2428000	2430000	but there was these
2430000	2432000	stories going around a lot of the gaming blogs about
2432000	2434000	how there's people out there that are
2434000	2436000	impersonating
2436000	2438000	celebrity or
2438000	2440000	professional YouTubers for lack of a better term
2440000	2442000	to get free keys for games
2442000	2444000	that they then flip and sell on
2444000	2446000	eBay. Did you read about this?
2446000	2448000	Well they're not even selling them yeah not even just on eBay
2448000	2450000	but like on like other
2450000	2452000	key reseller sites you know
2452000	2454000	some of which have
2454000	2456000	in the past bought the cheap
2456000	2458000	bundle stuff and flip it for
2458000	2460000	you know more money. Yeah
2460000	2462000	I mean it's just unfortunately
2462000	2464000	something you're going to run into I think even
2464000	2466000	not even necessarily
2466000	2468000	just
2468000	2470000	you know just
2470000	2472000	this type of thing but in people
2472000	2474000	impersonating other people but even just like
2474000	2476000	no name people just kind of asking
2476000	2478000	hey can I have a key you know that type of thing
2478000	2480000	and they've kind of
2480000	2482000	in the different stories I read that their advice
2482000	2484000	was you know either A
2484000	2486000	handle it through like a
2486000	2488000	PR firm or something like that
2488000	2490000	B you know handle it through
2490000	2492000	like if it's you're getting
2492000	2494000	requests from different YouTube
2494000	2496000	guys that you
2496000	2498000	follow up or have them make that
2498000	2500000	request via like a
2500000	2502000	message through YouTube
2502000	2504000	you know send them like a
2504000	2506000	you know a private message or whatever through YouTube
2506000	2508000	that way you can you know
2508000	2510000	say OK this is actually from this person not
2510000	2512000	just someone impersonating
2512000	2514000	them. So
2514000	2516000	I mean that makes sense.
2516000	2518000	Unfortunately you know
2518000	2520000	when you're you know sending out
2520000	2522000	emails or letting people know
2522000	2524000	PR and stuff that hey
2524000	2526000	you know if you want to review this game I can get
2526000	2528000	you a key for it and stuff and unfortunately
2528000	2530000	people want handouts you know
2530000	2532000	they want free stuff so they're going to do
2532000	2534000	whatever they can to manipulate
2534000	2536000	the system. Well it's not even the it's not even the free
2536000	2538000	stuff it's the people that turn them around and
2538000	2540000	resell them on these on these code sites and so forth
2540000	2542000	like it's more than that it's stolen
2542000	2544000	goods basically. Yeah crazy.
2544000	2546000	Yeah because I read it was I forget what game it was
2546000	2548000	but it was he'd actually
2548000	2550000	saw it was available on this one site
2550000	2552000	he's like well that's weird because I haven't even
2552000	2554000	released it you know other than
2554000	2556000	you know these reviewers
2556000	2558000	so houses on it. Yeah
2558000	2560000	the code. Yeah. Yeah. So
2560000	2562000	wow. Yeah.
2562000	2564000	That's that's pretty pretty bad
2564000	2566000	that people are you know singing
2566000	2568000	that low to do that. But you know it's
2568000	2570000	I'm not completely surprised
2570000	2572000	by it. And now
2572000	2574000	just quickly to answer the curator question
2574000	2576000	in our chatroom. Actf says a friend of mine
2576000	2578000	set up his own curator page
2578000	2580000	so yeah you can make your own. Groups
2580000	2582000	have curator pages made by default
2582000	2584000	so that might be. So VOG
2584000	2586000	has its own curator page now but
2586000	2588000	nobody has done recommendations since
2588000	2590000	it's only for group admins. Oh I didn't
2590000	2592000	know that that was a thing. But again
2592000	2594000	like I don't know like
2594000	2596000	what we would do because we're
2596000	2598000	really about like a variety of games
2598000	2600000	like should we do a list of these are games
2600000	2602000	that got a B or better review
2602000	2604000	on VOG or yeah I don't know I don't know what we do
2604000	2606000	so I think for now it'll stay
2606000	2608000	blank. I don't know. I kind of
2608000	2610000	feel like if you want to know our thoughts on games
2610000	2612000	check out the podcast. But
2612000	2614000	maybe we can think of a use for it.
2614000	2616000	Well hey hey I know we can do
2616000	2618000	we can just wait for you know Aaron
2618000	2620000	to port over
2620000	2622000	you know bungee ferret tossing. There you go.
2622000	2624000	So once bungee ferret tossing makes us
2624000	2626000	esteem it'll just be our list of one game
2626000	2628000	you need to check out. Oh there you go. Absolutely I'm all for that.
2628000	2630000	Alright well here's a game
2630000	2632000	a lot of people want to check out but some people
2632000	2634000	are very frustrated by
2634000	2636000	the number of systems that
2636000	2638000	it's on. Jamie you want to jump in here?
2638000	2640000	I just remember the other game I played.
2640000	2642000	Oh my gosh why? Hot to Full Boyfriend
2642000	2644000	which I would totally give recommendations
2644000	2646000	for since it's on Steam. Speaking of streaming
2646000	2648000	and all that right? Yeah.
2648000	2650000	Alright. I don't know why I didn't think about it.
2650000	2652000	Well I have a feeling you're going to dig this game
2652000	2654000	to Dark Sakura if you ever get a chance to play it.
2654000	2656000	You might have to come over here. Does it include dating pigeons?
2656000	2658000	Actually it might.
2658000	2660000	And it would be here at
2660000	2662000	my house for sure
2662000	2664000	because I actually have the Wii U
2664000	2666000	so you could play Bayonetta 2
2666000	2668000	which yeah see
2668000	2670000	a lot of folks looking forward to that and I know I'm looking
2670000	2672000	forward to this too.
2672000	2674000	Hideki Kamiya who's
2674000	2676000	with Platinum Games one of the producers there
2676000	2678000	has reiterated to fans
2678000	2680000	this week that you know other publishers
2680000	2682000	turned down Bayonetta 2
2682000	2684000	only Nintendo stepped in to help.
2684000	2686000	That's bullshit. I'm sorry.
2686000	2688000	I haven't even read the damn quote yet. I'm sorry.
2688000	2690000	Sit down.
2690000	2692000	I think I've discussed this many times before
2692000	2694000	but here goes. First of all, we, Platinum
2694000	2696000	Games are developers and receive
2696000	2698000	support from publishers by making games that they
2698000	2700000	request or suggest. As for Bayonetta
2700000	2702000	we developed the game after signing a deal with
2702000	2704000	Sega. Later it was decided to also
2704000	2706000	develop the sequel so we started working on Bayonetta 2.
2706000	2708000	When development had progressed
2708000	2710000	to a certain degree and Sega's situation
2710000	2712000	had turned into this isn't a good plan
2712000	2714000	so development halted temporarily.
2714000	2716000	Without funding we didn't have the possibility
2716000	2718000	to continue development but we wanted to get this
2718000	2720000	partially developed Bayonetta 2 available to
2720000	2722000	public one way or another so we offered it to various
2722000	2724000	publishers but as it is a big title
2724000	2726000	we couldn't find a partner company. Finally
2726000	2728000	Bayonetta 2 is about to get terminated completely
2728000	2730000	when Nintendo came in and lent
2730000	2732000	a hand we were able to restart the development
2732000	2734000	we so desired. Finally the game was released
2734000	2736000	last week in Japan so five years
2736000	2738000	we were able to make Bayonetta 2 available
2738000	2740000	to the public. Knowing those
2740000	2742000	circumstances if someone is still angry
2742000	2744000	for heading towards Nintendo I wonder what's
2744000	2746000	the reason for that? Wouldn't you tell me in a way
2746000	2748000	that's easy to understand? As I have
2748000	2750000	said earlier if you want Bayonetta 2 on
2750000	2752000	PS4 or Xbox One how about trying to
2752000	2754000	ask Nintendo? If Nintendo doesn't
2754000	2756000	say yes it's not going to happen.
2756000	2758000	While you're at it try asking for Mario
2758000	2760000	and Zelda 2. Ooh!
2760000	2762000	Somebody's
2762000	2764000	somebody had carried a little
2764000	2766000	whip with that comment but he's right
2766000	2768000	in a way. But Loki you claim
2768000	2770000	shenanigans. I claim shenanigans because
2770000	2772000	there's companies like Axes Games
2772000	2774000	that will fucking pay to have
2774000	2776000	almost anything localized. I mean
2776000	2778000	just ridiculous
2778000	2780000	niche games. This isn't a matter
2780000	2782000	of localization though. Localization
2782000	2784000	is way cheaper than development.
2784000	2786000	There's a big difference.
2786000	2788000	I don't think Axes Games has
2788000	2790000	quite the pockets. Now maybe
2790000	2792000	Atlas but maybe
2792000	2794000	that's somebody that was approached we don't know.
2794000	2796000	Or here's another thing.
2796000	2798000	Fucking self-publish on
2798000	2800000	PS4 or Xbox One. You can do
2800000	2802000	that you know. You don't need
2802000	2804000	a publisher. But who
2804000	2806000	pays for the development? You can't say
2806000	2808000	oh I'll pay you when we're
2808000	2810000	done. Like you can't do that.
2810000	2812000	You have to pay these people as the game is
2812000	2814000	development. Who's going to pay for that?
2814000	2816000	Kickstarter it.
2816000	2818000	Well okay.
2818000	2820000	Now that could
2820000	2822000	be an option. Now we could
2822000	2824000	Kickstarter it. But I think when this game was being
2824000	2826000	developed that really hadn't
2826000	2828000	gone through yet. So I don't know
2828000	2830000	Loki. Hold out hope for Bayonetta 3.
2830000	2832000	I hope they make
2832000	2834000	their money back on you know. I hope they do
2834000	2836000	too. On this
2836000	2838000	game cause
2838000	2840000	it's not looking good so far.
2840000	2842000	Let me put it that way. It's going to really suck
2842000	2844000	if they invested so
2844000	2846000	much into this game and
2846000	2848000	it doesn't end up making
2848000	2850000	that money back. I just hope
2850000	2852000	the Wii U audience doesn't limit them. I hope
2852000	2854000	Bayonetta and Smash can kinda
2854000	2856000	exist together. I just think
2856000	2858000	they develop on
2858000	2860000	PC
2860000	2862000	and it gets ported to the Wii U.
2862000	2864000	I mean they don't develop on a Wii U.
2864000	2866000	It's just something they test on.
2866000	2868000	It's developed on PC. It's fucking
2868000	2870000	apparently really easy to port
2870000	2872000	over to the PlayStation. I would imagine it's gotta be
2872000	2874000	pretty easy to port on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
2874000	2876000	being that they're more powerful systems.
2876000	2878000	But he's right. Nintendo paid for it.
2878000	2880000	It's Nintendo's game. Nintendo will have to be the one
2880000	2882000	to put it on the PC. Will Nintendo do that?
2882000	2884000	I mean they could.
2884000	2886000	I mean I just don't think
2886000	2888000	Nintendo will cause they're kinda stubborn like that.
2888000	2890000	It's like you'd have better luck
2890000	2892000	getting a Mario game on the PC.
2892000	2894000	They're not a company like Microsoft where
2894000	2896000	oh Halo 2 had a PC version.
2896000	2898000	You know. Well
2898000	2900000	I guess
2900000	2902000	it's just gonna
2902000	2904000	just sell like you know Mad World
2904000	2906000	did where you know it's
2906000	2908000	a great game and you know both
2908000	2910000	Platinum games and you know more power to them
2910000	2912000	but unfortunately it's just not something that's
2912000	2914000	gonna sell a lot of copies. Or let's
2914000	2916000	do crazy internet forum
2916000	2918000	speak. Let's do crazy wank theories
2918000	2920000	that people come up with like oh oh
2920000	2922000	this is what's gonna happen. Oh oh you guys you guys
2922000	2924000	this is what's gonna happen. This is what's gonna happen. Okay okay
2924000	2926000	you guys. Apple's gonna buy Nintendo
2926000	2928000	and then Bayonetta 2 will be on
2928000	2930000	the Mac. That's cause Apple and Nintendo
2930000	2932000	they have to be in bed together. That's right. Apple and
2932000	2934000	Nintendo they're like the same. Like Nintendo
2934000	2936000	is like Apple in Japan.
2936000	2938000	That's what's gonna happen. Loki that's what's gonna happen.
2938000	2940000	It's gonna happen.
2940000	2942000	Well
2942000	2944000	first off
2944000	2946000	you know
2946000	2948000	first off there's not a lot of games on them you know
2948000	2950000	you know the Mac anyways
2950000	2952000	but I mean I don't know. I could see them
2952000	2954000	maybe putting out
2954000	2956000	something for like you know
2956000	2958000	another
2958000	2960000	you know iPad or something like that. I mean
2960000	2962000	cause they're really pushing you know gaming.
2962000	2964000	Is there a Bayonetta on the fucking iPad?
2964000	2966000	Like it's just it doesn't. Why they've got like
2966000	2968000	what is it Infinity Blade on the fucking iPad?
2968000	2970000	I just don't see it. You know it's an action game
2970000	2972000	I mean I don't know.
2972000	2974000	I don't know. I'm
2974000	2976000	I'm looking forward very much to checking out
2976000	2978000	Bayonetta 2. I have a Wii U.
2978000	2980000	This isn't a problem for me.
2980000	2982000	It's the Xbox One exclusives that are
2982000	2984000	bugging me right now like Forza Horizon 2. Oh yeah.
2984000	2986000	I wanted to play that shit. No yeah exactly.
2986000	2988000	Forza Horizon 2 I totally want that.
2988000	2990000	Alright. Uh
2990000	2992000	Moving on. Dark Soccer. What do you have for us?
2992000	2994000	Uh we do have uh something
2994000	2996000	a new game coming out but not new new
2996000	2998000	new new. It's uh Star Wars Arcade
2998000	3000000	Machine is gonna be coming out. Yes.
3000000	3002000	They uh it's gonna be
3002000	3004000	uh uh
3004000	3006000	premiered at New York Comic Con
3006000	3008000	and Namco Bandai will be bringing out the new
3008000	3010000	Star Wars Arcade. It's uh totally coin
3010000	3012000	op so
3012000	3014000	very surprising but I guess
3014000	3016000	if they say it can be done it can be done. Prequels
3016000	3018000	aren't in it right? I don't think so.
3018000	3020000	But they said um there is
3020000	3022000	a press unveiling on October 8th
3022000	3024000	so we're not gonna
3024000	3026000	see it until it's actually out so
3026000	3028000	who knows. What kind of game
3028000	3030000	is it though? What does it say?
3030000	3032000	Is it gonna be like
3032000	3034000	well I mean they seem to
3034000	3036000	do these Star Wars arcade games pretty
3036000	3038000	regularly like you know there's the old school
3038000	3040000	Atari vector one right and then they had that one
3040000	3042000	not that long ago well actually probably yeah
3042000	3044000	it was a long time ago like 10 years at this point
3044000	3046000	which was like the right when the
3046000	3048000	prequels were probably like big where you
3048000	3050000	like you had the big lightsaber thing
3050000	3052000	the pod racer game was kind of okay. Stick in the
3052000	3054000	middle that you would like fight lightsaber
3054000	3056000	battles with. It was kind of neat.
3056000	3058000	I think the only good thing that ever came out of the prequels was
3058000	3060000	the pod racer game. Yeah. That was kind of
3060000	3062000	fun. Other than that. And the new
3062000	3064000	Star Tours. Like believe it or not
3064000	3066000	when you go to Jar Jar Binks' planet that's
3066000	3068000	like the best one. I know
3068000	3070000	I know bite my tongue but seriously
3070000	3072000	that's the best. That was the one that made me jump.
3072000	3074000	Yeah. That ending. Yeah. I finally
3074000	3076000	got Hoth did I tell you. Did you?
3076000	3078000	Yeah. It took me forever to get Hoth.
3078000	3080000	Hoth is cool. Hoth was the best. Literally.
3080000	3082000	It is. It's literally
3082000	3084000	cool. It's cold.
3084000	3086000	Anyway. You know who else
3086000	3088000	is cool. These guys who like to drop
3088000	3090000	into OLR occasionally and they're
3090000	3092000	back with us tonight. They snuck into the
3092000	3094000	studio through the door
3094000	3096000	and came back to say hi for another week
3096000	3098000	but I'm glad they're here. Welcome back you guys
3098000	3100000	from the big
3100000	3102000	yes the big anime
3102000	3104000	game room. Did I give that
3104000	3106000	out of order? Anyway. Jonas and
3106000	3108000	Diego are back tonight. Did I say that right?
3108000	3110000	Hello. I think it's the big ass game
3110000	3112000	anime room. The big ass game room?
3112000	3114000	No it's the big anime game room.
3114000	3116000	Is it the big ass game room?
3116000	3118000	Some people in this room like ass an awful lot.
3118000	3120000	Sounds like room for future
3120000	3122000	development.
3122000	3124000	We got another A in there I guess.
3124000	3126000	Big ass ass. That's right.
3126000	3128000	Big ass anime. So how you guys doing?
3128000	3130000	We're doing good. How are you doing?
3130000	3132000	How are things? Good. You missed us talking
3132000	3134000	about Smash. Have you guys
3134000	3136000	checked out the new Smash on 3DS yet?
3136000	3138000	I've been trying to keep up on it right now and people are
3138000	3140000	figuring out stuff left and right.
3140000	3142000	Even when the demo was out people were just figuring out things
3142000	3144000	but as they unlock more characters
3144000	3146000	they're just figuring out that some of these characters
3146000	3148000	are somewhat broken from what I heard.
3148000	3150000	Uh oh. They're breaking the game as we
3150000	3152000	speak right now.
3152000	3154000	It's only been out for a couple of days
3154000	3156000	now and people had just
3156000	3158000	a few tournaments locally around here and
3158000	3160000	people were saying things. I'm seeing people who are appearing
3160000	3162000	that I've never seen in my life that play games
3162000	3164000	that are winning. Wait they're already
3164000	3166000	having tournaments and this game came out on Friday?
3166000	3168000	Yes they are. What the
3168000	3170000	hell?
3170000	3172000	Yeah I had a couple of locals in some of the comic
3172000	3174000	stores around here and uh
3174000	3176000	yeah it's been pulling crowds. Oh my gosh.
3176000	3178000	Just on Saturday there was a big
3178000	3180000	one in San Jose in the GameStop and it
3180000	3182000	pulled enough. You literally would have like 30 hours
3182000	3184000	to prepare for this. Oh my god.
3184000	3186000	You know somebody was like Red Bull
3186000	3188000	Red Bull just in my
3188000	3190000	veins. They just want to get
3190000	3192000	Did Loki just get up to go get a Red Bull?
3192000	3194000	Oh my
3194000	3196000	god. Product placement. They're just trying to
3196000	3198000	unlock everything and figure out the game as fast as they can.
3198000	3200000	It's still relatively new so like it's anyways
3200000	3202000	game right now. Okay I'm struggling to
3202000	3204000	unlock characters because I'm just really bad
3204000	3206000	at Smash okay? And what the hell did they do
3206000	3208000	to Meta Knight? Oh my god.
3208000	3210000	Meta Knight used to be my go to. Like I understand he was
3210000	3212000	like so unbalanced like he was banned in tournaments
3212000	3214000	and shit but like now he does this
3214000	3216000	like torpedo shit. That just means he's bad ass
3216000	3218000	and you need to buff up everybody else.
3218000	3220000	Right? You know what Dan said
3220000	3222000	yesterday? Huh. You know
3222000	3224000	I miss Jigglypuff.
3224000	3226000	Uh Jigglypuff's an unlock. Spoiler
3226000	3228000	alerts. Okay. So you'll get Jigglypuff
3228000	3230000	eventually. Keep playing. But Dan
3230000	3232000	was just like I can't believe
3232000	3234000	he said that. I miss
3234000	3236000	Jigglypuff. Really? What about Snake?
3236000	3238000	Does anyone miss Solid Snake being
3238000	3240000	a little bit cause I thought
3240000	3242000	Snake was cool as a character but I understand
3242000	3244000	I understand like why.
3244000	3246000	He's also on the game too.
3246000	3248000	He's an unlock. Snake is in the
3248000	3250000	new game as well. No.
3250000	3252000	I thought he was like a DLC or something
3252000	3254000	like supposedly. No. He's either
3254000	3256000	one of the two. They said he was gonna be in this game.
3256000	3258000	I think he was on a list for supposed
3258000	3260000	DLC so but I do not believe
3260000	3262000	he's an unlock in the base roster.
3262000	3264000	Yeah I'm pretty sure cause you wouldn't
3264000	3266000	you wouldn't have a third party character. They already have the whole
3266000	3268000	game unlocked in Japan I thought already.
3268000	3270000	Yeah no I don't think Snake is in there.
3270000	3272000	Sonic is though.
3272000	3274000	Which you know that was cool
3274000	3276000	to have him back. Are his legs normal
3276000	3278000	sized?
3278000	3280000	Or is that like you know a pallet swap where you can
3280000	3282000	adjust the size of his legs. No
3282000	3284000	his legs are not.
3284000	3286000	Act F says the last unlock
3286000	3288000	is Jigglypuff. There you go.
3288000	3290000	Kaijuto in chat says Wii Fit Trainer
3290000	3292000	kicks ass and Little Mac. I like
3292000	3294000	all the different skins you can do
3294000	3296000	because like with Little Mac
3296000	3298000	you can like have the wire frame
3298000	3300000	with Little Mac from the old school punch out.
3300000	3302000	Like did anybody play punch out in the arcades
3302000	3304000	like back in the day before it was an NES game? Like it was a big
3304000	3306000	wire frame character he used to play as.
3306000	3308000	So I thought that was really cool. Yeah that was a nice feature
3308000	3310000	they did there. Yeah I love that. And
3310000	3312000	Bowser Jr. I didn't know this until
3312000	3314000	Shane was telling me about it. You can cycle
3314000	3316000	through and Bowser Jr. all the
3316000	3318000	pallet swaps are all of the Koopa
3318000	3320000	kids with Bowser Jr.'s moves.
3320000	3322000	So you can play every single one of them.
3322000	3324000	That's amazing. And
3324000	3326000	spoiler I'm totally glad that
3326000	3328000	Rob the Robot is back. Yes.
3328000	3330000	That was a fun character to play as.
3330000	3332000	It is, it is. So I just found
3332000	3334000	a fun screenshot that I will link in the chat room
3334000	3336000	of everyone who made the
3336000	3338000	cast of
3338000	3340000	King of the Hill
3340000	3342000	as Mies. Oh as Mies.
3342000	3344000	What the hell does that have to do with what we're talking about?
3344000	3346000	Oh it's in Smash Bros. It's Mies. I saw
3346000	3348000	one with RuPaul's Drag Race characters
3348000	3350000	as Mies. And I thought that was great. Someone had a
3350000	3352000	Neil deGrasse Tyson. Nice.
3352000	3354000	I saw a doctor.
3354000	3356000	Doctor Who. So I thought that was pretty cool.
3356000	3358000	Jonas how about you?
3358000	3360000	Have you been playing Smash at all?
3360000	3362000	I haven't gotten Smash yet because I'm just
3362000	3364000	waiting for the Wii U version. I know everyone says
3364000	3366000	get the 3DS version. But
3366000	3368000	again the 3DS I have
3368000	3370000	is actually my fiancé's.
3370000	3372000	And it's mainly for her Pokemon plays.
3372000	3374000	Because she's been
3374000	3376000	playing more Pokemon competitively
3376000	3378000	because of the upcoming regionals.
3378000	3380000	I actually think that's an okay
3380000	3382000	perspective. Not everybody's going to agree with me
3382000	3384000	but I also kind of put it out there during
3384000	3386000	my little review of it. As I said
3386000	3388000	the biggest problem with Smash Bros.
3388000	3390000	is the platform that it's on. Honestly.
3390000	3392000	It's too much for the 3DS.
3392000	3394000	And I think it'll be great on
3394000	3396000	the Wii U. For me this is like
3396000	3398000	a demo for the Wii U version.
3398000	3400000	Don't get me wrong. Yes it's in the 3DS version.
3400000	3402000	But I think this is just an opinion based.
3402000	3404000	I think in terms of
3404000	3406000	processing power it was designed mainly for
3406000	3408000	the new Nintendo 3DS.
3408000	3410000	Yeah. I mean this thing pushes
3410000	3412000	the limits of the 3DS and kind of
3412000	3414000	then some. Honestly it pushes it beyond
3414000	3416000	because you can't even do Miiverse with it.
3416000	3418000	So.
3418000	3420000	That's sad that we're already at
3420000	3422000	the limits of this system
3422000	3424000	what? A couple years from
3424000	3426000	its release? It's been longer than you think.
3426000	3428000	I think 3DS has been out like what?
3428000	3430000	5 years now I want to say?
3430000	3432000	No. 4. Maybe 4.
3432000	3434000	2010, 2011 I think.
3434000	3436000	Maybe 2010. About 4 years.
3436000	3438000	So. It was after
3438000	3440000	well because I bought my 3DS after I was
3440000	3442000	living at the house so it would have been
3442000	3444000	2009 or
3444000	3446000	after 2009 so it would have been 2010 or
3446000	3448000	later. Yeah.
3448000	3450000	But yeah. I mean
3450000	3452000	technology is a rapidly
3452000	3454000	evolving industry. I mean look at a lot of
3454000	3456000	phones. Like you know a lot of people talk
3456000	3458000	about like the Apple like the iOS
3458000	3460000	doesn't run on you know certain older
3460000	3462000	phones and the same thing happens on Android
3462000	3464000	you can't run the new
3464000	3466000	Kit Kat or whatever they call them. Little candy bar
3466000	3468000	platforms on certain older Android
3468000	3470000	devices like they just they have to be refreshed every few years.
3470000	3472000	I'm really looking forward to the
3472000	3474000	3DX XL that's coming out
3474000	3476000	on October 10th that's the old school
3476000	3478000	NES controller. I
3478000	3480000	have mixed feelings on that because I so
3480000	3482000	like what bogs me about is that they didn't
3482000	3484000	change the inside at all like they did with the
3484000	3486000	advanced SP that looked like the NES
3486000	3488000	so the outside just kind of looks like
3488000	3490000	somebody put a sticker on it you know. That's
3490000	3492000	the only but I love my retro
3492000	3494000	NES too don't get me wrong but it's just
3494000	3496000	I wish they'd done a little more with it.
3496000	3498000	The only thing else that just kind of applies to is that the box
3498000	3500000	that comes with it looks like the regular NES
3500000	3502000	that's about all they just kind of add it to that
3502000	3504000	so you have the controller which is the actual
3504000	3506000	console itself and the box that's the
3506000	3508000	NES. That's kind of cool. That part's cool.
3508000	3510000	Alright well
3510000	3512000	we're going to move on with some news
3512000	3514000	but by all means guys chime in as you
3514000	3516000	hear things in the news you want to comment on so
3516000	3518000	let's move on with some more news. Loki.
3518000	3520000	Sorry I was checking my progress
3520000	3522000	on Clicker Heroes because I haven't played
3522000	3524000	it in a week. I saw at least two
3524000	3526000	people on Twitter like say
3526000	3528000	God damn it Loki why did you have to bring up that game?
3528000	3530000	So I have was it uh
3530000	3532000	yeah I can't even
3532000	3534000	I don't even know where was it
3534000	3536000	2.56
3536000	3538000	tillion it's earned
3538000	3540000	in gold. You made that word up.
3540000	3542000	Let's go. There's a key
3542000	3544000	on the side because like I'm like I don't
3544000	3546000	even know so yeah whatever.
3546000	3548000	Okay so
3548000	3550000	this is kind of related
3550000	3552000	to what we were just talking about with Star Wars. Yeah I know
3552000	3554000	we went kind of on the Smash Brothers route
3554000	3556000	there but apparently
3556000	3558000	Disney has pulled a few
3558000	3560000	Star Wars games off of the
3560000	3562000	iOS and Google Play stores
3562000	3564000	and Windows Store can't forget Windows.
3564000	3566000	Yeah you can.
3566000	3568000	Yeah that's like
3568000	3570000	I was talking about my phone sucking the other day
3570000	3572000	and my wife's like well she's like well I have
3572000	3574000	a new phone. I'm like you have a Windows
3574000	3576000	phone. It doesn't do
3576000	3578000	anything. Okay like have you used your
3578000	3580000	phone to use Facebook. No it makes
3580000	3582000	calls. I'm like yeah
3582000	3584000	that's about all this. Alright so
3584000	3586000	anyways so Star Wars assault team
3586000	3588000	has been
3588000	3590000	removed. It was a free to play game and
3590000	3592000	was it
3592000	3594000	I guess they're focusing now on
3594000	3596000	Star Wars Commander but the one I was
3596000	3598000	kind of disappointed with is Nimblebits
3598000	3600000	Tiny Death Star was removed
3600000	3602000	and the best part about it is they didn't even fucking
3602000	3604000	tell Nimblebit oh hey we removed your game.
3604000	3606000	That was
3606000	3608000	nice. That's
3608000	3610000	that's so crazy. I actually
3610000	3612000	have Tiny Death Star. I downloaded
3612000	3614000	that because you know Tiny Tower was kind of cool.
3614000	3616000	Um you know I got a little
3616000	3618000	I kind of was over it after
3618000	3620000	a couple days of play but for a free
3620000	3622000	game you know it entertained me for a while but I'm very
3622000	3624000	surprised especially with such a tie in
3624000	3626000	like that with Tiny Tower they got rid of it. Why would you
3626000	3628000	remove that? They want to focus
3628000	3630000	on this Star Wars
3630000	3632000	Commander what the new one is called.
3632000	3634000	That's the one they want to focus on. But it's not even the same
3634000	3636000	type of game. I know it's weird isn't it?
3636000	3638000	Like you know
3638000	3640000	casual like you know moms and stuff
3640000	3642000	are probably not going to play Star Wars Commander
3642000	3644000	I mean well well I don't know because
3644000	3646000	Star Wars Commander apparently is doing insanely well.
3646000	3648000	Like and a lot of good feedback
3648000	3650000	on the game you know and so forth so I
3650000	3652000	Is it like you know Smurf Village or
3652000	3654000	I haven't played it myself so I can't really
3654000	3656000	comment on it but I've just I see a lot about it on
3656000	3658000	Facebook so anyways
3658000	3660000	um yeah so they basically
3660000	3662000	basically said hey we're very disappointed to see Tiny
3662000	3664000	Earth Star shuttered in less than a year after
3664000	3666000	launch. We had no prior knowledge
3666000	3668000	that the game was going to be removed
3668000	3670000	and no longer even have
3670000	3672000	a contract with Disney after recent layoffs.
3672000	3674000	Suffice to say
3674000	3676000	I guess if you're looking to partner
3676000	3678000	with Disney this might not be the
3678000	3680000	partnership you're looking for. Wow
3680000	3682000	shady shade. So
3682000	3684000	uh well you know what. Well
3684000	3686000	earned advice. Well uh
3686000	3688000	no Tiny Disneyland coming to your phones
3688000	3690000	anytime soon I'm sure. Dude see that would have been awesome.
3690000	3692000	Right. That would have been awesome.
3692000	3694000	That would have been so awesome. Maybe like um
3694000	3696000	I don't know
3696000	3698000	Jurassic Park's coming out pretty soon you know
3698000	3700000	Tiny Jurassic Park
3700000	3702000	I don't know. Tiny
3702000	3704000	Velociraptor
3704000	3706000	It's like you bred Tiny Raptors
3706000	3708000	Oh my god
3708000	3710000	Tiny Dinos
3710000	3712000	that would be funny
3712000	3714000	Dungeon Buster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
3714000	3716000	says I should check on my Tiny Death
3716000	3718000	Star and see how it's doing. Well someone
3718000	3720000	might have blown it up apparently and that might have
3720000	3722000	been Disney. Just flew an
3722000	3724000	X-Winger. Just blew the damn thing up.
3724000	3726000	Alright anyhow
3726000	3728000	uh moving on. A follow
3728000	3730000	up to something we were talking about in a previous
3730000	3732000	week. The Wii U is going to be
3732000	3734000	getting a Minecraft clone
3734000	3736000	or two and the
3736000	3738000	developer yeah the developer behind the
3738000	3740000	Minecraft clone on the Wii U which is apparently
3740000	3742000	called Ucraft is
3742000	3744000	Nexus Games
3744000	3746000	that is. You guys laughing over there at that name?
3746000	3748000	Yeah yeah
3748000	3750000	What's that Jonas?
3750000	3752000	That company sounds familiar. Nexus
3752000	3754000	No no not that Nexus Games
3754000	3756000	Nexus with an I
3756000	3758000	Nexus with an I Games
3758000	3760000	No not the good Nexus Games
3760000	3762000	Hold on. Hold on. Jonas may be a fan of
3762000	3764000	Brick Blast U which is on
3764000	3766000	the Nintendo eShop
3766000	3768000	Ok wrong game. That's fine. Wrong company
3768000	3770000	But they are working on
3770000	3772000	Ucraft for the Wii U
3772000	3774000	and uh yeah
3774000	3776000	saying it could arrive for the Nintendo eShop
3776000	3778000	before Christmas. Don't
3778000	3780000	have that set in stone however
3780000	3782000	so uh that is in development
3782000	3784000	however that's not the only
3784000	3786000	one being made.
3786000	3788000	Stone Shire is also in
3788000	3790000	development by the two man
3790000	3792000	team over at Finger Gun Games
3792000	3794000	which if you think about it though I mean
3794000	3796000	you know one guy kind of made the original Minecraft
3796000	3798000	so two people making a clone
3798000	3800000	I guess would make sense. Uh
3800000	3802000	so there it is. Apparently this game will have dwarves
3802000	3804000	elves, hobbits and goblins roaming
3804000	3806000	the land. So just because we call it a Minecraft
3806000	3808000	clone doesn't mean it is actually like a clone
3808000	3810000	it might have its own stuff and this
3810000	3812000	sounds like it may have some extra kind of
3812000	3814000	stuff in it so you know
3814000	3816000	don't write off these games just because we're calling
3816000	3818000	the Minecraft clones. They might end up
3818000	3820000	being actually kind of cool but we won't really
3820000	3822000	know until we see more about them. Well we can call it
3822000	3824000	Minecraft-like like we do roguelikes
3824000	3826000	Sure I like that. Minecraft-like
3826000	3828000	Craft-like. Craft-like.
3828000	3830000	Now it sounds like we're talking about cheese
3830000	3832000	like they're craft singles or anyways.
3832000	3834000	It's not real cheese. That's like cheese
3834000	3836000	food. That's what cheese eats.
3836000	3838000	Let me put it this way okay
3838000	3840000	and I not to throw shade
3840000	3842000	because you know indie developers
3842000	3844000	and stuff but if you
3844000	3846000	look at the other games that this guy
3846000	3848000	that Nexus has made that like that game
3848000	3850000	that's on there it looks really
3850000	3852000	uh
3852000	3854000	low production quality. I mean
3854000	3856000	don't get me wrong I understand it's a unity game
3856000	3858000	and stuff but it looks like
3858000	3860000	they like kicked that out in maybe a
3860000	3862000	week like spent no time on it
3862000	3864000	and seeing how many tutorials
3864000	3866000	there are out there that make voxel
3866000	3868000	like games. Hell I'm making a voxel like
3868000	3870000	game but it's not necessarily going to be a
3870000	3872000	voxel game just
3872000	3874000	I use it to build my models because I can't fucking
3874000	3876000	I can't 3D model for
3876000	3878000	shit but I can build with Legos
3878000	3880000	so hey let's do that.
3880000	3882000	So uh
3882000	3884000	it's pretty easy to
3884000	3886000	you know to build one of these things and there's a lot
3886000	3888000	of tutorials out there so all you would have to do is
3888000	3890000	build something for the Wii U get a
3890000	3892000	dev kit and port it over. Unity does
3892000	3894000	the porting for you.
3894000	3896000	All you really got to do is sign up for Nintendo
3896000	3898000	and get fucking dev kit to test it on that's it
3898000	3900000	and just looking at this
3900000	3902000	I mean
3902000	3904000	it's got well the the other one had
3904000	3906000	the default you know standard
3906000	3908000	asset you know skybox
3908000	3910000	and default
3910000	3912000	shaders it really looks like it was
3912000	3914000	thrown together in a few days
3914000	3916000	so
3916000	3918000	but hey you know what though um
3918000	3920000	there will be better games out there I mean
3920000	3922000	look at the xbox indie games there was
3922000	3924000	how many minecraft clones a
3924000	3926000	ton of fucking minecraft clones and you know what
3926000	3928000	it's not a bad idea to do that
3928000	3930000	because they made a ton of money
3930000	3932000	they weren't great but people want to play
3932000	3934000	minecraft so badly if that's their only
3934000	3936000	option they're going to fucking buy it
3936000	3938000	so they're going to make tons of money
3938000	3940000	even if it's absolute shit
3940000	3942000	well let's hope it's not though I hope
3942000	3944000	I hope it's good turn out pretty decent
3944000	3946000	we'll kind of want to make a minecraft clone
3946000	3948000	but not right now uh act
3948000	3950000	deaf in chat says the trailer for you
3950000	3952000	craft is hilariously awful the game
3952000	3954000	looks okay but oh god the trailer
3954000	3956000	they have a trailer apparently and
3956000	3958000	kaijuto and chat says survival craft
3958000	3960000	on the tablet is awesome so you know
3960000	3962000	there's some clones that people people dig
3962000	3964000	I mean uh the one I was
3964000	3966000	playing you see what I did there dig because it's
3966000	3968000	minecraft I think it was a
3968000	3970000	castle maker her
3970000	3972000	and that was like a buck on indie games and it was
3972000	3974000	it was fun it was a minecraft game with
3974000	3976000	guns I mean the graphics weren't great but it
3976000	3978000	was just kind of something to mess around
3978000	3980000	with cool guns
3980000	3982000	all right uh one more story and then
3982000	3984000	we'll get to some release dates star sakura
3984000	3986000	well you know I never remembered if
3986000	3988000	it was west one
3988000	3990000	or west stone I always thought was
3990000	3992000	west one but the
3992000	3994000	company that created wonder boy is filing for bankruptcy
3994000	3996000	uh after 30
3996000	3998000	years of being in business
3998000	4000000	since 1986
4000000	4002000	which is hard to think of the 80s as being
4002000	4004000	30 years ago um
4004000	4006000	but basically they have
4006000	4008000	uh filed for
4008000	4010000	bankruptcy um they actually uh
4010000	4012000	the the wonder boy series
4012000	4014000	was actually adapted
4014000	4016000	into uh the nes
4016000	4018000	adventure island so
4018000	4020000	if you don't remember too much about
4020000	4022000	and don't forget about you know
4022000	4024000	wonder boy in monster world um
4024000	4026000	you could actually play in the sega vintage
4026000	4028000	collection monster world so
4028000	4030000	it's a sad day
4030000	4032000	we're sorry to see them go
4032000	4034000	I I actually used to love
4034000	4036000	adventure island when I was younger
4036000	4038000	and like I was actually good at those type of games
4038000	4040000	and uh I'll give a shout out to my pal
4040000	4042000	uh jeremy over at uh the koopa
4042000	4044000	club podcast was doing some uh
4044000	4046000	youtubes and and uh livestreams
4046000	4048000	of adventure island he was talking about
4048000	4050000	that wonder boy connection I was like oh yeah
4050000	4052000	that's right the games were related and I never like you don't
4052000	4054000	really realize that as a kid but like
4054000	4056000	it's kind of cool to hear those connections now
4056000	4058000	but very sad to hear about um
4058000	4060000	them shutting down I think I've covered two of the wonder
4060000	4062000	boy games for a classic game you probably
4062000	4064000	have but that would imply that I have
4064000	4066000	some type of memory or you know
4066000	4068000	the sequels were on the master system
4068000	4070000	sega genesis turbo graphics 16
4070000	4072000	or as it was in japan the pc engine
4072000	4074000	uh there was uh in japan
4074000	4076000	only there was a monster world complete collection
4076000	4078000	of the ps2 and then like
4078000	4080000	I said there was a sega vintage collection monster world
4080000	4082000	uh dark tetsuya
4082000	4084000	and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
4084000	4086000	man I loved wonder boy 3 the dragons
4086000	4088000	trap or dragons curse on pc
4088000	4090000	engine turbo graphics so yeah I'm legit
4090000	4092000	sad frowny well I mean
4092000	4094000	there's always what virtual console
4094000	4096000	and so forth for those right I think
4096000	4098000	uh wonder boy 3 had come out for those
4098000	4100000	at some point I thought I saw that I could be wrong
4100000	4102000	so alright
4102000	4104000	well uh let's travel around the world
4104000	4106000	and check out some releases and some games that are
4106000	4108000	coming out very soon on a store shelf near

4110000	4112000	season of the year yes uh

4124000	4126000	to go along with that they've got that with its
4126000	4128000	I don't know if you'd call it free version
4128000	4130000	but the playstation plus version
4130000	4132000	has some of the tracks uh
4132000	4134000	nbh the bear the starter
4134000	4136000	edition let's say cause like a starter
4136000	4138000	in a car the starter edition
4138000	4140000	possibly you could do piecemeal
4140000	4142000	edition because they're gonna have like you know
4142000	4144000	where you can buy content
4144000	4146000	for it and then or if you want
4146000	4148000	buy the full game um so they've got that coming
4148000	4150000	out this week and then also um

4166000	4168000	one and pc
4168000	4170000	uh oh and also I guess uh
4170000	4172000	alien isolation was also on pc
4172000	4174000	um the disc version
4174000	4176000	I'm not sure if this is the only way
4176000	4178000	you can get this cause I thought this was free to play
4178000	4180000	but project spark on xbox one
4180000	4182000	is coming out um
4182000	4184000	I guess that's a disc
4184000	4186000	version of the game although I thought it was free
4186000	4188000	to play so I thought so too
4188000	4190000	I don't know maybe it's extra content or something
4190000	4192000	uh minecraft playstation 4
4192000	4194000	editions getting its disc based version
4194000	4196000	coming out this week
4196000	4198000	uh they're doing a

4204000	4206000	edition on xbox one sorry to butt in
4206000	4208000	but with minecraft releasing on playstation 4
4208000	4210000	you have microsoft releasing a game
4210000	4212000	on ps4 so hey hey
4212000	4214000	bayonetta fans anything's possible never lose hope
4218000	4220000	well technically that was already in the works
4220000	4222000	so yeah
4222000	4224000	uh let's see
4224000	4226000	and uh finally
4226000	4228000	forza motorsports 5

4230000	4232000	game of the year edition on xbox one
4232000	4234000	so a lot of re-releases there
4234000	4236000	and that would be it
4236000	4238000	I thought there was more games this week but I guess that's it
4238000	4240000	well let's travel over to japan and check out
4240000	4242000	what's coming out there on the playstation 4
4242000	4244000	drive club releases for them as well

4254000	4256000	and the project spark starter
4256000	4258000	pack so maybe I'm

4262000	4264000	uh things included with it that you
4264000	4266000	would buy otherwise uh over on

4404000	4406000	undead and undressed in order to find the

4408000	4410000	vampires you have to fight them and
4410000	4412000	undress them so that they're it's vampires
4412000	4414000	that's right because they have to expose their
4414000	4416000	their body parts to the sun in order
4416000	4418000	to um stop the vampires
4418000	4420000	ps3 and ps vita
4420000	4422000	brilliant brilliant it came out already
4422000	4424000	over here at the beginning of august
4424000	4426000	oh my god that's awesome
4426000	4428000	we also have project spark
4428000	4430000	which i misread as project spank
4430000	4432000	hahaha
4432000	4434000	that'd be a better game uh rise son
4434000	4436000	of rome on pc and
4436000	4438000	skylanders trap team on a bunch of
4438000	4440000	stuff sleeping dogs
4440000	4442000	definitive edition on ps4x
4442000	4444000	bone and pc
4444000	4446000	so with project spark you know
4446000	4448000	i don't know if it's officially out already
4448000	4450000	or if it's coming out this um
4450000	4452000	tuesday
4452000	4454000	time to penis what do you think
4454000	4456000	you know how long before we get
4456000	4458000	like how long to unlock all the
4458000	4460000	the stuff needed to well
4460000	4462000	i'm telling you there's a very good
4462000	4464000	chance that the time to penis is actually going to be very short
4464000	4466000	being that conquer is in the game
4466000	4468000	so this is going to be a very short one
4470000	4472000	do you guys know uh from from the uh big anime game room
4472000	4474000	do you know about our time to penis estimations
4474000	4476000	i don't know if you know this but any game that
4476000	4478000	allows you any type of creativity
4478000	4480000	we always ask the question how
4480000	4482000	long till somebody puts a penis in it
4482000	4484000	so that's probably around the time
4484000	4486000	when picto chat came out and people were drawing
4486000	4488000	penises all over the place
4488000	4490000	literally they should have just called it penis chat
4490000	4492000	right it wasn't a
4492000	4494000	well obviously it was just part of the system
4494000	4496000	but it wasn't a game but yeah that was just being thrown
4496000	4498000	all over the place especially going to conventions
4498000	4500000	people were just passing around pictures
4500000	4502000	and sending them to each other that looked like penises
4502000	4504000	the closest uh private part
4504000	4506000	yeah or you know they they had that game
4506000	4508000	ping pals it was just ping pals
4508000	4510000	that's all it was you know
4510000	4512000	do you ever remember reading vg cats
4512000	4514000	yes i've heard of them
4514000	4516000	and they had the optimus prime versus megatron
4516000	4518000	picto chat that was pretty funny
4518000	4520000	did they show penis yes
4520000	4522000	i think i don't remember but it was
4522000	4524000	basically them just going back
4524000	4526000	that's what picto chat was for
4526000	4528000	at least you know picked it or was it uh
4528000	4530000	was it ping pals
4530000	4532000	it's better than like tinder pals or something like that
4532000	4534000	tinder pals
4536000	4538000	just a bunch of like little picto chat penises
4538000	4540000	come up on the screen swipe left
4540000	4542000	swipe left ooh swipe right
4542000	4544000	a lot of other common things
4544000	4546000	i saw with like a bell spout and they tried to put the
4546000	4548000	penis in the mouth it was pretty bad
4548000	4550000	i don't know what they were
4550000	4552000	doing with pokemon at the time that's what they're doing
4552000	4554000	that's what they're doing in smash brothers
4554000	4556000	picture mode right now is like you know
4556000	4558000	let's see how many sexual positions we can put these characters
4558000	4560000	in anyway
4560000	4562000	a couple more gaming stories for you
4562000	4564000	guys than the classic game of the week
4564000	4566000	back to a simpler time in gaming before
4566000	4568000	you all filthied it up with your
4568000	4570000	dicks alright hey hey hey
4570000	4572000	we had custers revenge
4572000	4574000	that's true alright
4574000	4576000	uh loki alright
4576000	4578000	um so this is a little
4578000	4580000	disappointing but unfortunately there has been
4580000	4582000	some layoffs at rovio
4582000	4584000	they're cutting 130 jobs
4584000	4586000	to as they put
4586000	4588000	um simplify the company
4588000	4590000	they went towards a simplified
4590000	4592000	organization as they say it's never
4592000	4594000	easy to consider changes like this
4594000	4596000	but it's better to do them um
4596000	4598000	sooner rather than later
4598000	4600000	when we're in a good place to
4600000	4602000	reignite growth so
4602000	4604000	in other words they're not making as much money as they
4604000	4606000	used to they need to cut jobs in order to
4606000	4608000	be able to stay
4608000	4610000	i guess in the black
4610000	4612000	i'm thinking maybe like
4612000	4614000	angry birds just probably maybe got
4614000	4616000	like too big i don't know if that makes
4616000	4618000	sense but like you know
4618000	4620000	uh they have all these spin
4620000	4622000	off games and angry birds is on like
4622000	4624000	like all these different platforms and maybe
4624000	4626000	maybe it just became too diluted
4626000	4628000	like because when they talk about the whole like
4628000	4630000	trying to
4630000	4632000	bring it dark
4632000	4634000	sakura stop showing pictures of picto chat one time
4634000	4636000	time i mean they have angry
4636000	4638000	birds transformers they have
4638000	4640000	you know sorry after the conversation
4640000	4642000	she just had it's a funny image in my mind
4642000	4644000	i think wait if it
4644000	4646000	we're talking about rovia here right yeah
4646000	4648000	isn't this the same kind of um
4648000	4650000	effect that happened with zinga
4650000	4652000	where they got so big for a short
4652000	4654000	time then tanked like
4654000	4656000	because
4656000	4658000	new trends come out and they haven't
4658000	4660000	maintained their trends the big
4660000	4662000	difference here though is that i understand
4662000	4664000	why people like angry birds i never
4664000	4666000	understood why people like farmville that's
4666000	4668000	that's the big difference here to me people
4668000	4670000	like angry birds because scorched earth isn't on
4670000	4672000	fucking foam that's why they like angry
4672000	4674000	birds and because
4674000	4676000	gorillas was awesome but you know
4676000	4678000	uh angry birds is a fun game i
4678000	4680000	don't knock it it's a fun game it's a fun
4680000	4682000	time waster but
4682000	4684000	it's just i don't know
4684000	4686000	uh there's only
4686000	4688000	so much of it you can take before it gets kind of boring
4688000	4690000	i guess um you know eventually
4690000	4692000	people are gonna get tired of it and
4692000	4694000	it's maybe just not you know
4694000	4696000	rebranding it or something it's not really
4696000	4698000	doing anything that's
4698000	4700000	like saying offering different skins in
4700000	4702000	minecraft sells more copies of the game
4702000	4704000	maybe it does but i don't think
4704000	4706000	it's gonna make a huge difference i think that's a tough
4706000	4708000	thing for a lot of these mobile developers is
4708000	4710000	that you know you gotta have
4710000	4712000	i think more than one big franchise
4712000	4714000	to really you know
4714000	4716000	get out there you know and i know right now a lot
4716000	4718000	of the focus is on king and candy crush
4718000	4720000	saga but you know what that bubble that
4720000	4722000	bubble's gonna burst someday too maybe not today
4722000	4724000	but you know i think that's
4724000	4726000	that's a huge problem with the mobile market too
4726000	4728000	because at first oh angry birds is one of the
4728000	4730000	one of the first few games out there
4730000	4732000	but now that everybody's doing it
4732000	4734000	yeah i mean no one expected
4734000	4736000	flappy bird of all things to pop out
4736000	4738000	it just popped out at random and people are starting to play
4738000	4740000	the hell out of it that's true sometimes
4740000	4742000	the the fans especially on mobile
4742000	4744000	can be very fickle you know it's
4744000	4746000	it's almost like going viral on youtube like
4746000	4748000	you can't like you know these people all sit in
4748000	4750000	a boardroom we have to do something
4750000	4752000	that will go viral and it's like
4752000	4754000	that's very hard to do
4754000	4756000	like if you don't like put betty white in
4756000	4758000	it or something that's not gonna happen
4758000	4760000	just because you want it to like that has
4760000	4762000	to happen organically yeah because i mean
4762000	4764000	i understand that um like these
4764000	4766000	companies it is the cheapest way to
4766000	4768000	develop games like out there
4768000	4770000	it saves money rather you know how like people
4770000	4772000	develop games for like xbox one ps4
4772000	4774000	and wii u and all that other consoles
4774000	4776000	and stuff or even pcs where
4776000	4778000	the production might be more expensive
4778000	4780000	for this one but the the problem
4780000	4782000	with i think the mobile market at the moment
4782000	4784000	like with especially with angry birds is
4784000	4786000	that there's too much like way
4786000	4788000	way too much in the market that
4788000	4790000	people have to decide which one's gonna be
4790000	4792000	the best one and it's
4792000	4794000	hard to get noticed like you know when flappy
4794000	4796000	bird was the big thing and you looked
4796000	4798000	at like the top 100 games like 20 of
4798000	4800000	them were flappy burglar like you had flappy
4800000	4802000	miley for fuck's sake like
4802000	4804000	hoop who downloaded flappy
4804000	4806000	miley who are you come out
4806000	4808000	here so i can smack you
4808000	4810000	who did that did
4810000	4812000	you do it i see you you're looking away
4812000	4814000	from me right now you know you do
4814000	4816000	flappy miley
4816000	4818000	no i will twerk you to death wait
4818000	4820000	that sounds really bad actually i maybe i won't
4820000	4822000	wait
4822000	4824000	i'll probably draw another penis on
4824000	4826000	peto chat
4826000	4828000	all right uh
4828000	4830000	one more story for you guys and uh
4830000	4832000	this is um not really good
4832000	4834000	news for nintendo one of their uh
4834000	4836000	big titles possibly being delayed
4836000	4838000	don't we don't have anything official
4838000	4840000	yet but uh
4840000	4842000	and breathe out it's not smash brothers
4842000	4844000	i'm talking about this time but it's
4844000	4846000	captain toad treasure tracker
4846000	4848000	oh and nobody is sad
4848000	4850000	sorry i think some
4850000	4852000	people are a little bit sad but
4852000	4854000	i don't know uh please
4854000	4856000	gamefly of all people which
4856000	4858000	you know rents the games and so forth
4858000	4860000	they changed their captain toad
4860000	4862000	treasure tracker release date from
4862000	4864000	2014 to march 2015
4864000	4866000	uh it should
4866000	4868000	be noted that gamefly has a pretty
4868000	4870000	good record of being correct about
4870000	4872000	these sorts of delays uh in
4872000	4874000	the past no they don't oh look at you
4874000	4876000	listen i came from the distribution
4876000	4878000	industry since i'm not fucking working there
4878000	4880000	anymore i love this now now you're gonna become unhinged
4880000	4882000	now you officially don't work there now it's
4882000	4884000	oh man loki's gonna give it all
4884000	4886000	here's the thing
4886000	4888000	here's what it comes down to nintendo
4888000	4890000	probably they they announced stuff by
4890000	4892000	quarter and so they've already
4892000	4894000	announced their ship for fourth quarter
4894000	4896000	it's not on there so they're probably assuming
4896000	4898000	hey we haven't heard anything about this yet we're
4898000	4900000	just gonna move it out of the year that's what i used to do
4900000	4902000	it's like i have a bunch of shit that'd be on the
4902000	4904000	the 31st of december it's all
4904000	4906000	that to be announced fucking dates stuff
4906000	4908000	guess where guess where uh
4908000	4910000	captain toad treasure tracker was yeah
4910000	4912000	i was right there so
4912000	4914000	i just moved the shit you know
4914000	4916000	to clear up my calendar or whatever
4916000	4918000	i'm like because i want my release dates to be nice and clean
4918000	4920000	so if i don't want all this tba shit at the end of
4920000	4922000	the year so i just fucking move it to
4922000	4924000	the next quarter so that's
4924000	4926000	probably what i would do yeah
4926000	4928000	they move shit on hunch
4928000	4930000	a lot of the times they don't move stuff just because
4930000	4932000	you know nintendo
4932000	4934000	told them unless it was an actual
4934000	4936000	release date in march or something
4936000	4938000	and i can see them moving it because
4938000	4940000	it's not that essential of a title it can be
4940000	4942000	put out anytime it's not like
4942000	4944000	oh my god a moment buy a system for treasure
4944000	4946000	no no one's fucking buying a system for that
4946000	4948000	i can also see where nintendo
4948000	4950000	may have a situation where it's like
4950000	4952000	every fucking person in
4952000	4954000	development is fucking making
4954000	4956000	smash happening on the wii u
4956000	4958000	by the holiday we don't give a fuck
4958000	4960000	what has to be pushed back smash is
4960000	4962000	coming out this holiday season i mean you literally
4962000	4964000	could have a situation like that going on right now
4964000	4966000	yeah so i'm just i
4966000	4968000	i think that it's just tba i mean
4968000	4970000	what date did they move into march that's what i
4970000	4972000	want to know no uh it doesn't say
4972000	4974000	okay well then
4974000	4976000	fucking look this up
4976000	4978000	yes because that game
4978000	4980000	it doesn't surprise why they didn't make it as a dlc
4980000	4982000	like add-on to like super mario
4982000	4984000	3d world well i think people
4984000	4986000	are assuming that all it's going
4986000	4988000	to be is what you saw in 3d world
4988000	4990000	and you know one thing nintendo
4990000	4992000	games are pretty decent at i mean especially
4992000	4994000	looking at again like smash brothers they
4994000	4996000	have depth to them so i think there'll be
4996000	4998000	more to expect in this game than
4998000	5000000	just what you saw like that's the
5000000	5002000	start that's the first world and then you'll have
5002000	5004000	these more power-ups maybe you'll have co-op
5004000	5006000	you know there'll be more to it we just haven't
5006000	5008000	really seen what all that looks like i mean i'm not
5008000	5010000	saying anything about nintendo like how they do things
5010000	5012000	because i know they started changing their policies with
5012000	5014000	like let's let's
5014000	5016000	perfect example super luigi u
5016000	5018000	which technically everyone thinks it's a different
5018000	5020000	game but it's a
5020000	5022000	specialized add-on where they added
5022000	5024000	more like an actual package it's just
5024000	5026000	really good dlc
5026000	5028000	yeah so or even mario kart
5028000	5030000	mario kart 8
5030000	5032000	where they have the two
5032000	5034000	two packs and it's so weird
5034000	5036000	to see mario kart with dlc
5036000	5038000	but at the same time it's kinda it's awesome at the
5038000	5040000	same time you know usually i don't get excited
5040000	5042000	about dlc but it seems like nintendo really
5042000	5044000	knows how to do it right that's just my question
5044000	5046000	with the whole totes um that toad game
5046000	5048000	well because if they don't release it as a separate
5048000	5050000	game then they can't do dlc for the toad game
5050000	5052000	it's
5052000	5054000	well hey i mean they haven't they still haven't
5054000	5056000	announced the release date for smash brothers
5056000	5058000	they haven't although
5058000	5060000	i would think all these signs
5060000	5062000	pointing to november 21st would be right but
5062000	5064000	i would think so too but
5064000	5066000	at the same time that 31st
5066000	5068000	march date is a fucking placeholder
5068000	5070000	date nintendo never releases
5070000	5072000	a title on tuesday it's always a fucking
5072000	5074000	friday or something oh so you went over to gamefly
5074000	5076000	and it shows 31st of march it's the 31st
5076000	5078000	yeah so there's that's placeholder
5078000	5080000	that yeah that's what i would do
5080000	5082000	is just move it out of the month look at that
5082000	5084000	loki calling the news out
5084000	5086000	is bull live on air look at that
5086000	5088000	it's a good good thought alright
5088000	5090000	well let's let's move to a simpler

5140000	5142000	but i think i might do cps3 next in november
5142000	5144000	i was like it's been a whole year what the
5144000	5146000	fuck over i started it in september
5146000	5148000	alright i'll stop bugging you what is the classic
5148000	5150000	game of the week mega man the power battle
5150000	5152000	also known as rockman the power battle
5152000	5154000	and it was
5154000	5156000	a uh basically an arcade game
5156000	5158000	it was a spin off for the rockman series
5158000	5160000	it came out in japan in 1995
5160000	5162000	and had a sequel called mega
5162000	5164000	man 2 the power fighters
5164000	5166000	uh the next year um
5166000	5168000	the games reported to uh
5168000	5170000	consoles in north america in 2004 as part of
5170000	5172000	the mega man anniversary collection
5172000	5174000	came out on ps2 uh gamecube
5174000	5176000	and xbox
5176000	5178000	and um was also part of the same
5178000	5180000	compilation in japan as rockman power
5180000	5182000	battle fighters for ps2
5182000	5184000	there was also an adaptation of both
5184000	5186000	games for neo geo pocket caller called
5186000	5188000	rockman battle and fighters
5188000	5190000	which was pretty pretty funny
5190000	5192000	neo geo pocket caller game
5192000	5194000	um so basically uh dr wily
5194000	5196000	rebuilt the robot masters and
5196000	5198000	he wants to take over the world so basically
5198000	5200000	it's a fighting game with
5200000	5202000	uh you can play as
5202000	5204000	as uh
5204000	5206000	mega man or rockman uh
5206000	5208000	proto man or base why would he
5208000	5210000	rebuild them why wouldn't he just build better
5210000	5212000	ones he got a point there
5212000	5214000	his
5214000	5216000	eyebrows way too much
5216000	5218000	um it's it's weighing down his brain
5218000	5220000	so anyway um basically
5220000	5222000	it's just like playing any
5222000	5224000	mega man game you have your jump you have your shoot
5224000	5226000	um you can hold it down
5226000	5228000	for stronger blast you can hold it down while
5228000	5230000	jumping makes you dash uh
5230000	5232000	so you have those different mechanics in there
5232000	5234000	um and as far as the stories that you do
5234000	5236000	each one has a different
5236000	5238000	uh series of stories
5238000	5240000	for what for uh depending on who they
5240000	5242000	fight so you've got
5242000	5244000	um as
5244000	5246000	stories for mega man one through two three through six
5246000	5248000	and mega man seven
5248000	5250000	um the level is
5250000	5252000	you don't really do like a whole level
5252000	5254000	you just have like
5254000	5256000	some part of the level and then
5256000	5258000	you fight your bad guys
5258000	5260000	and you actually have to go through um
5260000	5262000	uh sort of a rock paper
5262000	5264000	scissors kind of decision
5264000	5266000	method for choosing the weapon
5266000	5268000	i really like the redesign for uh
5268000	5270000	with man in this one by the way
5270000	5272000	it actually had a
5272000	5274000	soundtrack released on december 1st 1995
5274000	5276000	that was uh
5276000	5278000	actually had some arranged
5278000	5280000	uh pieces from other mega man games
5280000	5282000	by uh Yamamoto
5282000	5284000	Setsuo and um Okugawa
5284000	5286000	Hideki and they were performed by
5287000	5289000	so uh pretty cool stuff
5289000	5291000	um
5291000	5293000	as far as uh
5293000	5295000	the reception of it
5295000	5297000	gave it a pretty
5297000	5299000	decent rating
5299000	5301000	and uh basically
5301000	5303000	got a 22 out of 40
5303000	5305000	which is decent for
5305000	5307000	so there you go
5307000	5309000	rock man the power battle
5309000	5311000	very cool and uh
5311000	5313000	it was always awesome
5313000	5315000	also a good choice this week as we have mega man
5315000	5317000	fighting game right now it's nice to kind of go back
5317000	5319000	and revisit mega man's brawling
5319000	5321000	roots yes
5321000	5323000	the only thing i didn't like about this game is that like
5323000	5325000	mega man 7 or whatever got like its own
5325000	5327000	dedicated thing but like 1 and 2
5327000	5329000	should have had dedicated and 3 should have had dedicated
5329000	5331000	i don't know maybe it's just me but i thought the
5331000	5333000	robot masters in the earlier games were a little more memorable
5333000	5335000	i just liked playing base
5335000	5337000	yeah it was all about playing base in this one
5337000	5339000	for me cause base was just
5339000	5341000	bad ass alright there it is classic game
5341000	5343000	of the week mega man or rock man
5343000	5345000	the power battle again
5345000	5347000	another one of capcom's
5347000	5349000	arcade games

5457000	5459000	the time out to be on the show tonight
5459000	5461000	um so for those that might not
5461000	5463000	be familiar with the pinball arcade
5463000	5465000	i mean i know it's on just about every platform that's
5465000	5467000	out there but if for some reason somebody doesn't know what it is
5467000	5469000	tell us a little bit about the pinball arcade
5469000	5471000	sure the pinball arcade
5471000	5473000	came out um a couple years ago
5473000	5475000	we actually launched in february of 2012
5475000	5477000	and it's our goal to
5477000	5479000	recreate all of the greatest pinball machines
5479000	5481000	ever the real machines so we have
5481000	5483000	licenses from williams and batley and
5483000	5485000	and gottlieb and the start license
5485000	5487000	includes that how data east and
5487000	5489000	sega um
5489000	5491000	so basically we have the rights to recreate
5491000	5493000	pretty much every table there is
5493000	5495000	however those are just the pinball rights
5495000	5497000	and what we are looking
5497000	5499000	for in the adams family kickstarter
5499000	5501000	uh the ant employer rights to
5501000	5503000	the movie the adams family
5503000	5505000	um the adams family foundation
5505000	5507000	rights for the the characters
5507000	5509000	and then the uh specific actors
5509000	5511000	so um yeah
5511000	5513000	so it's now our goal to recreate
5513000	5515000	these pinball tables so that
5515000	5517000	pinball players from a whole new
5517000	5519000	generation get to play them
5519000	5521000	well let's since you brought up the adams family kickstarter
5521000	5523000	and i know that's the big big focus right now
5523000	5525000	and there's about a week left to go on the kickstarter
5525000	5527000	when people are going to be hearing this
5527000	5529000	um what exactly are you raising
5529000	5531000	that money for on the kickstarter
5531000	5533000	yeah so those
5533000	5535000	that money is specifically for all those licenses
5535000	5537000	i just mentioned they're for the
5537000	5539000	the rights for the movie
5539000	5541000	for the adams family and
5541000	5543000	for the actors to get their likeness
5543000	5545000	clearances um why is this
5545000	5547000	table so important
5547000	5549000	um the adams family was the best
5549000	5551000	selling pinball table of all time
5551000	5553000	uh it's it's over
5553000	5555000	20,000 like real machines were made
5555000	5557000	it's a really popular table it's really
5557000	5559000	it's a great table it's a fun table it's a pat lawler
5559000	5561000	classic um
5561000	5563000	it's just um a
5563000	5565000	table that any collection
5565000	5567000	is going to be the best of uh
5567000	5569000	pinball of all time really needs the adams family
5569000	5571000	so we've been pushing really hard to get these licenses
5571000	5573000	i seem to remember there was like
5573000	5575000	a limited edition gold version
5575000	5577000	or something of the adams family table as well
5577000	5579000	is that all a part of this or just
5579000	5581000	we're trying to just get the original classic table
5581000	5583000	yeah the pinball
5583000	5585000	of the adams family pinball
5585000	5587000	machine did so well they came up with a limited
5587000	5589000	edition um
5589000	5591000	um there's a special ROM
5591000	5593000	so some special rules were created
5593000	5595000	and there's gold trim around them
5595000	5597000	uh in the real world
5597000	5599000	so we have the rights to
5599000	5601000	recreate both so anyone who
5601000	5603000	kick starts contributes
5603000	5605000	um $100 or more will be
5605000	5607000	a member of the gold club and be a gold
5607000	5609000	backer and they'll get to
5609000	5611000	play the gold edition in addition to the
5611000	5613000	regular one oh very cool
5613000	5615000	um do you have a particular favorite feature
5615000	5617000	of the adams family table?
5617000	5619000	um geez i like
5619000	5621000	the mamushka i like
5621000	5623000	how simple it is to understand that you're clearing
5623000	5625000	out the rooms uh i like
5625000	5627000	the flipper that's automatically you know
5627000	5629000	working for you but the hand's really cool
5629000	5631000	the thing
5631000	5633000	um it was one of
5633000	5635000	the first tables to have a DMD working
5635000	5637000	so it's
5637000	5639000	it's a really great presentation table
5639000	5641000	it's just a lot of fun to play i just remember
5641000	5643000	um really being drawn to it you know
5643000	5645000	because this has probably been when the movie was out
5645000	5647000	i was probably in about junior high or something when the movie
5647000	5649000	came out and i just remembered like it tied in so well
5649000	5651000	to the movie like i think a lot of other
5651000	5653000	tables sometimes you can kind of
5653000	5655000	like especially in gaming and video games in
5655000	5657000	general you really feel like the movie or the game
5657000	5659000	that goes with the add-on is such like a loose
5659000	5661000	like a loose tie-in but this really felt
5661000	5663000	like an extension of the movie to me
5663000	5665000	right that's actually one of the reasons why we needed
5665000	5667000	the paramount license because not only
5667000	5669000	was it used in the adams family characters
5669000	5671000	but they took actual script from the movie
5671000	5673000	um they took story from the movie
5673000	5675000	and built that into the pinball table machine
5675000	5677000	design uh so it's one of the
5677000	5679000	reasons why we had to get that license gotcha
5679000	5681000	now i don't know if this is true or not but there were
5681000	5683000	rumors circulating out there that
5683000	5685000	the estate of rao julia was
5685000	5687000	part of the holdout that the likeness
5687000	5689000	was uh not wanting
5689000	5691000	to be used has this all been resolved
5691000	5693000	will we see rao julia in the game
5693000	5695000	if if kickstarter yeah
5695000	5697000	we have the likeness clearance and that's one of the
5697000	5699000	the funds that we're trying to raise
5699000	5701000	um so his widow was very
5701000	5703000	um willing to work with us and
5703000	5705000	we're very appreciative that we're able to use
5705000	5707000	his likeness and i don't know
5707000	5709000	if you know but his voice is used a lot
5709000	5711000	in the table oh yeah the uh
5711000	5713000	wms has a special audio recording with
5713000	5715000	rao julia just for the pinball machine
5715000	5717000	so it's
5717000	5719000	it's a little over 100 wave files just
5719000	5721000	his voice wow which is far
5721000	5723000	more than any other character yeah you can't really
5723000	5725000	talk about the mamushka without really hearing it in
5725000	5727000	his voice the mamushka you know he's
5727000	5729000	this very grandiose way of delivering
5729000	5731000	lines right um
5731000	5733000	now going going to the the
5733000	5735000	pinball uh arcade collection
5735000	5737000	in general um you know i
5737000	5739000	i remember playing the
5739000	5741000	i think you guys had a early version of this game
5741000	5743000	on the we there wasn't there like a
5743000	5745000	a pinball collection of some sort
5745000	5747000	on the we as well right
5747000	5749000	yeah we started doing pinball um table
5749000	5751000	collections about 10 years ago and our
5751000	5753000	first franchise was called the pinball hall of fame
5753000	5755000	that's it yeah pinball hall of fame
5755000	5757000	uh and we had the gotley collection and
5757000	5759000	the williams collection and i think both of
5759000	5761000	those made it to the we eventually
5761000	5763000	i noticed you guys kind of
5763000	5765000	really make it a point to have your game on a
5765000	5767000	variety of systems i mean i could i could
5767000	5769000	list where the pinball arcade is playable
5769000	5771000	but it is literally everywhere from
5771000	5773000	the playstation 4 to the uia
5773000	5775000	and mobile phones many
5775000	5777000	developers focus on one console
5777000	5779000	plus steam or what have you
5779000	5781000	why do you guys go for such that variety
5781000	5783000	how how important is that for you
5783000	5785000	well it's always been far
5785000	5787000	sight bread and butter um you know
5787000	5789000	the pinball arcade is our first
5789000	5791000	published title that we've done ourselves publishing
5791000	5793000	wise um with digital distribution
5793000	5795000	as possible um but before
5795000	5797000	that we were basically being contracted by publishers
5797000	5799000	to make a game and one of the
5799000	5801000	key selling points we had as a developer
5801000	5803000	was that we could take a game and
5803000	5805000	develop it on as many platforms as they wanted
5805000	5807000	for very little incremental cost
5807000	5809000	uh so we've carried over
5809000	5811000	we have really good tools when it comes to cross platform
5811000	5813000	development and since
5813000	5815000	you know people want to play it on whatever device they have
5815000	5817000	let's we felt that why not do
5817000	5819000	it as long as there's a digital store
5819000	5821000	to sell it to them we've
5821000	5823000	created for them do you
5823000	5825000	find that people tend to prefer
5825000	5827000	like one over the other like
5827000	5829000	mobile versus couch play
5829000	5831000	on the playstation or do you
5831000	5833000	do you kind of find that
5833000	5835000	somebody who likes it one place might
5835000	5837000	want to have all the versions that they have a
5837000	5839000	something on the go and what have you
5839000	5841000	yeah the bulk of our users just pick one
5841000	5843000	um but we do have plenty of
5843000	5845000	users who like will pick one console
5845000	5847000	like one of the later consoles and our
5847000	5849000	xbox one version um should be coming
5849000	5851000	out here soon within a month or two
5851000	5853000	um but most people want
5853000	5855000	to have one mobile version and
5855000	5857000	one not most people but our most
5857000	5859000	hardcore fans will have one mobile version
5859000	5861000	either the android or the ios
5861000	5863000	and one home console
5863000	5865000	and home console might be pc
5865000	5867000	if you get to that home console of course
5867000	5869000	um seems like most of the fans play it
5869000	5871000	one one one device on the go
5871000	5873000	and one device at home gotcha
5873000	5875000	now um many pinball
5875000	5877000	games i've played in the past like and i'm talking
5877000	5879000	like pinball dreams on like
5879000	5881000	nineties computers to other games today
5881000	5883000	they're based off of new tables
5883000	5885000	but you guys have really made it your
5885000	5887000	thing to do pinball
5887000	5889000	classics have you guys ever wanted
5889000	5891000	to do an original table why do you
5891000	5893000	stick to classics
5893000	5895000	um well i can give you a whole
5895000	5897000	history um back when
5897000	5899000	we first started doing pinball machines the
5899000	5901000	publisher crave actually asked us to
5901000	5903000	create some original tables
5903000	5905000	but i was um at the studio
5905000	5907000	we had never done anything pinball related
5907000	5909000	and even though we had some fans of
5909000	5911000	pinball internally we weren't
5911000	5913000	comfortable designing original tables
5913000	5915000	so someone there at crave
5915000	5917000	um bob bryant had the idea
5917000	5919000	for us to license real tables
5919000	5921000	and we create them because he's
5921000	5923000	a huge fan of real pinball and wanted to play
5923000	5925000	some of the favorite tables which he
5925000	5927000	couldn't find anywhere right so that's really
5927000	5929000	how it started so
5929000	5931000	moving forward to today uh we
5931000	5933000	actually have i don't know how much i
5933000	5935000	can talk about this but we're
5935000	5937000	working currently on an original table
5937000	5939000	um and it should be
5939000	5941000	coming out really soon
5941000	5943000	um we're pretty excited about it
5943000	5945000	and moving forward we actually
5945000	5947000	have we're looking at some
5947000	5949000	other license deals um to
5949000	5951000	possibly uh include but these
5951000	5953000	tables that we're going to be making are going to be
5953000	5955000	powered with pinball arcade
5955000	5957000	um they're going to be a you know separate
5957000	5959000	you know standalone apps one at a time
5959000	5961000	might have a link to the pinball arcade
5961000	5963000	if you want to play some more pinball
5963000	5965000	some more real pinball um
5965000	5967000	but we're just starting to do it
5967000	5969000	and there's a lot of people here internally since we've been
5969000	5971000	making pinball for so long now
5971000	5973000	and we've seen so many different designs come
5973000	5975000	uh we've created
5975000	5977000	and simulated that we are
5977000	5979000	pretty excited here a lot of us
5979000	5981000	to start making our own tables
5981000	5983000	the first one that we're going to be doing is
5983000	5985000	a relatively
5985000	5987000	like a kind of like a stepping stone i guess
5987000	5989000	we're taking an existing
5989000	5991000	table and kind of modding it
5991000	5993000	um because we're trying to get it
5993000	5995000	out relatively fast
5995000	5997000	but moving forward we've got a lot of ideas
5997000	5999000	to do some more
5999000	6001000	original table design and
6001000	6003000	it seems like the
6003000	6005000	the feeling here internally in the studio
6005000	6007000	is to do
6007000	6009000	tables that could exist in real life as opposed
6009000	6011000	to the then approach which is
6011000	6013000	make video gamey um
6013000	6015000	pinball we're going to try to make tables
6015000	6017000	that actually could really exist
6017000	6019000	and make out our niche when it comes to original design
6019000	6021000	you know and there are
6021000	6023000	so few pinball machines
6023000	6025000	that are really released every year now
6025000	6027000	you know it's really you know ramped down in where we're at
6027000	6029000	now so i mean it does feel like a natural
6029000	6031000	progression that you know well these maybe these
6031000	6033000	are the tables that they would be making if
6033000	6035000	if you know there were uh
6035000	6037000	as many physical pinball tables these days
6037000	6039000	right right i mean
6039000	6041000	there's two manufacturers still working
6041000	6043000	um and maybe you know a couple more
6043000	6045000	you know trying to get off the ground
6045000	6047000	um but yeah zen's doing a pretty good
6047000	6049000	job of licensing some cool properties
6049000	6051000	and we hope to get in there too
6051000	6053000	uh well best of luck with you guys
6053000	6055000	uh in in that venture although i am
6055000	6057000	going to hold out hope personally i know this might be a
6057000	6059000	tricky one for you guys to get but that tron
6059000	6061000	pinball table they just released is so rad
6061000	6063000	i i really hope you
6063000	6065000	guys can work something out with that
6065000	6067000	yeah we have one really big fan
6067000	6069000	of it here generally so we're
6069000	6071000	we're working on that one it's a tough license
6071000	6073000	all right i'm joining the club make that two fans
6073000	6075000	all right uh now
6075000	6077000	i'm sure a lot of people out there that are
6077000	6079000	listening to this program they probably have downloaded
6079000	6081000	the the free trials of pinball arcade
6081000	6083000	that that come with uh
6083000	6085000	one table right and they they wonder
6085000	6087000	maybe i should go in and and buy
6087000	6089000	another table but there's so many to choose
6089000	6091000	from now i know this is a tough question
6091000	6093000	but is is there one table out there
6093000	6095000	in your collection that you think people
6095000	6097000	need to play and check out like because maybe
6097000	6099000	they don't have memories of it so you know
6099000	6101000	it's one thing to kind of go in there like oh i got to get
6101000	6103000	the star trek table because i'm a star trek fan but
6103000	6105000	is is there something people might be missing
6105000	6107000	like what is that one real
6107000	6109000	hidden gem that people really need to
6109000	6111000	check out in the collection
6111000	6113000	yeah someone's not a big fan of
6113000	6115000	real pinball they really should download the
6115000	6117000	table pack one which is medieval madness
6117000	6119000	and the pride of pinball because medieval
6119000	6121000	madness is such a fun table
6121000	6123000	so a lot of people's favorite table of all time
6123000	6125000	um inside it's not a huge license
6125000	6127000	you'll you know what's new to madness
6127000	6129000	you won't even have heard of it if you're not into pinball
6129000	6131000	right but it's it kind of has that money
6131000	6133000	python feel for the comedy
6133000	6135000	and it's really well designed
6135000	6137000	it's just a really fun table our co-host
6137000	6139000	our co-host dark soccer i believe
6139000	6141000	had one of those in her house for for a while
6141000	6143000	she had a bride of pinbot as well and that was
6143000	6145000	that machine's a ton i actually pinbot is
6145000	6147000	probably one of my i i will be honest
6147000	6149000	adam's family is actually my favorite table of all
6149000	6151000	time i have personally backed this kickstarter
6151000	6153000	and i i really thank you yeah
6153000	6155000	i really hope you guys get it uh but
6155000	6157000	my second favorite is probably pinbot
6157000	6159000	so you know i had to
6159000	6161000	play the original pinbot or the bride of pinbot
6161000	6163000	i prefer the original pinbot and part of
6163000	6165000	that is probably my memories of the nes
6165000	6167000	version as well which i know is like
6167000	6169000	kind of wacky different but
6169000	6171000	that was a little different but the physics
6171000	6173000	weren't exactly yeah yeah
6173000	6175000	as advanced as ours were they're 2d
6175000	6177000	but it was it was fun it was really
6177000	6179000	well done yeah when you're 10 years old you know
6179000	6181000	you're not thinking about that stuff as much so it's
6181000	6183000	you got a little more slack
6183000	6185000	um i have another question here from our facebook
6185000	6187000	community is the show where every gamer has
6187000	6189000	a voice and we invited you guys to ask some questions
6189000	6191000	and we had a derek over on our facebook community
6191000	6193000	ask you about some very specific
6193000	6195000	titles here so i don't even know if this is something you can
6195000	6197000	you can comment on but uh when will
6197000	6199000	raven hollywood heat and last
6199000	6201000	action hero be released are there
6201000	6203000	i and especially i look at last action hero
6203000	6205000	and i kind of go okay so there's there's obviously some
6205000	6207000	other big properties out there that people have
6207000	6209000	their eye on are there other properties
6209000	6211000	you guys are hoping to bring over that you have
6211000	6213000	your eye on that you might kick start next
6213000	6215000	um sure and actually i think
6215000	6217000	i've already mentioned that
6217000	6219000	um last action hero is
6219000	6221000	one that we do have our eye on
6221000	6223000	and we already have arnold's
6223000	6225000	likeness um for terminator 2
6225000	6227000	so that one is
6227000	6229000	very possible the other two are tables
6229000	6231000	i'm aware of um i can't say
6231000	6233000	that they're in any short term plans

6453000	6455000	it's got padding and it's not
6455000	6457000	wood so yeah it's it's a lot more
6457000	6459000	comfy than the uh other chair over there and of course
6459000	6461000	loki's still here with us yeah
6461000	6463000	half partially because he's he's kind of
6463000	6465000	engrossed in clicker heroes
6465000	6467000	yeah there's no there's
6467000	6469000	literally no point to me playing
6469000	6471000	this right now and yet
6471000	6473000	i am yeah that's well i'm not really
6473000	6475000	playing it i'm just mainly saying levels
6475000	6477000	done next levels done next
6477000	6479000	that's me and diablo 3
6479000	6481000	i mean
6481000	6483000	i was just watching that game it
6483000	6485000	looked like just stuff was falling from the sky and landing on the
6485000	6487000	ground it's because my characters do so
6487000	6489000	much damage that it kills them instantly
6489000	6491000	there it is instant kill because i cheated
6491000	6493000	because i didn't want to play this game and i
6493000	6495000	thought hey if i cheated it would be
6495000	6497000	it would be over faster you oh my
6497000	6499000	god loki can't even play clicker
6499000	6501000	heroes the right way he's got to cheat in
6501000	6503000	that too i did play i hope you were
6503000	6505000	putting cheat codes into your game
6505000	6507000	or you know heaven help you when
6507000	6509000	everybody wants to hack and cheat in your
6509000	6511000	game that you're making
6511000	6513000	well be smarter to check for that stuff
6513000	6515000	yeah i bet i bet we'll see how that goes all right
6515000	6517000	uh hey i've gotten to the point now where
6517000	6519000	stuff isn't dying instantly so that's
6519000	6521000	that's good right before we get into
6521000	6523000	some rapid fire news i wanted to check in with
6523000	6525000	our friends over at the uh big anime game room
6525000	6527000	and see what what they might have going on right

6555000	6557000	it's our locals here in sacramento
6557000	6559000	and we really wanted to jump start that again

6743000	6745000	back in the last decade thank you very much
6745000	6747000	anyway
6747000	6749000	speaking of
6749000	6751000	i think it was one of the times when i met you
6751000	6753000	jonas at paradise island days remember that
6753000	6755000	oh yeah when we when we
6755000	6757000	indirectly met each other and stuff
6757000	6759000	for a tournament that we actually hosted in sacramento
6759000	6761000	like after like it was a tournament
6761000	6763000	it was a tournament in 2005 called spit
6763000	6765000	sacramento paradise
6765000	6767000	island tournament oh it's awesome
6767000	6769000	right this is the i think this is the time where
6769000	6771000	they wanted me to run a tournament
6771000	6773000	so i was like cool i want to run a ddr tournament
6773000	6775000	for sacramento
6775000	6777000	smash brothers and ddr tournament in the same venue
6777000	6779000	and we kind of crossed streams me and him
6779000	6781000	not in that fashion but
6781000	6783000	we crossed streams
6783000	6785000	don't cross the streams
6785000	6787000	we kind of initially talked
6787000	6789000	we got reacquainted back in 2007 after that
6789000	6791000	can you believe it
6791000	6793000	though i mean speaking of like ddr and all that
6793000	6795000	tonight is episode 570
6795000	6797000	so guess what's in 3 more episodes
6797000	6799000	i can't
6799000	6801000	i can't i can't officially unveil
6801000	6803000	anything yet but we have a lead on
6803000	6805000	a really great interview
6805000	6807000	for that night to celebrate
6807000	6809000	573 which anybody who like
6809000	6811000	knows ddr any old school
6811000	6813000	konami game ought to catch the reference so i'm very
6813000	6815000	excited about that
6815000	6817000	we'll let you know more details on that when we have everything
6817000	6819000	you know all our t's crossing our i's dotted
6819000	6821000	and all that good stuff so before we get into
6821000	6823000	rapid fire news anything else we should know about going on
6823000	6825000	speaking of
6825000	6827000	games for those
6827000	6829000	those who are going to pacific media expo
6829000	6831000	next month november
6831000	6833000	i think it's like november
6833000	6835000	i think it's 7th or 9th it's just a friday through sunday
6835000	6837000	they are actually hosting the united
6837000	6839000	states pump it up festival
6839000	6841000	the u.s championships
6841000	6843000	for pump it up
6843000	6845000	and that's that's still a big thing too
6845000	6847000	um u.s it's really hard to say if
6847000	6849000	it's still big but i know in countries
6849000	6851000	like mexico and south america that's still
6851000	6853000	really big people keep forgetting
6853000	6855000	that
6855000	6857000	from that that said that the country they still play
6857000	6859000	a lot maybe a few koreans and stuff but
6859000	6861000	because some koreans still play
6861000	6863000	because they still want to compete with um the
6863000	6865000	competition i heard i heard pump was like
6865000	6867000	still really huge in latin america so that's
6867000	6869000	okay that makes a lot of sense are they the ones that took it
6869000	6871000	away from korea um that was
6871000	6873000	years ago when when they had the rule of no
6873000	6875000	bar when they had the when
6875000	6877000	when they actually started allowing bar i think
6877000	6879000	that the competition started being a little bit
6879000	6881000	more even not i'm saying anything
6881000	6883000	bad about those who actually use the bar or not
6883000	6885000	but that's been that's yeah again let's
6885000	6887000	leave the drama from 10 years ago
6887000	6889000	but again that's what that was a shift
6889000	6891000	change of what statistics were showing
6891000	6893000	during who is the top players
6893000	6895000	but actually still mexico is still
6895000	6897000	on the top 10 in terms of not tournaments
6897000	6899000	but actual just um actually um
6899000	6901000	act out one of our mexican listeners
6901000	6903000	in chat saying yeah pump it up is still big here
6903000	6905000	so very cool so i think
6905000	6907000	the rankings are still top 10
6907000	6909000	for just regular players
6909000	6911000	for pump it up fiesta too
6911000	6913000	all right so yep there is

7097000	7099000	it's a pretty diverse cast list so yeah
7099000	7101000	it's pretty awesome considering i don't know
7101000	7103000	them it looks neat
7103000	7105000	in the picture at least
7105000	7107000	i mean it looks like it's gonna be pretty high
7107000	7109000	but i i don't know i just can't see what
7109000	7111000	the plot's gonna be but you know what fuck i couldn't
7111000	7113000	imagine what a lego movie was gonna be like and that
7113000	7115000	ended up being pretty awesome so whatever
7115000	7117000	true it's all good but are we gonna see
7117000	7119000	like now anger birds the movie the game
7119000	7121000	i mean cause you know
7121000	7123000	is it gonna come full full circle again
7123000	7125000	why not street further movie
7125000	7127000	the game why not with the
7127000	7129000	fighting game so
7129000	7131000	i'd play that
7131000	7133000	i at least try it
7133000	7135000	once i mean cause it's something else
7135000	7137000	it sounds like it'd be pretty cool
7137000	7139000	uh this is kind of a neat little thing
7139000	7141000	that they're adding to the halo master chief
7141000	7143000	collection halo one and two
7143000	7145000	also of course had pc
7145000	7147000	versions of the game and those
7147000	7149000	versions of the game also had exclusive
7149000	7151000	multiplayer maps well now those
7151000	7153000	are actually gonna be coming over as
7153000	7155000	part of the master chief
7155000	7157000	collection so you'll be able to play those maps including
7157000	7159000	timberland death island
7159000	7161000	um i'm not even gonna try to
7161000	7163000	pronounce that it was jeff
7163000	7165000	hydro
7165000	7167000	jeff hydro phobia i don't know
7167000	7169000	um i have no idea
7169000	7171000	that's like a fucking made up name and i don't even
7171000	7173000	care uh danger canyon see why
7173000	7175000	can't they be just like danger canyon um
7175000	7177000	ice fields and infinity from
7177000	7179000	halo the collector's edition
7179000	7181000	and halo 2 they've got
7181000	7183000	um they got district and uplift
7183000	7185000	um so that'd be pretty cool and also
7185000	7187000	some pc exclusive weapons
7187000	7189000	like i guess a flamethrower and they had a
7189000	7191000	fuel rod gun or it's supposed to be coming
7191000	7193000	um or you can filter
7193000	7195000	them out because they're allowing you to
7195000	7197000	do that kind of thing boy they're really trying to make this
7197000	7199000	like the definitive halo aren't
7199000	7201000	they that's pretty awesome i mean
7201000	7203000	cool and uh
7203000	7205000	hey you know what this was a pretty cool
7205000	7207000	game on uya although i didn't get it
7207000	7209000	at the time because i was playing like a very very
7209000	7211000	early version of it but one of the
7211000	7213000	best games i guess on uya and
7213000	7215000	it was at least one i had one
7215000	7217000	was amazing frog it was a game where
7217000	7219000	you just kind of hurt yourself as
7219000	7221000	a frog bouncing off different
7221000	7223000	things and stuff like that and it was only on uya but now
7223000	7225000	now it's going to be coming
7225000	7227000	to steam so you
7227000	7229000	can check it out and they've got all sorts of
7229000	7231000	fun stuff in there i guess it's actually
7231000	7233000	it reminds me a lot of goat simulator it
7233000	7235000	is like goat sim it is
7235000	7237000	and they're going to have you know different
7237000	7239000	um four player split
7239000	7241000	screen um and all sorts of different
7241000	7243000	other modes in there um
7243000	7245000	so you know what i
7245000	7247000	checked it out i'm going to have to
7247000	7249000	check it out when it comes out
7249000	7251000	alright well uh loki i think
7251000	7253000	this is another game that really sounds like it's up your alley
7253000	7255000	and it was something that was on kick
7255000	7257000	starter and it made its goal
7257000	7259000	and it's trinket games developing this
7259000	7261000	it's called battle chef brigade
7261000	7263000	just imagine like iron chef
7263000	7265000	or top chef like what are those like
7265000	7267000	iron chef the anime is pretty much
7267000	7269000	it's like one of those epic cooking games like this is
7269000	7271000	like hardcore cooking mama
7271000	7273000	this is like cooking mama could be an iron
7273000	7275000	chef in the same way like if you watch the trailer video
7275000	7277000	that's on their kickstarter page it even opens
7277000	7279000	like iron chef with the
7279000	7281000	chairman eating a pepper
7281000	7283000	that's awesome that's amazing oh actually
7283000	7285000	uh the kickstarter is still going
7285000	7287000	it already made it's 38,000 but the
7287000	7289000	kickstarter is still going and
7289000	7291000	is scheduled for release in 2016
7291000	7293000	for the pc mac and
7293000	7295000	linux yeah holy crap that's a long time
7295000	7297000	yeah they're at 54,000
7297000	7299000	uh right now of their 38,000 goal
7299000	7301000	with 21 days to go this did
7301000	7303000	very well it looks awesome
7303000	7305000	it's like yeah
7305000	7307000	one part like cookie mama and then you
7307000	7309000	have to hunt monsters and you get
7309000	7311000	like resources from those monsters
7311000	7313000	and uh it's
7313000	7315000	definitely unique
7315000	7317000	uh i love this their next stretch goal
7317000	7319000	at 56,000 which they'll make
7319000	7321000	is uh summons call forth
7321000	7323000	incredible beings with powerful
7323000	7325000	spells similar to final fantasy tactics
7325000	7327000	what this is a fucking cooking game and
7327000	7329000	you're gonna like summon shiva like
7329000	7331000	instead of sick sticking it in the freezer it's like
7331000	7333000	oh shiva get over here and snap i think
7333000	7335000	though if they want to be really kind of cool
7335000	7337000	with that they should like kind of
7337000	7339000	combine both like final fantasy
7339000	7341000	summons and like
7341000	7343000	you know peeps chefs from
7343000	7345000	iron chef in there like you know
7345000	7347000	not that i want to give the example of bobby flay
7347000	7349000	because i fucking hate bobby flay but
7349000	7351000	um you know just have like you know
7351000	7353000	bobby flay in there or like cat core
7353000	7355000	okay cat core and shiva you know together
7355000	7357000	or something like that they're like
7357000	7359000	materia it's like spices
7359000	7361000	recipes or something and and then like
7361000	7363000	it all's like you you don't summon fourth
7363000	7365000	you cook fourth and they get summoned and they do
7365000	7367000	something or i don't know like a
7367000	7369000	something crazy like that i need someone
7369000	7371000	to slice these carrots oh let me summon
7371000	7373000	there's a guy on there summon knights of the round
7373000	7375000	and then you'll afk in 30 minutes if you read
7375000	7377000	all the like different you know
7377000	7379000	um descriptions of the characters there's a
7379000	7381000	guy that's an undead zombie guy and he's able
7381000	7383000	to summon forth like
7383000	7385000	the undead and skeletons and stuff to
7385000	7387000	help him cook devil's food cake
7387000	7389000	it's pretty awesome i i don't know
7389000	7391000	it just sounds like a ridiculous
7391000	7393000	premise for a game but it
7393000	7395000	also would i could totally say this being
7395000	7397000	like an anime uh dart tatsumi in
7397000	7399000	chat says that reminds me of trauma center
7399000	7401000	the one on the wii where you could draw symbols
7401000	7403000	during the operation to do spells and shit
7403000	7405000	actually yeah kind of sounds like that
7405000	7407000	with cooking let's examine some of the
7407000	7409000	other stretch goals they've hit uh
7409000	7411000	jungle a new steamy overgrown
7411000	7413000	biome for you to hunt in oh
7413000	7415000	because i guess you have to hunt your food before you cook it
7415000	7417000	uh caverns where you catch bizarre
7417000	7419000	monsters deep undergrounds and
7419000	7421000	announcer vo every cooking

7445000	7447000	Contessa i would like to see
7447000	7449000	alright Paula Deem
7449000	7451000	no she's
7451000	7453000	controversial remember she's a little too controversial
7453000	7455000	alright anyway uh
7455000	7457000	also controversial could be
7457000	7459000	video game movies that don't turn out so
7459000	7461000	great so we're hoping dead rising
7461000	7463000	turns out alright there's a dead rising digital
7463000	7465000	film of course in production we've talked about it
7465000	7467000	before but we have uh
7467000	7469000	some more updates on what's going on
7469000	7471000	and this is according to
7471000	7473000	director zach
7473000	7475000	libofsky sorry if i'm saying that wrong
7475000	7477000	but that there will be familiar faces
7477000	7479000	uh and i can't reveal too
7479000	7481000	much but the character has covered wars
7481000	7483000	you know which might be a tease that frank
7483000	7485000	west is somehow in it he also
7485000	7487000	uh described the movie as
7487000	7489000	indiana jones with zombies
7489000	7491000	well now that's a i better see some
7491000	7493000	face melting if you're gonna use that comparison
7493000	7495000	there so we'll see what happens there
7495000	7497000	uh pretty much every person
7497000	7499000	i know has already emailed me saying they want
7499000	7501000	to be a zombie so i think we'll be fine
7501000	7503000	it's like shot in the dead with zombies
7503000	7505000	we're also planning a long one take
7505000	7507000	action shot with hundreds of zombies
7507000	7509000	which i'm very excited about online there's
7509000	7511000	no ratings board there's no run time
7511000	7513000	limit there are no rules
7513000	7515000	this is an experiment for legendary and they've been
7515000	7517000	very incredibly willing to take creative
7517000	7519000	risks now i know that they were against our
7519000	7521000	hardcore pornography
7521000	7523000	zombie scene but there's no rules
7523000	7525000	online this sounds like the type
7525000	7527000	of movie that i'm gonna show my mom and you know

7529000	7531000	that is gross that is a
7531000	7533000	gross movie um
7533000	7535000	i don't know if she'd think this is gross
7535000	7537000	because this seemed like it was more cartoon violence
7537000	7539000	in these games but uh too bad dark
7539000	7541000	soccer is still not here because i bet she'd be excited to know
7541000	7543000	that strider 2
7543000	7545000	that's right the uh arcade side
7545000	7547000	scroller strider 2 will be on the
7547000	7549000	playstation network uh coming out

7551000	7553000	is the big day that's available
7553000	7555000	uh this is the arcade game from
7555000	7557000	1999 and uh
7557000	7559000	yeah very cool this is uh the ps1

7561000	7563000	with 1989's
7563000	7565000	strider so that will be bundled then
7565000	7567000	with the download so you get strider 1 and
7567000	7569000	strider 2 originally on the playstation
7569000	7571000	1 did they release that

7667000	7669000	the warlock table that game
7669000	7671000	had some of the best pinball physics that are just a
7671000	7673000	tad faster than zen's pinball physics
7673000	7675000	uh brad
7675000	7677000	our pal from pod culture

7683000	7685000	man it was fun um
7685000	7687000	i hope that someone would bring it to one of the
7687000	7689000	pinball games for pc or console
7689000	7691000	my favorite digital table is probably
7691000	7693000	the star trek next generation one having two
7693000	7695000	of my favorite things pinball and star trek
7695000	7697000	combined is just
7697000	7699000	fantastic uh
7699000	7701000	febreeze a over on facebook
7701000	7703000	answers this question i played a fair
7703000	7705000	share of pinball tables but never had the
7705000	7707000	opportunity to spend enough time with them
7707000	7709000	my local had two well maintained
7709000	7711000	tables the adams family
7711000	7713000	and playboy i forgot
7713000	7715000	playboy had a table playboy
7715000	7717000	table is gone now but i play the adams
7717000	7719000	family every month it's the best
7719000	7721000	machine i've ever played it never bores me
7721000	7723000	on the digital side i like zen pinball the most
7723000	7725000	motley crew on mega drive was cool too
7725000	7727000	this answer reminded me we used to have an arcade
7727000	7729000	that had the guns and roses pinball table
7729000	7731000	that machine was the shit i wish that was
7731000	7733000	one that they could pour it over where the little
7733000	7735000	plunger was actually a big rose that you'd pull
7735000	7737000	that was awesome
7737000	7739000	and i played this wasn't that scandia
7739000	7741000	uh they they might have one
7741000	7743000	scandia but there used to be a little arcade in
7743000	7745000	roseville where i grew up and i think it was
7745000	7747000	supercade was what it was called and they had one
7747000	7749000	there and they actually had the playboy table there
7749000	7751000	too so i've actually played that game before i don't know why i was thinking
7751000	7753000	the birdcage but that could have been something else
7753000	7755000	it probably was back when birdcage had a
7755000	7757000	i wish they had more nickel arcades
7757000	7759000	the last nickel arcade
7759000	7761000	we had was in downtown
7761000	7763000	sacramento but that shut down like a year
7763000	7765000	2001

7767000	7769000	time ago alright moving over to emily c

7775000	7777000	theme here it was always very
7777000	7779000	entertaining and challenging to me today it would

7781000	7783000	enter the room with one digitally i
7783000	7785000	fell in love with pokemon pinball

7881000	7883000	is it the adams family the one where you have to
7883000	7885000	like cycle cycle and
7885000	7887000	charge the ball okay the here's the
7887000	7889000	crazy thing they had an adams family
7889000	7891000	thing that was like prop cycle

7901000	7903000	no when they when they uh poured it over
7903000	7905000	i don't believe prop cycle will be involved
7905000	7907000	i don't remember
7907000	7909000	that i've never played that
7909000	7911000	where they have the prop cycle thing yeah
7911000	7913000	jamie knows i know they had that in california
7913000	7915000	extreme at one point yeah yeah that's probably where
7915000	7917000	she saw it yeah and i remember seeing
7917000	7919000	that in reno at the time like when i was like
7919000	7921000	it was like 15 years ago when i was playing
7921000	7923000	where they had some really good
7923000	7925000	pinball machines like um
7925000	7927000	i noticed they had a street fighter one which is pretty fun
7927000	7929000	oh yeah yeah it was a street fighter pinball
7929000	7931000	and yeah but i just forget the names
7931000	7933000	of it because all the people at first looked the same
7933000	7935000	but they're actually it's pretty fun just
7935000	7937000	forgetting the names of the problem sure sure as
7937000	7939000	i said earlier i i'm definitely a fan
7939000	7941000	of that pokemon pinball that
7941000	7943000	was definitely addicting for a while and
7943000	7945000	um at one point there was a back to the
7945000	7947000	future pinball uh yes there was yeah i
7947000	7949000	was kind of interested in that too that back to the future one
7949000	7951000	and uh
7951000	7953000	other than that i can't really recall anymore but
7953000	7955000	i remember some some different ones that
7955000	7957000	we did at like i mentioned the bird cage earlier
7957000	7959000	because my brother would always drag me out there and some
7959000	7961000	there was always like pinball machines all over the place because
7961000	7963000	he's twice my age and all that so
7963000	7965000	he'd always pull me aside and say
7965000	7967000	we're gonna have fun and play some real video games
7967000	7969000	and i'm glad i'm grateful for
7969000	7971000	him for doing that because otherwise i wouldn't have
7971000	7973000	you know touched all those fields right
7973000	7975000	right yeah but it was fun definitely it was very addicting
7975000	7977000	yeah definitely uh i see a lot of
7977000	7979000	uh comments in our chat room talking about sonic
7979000	7981000	spinball um another you know
7981000	7983000	pinball video game oh god
7983000	7985000	sonic spinball was so different though because like
7985000	7987000	you you could kind of move
7987000	7989000	sonic like if you weren't
7989000	7991000	doing right like you could like jump up
7991000	7993000	it's not real it's it's a combination
7993000	7995000	of yeah it's like a combo
7995000	7997000	it's like pinball quest or something
7997000	7999000	and then the faces
7999000	8001000	of that is kind of bs at some points
8001000	8003000	yeah it is remember metroid pinball
8003000	8005000	i do it was the
8005000	8007000	first game well it was yeah it came
8007000	8009000	with the rumble thing yeah good times
8009000	8011000	alright thank you guys for answering our
8011000	8013000	fugo question of the week we're gonna get back into
8013000	8015000	some other news loki
8015000	8017000	alright um so this is kind of
8017000	8019000	neat uh playstation well it's
8019000	8021000	not neat it kind of sucks actually uh
8021000	8023000	thankfully it's not
8023000	8025000	gonna be here uh but they're increasing the price
8025000	8027000	of playstation plus for certain regions
8027000	8029000	um not in north
8029000	8031000	america though but in south america ukraine
8031000	8033000	russia turkey and india
8033000	8035000	regions um they're increasing
8035000	8037000	the price because of various market
8037000	8039000	conditions and of course
8039000	8041000	they go on to reiterate again that this is
8041000	8043000	not happening in north america
8043000	8045000	um so
8045000	8047000	i don't know
8047000	8049000	it kind of sucks i guess for those
8049000	8051000	regions that it's going up in price
8051000	8053000	um i don't
8053000	8055000	know if you can buy cards elsewhere
8055000	8057000	in redeemum i don't think you can
8057000	8059000	so
8059000	8061000	um hmm
8061000	8063000	oh well
8063000	8065000	um i guess it is neat
8065000	8067000	that we're not gonna get a price increase here
8067000	8069000	at least yet yeah that would be something
8069000	8071000	they sneak in after the holiday or something
8071000	8073000	quote yet right
8073000	8075000	yeah and unfortunately it's already happened
8075000	8077000	uh on october
8077000	8079000	first um
8079000	8081000	so well that kind of sucks
8081000	8083000	oh my god if they do like a crazy black
8083000	8085000	friday deal again this year something like it remember
8085000	8087000	last year they had like an insanely good black
8087000	8089000	friday deal i don't know if they do black friday
8089000	8091000	stuff in other countries like that but you know
8091000	8093000	what um keep an eye out
8093000	8095000	uh i guess in other regions because
8095000	8097000	i'm sure that there's places
8097000	8099000	where you can buy cards like that
8099000	8101000	um they mark down the price
8101000	8103000	and maybe you can get one for your region that's
8103000	8105000	cheaper than what they're gonna
8105000	8107000	you know do for
8107000	8109000	it probably smart that they aren't
8109000	8111000	doing that for north america because i think people would pitch
8111000	8113000	a fit you know about it
8113000	8115000	um especially that or like japan or
8115000	8117000	something like that i think they would pitch a fit
8117000	8119000	um about those
8119000	8121000	prices going up and you know microsoft
8121000	8123000	i'm sure get on board and say hey
8123000	8125000	you know even though theirs is
8125000	8127000	more expensive but i
8127000	8129000	don't know it's still you don't want to raise
8129000	8131000	prices out of the fact all right well let's
8131000	8133000	hope they don't decide to do the same thing unless
8133000	8135000	you know they're throwing in
8135000	8137000	some features or something that makes
8137000	8139000	the games they give away are pretty darn good though
8139000	8141000	you gotta admit i mean playstation plus is
8141000	8143000	a really great here's what i would like is you know
8143000	8145000	maybe all those games that i
8145000	8147000	have in my library if i could
8147000	8149000	you know stream this that would be great
8149000	8151000	i would love that yeah we should
8151000	8153000	get that with like playstation plus or whatever
8153000	8155000	where the ps1 games we bought should be
8155000	8157000	streamable on ps4 when they get the
8157000	8159000	ps1 and ps2 stuff working but hopefully
8159000	8161000	that's sooner rather than later right or even like playstation
8161000	8163000	3 stuff i mean there's stuff i have in my
8163000	8165000	library that true that'd be nice
8165000	8167000	true very true all right
8167000	8169000	let's move on to talk about a new feature
8169000	8171000	coming to the 3ds
8171000	8173000	and uh we don't know when but it'll be sometime
8173000	8175000	in this next month nintendo is going to be releasing
8175000	8177000	a firmware update for the 3ds
8177000	8179000	that will allow themes you
8179000	8181000	know because speaking of playstation
8181000	8183000	this is something that is on the playstation
8183000	8185000	uh three at least and we know it's coming
8185000	8187000	to the four and they can
8187000	8189000	sell themes and make money off them
8189000	8191000	so why not on the 3ds as well
8191000	8193000	especially we're talking about with these new 3ds
8193000	8195000	you can have all these like interchangeable face plates
8195000	8197000	so you can have like 3ds that match your shoes
8197000	8199000	well now why not the why not the
8199000	8201000	internal theme yeah they're gonna have the themes that match
8201000	8203000	those the face plates exactly
8203000	8205000	so 50 themes gonna be
8205000	8207000	offered in japan at the launch including
8207000	8209000	a few from third parties
8209000	8211000	they'll be like a monster hunter theme is apparently
8211000	8213000	one of the things uh
8213000	8215000	now here's the thing they're not gonna be free but they're
8215000	8217000	priced at around either 100 or
8217000	8219000	200 yen depending on what it is
8219000	8221000	that's a buck or two roughly
8221000	8223000	so they're gonna be cheap
8223000	8225000	but that's still money for a theme
8225000	8227000	but still though they charge money for themes
8227000	8229000	um yeah if some were free
8229000	8231000	that's cool if they do they have
8231000	8233000	simple color set and simple
8233000	8235000	clear color set are free
8235000	8237000	oh color set
8237000	8239000	fancy
8239000	8241000	but if you want to get something
8241000	8243000	like i don't know uh animal crossing
8243000	8245000	able sisters mabel
8245000	8247000	that's gonna set you back why can't i do my
8247000	8249000	own themes like i could in you know the
8249000	8251000	xbox 360 because you'd put
8251000	8253000	a penis on it and we all know you can't
8253000	8255000	have that on the nintendo system wrong wouldn't put
8255000	8257000	a penis on it but a lot of people would put porns
8257000	8259000	from if it's any new
8259000	8261000	indication from the you know youtube

8807000	8809000	question let's go to another email here
8809000	8811000	from azhp
8811000	8813000	uh
8813000	8815000	hey olr crew azhp here
8815000	8817000	i heard you guys talk about uh the
8817000	8819000	online educational game galaxies
8819000	8821000	on the show yesterday and
8821000	8823000	the studio seemed very positive about it
8823000	8825000	as someone who lives with someone who works
8825000	8827000	on the game i hear firsthand every
8827000	8829000	single day about how the ceo has no idea
8829000	8831000	what he's doing has never made a game before
8831000	8833000	and ignores the advice criticism and
8833000	8835000	general sense from his entire team
8835000	8837000	oh boy this
8837000	8839000	is well we're getting some some
8839000	8841000	tea spill on this one aren't we trying to
8841000	8843000	relax these yeah it's that educational game
8843000	8845000	we talked about a little bit last week now i just want to say
8845000	8847000	i'm just going to put disclaimer out here because i just
8847000	8849000	want to make sure the opinion that i'm reading
8849000	8851000	here is the opinion of the listener and does not
8851000	8853000	necessarily reflect that i'm just going to make
8853000	8855000	because this is this sounds like some pretty
8855000	8857000	this is some gossip so get your coffee
8857000	8859000	and uh let's see see some more here
8859000	8861000	on the email here um
8861000	8863000	continuing on the email
8863000	8865000	he will ask for mini games to be coded
8865000	8867000	in a single day and then ask why
8867000	8869000	there are bugs in it he tells people that they
8869000	8871000	should work on the weekends because that's what successful
8871000	8873000	companies do and he once hired an incompetent
8873000	8875000	socially inept crybaby programmer
8875000	8877000	while his lead programmer was out on
8877000	8879000	maternity leave even though he the CEO
8879000	8881000	doesn't know the first thing about programming or making a game
8881000	8883000	he also told his team
8883000	8885000	when they asked for dedicated QA staff
8885000	8887000	so they could focus on building of the game that
8887000	8889000	quote there's no reason why all of us can't
8889000	8891000	QA our own work 100% of the time
8891000	8893000	then he finally caved
8893000	8895000	and said i think i have a 9 year old
8895000	8897000	nephew who can QA this game for us
8897000	8899000	oh boy uh finally i've played
8899000	8901000	the game in various stages of completion
8901000	8903000	and i can assure you that as an engineer
8903000	8905000	who grew up playing educational games
8905000	8907000	the game is pretty pitifully simple
8907000	8909000	in terms of science concepts even
8909000	8911000	compared to some educational games from the 90s
8911000	8913000	and the mini games themselves take
8913000	8915000	some creative liberties with how scientifically
8915000	8917000	accurate they are i'll be surprised
8917000	8919000	if the game ever ships and i'm pretty willing to
8919000	8921000	bet that if it does ship it'll be about as good
8921000	8923000	as the Duke Nukem forever of educational
8923000	8925000	games wow my jaw is on the floor
8925000	8927000	with like the fucking like reading to
8927000	8929000	filth going on in this mail
8929000	8931000	just thought you guys deserved
8931000	8933000	a more accurate picture of the game
8933000	8935000	than the PR spin the New York Science
8935000	8937000	Foundation puts on it because
8937000	8939000	i think they're going to be pretty disappointed with the game
8939000	8941000	if and when it actually does
8941000	8943000	ship yours truly
8943000	8945000	AZHP
8945000	8947000	DAMN
8949000	8951000	well uh
8951000	8953000	i guess the only way to truly find
8953000	8955000	out is to try the game for yourself once
8955000	8957000	it comes out but that is um
8957000	8959000	you know what let me say this
8959000	8961000	let me try to pull
8961000	8963000	what i possibly can out of this
8963000	8965000	especially what it can apply to other stuff
8965000	8967000	in the industry is that you know
8967000	8969000	it does go to show that sometimes
8969000	8971000	we get the feeling and i
8971000	8973000	i don't know this guy and i don't know
8973000	8975000	this company and i don't know you know
8975000	8977000	the CEO or whatever but i have
8977000	8979000	heard stories from other places about
8979000	8981000	people in middle management at some of these
8981000	8983000	companies who really don't seem to know
8983000	8985000	a fucking thing about video games
8985000	8987000	and the impression i'm getting
8987000	8989000	from this email which you know again
8989000	8991000	is i
8991000	8993000	i can't endorse it officially
8993000	8995000	but i can take it at face value
8995000	8997000	i have heard from this listener before
8997000	8999000	and they write pretty good emails
8999000	9001000	i'm inclined to kind of go
9001000	9003000	oh shit where there's smoke there's fire
9003000	9005000	type of thing right so
9005000	9007000	i mean we've heard about where people
9007000	9009000	sometimes who are in the
9009000	9011000	middle in the management so forth
9011000	9013000	kind of don't seem to know what they're doing sometimes
9013000	9015000	like and i get worried when i read that
9015000	9017000	stuff about QA i think i have a
9017000	9019000	9 year old nephew who can QA this game
9019000	9021000	for us that's not QA
9021000	9023000	that's like test marketing
9023000	9025000	or you know because obviously if it's an
9025000	9027000	educational game then fine 9 year olds who
9027000	9029000	the game's targeting but that's that's not QA
9029000	9031000	a 9 year old is not going to explore
9031000	9033000	every single nook
9033000	9035000	and cranny of the game to intentionally
9035000	9037000	try to destroy it
9037000	9039000	a 9 year old doesn't have that type of attention
9039000	9041000	span that's your focus group
9041000	9043000	that's your test audience that's not QA
9043000	9045000	so
9045000	9047000	that right there i kind of go uh oh
9047000	9049000	jonas you're
9049000	9051000	kind of sitting back here going
9051000	9053000	i heard about like
9053000	9055000	the email dimension i think did it mention that
9055000	9057000	something about working like
9057000	9059000	weekends and all that other stuff
9059000	9061000	oh yeah oh yeah you can't just mimic what
9061000	9063000	other companies do for your own success you got to figure it out
9063000	9065000	yourself oh yeah yeah i thought there were
9065000	9067000	laws like actually against that ever since the whole
9067000	9069000	ea incident like not if your
9069000	9071000	contractor whatever i mean you can
9071000	9073000	i think they can make up their own
9073000	9075000	like rules
9075000	9077000	you know when i heard that i was like
9077000	9079000	oh shit we're going back to the what caught
9079000	9081000	ea into a big strangle
9081000	9083000	of legal situations
9083000	9085000	and i'm not sure if it's a repeat of
9085000	9087000	that a lot of
9087000	9089000	reaction in our chat room i mean there's just a lot
9089000	9091000	of people going wow wow wow
9091000	9093000	like it looks like we have a bunch of doge in our chat
9093000	9095000	room right now wow wow such wow
9095000	9097000	much anger wow but see we have
9097000	9099000	bochi kawa says
9099000	9101000	someone had a little bit of pent up aggression although i
9101000	9103000	can believe all of it which is terrible
9103000	9105000	dungeon buster says sadly it's a story that
9105000	9107000	i've read too often about a few other
9107000	9109000	companies it's not crunch it's over
9109000	9111000	time we just won't be paying you over time
9111000	9113000	and ssj100 matt says plenty
9113000	9115000	of companies pull shady shit
9115000	9117000	the stories i could tell you
9117000	9119000	that is true this isn't necessarily something
9119000	9121000	and i don't know if ssj100 matt
9121000	9123000	meant gaming companies or when
9123000	9125000	he says plenty of companies he means like
9125000	9127000	companies all over like not just
9127000	9129000	necessarily
9129000	9131000	video games and i would
9131000	9133000	believe it i believe there's a lot more industries
9133000	9135000	than just video games where this kind of fuckery goes
9135000	9137000	on so
9137000	9139000	a burnt out employee
9139000	9141000	is not a happy employee and a happy employee
9141000	9143000	is going to or an unhappy
9143000	9145000	employee excuse me is bound to make more
9145000	9147000	bugs whether they want to or not that
9147000	9149000	a nine year old is not going to find in the game just
9149000	9151000	saying so you better
9151000	9153000	find that right balance so
9153000	9155000	yikes well you know what um
9155000	9157000	although i hope that doesn't
9157000	9159000	start too much controversy if anyone
9159000	9161000	from that team happens to be
9161000	9163000	listening feels differently
9163000	9165000	i would love to hear from

9177000	9179000	that was our last of our email by the way so
9179000	9181000	please send this email for a future week participate
9181000	9183000	at orange launch radar.com
9183000	9185000	that last email sure does make a good
9185000	9187000	transition into one of our regular segments we do here
9187000	9189000	on the show it is the FUs
9189000	9191000	of the week
9205000	9207000	uh Loki we'll start with you
9208000	9210000	uh i feel the power outages because we keep
9210000	9212000	having them for some reason i think
9212000	9214000	someone ran into a power pole or something
9214000	9216000	i don't know because i saw them fixing
9216000	9218000	it the day after but we also had one this morning
9218000	9220000	for no apparent reason and the thing
9220000	9222000	it sucks is it shuts off you know
9222000	9224000	the lights and the fans during the night
9224000	9226000	you know that my son uses
9226000	9228000	to keep himself asleep
9228000	9230000	because he likes white noise and then
9230000	9232000	everybody's up you know
9232000	9234000	instead of us being able to sleep through
9234000	9236000	the night so that kind of sucks
9236000	9238000	i wish they would just fix that shit
9238000	9240000	oh and and their ever helpful
9240000	9242000	phone call which i don't even know how the
9242000	9244000	hell they have my number anyways but
9244000	9246000	they called me like an hour
9246000	9248000	after the power outage was done
9248000	9250000	like there's been a power outage
9250000	9252000	i'm like no fucking shit really
9252000	9254000	that was all the things turning off
9254000	9256000	was that what that was i thought it was a ghost
9256000	9258000	i mean seriously thank you
9258000	9260000	smud for fucking calling
9260000	9262000	me and telling me there was a fucking
9262000	9264000	power outage like i couldn't fucking figure that out
9265000	9267000	um i want to give an FU to
9267000	9269000	destiny for not giving me better loot
9269000	9271000	because i'd really like to level up past level 21
9271000	9273000	so uh FU
9273000	9275000	you crap loot system
9275000	9277000	uh and uh let's see
9277000	9279000	i guess my other FU of the week goes to
9279000	9281000	just being like really busy
9281000	9283000	and tired i mean it's a good busy i can't
9283000	9285000	complain but i'm just i'm
9285000	9287000	probably spreading myself too thin again
9287000	9289000	but um yeah
9289000	9291000	there you go
9291000	9293000	real quick about destiny
9293000	9295000	if i played that say in the xbox 360
9295000	9297000	would my character level up and like
9297000	9299000	if i bought that on playstation 4
9299000	9301000	or does that only work for playstation 3 to playstation 4
9301000	9303000	only works i believe from 3 to 4
9303000	9305000	i do not believe it works the other way around
9305000	9307000	but check the bungee forums just to see
9307000	9309000	uh jonas my friend
9309000	9311000	how about you
9311000	9313000	uh big FU to the
9313000	9315000	whiners of people on facebook saying
9315000	9317000	oh they're changing the name policy where people can put
9317000	9319000	fake names this is by the way
9319000	9321000	in response to like the LGBT community
9321000	9323000	who's actually like drag queens
9323000	9325000	trying to protect themselves
9325000	9327000	and you're telling me that
9327000	9329000	and people are telling me uh
9329000	9331000	that they have to put
9331000	9333000	their real names
9333000	9335000	so what's gonna happen with the protection of um
9335000	9337000	the um the drag queens and all the
9337000	9339000	LGBT trying to keep themselves in the sequence
9339000	9341000	i'm not saying anything bad but people
9341000	9343000	are not understanding the situation right
9343000	9345000	i use a fake name on facebook and it's because
9345000	9347000	um i have had situations
9347000	9349000	where in my professional life i've had
9349000	9351000	people try to look me up online
9351000	9353000	and they have found things
9353000	9355000	in my past that they then
9355000	9357000	would bring up in the workplace
9357000	9359000	which is not appropriate you know what i mean
9359000	9361000	so i keep my life separate
9361000	9363000	so i have every right to do that
9363000	9365000	and what really pissed me off
9365000	9367000	in that whole thing and so FU
9367000	9369000	to Mark Zuckerberg because he said
9369000	9371000	something where people who don't use their real name
9371000	9373000	don't have integrity fuck
9373000	9375000	you for that comment
9375000	9377000	fuck you because you obviously
9377000	9379000	don't know what it's like to have a stalker
9379000	9381000	so be seated
9381000	9383000	have 50 seats
9383000	9385000	the funny thing is that one of the main people on facebook
9385000	9387000	said they're gonna change that policy so

9575000	9577000	golly gee loki what could you possibly be talking about here next
9577000	9579000	speaking of diarrhea
9579000	9581000	uh
9581000	9583000	some dumbass thought it was a great idea
9583000	9585000	to hey let's slice this tetris
9585000	9587000	and make it into a sci-fi movie
9587000	9589000	oh it'd be the dumbass that was behind
9589000	9591000	moral combat moral combat annihilation
9591000	9593000	now to be fair the moral combat movies were good
9593000	9595000	but i don't know how the fuck they're gonna
9595000	9597000	pull out a sci-fi movie out of tetris
9597000	9599000	i mean that doesn't that's like ok we wanted to make
9599000	9601000	a sci-fi movie but fuck it we
9601000	9603000	like some setris as well let's just
9603000	9605000	throw it together
9605000	9607000	but hey it's gonna
9607000	9609000	you know it's gonna be something
9609000	9611000	i guess i agree with tiger claw
9611000	9613000	in the chat room the tetris movie just needs that
9613000	9615000	mortal combat style soundtrack
9615000	9617000	it's gonna be a very big epic sci-fi movie
9617000	9619000	this isn't a movie with a bunch of lines
9619000	9621000	running around the page we're not
9621000	9623000	giving feet to geomet
9623000	9625000	geometric shapes brands
9625000	9627000	are the new stars of hollywood
9627000	9629000	we have a story behind
9629000	9631000	tetris which makes it much more
9631000	9633000	an imaginative thing yes i remember battleship
9633000	9635000	2 that wasn't a very good movie
9635000	9637000	ok but if they don't
9637000	9639000	have like kmfdm are they
9639000	9641000	still around but if they if they don't have like
9641000	9643000	kmfdm or some type of industrial band
9643000	9645000	doing a remix of
9645000	9647000	if they don't have
9647000	9649000	like the industrial yes
9649000	9651000	we need the rom zobby version
9651000	9653000	of that
9653000	9655000	heavy metal that's what we need
9655000	9657000	like during a big action scene
9657000	9659000	imagine tetris the movie
9659000	9661000	i'm sorry it's it's a puzzle
9661000	9663000	game you can't fucking make
9663000	9665000	movies out of puzzle games
9665000	9667000	it doesn't fucking work
9667000	9669000	unless i do something really fucked up
9669000	9671000	it's gonna be and if it does work
9671000	9673000	oh my god can you imagine all the knockoffs we're gonna get
9673000	9675000	then it's gonna be like sudoku
9675000	9677000	the mini series on television
9677000	9679000	scrabble that yeah
9679000	9681000	right then it's like scrabble
9681000	9683000	the you know the sitcom
9683000	9685000	coming to cbs i think that
9685000	9687000	the farthest you can go
9687000	9689000	to make a movie is based off of
9689000	9691000	a board game maybe and
9691000	9693000	that's where clue was clue was good
9693000	9695000	cult classic right was it
9695000	9697000	they're doing one for well they did
9697000	9699000	witch port but now they have an ouija movie as well
9699000	9701000	what i mean come on that's just a fucking paranormal movie
9701000	9703000	um they had
9703000	9705000	jumanji which technically wasn't a board game
9705000	9707000	but it was you know based on a book
9707000	9709000	about about like ants in my
9709000	9711000	pants or
9711000	9713000	uh don't break the ice they're gonna
9713000	9715000	have candy land
9715000	9717000	could they do crossfire
9717000	9719000	how about i would watch a crossfire movie how about
9719000	9721000	cootie i would fucking watch
9721000	9723000	crossfire it's gotta be the retro futuristic
9723000	9725000	thing though like fucking rollerball i'd
9725000	9727000	watch a crossfire
9727000	9729000	exactly gotta have a remix of the fucking
9729000	9731000	commercial hell yes
9731000	9733000	maybe tetris will go like the shark
9733000	9735000	nato route or something where it'll be
9735000	9737000	end up being like super camp like if
9737000	9739000	terra reed is cast in the tetris movie
9739000	9741000	then maybe it'll turn out okay
9741000	9743000	like if they if they aim for camp and so
9743000	9745000	bad it's good that would actually be
9745000	9747000	i know that there's like that he was at the
9747000	9749000	youtube trailer or something like that that
9749000	9751000	someone did a funny like haha it's a trailer
9751000	9753000	for a tetris movie because it's so ridiculous
9753000	9755000	okay i mean
9755000	9757000	it's stupid yeah i just don't want
9757000	9759000	to see a real tetris movie i don't think it's
9759000	9761000	it it doesn't make any fucking sense
9761000	9763000	if you won't make a sci-fi movie make a
9763000	9765000	fucking sci-fi movie there's plenty of properties
9765000	9767000	you can license that are actually sci-fi that
9767000	9769000	makes sense but don't just like
9769000	9771000	i can't like fucking say okay
9771000	9773000	i'm gonna take the game of poker and i'm gonna make it into
9773000	9775000	a war action film
9775000	9777000	it doesn't fucking make any sense
9777000	9779000	although that would probably make more sense
9779000	9781000	than this see act deft in chat says
9781000	9783000	don't wake daddy would be a horror movie
9783000	9785000	um
9785000	9787000	the legend of zaku in chat says
9787000	9789000	uh hungry hungry hippos the movie
9789000	9791000	you know
9791000	9793000	obesity that could well could be kind of like
9793000	9795000	jurassic park what about mousetrap
9795000	9797000	where like there you go oh there you go
9797000	9799000	that would be a pretty sweet you know that
9799000	9801000	was just the opening five minutes of pewie's
9801000	9803000	big adventure it's really just you know
9803000	9805000	all the videos for okay go but
9805000	9807000	i mean i don't know mr t i like
9807000	9809000	my cereal or jenka the movie
9809000	9811000	yeah right yeah yeah
9811000	9813000	thank god featuring the twin towers
9813000	9815000	no no
9815000	9817000	bad bad slap that is
9817000	9819000	bad taste oh my goodness
9819000	9821000	this is exactly what i'm thinking like
9821000	9823000	what did they do with the tetris movie of all
9823000	9825000	things i thought the only thing that the tetris thing
9825000	9827000	worked in was that you remember that they have that
9827000	9829000	little concept video for pixels or whatever
9829000	9831000	that adam sandler's not gonna take his shit on
9831000	9833000	but remember where they had you know the tetris
9833000	9835000	blocks you know falling down stuff and knocking
9835000	9837000	out buildings and stuff like that that was kind of
9837000	9839000	cool this adam sandler
9839000	9841000	movie probably not so cool but whatever
9841000	9843000	light bright wait adam sandler's
9843000	9845000	in the tetris movie no he's in the pixels
9845000	9847000	movie oh god he's in the pixels
9847000	9849000	i was like
9849000	9851000	no no no
9851000	9853000	gee how could the tetris movie get
9853000	9855000	any worse no he's in adam
9855000	9857000	sandler's in it wow it got worse
9857000	9859000	movie the pixels movie which is
9859000	9861000	about all the like retro 80s like
9861000	9863000	you know things coming alive
9863000	9865000	all the arcade characters and then also
9865000	9867000	um he's in candyland
9867000	9869000	which is gonna be terrible too so
9869000	9871000	all right all right uh moving
9871000	9873000	on one more story here for you
9873000	9875000	guys and uh this is just
9875000	9877000	kind of one of those hmm isn't that interesting
9877000	9879000	sort of stories well a few weeks
9879000	9881000	ago on the show we talked about how there was
9881000	9883000	a former nintendo employee
9883000	9885000	dan adelman and he left nintendo
9885000	9887000	he used to be the guy that would work
9887000	9889000	very closely with the indies
9889000	9891000	to get them onto the wii u uh e-shop
9891000	9893000	and you know he's responsible for some of these
9893000	9895000	big titles coming over to the wii u and he
9895000	9897000	actually left uh nintendo
9897000	9899000	well uh he actually
9899000	9901000	announced this week uh a game called
9901000	9903000	axiom verge that uh he
9903000	9905000	is uh working on he's involved with
9905000	9907000	the development of this game it's a metroid
9907000	9909000	castlevania style action platformer
9909000	9911000	and it's being developed by tom
9911000	9913000	hap who's a petroglyph games employee
9913000	9915000	who makes independent games
9915000	9917000	but here's the twist the
9917000	9919000	game is going to be exclusive to playstation
9919000	9921000	oh wow
9921000	9923000	i've actually played the game snap girl
9923000	9925000	i actually played the game actually oh
9925000	9927000	during e3 oh i didn't know it is
9927000	9929000	they actually had a small demo it
9929000	9931000	actually looks really good yeah yeah
9931000	9933000	i'm all for it feels like it feels like
9933000	9935000	the more bloody like aliens or
9935000	9937000	i'm not sure about the abadox
9937000	9939000	sorry the one with
9939000	9941000	it's more like abadox and aliens
9941000	9943000	mixed with metroid
9943000	9945000	so yeah it's gonna be a playstation
9945000	9947000	4 and vita and there was also
9947000	9949000	a steam version that's in the works
9949000	9951000	and uh you know dan edelman does say
9951000	9953000	quote although i will always have a special place in my
9953000	9955000	heart for nintendo fuck those guys no
9955000	9957000	he didn't say that he said in my
9957000	9959000	heart for nintendo this game is solely
9959000	9961000	focused on playstation which
9961000	9963000	surely you've gotta kind of go
9963000	9965000	oh really
9965000	9967000	but gotta get a ps4 now
9967000	9969000	ah
9969000	9971000	i was hoping there'd be a price reduction this year
9971000	9973000	but they've been selling too well yeah they are they
9973000	9975000	really are you probably won't see that
9975000	9977000	probably just wait for some sort of bundle
9977000	9979000	that you want i mean the other destiny one
9979000	9981000	hopefully they'll have some new bundles or
9981000	9983000	wait for microsoft to get desperate
9983000	9985000	and cut the price of their console a little
9985000	9987000	bit assuming it doesn't do well this
9987000	9989000	year i mean till black friday yeah
9989000	9991000	right isn't the xbox sort of
9991000	9993000	like starting to get a little bit of the peak only
9993000	9995000	because they don't include the connect
9995000	9997000	um
9997000	9999000	i mean it's not like
9999000	10001000	you know xbox is not doing like
10001000	10003000	awful but i mean
10003000	10005000	microsoft wants to be doing better
10005000	10007000	than they are that's for sure and they don't
10007000	10009000	like this fact that they're lagging behind sony
10009000	10011000	right now um so
10011000	10013000	they're gonna probably you know
10013000	10015000	if if halo doesn't really move some
10015000	10017000	consoles and so forth they'll probably
10017000	10019000	make a desperation move and that could be
10019000	10021000	slashing the price of the console or maybe a
10021000	10023000	redesign that would be cheaper parts who
10023000	10025000	knows you know this is
10025000	10027000	not before christmas not before
10027000	10029000	christmas we're we're everything that's coming
10029000	10031000	for the holidays you already know about at this point
10031000	10033000	they're not going to do anything then but uh
10033000	10035000	uh next year you never know what
10035000	10037000	bundles they'll sell what games

10075000	10077000	it so i am going to finish
10077000	10079000	it whatever means necessary and yes
10079000	10081000	you know the only thing that cheating does
10081000	10083000	it means i don't have to spend my life playing this fucking
10083000	10085000	game so i am going to ruin it for myself
10085000	10087000	so i stop playing it that was the goal
10087000	10089000	goal accomplished
10089000	10091000	except i am still fucking playing the game
10091000	10093000	so apparently there's

10119000	10121000	i have a feeling i know what i did but what is it
10121000	10123000	no you tell me what
10123000	10125000	what did you do i
10125000	10127000	bought crazy chocobo and you're probably
10127000	10129000	not very happy that i did that but
10129000	10131000	i'm just going to tell you deal with
10131000	10133000	it and then sunglasses are going to
10133000	10135000	fall from the sky and rest on my face
10135000	10137000	that's what's going to happen
10137000	10139000	uh yeah crazy
10139000	10141000	chocobo that song oh my
10141000	10143000	god i don't know how
10143000	10145000	people love that song i
10145000	10147000	check the i check
10147000	10149000	videos on youtube for
10149000	10151000	this crazy chocobo song on
10151000	10153000	on teeter rhythm just to see how it
10153000	10155000	how it's uh how it plays
10155000	10157000	and people are
10157000	10159000	oh my god this is my favorite song and i'm like
10159000	10161000	what it is you know what i
10161000	10163000	i will say this it is a lot more tolerable in a
10163000	10165000	two minute chunk i will say that
10165000	10167000	because they do have to crop it
10167000	10169000	yeah it is a two minute song
10169000	10171000	it's not that long so yeah
10171000	10173000	it's pretty much the full song
10173000	10175000	but yeah it's i don't know
10175000	10177000	and i and i have said this
10177000	10179000	before and before and
10179000	10181000	and even i said it this week
10181000	10183000	on twitter because uh i played a lot of
10183000	10185000	teeter rhythm before uh smash released
10185000	10187000	and
10187000	10189000	and i really loved all the songs that
10189000	10191000	they put from all the
10191000	10193000	the final fan final fantasy
10193000	10195000	13 series uh
10195000	10197000	13 2 lightning returns especially
10197000	10199000	lightning returns songs are really
10199000	10201000	great yeah they really are yeah
10201000	10203000	they are it kind of makes you want to play the game
10203000	10205000	sorry uh i
10205000	10207000	i still hear crazy chocobo
10207000	10209000	and i'll go like uh yeah
10209000	10211000	i don't know what went in
10211000	10213000	the minds of of the composer there
10213000	10215000	because yeah or or whoever
10215000	10217000	worked on the soundtrack have you heard the
10217000	10219000	titan song from final fantasy 14 because
10219000	10221000	that's kind of a heavy metal song too
10221000	10223000	i think so
10223000	10225000	uh well at least from your streams
10225000	10227000	i think i i have remembered that
10227000	10229000	but yeah that's that's a good song because
10229000	10231000	uh it
10231000	10233000	at least i consider it a good song because it's
10233000	10235000	uh at least it's
10235000	10237000	coherent it's uh it's not
10237000	10239000	played as funny yeah
10239000	10241000	because like the crazy uh well not the
10241000	10243000	crazy chocobo uh in particular
10243000	10245000	all the the chocobo
10245000	10247000	the chocobo songs are are
10247000	10249000	funny are are simplistic
10249000	10251000	are funny are are pretty much
10251000	10253000	just to enjoy
10253000	10255000	and crazy chocobo takes all that through
10255000	10257000	the window and replace it with another thing that
10257000	10259000	i i i i seriously
10259000	10261000	seriously sorry can't
10261000	10263000	comprehend why they did that well you know
10263000	10265000	i in all fairness music is music
10265000	10267000	and you know i sit here and i go how does
10267000	10269000	one direction sell millions of
10269000	10271000	albums it's not very good music but
10271000	10273000	somebody out there likes it who's
10273000	10275000	probably 12 years old but you know whatever
10275000	10277000	so um
10277000	10279000	uh is that it you just want to call and read me
10279000	10281000	out for crazy chocobo or
10281000	10283000	no i also want to talk about
10283000	10285000	the smash brothers a bit because
10285000	10287000	it's a really good game i thought you might what are your
10287000	10289000	thoughts on it uh well you've
10289000	10291000	pretty much uh nailed it at the
10291000	10293000	beginning uh it has its flaws
10293000	10295000	it's not perfect
10295000	10297000	but it's the smash brothers
10297000	10299000	it's it's an affordable it's
10299000	10301000	something that i personally wanted since
10301000	10303000	ever ever since the first
10303000	10305000	measure probably melee
10305000	10307000	that that we uh
10307000	10309000	that that we should
10309000	10311000	be able to play uh a smash
10311000	10313000	or something on a portable yes uh whenever
10313000	10315000	you uh whatever you go
10315000	10317000	you have your if you have your 3ds in this
10317000	10319000	case uh well you can play it
10319000	10321000	and it's it's really good it's
10321000	10323000	not a bad game it's not terrible
10323000	10325000	it has again it's
10325000	10327000	lost like the online component
10327000	10329000	uh it's it's a little
10329000	10331000	wonky especially uh with
10331000	10333000	whoever you're playing
10333000	10335000	with friends it's not it's
10335000	10337000	pretty great i haven't had that
10337000	10339000	many problems uh
10339000	10341000	although i haven't played online with uh
10341000	10343000	with strangers so i i don't know i
10343000	10345000	i but the same thing i wouldn't
10345000	10347000	i sorry i haven't
10347000	10349000	been able to connect to a server or to
10349000	10351000	uh to an image
10351000	10353000	online that way so yeah
10353000	10355000	uh yeah you know and it kind of makes me
10355000	10357000	think like you know i said earlier in the show that the
10357000	10359000	game uh maybe just isn't really
10359000	10361000	for this particular console i mean it
10361000	10363000	doesn't necessarily make it bad or whatever just
10363000	10365000	you know i kind of think back like we've seen fighting
10365000	10367000	games and games that were from
10367000	10369000	um you know the the consoles
10369000	10371000	ported to portable you know
10371000	10373000	since we even had the original game boy
10373000	10375000	like somebody put mortal combat
10375000	10377000	on the original game boy
10377000	10379000	and it's not that it was necessarily
10379000	10381000	bad per se but it just
10381000	10383000	really wasn't a game that was meant to be played on the game boy
10383000	10385000	and that's kind of how i feel about
10385000	10387000	smash and i realized some of the hardcore fans
10387000	10389000	are going to be like no rob you're wrong this is a
10389000	10391000	great thing because now we can play this
10391000	10393000	whenever we want we don't have to have the tv
10393000	10395000	and set it all up but i'm like yeah but you
10395000	10397000	have to have four 3ds's and four
10397000	10399000	copies of the game so
10399000	10401000	you know maybe at conventions that'll work but
10401000	10403000	i don't know i just
10403000	10405000	i just see it as the as the
10405000	10407000	appetizer for the main course
10407000	10409000	that's coming in the wii u version oh yeah
10409000	10411000	definitely though it's curiously because
10411000	10413000	most of the people that are mostly
10413000	10415000	hardcore for smash brothers
10415000	10417000	say that the 3ds
10417000	10419000	it's really awful and
10419000	10421000	and they're waiting for the wii u
10421000	10423000	version especially because
10423000	10425000	yeah all the flaws that the
10425000	10427000	3ds has probably the wii u
10427000	10429000	will fix them let's hope oh yeah that's
10429000	10431000	the again it's the portable
10431000	10433000	component if you can
10433000	10435000	deal with with the bad
10435000	10437000	the good stuff really really shines
10437000	10439000	and something to
10439000	10441000	just to finish this call before
10441000	10443000	it gets too long uh something that
10443000	10445000	the other rhythm and the smash brothers
10445000	10447000	really does really great it's the music
10447000	10449000	player having a music player
10449000	10451000	there having all the songs really
10451000	10453000	great something that a lot of
10453000	10455000	games should do and uh even
10455000	10457000	theater of them will play the cut scenes as well
10457000	10459000	with little movies for the songs that it's appropriate
10459000	10461000	for which is a great feature
10461000	10463000	so oh yeah but especially the music player because
10463000	10465000	you can uh have the 3ds in
10465000	10467000	sleep mode you can close it and
10467000	10469000	and just hear the songs
10469000	10471000	on your headphones so yeah
10471000	10473000	that's awesome that's awesome alright well
10473000	10475000	act deft I'm gonna go ahead and let you go but uh
10475000	10477000	thanks for the call I appreciate it hey thanks for having
10477000	10479000	me no problem take care my friend

10507000	10509000	here hey buddy how you doing
10509000	10511000	oh pretty good how are you good what's on your
10511000	10513000	mind um
10513000	10515000	uh you know just a really
10515000	10517000	quick question I thought I'd get you
10517000	10519000	take on something um
10519000	10521000	as you already know uh
10521000	10523000	we've been uh you know
10523000	10525000	seen a few more uh
10525000	10527000	games appearing on scene recently
10527000	10529000	I think uh what was it
10529000	10531000	three four
10531000	10533000	yeah three four seven
10533000	10535000	yeah three four seven eight
10535000	10537000	and they've announced 13 now
10537000	10539000	yeah and plus
10539000	10541000	uh what uh
10541000	10543000	you love it and 14 are also on there
10543000	10545000	well of course duh yeah
10545000	10547000	uh now
10547000	10549000	that being said what do
10549000	10551000	you think the odds are
10551000	10553000	that we'll see some of the other
10553000	10555000	Final Fantasy games
10555000	10557000	you know appearing schemes such as
10557000	10559000	um I know
10559000	10561000	Final Fantasy 9 Final Fantasy
10561000	10563000	10 10 2
10563000	10565000	um well
10565000	10567000	the ones you're naming
10567000	10569000	maybe not so much but I think
10569000	10571000	the likely candidates uh
10571000	10573000	and this is probably gonna kind of strike you as kind of
10573000	10575000	uh well oh okay uh I would say
10575000	10577000	five and six are very likely candidates
10577000	10579000	and the reason why I say that is because they've already
10579000	10581000	done those android versions and
10581000	10583000	all they did was convert those android and
10583000	10585000	ios versions for three and four
10585000	10587000	I see no reason why they won't do them for five and six
10587000	10589000	however I'm gonna warn you
10589000	10591000	the outsourced
10591000	10593000	sprite work in five and six
10593000	10595000	is somewhat questionable
10595000	10597000	I'm not sure it's
10597000	10599000	giving you quite the same pure experience
10599000	10601000	but if you've never
10601000	10603000	played the games before and you
10603000	10605000	don't exactly have the means to go track
10605000	10607000	down like a gameboy advance or an old
10607000	10609000	super nintendo which at this point how do you
10609000	10611000	um I would say
10611000	10613000	at least it's better than nothing
10613000	10615000	so uh if those games do come out to
10615000	10617000	steam and you haven't experienced five or
10617000	10619000	especially six for gods sake
10619000	10621000	six is one of the best they've ever made
10621000	10623000	in my opinion I like it but it's my favorite one
10623000	10625000	but if I don't know if you've played the android one
10625000	10627000	it's just kinda
10627000	10629000	it doesn't feel right
10629000	10631000	oh the little reboot one
10631000	10633000	yeah the app games and stuff
10633000	10635000	yeah cause the original sprites I actually
10635000	10637000	enjoyed the original stuff and when they tried to
10637000	10639000	kind of bring it up to date it didn't feel to have the same
10639000	10641000	feeling as it did before yeah it's something like
10641000	10643000	the soul really gets kind of lost
10643000	10645000	six is yeah definitely in my heart
10645000	10647000	the best one in my opinion it's kind of like a fuck you
10647000	10649000	old people we're all for the new people kind of
10649000	10651000	thing yeah I don't know I don't know what the rationale
10651000	10653000	was behind that but that's
10653000	10655000	where it stands with those games but you know
10655000	10657000	for better or for worse with our opinion
10657000	10659000	on that I believe five and six
10659000	10661000	are highly likely candidates
10661000	10663000	as far as nine and ten and those others
10663000	10665000	see that's where we get tricky cause now the hardware
10665000	10667000	gets trickier and final fantasy
10667000	10669000	nine in particular never had a PC
10669000	10671000	release there's a big thing
10671000	10673000	here where seven and eight were actually released
10673000	10675000	on the PC in the
10675000	10677000	late 90s and early
10677000	10679000	2000s yeah
10679000	10681000	so those games were already out
10681000	10683000	on the PC so again it was about adapting
10683000	10685000	them they never did put nine on the PC
10685000	10687000	for whatever reason so
10687000	10689000	they would have to make
10689000	10691000	a conscious decision to do that now
10691000	10693000	I'm not sure that
10693000	10695000	would happen I
10695000	10697000	I think what's going to happen is where the
10697000	10699000	iOS and Android goes
10699000	10701000	Steam's going to follow but then you know I
10701000	10703000	would have never guessed that thirteen was
10703000	10705000	going to come out thirteen coming to
10705000	10707000	Steam is kind of a huge surprise so you know
10707000	10709000	what I guess anything's possible
10709000	10711000	in that regard Spazinator but I
10711000	10713000	would say five and six next if
10713000	10715000	they all continue to sell well and if thirteen
10715000	10717000	sells well maybe
10717000	10719000	ten HD
10719000	10721000	because they already clearly know how
10721000	10723000	to port over PS3 code to run
10723000	10725000	on the PC I would say ten
10725000	10727000	HD would be your likely candidate next
10727000	10729000	yeah I
10729000	10731000	definitely hope that's the case because I
10731000	10733000	love ten
10733000	10735000	I beat it on to play season
10735000	10737000	two god knows how many times
10737000	10739000	yeah it's a good one it's a good one
10739000	10741000	so great question though and
10741000	10743000	I believe thirteen is on Steam this
10743000	10745000	week right yeah
10745000	10747000	in fact I got pre-ordered I just
10747000	10749000	went in for the game to unlock so
10749000	10751000	that's going to be nice to have the trilogy
10751000	10753000	kind of all right there on the PC I think that'll be a lot
10753000	10755000	of fun so
10755000	10757000	alright well thanks for taking my calls
10757000	10759000	definitely appreciate it alright take care
10759000	10761000	of my friend alright bye-bye
10761000	10763000	that was a good question there from Ragenator
10763000	10765000	1877 game OLR our username
10765000	10767000	on Skype orange lounge radio
10767000	10769000	looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
10769000	10771000	and some of the thoughts they
10771000	10773000	have Alan Alchemy reminds
10773000	10775000	us we got the little EMU
10775000	10777000	emulator for the LED Chocobo minigame
10777000	10779000	for eight that's right that is there
10779000	10781000	and Bob Coffee reminding us you can
10781000	10783000	buy nine on the Playstation store easy
10783000	10785000	and it works with the PS3, PSP
10785000	10787000	and Vita we do have one more
10787000	10789000	call coming in so this will probably be it for
10789000	10791000	tonight let's go to the phones hi you're on orange
10791000	10793000	lounge radio who's this hey what's up guys
10793000	10795000	this is Kaijuto hey Kaijuto what's up my friend
10795000	10797000	not much I'm gonna I'm gonna try
10797000	10799000	to keep this real quick
10799000	10801000	about what you said about the
10801000	10803000	about the
10803000	10805000	3DS not probably not being
10805000	10807000	the console for the
10807000	10809000	Smash Brothers sure
10809000	10811000	I disagree that's fine mainly
10811000	10813000	yeah mainly the main reason why I disagree is
10813000	10815000	what I noticed about myself is
10815000	10817000	I'm not a hardcore Smash
10817000	10819000	Brothers fan
10819000	10821000	the only other Smash Brothers
10821000	10823000	game that I own is Brawl and that was for
10823000	10825000	the Wii so I'm not
10825000	10827000	I'm not one of these people that have been
10827000	10829000	playing for years and I've really gotten used to the
10829000	10831000	GameCube controller you know
10831000	10833000	I don't you know I don't come from that
10833000	10835000	place so when I played on the 3DS
10835000	10837000	I don't know what I'm missing
10837000	10839000	I don't know what's changed and I'm able to adapt
10839000	10841000	to the controls a lot better now
10841000	10843000	I will agree that
10843000	10845000	every now and then when I'm using the
10845000	10847000	the circle pad I'll
10847000	10849000	go to like maybe throw a punch and I think that I'm
10849000	10851000	punching in the right direction I'll be
10851000	10853000	punching somewhere else and that kind of gets frustrating
10853000	10855000	but it's not something that happens
10855000	10857000	all the time and it really doesn't affect
10857000	10859000	my gameplay so I think that
10859000	10861000	I think it's
10861000	10863000	great to have it on the 3DS because I think that
10863000	10865000	there may be a lot of little kids that are maybe
10865000	10867000	like me which is funny to say but
10867000	10869000	there's probably a lot of little kids that are like me who may
10869000	10871000	have never played any of the other Smash Brothers
10871000	10873000	games and this would be like a great little
10873000	10875000	entry point for them you know
10875000	10877000	and they could probably get used to it you know the
10877000	10879000	controls on the 3DS really quickly
10879000	10881000	and learn to play the game there you know I could
10881000	10883000	I could remember being a little kid
10883000	10885000	and trying to go to the arcade and trying
10885000	10887000	to play Pac-Man on the
10887000	10889000	big huge ass joystick and not being able
10889000	10891000	to like reach the screen but when I got my little
10891000	10893000	when I got my little tabletop Pac-Man
10893000	10895000	I was able to kick ass on that I mean like
10895000	10897000	literally just playing you know for hours
10897000	10899000	and hours without dying and that's
10899000	10901000	how I was used to playing but I know
10901000	10903000	I'm pretty sure that there were adults who
10903000	10905000	played in the arcade that was like what's this little
10905000	10907000	tabletop shit you know like you know
10907000	10909000	this isn't how you play you know
10909000	10911000	this isn't Pac-Man
10911000	10913000	you know what that's a really good comparison
10913000	10915000	that is a really fair point I think in that
10915000	10917000	respect especially I love that
10917000	10919000	comparison with the tabletop Pac-Man
10919000	10921000	where like when you're a little kid you don't care
10921000	10923000	it's Pac-Man whereas like an adult
10923000	10925000	gamer probably looks at that and goes what is that cheap
10925000	10927000	knockoff garbage you know I don't
10927000	10929000	think now obviously Smash Brothers is not
10929000	10931000	knockoff garbage by any means it is still
10931000	10933000	a good game I just believe
10933000	10935000	it's biggest flaw is the system that it's
10935000	10937000	on which is why I'm like I'm really excited for the Wii U
10937000	10939000	version but you bring up a great point
10939000	10941000	there's gonna be kids out there with like a 2DS
10941000	10943000	even that like this is the way they're
10943000	10945000	gonna play the game because maybe their
10945000	10947000	family just doesn't have a Wii U or
10947000	10949000	the little kid can't exactly monopolize
10949000	10951000	the TV with their game console
10951000	10953000	so this 2DS version is what
10953000	10955000	they get so hook them early
10955000	10957000	yeah exactly and I'm also
10957000	10959000	about the porting issue
10959000	10961000	you know from what you had mentioned earlier
10961000	10963000	about you know how they had to take some
10963000	10965000	characters out and tweak a few things just so
10965000	10967000	that it's able to be played on the 3DS
10967000	10969000	I feel that it's not really a
10969000	10971000	direct port you know it's more of like
10971000	10973000	it's more customized for the 3DS
10973000	10975000	which I think is also a good thing and one
10975000	10977000	last question I'll take this off the air
10977000	10979000	but how do you guys think
10979000	10981000	that it's gonna play on the Wii U with that
10981000	10983000	I know that they have the GameCube
10983000	10985000	controller that they're gonna
10985000	10987000	apply to it but how do you feel that people
10987000	10989000	are gonna be able to play with that big ass
10989000	10991000	Etch A Sketch controller
10991000	10993000	you know what I know a lot of people
10993000	10995000	I know a lot of people rag on the
10995000	10997000	gamepad but it honestly doesn't bother me
10997000	10999000	like when I'm holding it like maybe it's
10999000	11001000	just because I don't know maybe because I'm
11001000	11003000	an older guy who's got big
11003000	11005000	hands maybe like when I'm holding the gamepad
11005000	11007000	it's just not really an issue to me but I don't
11007000	11009000	I don't think about like
11009000	11011000	I don't know why but when I'm holding like I hold
11011000	11013000	my Xbox controller with two
11013000	11015000	hands so when I hold the Wii U controller
11015000	11017000	with two hands it really actually feels like a
11017000	11019000	similar configuration it's just my hands
11019000	11021000	are further apart but they
11021000	11023000	it doesn't feel weird or anything
11023000	11025000	cause the way the tablet's
11025000	11027000	weighted or whatever like it feels very natural
11027000	11029000	the Wii U controller is actually I
11029000	11031000	think it's a great feel and I know some people
11031000	11033000	think like what that thing is huge but
11033000	11035000	it works I don't know I don't know
11035000	11037000	and eventually I think sorry I didn't mean to cut you
11037000	11039000	it eventually feels like it'll
11039000	11041000	come down to preference just like when
11041000	11043000	it transferred to the Wii
11043000	11045000	when Brawl came out and now you have the
11045000	11047000	nunchuck and everything and people have their preference
11047000	11049000	and seeing that big controller
11049000	11051000	actually the way I look at it I see it as like
11051000	11053000	old school game gear if I think about it
11053000	11055000	but it's pretty much like towards that
11055000	11057000	it's just what they're feeling
11057000	11059000	bringing back the old controllers
11059000	11061000	the gaming controllers will bring back more
11061000	11063000	feel to the old school stuff but that's
11063000	11065000	because that was their preference too and that was just
11065000	11067000	the demand but I don't really see any
11067000	11069000	difference to people getting used to the new controllers
11069000	11071000	and such but at least what is great
11071000	11073000	about the Wii U version
11073000	11075000	is that you get a choice you know
11075000	11077000	and you can even use what we're hearing
11077000	11079000	your 3DS as the controller if you want
11079000	11081000	for the Wii U version so if you
11081000	11083000	totally think I'm off base
11083000	11085000	with what I'm saying and you enjoy the 3DS
11085000	11087000	as a controller then you're going to be able to use that
11087000	11089000	with the Wii U version so I think
11089000	11091000	that's great that you're at least going to have those
11091000	11093000	choices that you simply can't
11093000	11095000	have on the 3DS and that's just the
11095000	11097000	limitation of a portable gaming system
11097000	11099000	right yeah
11099000	11101000	I agree with that yep so
11101000	11103000	thanks for taking my call you are welcome and a great show
11103000	11105000	as always and have a good night quickly
11105000	11107000	quickly favorite character in Smash gotta know
11107000	11109000	has to be the Wii Fit Trainer
11109000	11111000	I mean I kicked ass today
11111000	11113000	with that like I haven't lost with her yet
11113000	11115000	Rob the Robot is pretty good too but
11115000	11117000	I'm hearing a lot about the Wii Fit Trainer
11117000	11119000	the Wii Fit Trainer is one of my favorites as well
11119000	11121000	like the Wii Fit Trainer is an awful lot of fun
11121000	11123000	what about the dog from Duck Hunt? I haven't unlocked him yet
11123000	11125000	I unlocked him but I haven't used
11125000	11127000	him yet but I don't know it feels weird
11127000	11129000	fighting the dog as much as I hate that dog
11129000	11131000	it
11131000	11133000	just feels weird to fight he has a duck on his
11133000	11135000	back and it's just weird
11135000	11137000	it's a weird character it looks like it should have been
11137000	11139000	Nintendo or something
11139000	11141000	Nintendo there you go that would have been something
11141000	11143000	alright my friend thanks for the call appreciate it
11143000	11145000	alright goodnight and take care buddy
11145000	11147000	that was a great comparison
11147000	11149000	that's why we love to hear from the listeners
11149000	11151000	and take the calls live is because you know I might be
11151000	11153000	sitting here saying one thing about the game but
11153000	11155000	that comparison with the old school and I remember
11155000	11157000	those things vividly in my head those 80's
11157000	11159000	Pac-Man table tops and you can even see these
11159000	11161000	like E3 at the museum and so forth
11161000	11163000	they just like you look at
11163000	11165000	like what a shitty port but
11165000	11167000	again when you're younger it's like
11167000	11169000	it's the real thing it's awesome
11169000	11171000	on top of like the casual discussions I mean
11171000	11173000	for 3DS if people will buy
11173000	11175000	if they prefer more on the gun
11175000	11177000	that people have preference of controls
11177000	11179000	I do agree on him as well
11179000	11181000	as he said about besides the competitors
11181000	11183000	it's actually catering to the fans
11183000	11185000	of actually Smash itself
11185000	11187000	because as he says as a kid
11187000	11189000	now they can have it handheld they can take it where they want to go
11189000	11191000	rather than taking a humongous system which they can't
11191000	11193000	which definitely will apply
11193000	11195000	to them as well and then you know though it's a different
11195000	11197000	entire game
11197000	11199000	they'll get used to that too and still have fun
11199000	11201000	it's still Smash Brothers
11201000	11203000	as the thing you'll always have that
11203000	11205000	and the developers
11205000	11207000	themselves said it's a fine balance
11207000	11209000	between the casual brawl
11209000	11211000	and the competitive melee
11211000	11213000	to the upcoming
11213000	11215000	Smash games and sometimes with our
11215000	11217000	conventions we try to separate that too that's the one thing
11217000	11219000	that some of our staff applied
11219000	11221000	is that you have these kids that go to these
11221000	11223000	conventions and they want to play the game but then
11223000	11225000	you have the competitors there at the same time they're mashed
11225000	11227000	in there but then they're not having fun
11227000	11229000	so what one of our staff has done
11229000	11231000	is made two separate tournaments
11231000	11233000	a kind of a peewee division to separate
11233000	11235000	them where they can use items and so forth because
11235000	11237000	they want to play with that stuff they want to have fun
11237000	11239000	not to show that the parents look at
11239000	11241000	this and say that I think my child just wasted
11241000	11243000	his money just to go here and get
11243000	11245000	bummed off by these kids that
11245000	11247000	just are not showing any
11247000	11249000	sportsmanship towards the game
11249000	11251000	especially to the little kids as well
11251000	11253000	but that's why we separate the two sometimes
11253000	11255000	just to have the fun
11255000	11257000	now in the online mode you have for fun and for
11257000	11259000	glory and that sounds almost exactly what you're talking about
11259000	11261000	there is how you're kind of splitting things
11261000	11263000	that's how it should be actually that's how it should be
11263000	11265000	because there's two different scenes
11265000	11267000	great wow
11267000	11269000	very cool to kind of hear how that plays into
11269000	11271000	the tournament stuff that you guys do there
11271000	11273000	let's see actdeft in chat says why didn't I
11273000	11275000	get asked that question about my favorite character
11275000	11277000	because you would have picked Kirby
11277000	11279000	or clearly if you know actdeft
11279000	11281000	you know he loves Kirby or maybe
11281000	11283000	I suppose maybe it could have been Meta Knight
11283000	11285000	or Dedede or one of the other characters in those games
11285000	11287000	but I kind of just have a feeling here
11287000	11289000	alright anyhow
11289000	11291000	that is about going to do it for another
11291000	11293000	episode of Orange on its Radio it's been a long show tonight
11293000	11295000	but a fantastic show
11295000	11297000	I want to once again thank Bobby King
11297000	11299000	and Farsight Studios and wish them
11299000	11301000	the best of luck with the Addams Family Kickstarter
11301000	11303000	which as we saw in our Fugu Question of the Week tonight
11303000	11305000	there's a lot of love for the Addams Family out there
11305000	11307000	so if you don't mind
11307000	11309000	putting down the money now to make sure you're going to get
11309000	11311000	a copy of the table when they finish that
11311000	11313000	then they can get all that licensing they need to finish it up
11313000	11315000	and it looks like, although it looks really good
11315000	11317000	remember they have to hit that goal
11317000	11319000	or they don't get any of it
11319000	11321000	so we're going to keep our fingers and toes crossed for them
11321000	11323000	DarkSaraka
11323000	11325000	sadly she's already left
11325000	11327000	but she will be back next week on the show
11327000	11329000	we already got her final thought earlier
11329000	11331000	Diego, Jonas, thanks for being back again tonight
11331000	11333000	Always a pleasure
11333000	11335000	It's been fun having you guys drop in over the past couple months
11335000	11337000	and it's good to hear what you guys are up to
11337000	11339000	good luck with all the tournaments
11339000	11341000	and having to work Smash 3DS into your rotation now
11341000	11343000	Looking forward to it on October the 10th
11343000	11345000	it's already getting pretty hyped
11345000	11347000	and I'll be looking, definitely
11347000	11349000	That'll be a lot of fun
11349000	11351000	Final thoughts tonight, Jonas, I'll start with you
11351000	11353000	your final thought
11353000	11355000	With October being busy and with Smash coming up
11355000	11357000	I want to see how this develops
11357000	11359000	and how it can integrate for future events
11359000	11361000	so
11361000	11363000	and I'll be honest
11363000	11365000	hopefully with the upcoming Smash comes up
11365000	11367000	people can stop talking about
11367000	11369000	too heavily
11369000	11371000	people can say Project M
11371000	11373000	don't get me wrong, it's a game for people who could cater to that
11373000	11375000	but I can't have that requested
11375000	11377000	because we don't want to be in trouble with legal issues
11377000	11379000	it's what it is
11379000	11381000	with the whole
11381000	11383000	hacked version
11383000	11385000	Diego, your final thought tonight
11385000	11387000	Like I said, kind of going off what he said
11387000	11389000	about upcoming games and such
11389000	11391000	we got a lot of stuff on our plate that we hopefully would present out
11391000	11393000	to the community as we try to do
11393000	11395000	throughout the years
11395000	11397000	and definitely looking forward to not just Smash
11397000	11399000	but also November when Pokemon
11399000	11401000	Omega, Ruby and Sapphire
11401000	11403000	Alpha, that's definitely going to be a big thing
11403000	11405000	because Pokemon is another big scene too
11405000	11407000	oh yes
11407000	11409000	and when that comes out, and I've never played the third version
11409000	11411000	and I'm glad they brought it out in 3D
11411000	11413000	and I will definitely be the first time ever
11413000	11415000	I'll play that
11415000	11417000	I always try to get into Pokemon
11417000	11419000	and I usually get to the first or second gym
11419000	11421000	and then I just, I can't
11421000	11423000	and the games won't allow me to not collect
11423000	11425000	every single Pokemon along the way
11425000	11427000	even though Shane, who's very into Pokemon
11427000	11429000	won't tell me, don't play it that way
11429000	11431000	and I tell you, the game has changed
11431000	11433000	so much since it first came out
11433000	11435000	because everything, as people say, was so much broken
11435000	11437000	but it's definitely a deep game
11437000	11439000	speaking of Pokemon
11439000	11441000	I thought you had discussed
11441000	11443000	of course the Pokemon Regionals
11443000	11445000	coming up next week
11445000	11447000	now will be the last of the Pokemon
11447000	11449000	X1
11449000	11451000	until they start moving on to Pokemon
11451000	11453000	Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire
11453000	11455000	so that should be a fun series
11455000	11457000	of tournaments going on for Regionals
11457000	11459000	you guys are going to be
11459000	11461000	tournamented out by the time Christmas comes around
11461000	11463000	but I guess I can't really
11463000	11465000	so many things that get in order
11465000	11467000	well thank you guys again for being here
11467000	11469000	I'm sure next month or so
11469000	11471000	thank you for having us again
11471000	11473000	you're welcome, anytime
11473000	11475000	it's always good to have the mixed perspectives
11475000	11477000	where would we be without you guys?
11477000	11479000	if we have gotten to topless marijuana
11479000	11481000	Rosalina, without you guys
11481000	11483000	I don't know
11483000	11485000	I forgot the order of how that all started
11485000	11487000	Loki, my friend, your final thought tonight
11487000	11489000	I'm confused, I went to this Nexus
11489000	11491000	games website and they have their
11491000	11493000	Brickblast U game which they
11493000	11495000	on the one side it says
11495000	11497000	Family Fun Entertainment
11497000	11499000	and for some reason they have a mature rating
11499000	11501000	marked on that, which I don't think that
11501000	11503000	even went through the ESRB and I'm pretty sure
11503000	11505000	they mocked that up because it also says
11505000	11507000	their website and
11507000	11509000	quality stuff that you can
11509000	11511000	look forward to in a Minecraft clone
11511000	11513000	coming soon
11513000	11515000	yeah, and my
11515000	11517000	final thought is I'm going to work on my games more
11517000	11519000	alright, good luck with that
11519000	11521000	as I do every show, I'm just going to say
11521000	11523000	please help spread the word about
11523000	11525000	Orange Launch Radio, if you enjoyed the show
11525000	11527000	please tell a friend or five or fifty
11527000	11529000	about the program, five star
11529000	11531000	reviews on the website where you found
11531000	11533000	this show goes along with iTunes
11533000	11535000	Stitcher Radio, all those places
11535000	11537000	go a very long way in helping people
11537000	11539000	discover the show, remember we don't have a mega
11539000	11541000	budget behind the show, all we have is you
11541000	11543000	guys, our OL army as we say to help spread
11543000	11545000	the word, definitely, definitely, we will definitely
11545000	11547000	same one will be on October
11547000	11549000	10th, we'll definitely spread that out, heck yes
11549000	11551000	especially for our next coming streams definitely
11551000	11553000	we'll give you a shout out, awesome
11553000	11555000	once again we apologize for not bringing more people
11555000	11557000	but we're still working on that
11557000	11559000	it's not that big of a space
11559000	11561000	I do still have
11561000	11563000	a final thought I want to get out here but I do
11563000	11565000	want to, well let me give my final thought here
11565000	11567000	this was a little bit more of a personal note
11567000	11569000	and it's going to come off as a little bit random
11569000	11571000	but it's something kind of important I want to make sure I mention
11571000	11573000	because I've told
11573000	11575000	the cast and the people of this directly
11575000	11577000	impacts about it so now I can be a little more
11577000	11579000	public with this, but
11579000	11581000	as you guys know, I have
11581000	11583000	before I got to
11583000	11585000	Orange Lounge Radio
11585000	11587000	I used to do another show
11587000	11589000	Understation Live with Travis and Jessica
11589000	11591000	I was born of the Rocky Horror
11591000	11593000	Picture Show community and you know
11593000	11595000	cult movies and cult cinema that's something
11595000	11597000	I've done on and off since 1998
11597000	11599000	and even until
11599000	11601000	these past few years I've been working very closely
11601000	11603000	with a local group with the Sacramento
11603000	11605000	Horror Film Fest which is actually going on next weekend
11605000	11607000	which is why I can't go to
11607000	11609000	your shindig but that's going on
11609000	11611000	next weekend
11611000	11613000	you know that whole thing keeps me very busy
11613000	11615000	but I kind of got to this
11615000	11617000	point where it was like alright I'm doing more
11617000	11619000	and more and more broadcasting I'm doing more
11619000	11621000	and more with this I've got too much on my plate
11621000	11623000	something's got to give so I
11623000	11625000	actually have made a decision
11625000	11627000	to end my 16 year career
11627000	11629000	with the Rocky Horror Picture Show
11629000	11631000	so Halloween is going to be my
11631000	11633000	farewell show as the director and
11633000	11635000	as a regular performer so if you are
11635000	11637000	in the Sacramento area and you need plans for Halloween
11637000	11639000	I encourage you to come on out
11639000	11641000	because that's actually going to be my final
11641000	11643000	show so which
11643000	11645000	is you know it's a little bit difficult personally
11645000	11647000	especially all the history and the fact that like
11647000	11649000	wow would I be here where I am with OLR if it wasn't
11649000	11651000	for that and I don't know
11651000	11653000	but the
11653000	11655000	good thing about that is that this will
11655000	11657000	allow me to continue to focus
11657000	11659000	on broadcasting
11659000	11661000	and this hobby and
11661000	11663000	you know doing more things like
11663000	11665000	livestream and more things like YouTube and
11665000	11667000	all of that and VOG
11667000	11669000	and so forth so and that doesn't mean I
11669000	11671000	still won't continue to support my
11671000	11673000	friends over at the SAC Horror Film Fest and in the
11673000	11675000	Rocky Horror Community and cult cinema in general
11675000	11677000	I just have to support them in other ways
11677000	11679000	now instead of unnecessarily getting on stage
11679000	11681000	so that's just why I wanted to get off my chest
11681000	11683000	so thank you guys very much for indulging
11683000	11685000	me there and
11685000	11687000	I will say next week on the show
11687000	11689000	stay tuned because
