7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight, we interview Mike Kennedy, publisher of Retro Magazine, with their plans of a second year of crowdfunded retro publishing goodness and much more.
20000	27000	It's been a busy two weeks, so without any further delay, let's get to the news, your chat, comments, calls, and emails right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	42000	Jason, you forgot about the delay for food talk. That's the thing that always happens. Hi everybody, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
42000	50000	And yes, we are back after a week off live with this episode number 572 for October the 26th of 2014.
50000	60000	My name is Rob Roberts, and not here with you unfortunately tonight in studio, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I know, we were just gone last week, shouldn't she be here tonight?
60000	73000	But actually, DarkSakura actually moved this week, so she is moving into a new house, so she's finishing up some business that comes with moving, because moving is certainly no fun task, I can attest to that.
73000	82000	But that means, for those of you that have been listening to OLR for a while, we currently tape at what we call studio N7, because it's number 7, the seventh studio we've had.
82000	90000	This means that studio number 5 is no more. It's gone though, she's moved into a new place, so she should be back on the program next week.
90000	96000	Joining us here in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hi Loki, how are you? Welcome back.
97000	99000	Yeah, did you have a good week off?
99000	101000	Yeah, I guess.
101000	106000	Sorry, you were muted there for a minute there, but what did you do, it was my fault, what did you do with your week off?
106000	108000	I think watched the kids.
108000	112000	Yeah, working on your game, did you get to play games?
112000	117000	Oh, you know what, actually I did work on my game, that's right, that's what I was doing.
117000	124000	I didn't really play a whole ton of games. I bought a PlayStation 4.
124000	135000	Sadly enough, I didn't really get to play any games on it, because it was one of those, you buy it off of Craigslist for a discounted price, and everything seems good.
135000	146000	And I even was smart enough to power it on, I brought my portable HDMI monitor with me, plugged it in, made sure that I got something on the screen.
147000	153000	I forgot to bring a game disc to see if it played, and unfortunately the disc drive was busted.
153000	165000	But fortunately, it's under warranty, and the dude even had an extended warranty on it, so I, instead of sending it off to the extended warranty place, I just went ahead and sent it to Sony.
165000	168000	Because they're like, oh well if it's in within a year, you know, it's under warranty.
168000	174000	I'm like, well the PlayStation 4 hasn't been out for a year yet, so I'm pretty sure it's under your warranty.
174000	180000	So there's no problems, and they're sending me a box to send it back, and they'll fix it, and that'll be that.
180000	186000	So what made you decide to finally take the plunge, and you got PlayStation 4, as opposed to Xbox One?
186000	195000	Because you and I were talking a little bit before the show, catching up from a couple weeks, and you kind of mentioned that Xbox One has a lot of really attractive, exclusive software right now.
195000	202000	With the, you know, the Fantasia, Disney, and with the Forza Horizon 2, what made you decide ultimately for PS4?
202000	206000	Well, basically it's just, you know, what my friends have.
206000	219000	So, I picked that console because I wanted a PlayStation 4 more than I wanted an Xbox One as far as like third-party stuff goes, because everything seems to play better on a PlayStation 4 versus an Xbox One.
219000	230000	And, you know, the first-party stuff that I really wanted right now, like Sunset Overdrive and Forza Horizon 2, I mean, it's okay, but even like next year is going to have some pretty good stuff with like Crackdown and stuff.
230000	247000	I still have time to get a system for that, but there's not a lot of our friends right now that have Xbox Ones, and so if I want to play like, you know, Call of Duty with my friends and stuff, or if I want to play, you know, like Grand Theft Auto, or even, you know, you guys are playing Destiny and stuff, you know, everybody has a PlayStation 4 to do that, so that's...
247000	251000	Or Final Fantasy XIV, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
251000	254000	I just, I really don't have time for an MMO.
254000	255000	I know, I know.
255000	259000	Hey, if it wasn't, you know, monthly, you know, that would be a whole different story.
259000	275000	But very interesting that, in a way, I don't want to say it's peer pressure that caused you to do it, because it's not so much that, but it's definitely that inertia and why the launches of systems are so important, because, you know, you kind of say, well, because all my friends have this, because, you know, PS4 kind of had the bigger boom out the gate,
275000	283000	a lot of people kind of adopted that. That's kind of what swayed you. It's kind of interesting to see how that inertia really plays into things.
283000	293000	Yeah, and on top of that, I mean, that's also why, you know, like, and if it was the opposite, yeah, I'd probably be buying an Xbox One, because if all my friends had an Xbox One...
293000	300000	Well, I got a 360 before a PlayStation 3 for very similar reasons. I mean, I think they were launched a year apart, but I was a later adopte...
300000	303000	The PS4 is the first system I bought at launch in a while.
303000	312000	Well, you see, I had a lot of store credit built up from selling off our LAN systems, because I had a lot of those.
312000	321000	And so I sold those off and sold off a lot of my duplicate games and stuff, and even I sold my Kinect and, you know, all that stuff.
321000	328000	I still have my PlayStation 3, my, you know, original one, and I've still got my Xbox 360.
329000	334000	So I'm still playing stuff on... I'm going to be playing stuff on those still, at least for a little bit.
334000	343000	And then, I don't know, but I just wanted to get, like, a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One, and I just kind of like, well, I'm just going to get PlayStation 4.
343000	348000	And then, mainly because Grand Theft Auto V is coming back out again.
348000	349000	Aha!
350000	353000	Call of Duty. Call of Duty looked really good, you know, next-gen.
353000	355000	And I was like, you know, it's just not going to be the same.
355000	363000	But, I see, and this is kind of even weird, because, like, you know, I never understood the point of pre-ordering games digitally.
363000	369000	Obviously, though, with Call of Duty, we talked a few weeks ago that they have that deal where if you buy it on, you know...
369000	373000	And they've even done that with, like, Destiny and stuff, where you buy it on one system, you get it...
373000	382000	It's cross-buy, so, since I still play with people on PlayStation 3 Call of Duty, I have bought it digitally, because now I'll have it on PlayStation 3 for the people that haven't upgraded yet.
382000	388000	And we can still play on that, and then when everybody upgrades the PlayStation 4, I'll have it for that as well.
388000	399000	Let's go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.
399000	409000	And if you're listening live, you should join us in chat. Live.vognetwork.com, just like SSG100Matt, who says, apparently it was too much effort to get it fixed and then sell it to someone.
409000	415000	What a jerk. Talk about the Craigslist guy. Have you learned your lesson about Craigslist yet? You don't...
415000	424000	I had good... Well, I've only done three deals on Craigslist, and to be honest, this wasn't so bad, because the system works. It is really strange, though.
425000	430000	Don't you think that the dude broke the disk drive and was just like, eh, I'll just sell it to some sucker?
430000	438000	Here's the thing, though. He didn't break the disk drive. The launched PS4s actually have a problem with their disk drives. Like, a lot of them failed.
438000	450000	And that was something that's well-known, but I just... It's under warranty. You fucking bought it. It's under warranty. Why didn't you just send it off for like a few days, and it would be fixed. Done.
450000	460000	But I think what happened is he ended up buying like another PlayStation 4 or something, and he just said, eh, fuck it. I'm just gonna... I can't wait to...
460000	467000	Well, the only game he had on the hard drive was NBA 2K14, so I guess he couldn't wait to play NBA 2K14, so...
468000	475000	Okay, you know, and whatever. I mean, it works. I mean, I can still play games on it right now. I just only play digital games.
475000	477000	Have you played NBA 2K14?
477000	488000	No, because it's not licensed to my account. Not that I would even want to, but I played the... I played that one because I bought a camera with it, so...
488000	489000	Oh, the playroom.
489000	491000	Yeah, I played the playroom a little bit.
491000	501000	Actually, TigerClaw is kind of referencing that there. TigerClaw says, with Loki now owning a PlayStation 4, hopefully we can see him stream some games on Twitch. Is that part of your long-term plan?
501000	502000	I guess I could.
502000	504000	Everybody's doing that now. It's so interesting.
504000	508000	That's what it looks like, you know, now that everybody's doing it. It's like, eh, who cares?
508000	515000	Well, you and I were talking before the show about the whole, like, you can't, you know, you're gonna have to send your PlayStation 4 in, but then I was like, oh, wait a minute, on Tuesday...
515000	524000	You know, I know we'll get into this a little later in the show, so sorry to jump ahead, but on Tuesday we're gonna get that patch, and it's gonna have the whole SharePlay thing, so I could pop in Diablo 4, or...
524000	532000	Diablo 4, I wish. Diablo 3, and we could do the co-op, you know, over the SharePlay, at least for an hour before we get cut off, but...
532000	539000	See, that'd be cool. I mean, you know, I'd like to check that out, and it's not a big deal if it's gone for, like, you know, because I...
539000	545000	Just because I have it doesn't mean I'm playing the system right now, and, you know, really I'm gonna want to play Call of Duty when it comes out, but...
545000	553000	Assuming I get that box pretty soon. They said it takes about seven to ten business days, I think, to turn it around, so it won't be too bad, so I'll miss a few days on it.
553000	556000	I can always play it on PlayStation 3 because I bought it digitally, so...
556000	558000	Yeah, and you haven't had a PS4 for this long, so what's another...
558000	564000	Exactly, I'm just, I'm not in a huge hurry. I was just like, aw, I want to play Watch Dogs and Infamous, and, you know, the other game I...
564000	565000	Oh, Destiny, so...
565000	576000	Going to our chat room, a name I have not seen before, so welcome, continues in our chat room, says, people don't think about that when a system breaks after they buy it, so maybe...
576000	581000	Yeah, I mean, maybe this guy, like, sure, he had the extended warranty, but he just kind of was... said, screw it.
581000	589000	Or maybe he bought the game digitally and literally didn't know that that drive was bad, because it was installed on there digitally, so...
589000	590000	It could be.
590000	598000	It could be just that he literally didn't know. I think he did know, but whatever, I mean, it's so stupid, and it's not, like, something I can't get fixed.
598000	599000	Exactly.
599000	600000	It's going to get fixed.
600000	612000	Well, you know, my launch, Xbox 360, broke, red-ringed after I had it, like, four days. You can go back in the show archive and find it, it was about February, it was around Valentine's Day, right after the 360s came out.
612000	623000	And I could have this point now that, you know, PlayStation Plus has Dust and the Legion tale is free right now. Yeah, see, that's the problem, is all those games that are free right now, a lot of them, I have on my Steam library.
623000	627000	So it's like, I could play this, but I'm not playing it on the Steam.
627000	632000	Not Pix the Cat, which is, like, actually way more awesome than you would think it is, looking at screenshots.
632000	634000	I will have to try that.
634000	637000	Alright, there you go. Play Pix the Cat, then send back your PlayStation 4.
637000	638000	I have it downloaded, yeah.
638000	639000	Alright, get on that.
639000	646000	Alright, let's talk about a couple quick things here. We are going to bring in, of course, as Jason said there at the top of the show, we have a return guest this week.
646000	653000	We haven't had a lot of these in the history of OLR, but we like to support indie productions, meaning indie podcasts, and indie publications.
654000	659000	And Mike Kennedy, the publisher of Retro Magazine, is going to be coming back on the show tonight.
659000	671000	He was on about a year ago when Retro Magazine was just an idea, and here we are a year later, and the Kickstarter for year number two is currently underway, and we'll talk to Mike all about that.
671000	673000	So that's in about ten minutes.
673000	677000	So I've got about ten minutes to talk about other stuff that happened while we weren't here.
677000	686000	Namely, Final Fantasy Fan Fest. That is where I was last weekend in Vegas. This all took place at the Rio.
686000	694000	I talked about this in depth a little bit on my other program, Hoard House, so I don't want to repeat myself too much, but I know there's some of you that listen here that don't listen to Hoard House.
694000	707000	Just to kind of clear a few things up, even though it's Final Fantasy Fan Festival, if you actually look at the logo, there's a very big 14 logo in it, meaning this festival was not about all things Final Fantasy.
707000	710000	It was only about Final Fantasy 14.
710000	726000	They had some demo kiosks for Final Fantasy Theatrhythm, where they were giving away codes for the song Good King Mooglemog, which is a stage in Final Fantasy 14, except they ran out of those halfway through the first day, but whatever, I'd already bought the song anyway.
726000	739000	That was it. There was no 11, which really surprised me, because Squares had four other Fan Fests before dedicated to Final Fantasy 11, but this was purely 14, not a peep set about Final Fantasy 11.
739000	753000	Nothing about 13 being on Steam, or the other ones, like 4 just came out on Steam, or the Monster Hunter game coming out next year, that one, the Final Fantasy Explorers, or whatever it's called.
753000	760000	Nothing about that. It was strictly about 14, and there was a lot of good things, a lot of not-so-good things.
761000	773000	Community was great, met a lot of good people, had a great time with my link shell. The developers of the game, so personable, and a real standout star from the whole thing, I think, is Soken, who's the music producer.
773000	783000	Who's kind of, you know, I know Nobui Matsu does stuff with Square still, but he's also kind of branched out on his own. He's not really tied so much to the Final Fantasy brand right now.
783000	795000	So Soken is kind of like their guy right now, and he's very different, because he's a little more contemporary, probably, but he's really, really personable, and just a lot of fun, and you really see the passion he has for it.
795000	812000	I really just loved watching him, and his band played the closing ceremonies, and they were very good, even though their repertoire was very limited, because as The Primals, the name of the band, they only played Primal songs, meaning the five boss themes that are in the game right now, that's all they could play.
812000	821000	Oh no, and then Moogle Mog, they played that song too, and had Koji, who's the localization guy who does all the voices of the Moogles in the game, I did not realize this, he does all those voices in that song.
821000	826000	He actually sung it on stage, which was actually kind of a hoot to watch live, so yeah, it was pretty funny.
826000	840000	So, and then some of the events, they had a really neat too, like they actually had an archery studio that like came in, and you could learn for like two minutes how to fire a legit bow and arrow, we had like signed releases and everything, and you could do that.
840000	844000	Pull bow back, or pull arrow back, let go of arrow.
844000	863000	It's harder than it looks, trust me, because I really flopped at it, and you actually had a little real, I should have brought him out here in the studio so you could see it, Loki, but they actually had like a little real life quest log book, and as you did all these events, you get it stamped, and then you could turn it in, you get like a participation badge for some of these things that you did, and the Odin battle was neat, because that's something that's not in the game.
863000	886000	So this was all, you know, kind of neat, all these events. The part that wasn't so great was the glue that held it all together, like there wasn't enough for everybody to do, the lines were really badly long, and in fact I know like the merchandise line was like crazy long, it was like four hours at one point,
886000	915000	so yeah, there was this whole thing about where we had some seats, we got kicked out, and that really pissed me off, because we've been there for 90 minutes, I'm not going to get into the whole thing, I talked about it on Hoard House, so there's just some organization things that were kind of bad, which I don't consider this the first year of Fan Fest, I consider it the fifth, and so I would have hoped some more of these things would have been worked out, but granted Final Fantasy 14 is in a much higher place, so to speak, sub-number wise, than Final Fantasy 11 ever was,
915000	922000	so maybe they really truly did under anticipate the volume, I really hope they learn a lot, and I would consider going to a year or two if they do one.
922000	929000	Joining us here in studio just for a bit, because I know we have an interview to get to here before too long, but joining us here in studio for a bit is our pal Shane.
929000	932000	And I'm going to go to sleep, because I'm super tired.
932000	936000	You're super tired, because that 6am shift or whatever it is you work, kicks your butt, right?
936000	937000	Waking up at 4.30.
937000	944000	Now you weren't able to come on Hoard House this week, because I wanted to have you on there to talk about Fan Fest, but you and I went to Vegas together on that 9 hour drive.
944000	945000	It was fine.
945000	946000	How'd you like the desert?
946000	950000	The desert's stupid, the desert needs to die somehow more than it already has.
950000	952000	Yeah, I can't believe people live there, right?
952000	953000	Just old people.
953000	958000	What did you think of Fan Fest, because you kind of disagreed with me on some things, so quickly, what was your take on the whole thing?
958000	972000	I think it was amazing. I understand the frustration with some of the parts. The lines were terrible at times. There wasn't a lot of things to do, unless you wanted to wait in line.
972000	977000	You stood in that merch line for 4 hours, and you still come out of this going, I had a great time.
977000	986000	Yeah, I did. For one thing, I didn't have to stand the entire time, because I got in so late that they were seating people to get in line.
986000	992000	So I sat through my favorite panel of the entire thing, the music panel, so it was great.
992000	994000	Did you hear what I said when you were in the other room about Soken?
994000	995000	No.
995000	996000	He's kind of like, you know, with Uematsu.
996000	997000	He's amazing.
997000	1004000	Well, with Uematsu, not really, I mean, he does stuff with Square, but now he kind of does other things too.
1004000	1007000	Like, Soken's really kind of like the face of music in the Final Fantasy games right now.
1007000	1009000	Yes, he's way more interesting, I think.
1009000	1011000	He's just different, I think. He's just different.
1011000	1016000	Like, I don't want to shade Nobuo Uematsu, who is a legend of legends, but Soken is...
1016000	1017000	He's more personable.
1017000	1020000	Well, Soken's also contemporary. He's more contemporary to me. I think he's a great face.
1020000	1025000	Well, I just watched the London ceremony, and he was awesome in it.
1025000	1035000	But anyway, no, I don't also consider it its fifth attempt, because the Vana Deal Fest, Vana Fests or whatever, I don't think those are even remotely the same thing.
1035000	1039000	It's the same company, but I don't think it's the same people involved.
1040000	1047000	But I had a great time. Arrow shooting was fun. The cannon stuff was dumb. It was really dumb, actually.
1047000	1050000	It was a cute idea, but if I was four, I might have liked it.
1050000	1056000	And yeah, I thought everything was really great, even if I didn't get to do everything.
1056000	1060000	Like, I didn't do the Primal Battle. I didn't do Frontlines. I didn't do Speed Challenge, but we did Odin.
1060000	1067000	We did the panels, and really, I was there for the information in the panels. The other stuff was just extra.
1068000	1070000	It was worth $120 to you?
1070000	1078000	It was amazing, yes. And I want them to do a second year, but they said they might not do it yearly, because people will expect an expansion every time.
1078000	1083000	Which I'm like, no, just say there's not going to be an expansion announcement and still do it, because people would still go.
1083000	1089000	We had free company members show up that decided they were going to go the day before it happened, and they had a blast.
1089000	1093000	Yeah. I was really amazed that they pulled that together.
1093000	1098000	But Final Fantasy XIV, one thing they've been very good at is that they've been putting out patches really regularly.
1098000	1099000	Yeah, we have one on Tuesday.
1099000	1105000	Yeah, exactly. I feel like they'd still have something to talk about with all these regular patches if they still go down that path.
1105000	1110000	Yeah, and think about it. Our Fan Fest, we got the announcement of the expansion.
1110000	1117000	The rest of Fan Fest was dedicated to the upcoming patch, and then just other random things like music or lore.
1117000	1126000	Not anything to do with the new expansion. So, yeah, they could really just base it around a patch, and I think people would be happy.
1126000	1133000	Acteft is linking to something on eBay asking, did Shane get this? And it's Fan Festival 2014 Delivery Moogle with in-game minion codes.
1133000	1136000	Yes, I already have my minion, and it's all running around in-game with me.
1136000	1142000	And that's why the line was so long, because this was the first time they were selling these exclusive Fan Fests with in-game minions.
1142000	1149000	Yes, the Moogle is going to be on the online store, but they were only taking pre-orders in every region for it. It wasn't out yet.
1149000	1152000	The art book was also there, and I believe...
1152000	1153000	Which also has a minion.
1153000	1161000	Which also has a minion. I believe Japan had just got the art book when we were able to get it at Fan Fest, but it's still up for just pre-order in the site.
1161000	1164000	So since I don't know anything about this game, what exactly are the minions?
1165000	1168000	They're just little pets that follow you. Sometimes they interact with things like...
1168000	1177000	Okay, so I have this adorable dog minion, and so you have a pet emote, and when you do that to him, he lays on his back so you can rub his stomach.
1177000	1183000	It's adorable. Sometimes the Moogles, no matter if it's a regular Moogle or the delivery one, they will...
1183000	1189000	If you have multiple out, like you have one out and your friend has one out, they will link up and start doing a little dance around with each other.
1189000	1196000	You can beckon some of them to hop on your shoulder. It's pretty neat. I mean, it's stupid, but it just gives you more things to do in the game.
1196000	1203000	Yeah, and honestly, when I saw that merch line, I was like, screw that. I'm like, Alan will understand if I don't bring one of those home because I'm not going to stand in that line.
1203000	1209000	And then I got extraordinarily lucky, and somebody who had connections did me a really nice favor, and I got one anyway.
1209000	1210000	One thing that I didn't mind...
1210000	1211000	If you're listening, thank you.
1211000	1219000	One thing I didn't mind about the line is that the people I was standing with were pleasant enough that I could talk with them the entire time.
1219000	1226000	I found that to be something... One of the biggest pluses about Fan Fest was that the community was really awesome.
1226000	1236000	And I was worried about that going in. I thought we were going to get the hardcore Final Fantasy fans that know everything, and if you say something wrong, they will look at you and say bad things at you.
1236000	1243000	Because I played 11 a lot. I played 14 a lot. The other Final Fantasies, to be honest, I haven't beat a Final Fantasy since 7.
1243000	1246000	And I didn't care for a lot of the ones after that.
1246000	1253000	And I thought it was awesome because there were 7 of us from the free company there. A party in Final Fantasy XIV is 8 people.
1253000	1257000	So to do Odin, we were one short to do a party. So we pugged somebody.
1257000	1260000	Well, you guys pugged him before you got the us three.
1260000	1262000	To make a long story short, because I'm running out of time.
1262000	1269000	We ended up pugging a guy that was there by himself from a low-pop server, didn't know anybody there, and he was really awesome and helped explain the fight to us.
1269000	1271000	And we were like, why don't you just hang out with us?
1271000	1273000	He hung out with us for the rest of the weekend.
1273000	1276000	For the rest of the weekend, he hung out with us. And we invited him up to party.
1276000	1278000	And I don't think he's joined our free company.
1278000	1283000	Yeah, he has a factory teacher. Actually, this is really funny. I think I got him in my trial today.
1283000	1284000	Because...
1284000	1285000	You know his name?
1285000	1291000	I know his name because our friend, his friends, I'm trying to keep this for public radio.
1291000	1294000	But yeah, I saw that name pop up in Duty Finder as a tank.
1294000	1295000	Yeah.
1295000	1298000	I got Leviathan, and I was like, I think that's...
1298000	1303000	But he was one of those ones that was like, in and out. Pulled, and then left the thing right away.
1303000	1306000	So I couldn't say, oh my god, were you FanFest?
1306000	1307000	I couldn't get any of that.
1307000	1311000	That's another reason why our FanFest was great. Because in our concert, we got Leviathan twice.
1311000	1314000	We got it as the second song, and we got it as the encore.
1314000	1316000	And that is my favorite song in the game.
1316000	1322000	And so I was beaming the entire time that song was being played live. So good.
1322000	1328000	Quickly here, because I have to transition topics here, but what was your favorite thing about FanFest?
1328000	1329000	Leviathan.
1329000	1331000	And what does that mean for the listeners that don't know?
1331000	1337000	Leviathan, the concert they had at the closing ceremonies was the Soken, the guy that does all the music.
1337000	1343000	And he has a band called the Primals, and they played the theme songs to all the current Primals in the game.
1343000	1351000	And Leviathan's song is my absolute favorite, probably song of all Final Fantasy games ever that I've heard.
1351000	1355000	And now that I have theater in them, I can hear a lot of the other songs I've never heard before.
1355000	1359000	And they played it second. I was kind of going crazy about it.
1359000	1363000	And then they did an encore, and they asked what song we wanted to hear.
1363000	1368000	And Leviathan won the encore, and they played it again.
1368000	1372000	But they wouldn't play Shiva, yet they did this weekend in Europe, which is bull.
1372000	1379000	Yeah, and now that I've heard it, we didn't really miss out on much. I'm glad we got Leviathan twice. I'd rather have that than Shiva.
1379000	1384000	And what's my least favorite? Because I assume that was the other side to this.
1384000	1393000	My least favorite probably was...
1393000	1401000	It being in a casino hotel, which I understand Vegas is probably all that, but I really don't like the smell of cigarette smoke.
1401000	1408000	When you're walking through the casino areas to get to the event, you walk through a lot of cigarette smoke.
1408000	1412000	And I did not like that at all.
1412000	1414000	And that was your first trip to Vegas, right?
1414000	1423000	Yeah, and you know what? Maybe. I'm just not a Vegas person, but I didn't drink or gamble, and I just didn't really see the point.
1423000	1425000	I was there with a purpose.
1425000	1433000	And I noticed one other thing I'll quickly say is that a ton of Street Passes, especially for 3 of them, I've got 99 Chaos maps now.
1433000	1441000	Theater of the M and Smash Brothers, that was the highlight for your 3DS there. And getting all your puzzle pieces, that was easy to do.
1441000	1445000	Anyhow, Shane, if you want to come back later and hang, that's cool.
1445000	1446000	We'll be in bed.
1446000	1447000	You're probably going to bed.
1447000	1453000	Well, I gotta go park my character in front of the Rogue Guild in Final Fantasy to be prepared on Tuesday.
1453000	1459000	Well, good luck. But I gotta shift gears here because it is time for us to give our pal Mike Kennedy a call.
1459000	1466000	Mike is with Retro Magazine, and they're just coming off their first year of Retro Magazine.
1466000	1471000	And they're starting a Kickstarter for the second year, which is actually in progress. We're going to get a status update on that.
1471000	1475000	And I believe we have Mike on the line. Hi, Mike. You there?
1475000	1477000	Hey, I'm here. Thanks again for having us on.
1477000	1482000	No problem. And actually, we're going to have a second person, too, here in this interview.
1482000	1484000	Do you want to introduce this guy for us here, Mike?
1484000	1489000	Yeah, I wanted to bring on Mark Kaminsky. He's the co-founder and also our creative director.
1489000	1493000	He's the guy responsible for all the pretty pages in the magazine, among lots of other things.
1493000	1496000	Very nice. Welcome to the show, Mark. How you doing?
1496000	1497000	Hey, thanks for having me.
1497000	1499000	Hey, thank you guys for being here. I appreciate it.
1499000	1507000	Well, first off, I just want to say congratulations. You guys have successfully completed one year of Retro Magazine.
1507000	1511000	And I know we're here to talk about the Kickstarter for year two.
1511000	1514000	And usually when we're talking about Kickstarter progress, I want to give an update and say,
1514000	1519000	Oh, go donate because they have this much further to go. But you made it.
1519000	1525000	You've accomplished already your Kickstarter goal for year two of Retro Magazine, right?
1525000	1531000	We have hit our goal, but the goal was really set, something that we thought we could achieve.
1531000	1535000	And really our goal for this second year is to make the magazine bigger and better,
1535000	1538000	add more pages and lots of other cool things to the magazine.
1538000	1543000	So right now, we're really excited that we hit the goal within, I think it was about a week.
1543000	1550000	And we've got three weeks left to start hitting some stretch goals, which means just more pages and more inserts and more cool things.
1550000	1557000	So we're really excited that we hit it early on. So we've got this nice launching pad for hitting some of these stretch goals, hopefully.
1557000	1564000	Awesome. Well, let me take a step back a little bit here because even though we had you on the show last year, Mike, we're fortunate enough.
1564000	1570000	We have some new listeners every week here on the show. So some people out there listening might not have heard about Retro Magazine before.
1570000	1576000	So maybe I'll ask you, Mark, since you weren't here last year, tell us a little bit about Retro Magazine, Mark. What is it?
1576000	1584000	Well, it's just an old school magazine. It's a double entente, so it's retro. We cover retro content.
1584000	1589000	It's also a retro throwback magazine, kind of like the old school magazines that we had in the past.
1589000	1598000	Nintendo Power, Game Fan, Game Pro, that kind of thing. So we want to resurrect a print magazine for guys that still collect games and don't emulate stuff.
1598000	1603000	And it felt like there was a void in the market, and we just kind of went out and created one.
1603000	1618000	And created you did. You guys have been very successful at that. How does it feel to see that there's all these people out there saying print is dead, print is dead, but yet you guys are still able to make this successful thing? How does that kind of feel?
1618000	1628000	Well, as Mark said, we're a retro magazine, and it is that double entendre being that we talk about retro and we deliver it in a retro format.
1628000	1637000	Although there are still a few video game magazines out there, but obviously the great ones are dying off with Nintendo Power last year.
1637000	1642000	And hopefully that's about where it stops. There's still a few on the rack, and it's great to see that.
1642000	1651000	We certainly don't want to be the only one on there. We just want to add to that cornucopia of video gaming goodness that you can still get and hold onto in your hands.
1651000	1663000	And that's kind of what we want to deliver. And I think so far our fans and readers, that's kind of what we're seeing because we do sell quite a few more print subscriptions than digital.
1663000	1673000	We offer it in both formats, so we're trying to cover all of the bases there. But generally, people seem to really resonate with the print.
1673000	1681000	Awesome. And if you guys have questions for Mike or Mark, you can ask them in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com if you are listening live here.
1681000	1687000	And of course, if you want to find out more about the Kickstarter, there's not an easy way for me to give Kickstarter links out on the show.
1687000	1689000	We have a link that's friendly.
1689000	1693000	Oh, because usually they're so long and slash, dot, so what is the link?
1693000	1703000	We have thought of that. We think of everything. Well, we think we do. We have a link for that, guys. It's readretro.com slash Kickstarter.
1703000	1704000	Simple enough.
1704000	1706000	Yeah, so there it is.
1706000	1715000	Good thinking. All right, I can just say that. Readretro.com slash Kickstarter. Much easier than go here and search for this person's name. Good job on thinking that through.
1715000	1724000	Well, let's talk about Kickstarter for a minute here, Mike. I want to ask a question that might be kind of tough, but I think just to clear the air and make sure everybody kind of understands.
1724000	1732000	You've gone to Kickstarter for year two of the magazine, but I know there's probably going to be those cynical people out there that say, well, doesn't year one pay for year two?
1732000	1738000	So do you want to elaborate on why that is not the case here and why you do need this Kickstarter for year two?
1738000	1747000	Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, we're using the Kickstarter not to fund the second year because we've committed to doing year two already. We've been selling subscriptions all year long.
1747000	1756000	But we wanted to use Kickstarter for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's a marketing, you know, people use it for marketing right now.
1756000	1767000	I mean, there's lots of sophomore follow-up deals or things that people are working on where they'll go back to Kickstarter again and again and again because it brings new people for whatever reason.
1767000	1772000	I mean, there's enough new people kind of on Kickstarter that will see this project maybe for the first time.
1772000	1778000	So, you know, it's kind of, for us, it's being used as a supplemental campaign to what we've already done.
1778000	1787000	And we're really just using it to grow the subscriber base, get in front of new people because, you know, there's just buzz around a Kickstarter project.
1787000	1795000	And so we just wanted to continue to use Kickstarter in whatever way that we can. I mean, it's kind of a smart way.
1795000	1804000	And other magazines, you know, Nintendo Force is another great magazine that they just completed their second year Kickstarter a few months ago and that was very successful.
1804000	1813000	And again, it's just a way to fund more growth and I think most people will understand, I hope, anyway why we're doing it.
1814000	1821000	So far we really haven't had too many questions about it. But it's just a great way to bring in new people, new eyes, new subscribers.
1821000	1830000	There's some marketing value that Kickstarter offers these days that, you know, again, a lot of people use it just to keep things going.
1830000	1835000	That's a very honest answer that I wouldn't have really thought of but you're absolutely right.
1835000	1841000	It's because, you know, these crowdfunding things are so, is really the buzz and what a lot of people are talking about right now.
1841000	1845000	And I'm sure it does kind of put this in front of more people that maybe were not even aware of year one.
1845000	1849000	So that's a great response. Thank you.
1849000	1857000	Let's talk a little bit about some of the contributors to the magazine, Mike, because you talked about how there's some of these magazines that aren't around anymore.
1857000	1862000	But it seems like some of the people you might recognize in those magazines, you've got writing for Retro.
1862000	1865000	Can you tell us a little bit about some of the contributors you have?
1865000	1871000	Yeah, yeah. So it was, you know, when we started this thing, it was always our goal to bring on a great team of writers.
1871000	1875000	And, you know, it didn't necessarily mean it was some big name. Everybody had heard of it.
1875000	1880000	You know, we wanted to try to kind of make it a mix of some well-known, you know, industry writers.
1880000	1885000	But if you look at our magazines, you'll notice lots of new names, you know, coming in and out of every issue.
1885000	1889000	So we certainly try to mix it up and give people opportunities to get in print.
1889000	1893000	Because, I mean, those opportunities are falling by the wayside these days, right?
1893000	1894000	Right.
1894000	1897000	But people want to see their name in print still, and I think always will.
1897000	1905000	And so we wanted to be an avenue for that, not for, you know, the kind of the more, I guess, well-known people, but the newer people as well.
1905000	1914000	But as far as the well-known people, I mean, yeah, people like Jeremy Parrish, Chris Koehler, Sean Baby, Kath Bailey, Alexandra Hall, Andy Eddy.
1914000	1923000	You know, he's been writing for video game magazines, he's published, he's been publisher or, I'm sorry, editor, you know, back in the 90s at Video Games and Computer Entertainment.
1923000	1925000	So he goes way back.
1925000	1927000	Dave Halverson.
1927000	1932000	Yeah, Dave Halverson, we brought him back, you know, in issue four, did our cover story.
1932000	1939000	So, you know, we try to mix things up, you know, we kind of have this, kind of our core group that you're going to see probably in every magazine.
1939000	1945000	But the other half of the people, you know, we're going to bring in and kind of new people and keep things fresh.
1945000	1950000	And, you know, kind of, and it's been, you know, it's a pretty successful model, I think, so far.
1951000	1954000	Awesome. And, yeah, you've got some great names there.
1954000	1962000	And when you say a name like Sean Baby, I kind of go like, oh, man, I remember reading that guy's stuff when there wasn't OLR, which I can't even remember that far back some days.
1962000	1964000	Like, this show's been going on so long.
1964000	1968000	And we got new people, you know, we just had Scott Sharkey sign on.
1968000	1969000	Oh, cool.
1969000	1971000	So a lot of you guys may remember Scott Sharkey.
1971000	1974000	I mean, he's kind of disappeared, you know, the last couple of years.
1974000	1981000	He went out and basically bartended out in the Nevada, middle of the Nevada desert for the last two years.
1981000	1982000	Wow.
1982000	1985000	So I caught up with him at Portland Retro Gaming Expo last weekend.
1985000	1988000	And, you know, really great guy.
1988000	1992000	And he's really excited to be back. He's really excited to be writing for the magazine.
1992000	1997000	So, you know, he's just one of the people that we're bringing on.
1997000	2006000	We've got kind of a handful of a few other kind of interesting folks that may be joining the contributor list that I think will surprise a lot of people.
2006000	2009000	But we're just sort of keeping wraps on those just for right now.
2009000	2014000	But there may be some revealing going on in the next three weeks before the Kickstarter ends.
2014000	2016000	All right. Then stay tuned to that.
2016000	2024000	Mark, let me ask you this one since, you know, you've done a lot with making the magazine pretty, as Mike said earlier.
2024000	2030000	What is a personal favorite article or contribution of yours from the first year of publication?
2030000	2033000	And I know it's probably a tough making you pick between all this stuff.
2033000	2038000	But try to pick just one that was a personal favorite of yours.
2038000	2043000	I'm going to have to say, you know, content-wise, some of the interviews that we've done.
2043000	2047000	It was really cool to get Ed Semrad in the first issue.
2047000	2050000	You know, he was one of the original guys at EGM.
2050000	2053000	Had some really cool custom stuff.
2053000	2061000	Another interview, we found a guy in Pittsburgh that was sort of in the closet with his collection of pinball machines.
2061000	2066000	Has over 800 machines in his private collection.
2066000	2072000	You know, never talked to anybody before, like not part of Papa or any of the big events.
2072000	2074000	So he was sort of like an unknown quantity.
2074000	2079000	And we kind of, you know, dug him out and got an exclusive interview.
2079000	2082000	So that's kind of my personal favorite.
2082000	2085000	Awesome. That's always kind of cool.
2085000	2090000	It sounds like you guys have been very good at kind of, I don't want to say digging up people,
2090000	2095000	but seeking out these people that maybe haven't kept up with the industry as it is today.
2095000	2101000	But really finding these folks that contributed to gaming in the past and letting us catch up with them.
2101000	2104000	Because maybe they don't all have Twitter accounts or what have it.
2104000	2110000	Well, in our first issue, we have an interview with Inafune.
2110000	2115000	Actually, one of the images that his team sent us wasn't supposed to be sent.
2115000	2121000	And I guess there's some scribbling in Japanese there where it says something like this is just like Mega Man.
2121000	2124000	And they were a little concerned about it.
2124000	2127000	It wasn't supposed to be released publicly kind of thing.
2127000	2130000	And that's in the book. So that's kind of cool.
2130000	2133000	Whoops.
2133000	2135000	I love that.
2135000	2139000	We might have done something bad, but it's in the book now.
2139000	2142000	Hey, we just published what they gave us.
2142000	2144000	That's right. You didn't do anything wrong.
2144000	2147000	That's right. But yeah, that's a great comment.
2147000	2150000	Part of what we want to do moving forward, adding more pages and content.
2150000	2155000	We had polled all of our readers back in probably March, kind of first quarter.
2155000	2163000	And a lot of people loved the retro gaming interviews that we do with some of these gaming legends.
2163000	2169000	And coming back and trying to find some of these people that haven't been interviewed hundreds of times.
2169000	2172000	I think it's going to be a new challenge of ours.
2172000	2177000	There's a lot of these legends that for whatever reason have flown under the radar for years.
2177000	2179000	And they're all getting a lot older now.
2179000	2187000	So it's important to find some of these people that maybe wrote some really great hit game back in the 80s or early 90s.
2187000	2189000	And then they've just disappeared.
2189000	2195000	So we're trying to find these people and give them an opportunity to come in and tell us about their time in the industry.
2195000	2199000	Everybody's heard David Crane, Gary Kitchen, at least kind of the pre-NES era.
2199000	2203000	Those guys have been interviewed a bazillion times.
2203000	2211000	So I know when we interviewed them on our latest issue, part of the angle I took with them is that issue was about platforming.
2211000	2213000	It was kind of the theme.
2213000	2218000	And so I pretty much centered all my questions around platforming, which a lot of these questions they've probably never been asked before.
2218000	2224000	So it's still kind of a cool way to ask them and get information out of them that maybe they hadn't told people before.
2224000	2231000	There was a section of that article that we actually cut when we had to edit it down.
2231000	2236000	And I think we've still got this and we're going to probably get it on the website sooner or later.
2236000	2244000	But there was this real in-depth explanation that Gary Kitchen had given us about porting over Donkey Kong to the Atari 2600.
2244000	2250000	And that's generally a port that people either love it or hate it, but unfortunately a lot of people didn't like it.
2250000	2256000	Me, I thought it was great. I've spent zillions of hours playing Donkey Kong on Atari 2600.
2256000	2262000	But he talked about how hard it was to angle the girders like in the first level of Donkey Kong,
2262000	2267000	because for whatever reason the architecture of Atari, everything had to be on a straight line.
2267000	2270000	And so it was just this great explanation.
2270000	2274000	And you could tell that this was something that he just had struggled with because he went on and on and on
2274000	2280000	about how much of an accomplishment it was for him to actually figure out how to angle the girders.
2280000	2285000	Because if you played Donkey Kong level one and they were flat, it just wouldn't look like Donkey Kong, right?
2285000	2288000	So he figured out how to do that.
2288000	2293000	And those are just the great stories that we loved to hear and talk about.
2293000	2297000	And although we cut that piece, there's still a ton of great information that we left in,
2297000	2299000	and we'll probably have that here someplace else.
2299000	2304000	But just hearing these people's struggles, they didn't have anybody they could learn from.
2304000	2307000	They were there first.
2307000	2312000	And while it's a unique opportunity that few people can find themselves in,
2312000	2321000	it's pretty amazing to see what they did without any training, no school, nobody to ask how to do something.
2321000	2326000	I think people nowadays just sort of forget where it all started. And it wasn't that long ago, really.
2326000	2330000	Well, and that kind of ties into some of the new content that we cover as well,
2330000	2336000	where it's almost like the golden age of resurgence of indie game publishing right now.
2336000	2342000	These little guys are going out there, and they worked with big developers,
2342000	2346000	and now they're coming out and they're like, you know, I want to make a cool platforming game,
2346000	2348000	or I want to make my own RPG.
2348000	2354000	And they're small teams of a handful of people, and they're making the game that they really want to make.
2354000	2356000	And it's just a really interesting space right now.
2356000	2360000	I don't know if you know this, but we literally had one of those guys on the show here two weeks ago
2360000	2362000	talking about his game, Timespinner.
2362000	2367000	I don't know if that's one of you guys' radar, but literally what you just said there.
2367000	2372000	And I kind of agree. There's a lot of love of the retro going on there.
2372000	2376000	And yeah, you are seeing people that are stepping away from maybe these AAA studios
2376000	2382000	to really do their quote-unquote pet projects, such as when we had Bodhi on a couple weeks ago.
2383000	2388000	Curious, are there any of these types of retro nostalgic games?
2388000	2391000	Because Retro Magazine doesn't only cover classics.
2391000	2399000	Like, you guys had Mighty No. 9 on your very first issue, which is certainly a retro-inspired game, right?
2399000	2406000	What kinds of these retro-inspired games do you think might not be on our radar right now, but should be?
2407000	2410000	Mike, is some of this stuff from E3?
2410000	2414000	I don't know. I was just looking at actually recovering Timespinner in our next issue.
2414000	2417000	So I knew you had mentioned that. I'm going through a pagination here going,
2417000	2419000	that really sounds familiar.
2419000	2422000	You know what, one of the things for me being kind of an older gamer,
2422000	2428000	I'm 45, I'm the pre-NES kind of demographic that we try to shoot some of our content towards.
2428000	2431000	There's tons of these games coming out that I would never hear about
2431000	2435000	if I wasn't publishing this magazine or reading this magazine.
2435000	2438000	Because I read it, you know, when we're doing the pagination
2438000	2442000	and people are turning their stories in and everything, that's when I get to read the magazine.
2442000	2445000	And I tell you what, I go through this stuff and we learn about these games.
2445000	2449000	And I tell you, there's not that many really great indie games that are coming out right now
2449000	2453000	that people haven't heard of because the industry has totally changed.
2453000	2456000	I mean, Sony, they're going after exclusives.
2456000	2459000	We're covering Axiom Verge, which is this great Metroidvania game.
2459000	2462000	That's kind of our cover story for the next issue.
2462000	2464000	Oh my god, that's a Sony exclusive.
2464000	2468000	So you've got companies like Sony going out to these single-person dev teams.
2468000	2471000	It's not even a team, it's just you.
2471000	2473000	And your game is so good.
2473000	2477000	They're trying to give you an exclusive deal on it.
2477000	2478000	Think about that.
2478000	2480000	I mean, it's insane.
2480000	2481000	And it's great.
2481000	2483000	That's why the industry is changing right now.
2483000	2486000	So there was Indiecade a couple of weekends ago.
2486000	2489000	I went out there and Nintendo had a tent there
2489000	2493000	showcasing all of these great indie titles that are coming out.
2493000	2496000	Ouya had a booth there and Sony had a booth there.
2496000	2501000	And so they're really trying to get these games out to the public.
2501000	2504000	And there's really no other magazines, at least at this point,
2504000	2508000	that are really covering it and giving these types of games top billing.
2508000	2513000	So I think that's a great place for us to come in
2513000	2517000	and kind of help get these people's games kind of permanently recorded
2517000	2522000	on paper and everything else because it's just kind of eroding right now.
2522000	2524000	But I don't know.
2524000	2528000	Mark, is there any other games that you can think of?
2528000	2531000	Well, right now on the Ouya, I'm playing Never Ending Nightmare.
2531000	2534000	It's that time of year, Survival War.
2534000	2538000	I'll tell you what, that is one of the creepiest games you will ever play.
2538000	2540000	I love the Ouya platform.
2540000	2542000	I think there's a lot of great stuff on there.
2542000	2545000	I wish them the best of luck. I hope they can continue on.
2545000	2547000	Me too.
2547000	2550000	My appreciation for the Ouya really didn't grow until I really saw
2550000	2553000	probably about E3 this year or GamerX,
2553000	2556000	where I really started to see more of the indie stuff
2556000	2559000	that they were really opening up that platform to
2559000	2562000	and really kind of going over and championing these indies.
2562000	2565000	Yeah, it made me really appreciate the Ouya a lot more as a system.
2565000	2569000	They had a tent full of people at IndieCade, full of people.
2569000	2573000	And there's probably a dozen flat screens in there playing all these games.
2573000	2576000	And almost every single one of them was a retro title.
2576000	2579000	So it's really turning into a pretty decent format.
2579000	2581000	So they had some rocky times.
2581000	2583000	But I think they're bringing the games,
2583000	2587000	which ultimately hopefully will work out really well for them.
2587000	2591000	Rob, I want to take a quick step back and just first of all thank you.
2591000	2597000	You were the first show that we got on last year to promote the Kickstarter.
2597000	2599000	And it really means a lot.
2599000	2603000	I've listened to your show since about 2006 on and off.
2603000	2607000	I ran into Bobby at Southern Fried Gaming Expo,
2607000	2610000	and we put your name in the magazine.
2610000	2613000	I just want to say thanks a lot for having us on.
2613000	2616000	Thank you so much. It's an absolute pleasure.
2616000	2618000	And I like to kind of say,
2618000	2622000	oh, well, we were there catching this wave before it got big.
2622000	2624000	Yeah, absolutely.
2624000	2626000	When the first issue came out, I noticed,
2626000	2628000	and I looked at the backer pages, I was like,
2628000	2631000	oh, orangeontrated.com is right there in the first position.
2631000	2633000	I was like, well, that's kind of neat.
2633000	2636000	And then, yeah, I had heard that that could be part of the reason why.
2636000	2638000	We were the first show that had you guys on.
2638000	2640000	So fantastic.
2640000	2642000	I'm glad we can give you guys a boost again this year,
2642000	2645000	just in case there's folks out there that still,
2645000	2648000	for whatever reason, have not heard of Retro Magazine.
2648000	2652000	And yes, print media is still happening out there, still happening.
2652000	2655000	Speaking of that, let me ask one more question I have here.
2655000	2658000	Do you have advice to anybody else
2658000	2661000	that might decide to venture into the world of print media?
2661000	2664000	Now, we are the voice of geeks network,
2664000	2666000	so we have a lot of different fandoms, not just video gaming.
2666000	2670000	We've got people that like British television shows and anime
2670000	2672000	and all sorts of fandoms here.
2672000	2674000	And I'm sure a lot of people are feeling like
2674000	2678000	they see the print media for their stuff slip away.
2678000	2681000	I've seen everything from newsletters
2681000	2685000	and what we used to call zines many years ago.
2685000	2687000	I've seen all sorts of things.
2687000	2689000	So what advice would you guys have
2689000	2691000	from what you've learned over the past year
2691000	2695000	to anybody else that might be ready to venture down this path?
2695000	2700000	I think, first of all, it's easy to say,
2700000	2702000	but you've got to just go for it.
2702000	2704000	And then you figure out a way to make it happen,
2704000	2709000	especially if what you want to talk about
2709000	2712000	would resonate with people to read magazines.
2712000	2714000	Like old video game magazines, that resonates with people.
2714000	2716000	So generally, I'm thinking,
2716000	2718000	probably a lot of your people grew up reading magazines
2718000	2721000	and whatever hobby they like.
2721000	2723000	And those magazines probably are disappearing.
2723000	2725000	Maybe they didn't have magazines in the first place
2725000	2727000	if they were really small hobbies.
2727000	2729000	But generally, you're not the only kind of people that like something.
2729000	2731000	There's other people out there.
2731000	2733000	And we've just found that people still really like the magazines
2733000	2735000	and don't think that we're crazy.
2735000	2738000	But there's a lot of work that's involved.
2738000	2740000	And it helps if you've got connections.
2740000	2742000	Honestly, if Marc wouldn't have come to me,
2742000	2744000	I was going to do a digital magazine originally,
2744000	2748000	and Marc, who happens to be in that business,
2748000	2750000	kind of sought me out and heard what I wanted to do
2750000	2752000	and said, let's do a print magazine.
2752000	2754000	And at first I thought, you're nuts.
2754000	2756000	But luckily for me, he had a background in it.
2756000	2760000	He had the printing contacts and the desire and will
2760000	2765000	and aptitude to lay out a complete magazine by himself.
2765000	2767000	It's insane.
2767000	2769000	So we got a little bit lucky that way.
2769000	2772000	But with the software and stuff out there these days,
2772000	2776000	if you wanted to do it and do it yourself and start small,
2776000	2779000	I think you probably could do it.
2779000	2782000	But just nail your costs down.
2782000	2787000	Yeah, just go out there and do it, really.
2787000	2789000	There's a lot of technological advances
2789000	2790000	that happen with printing.
2790000	2794000	So we print on a traditional big web press.
2794000	2797000	We ship out through the mail and everything,
2797000	2798000	polybagger magazines.
2798000	2801000	But I mean, there's print on demand services
2801000	2806000	through places like Jumag or MagCloud,
2806000	2808000	and all these other things.
2808000	2810000	So you could put out a digital magazine.
2810000	2812000	And let's say it's something that you
2812000	2814000	start with some people you know.
2814000	2818000	And then you want to offer a print version.
2818000	2821000	People can ante up and pay and have it shipped to them
2821000	2824000	directly, sort of like a one-off print on demand.
2824000	2826000	So I mean, go out there and do it.
2826000	2828000	I mean, we love it.
2828000	2833000	And we didn't really skip on any of the,
2833000	2835000	we don't print on cheap toilet paper.
2835000	2837000	We have really nice quality paper.
2837000	2840000	We have high quality stock for our covers and everything.
2840000	2842000	We want this to be something that you put on the shelf.
2842000	2845000	And we're going after a certain market, people
2845000	2849000	that collect games, that want to have something to hold on to.
2849000	2852000	So I mean, if you love it, go out, do it.
2852000	2853000	You'll feel better for it.
2853000	2855000	And there's a lot of options right now.
2855000	2857000	So yeah, absolutely.
2857000	2858000	Follow your dream.
2858000	2859000	Excellent.
2859000	2861000	Well, again, if you guys want to check out Retro Magazine,
2861000	2863000	check out their website, readretro.com.
2863000	2866000	And of course, the Kickstarter, readretro.com slash Kickstarter.
2866000	2867000	I got that right.
2867000	2868000	Correct?
2868000	2869000	You got it.
2869000	2870000	All right.
2870000	2871000	Awesome.
2871000	2872000	Well, before we close up here, I always
2872000	2874000	like to ask this question of all the guests
2874000	2875000	out there on the show.
2875000	2877000	What games are you playing right now?
2877000	2880000	So what games are you into right now?
2880000	2882000	I'm curious if you're playing retro games
2882000	2884000	or maybe there's newer games that have your eye right now,
2884000	2885000	which is totally fine too.
2885000	2886000	I play both.
2886000	2887000	Mark, I'll start with you.
2887000	2889000	What games are you playing right now?
2889000	2890000	OK.
2890000	2891000	Classic games right now.
2891000	2898000	I'm playing through R-Type 1 and 2 as best I can on Ouya.
2898000	2901000	Really hard.
2901000	2902000	I keep going back to it.
2902000	2905000	I'm like, man, I don't remember this being so hard.
2905000	2907000	But any shmup that I can't.
2907000	2908000	And I'm pretty good.
2908000	2910000	I have a Neo Geo cabinet and everything.
2910000	2913000	I mean, having a hard time getting past the third level
2913000	2914000	in both games.
2914000	2915000	And it's like, ugh.
2915000	2917000	But Borderlands, Borderlands, Borderlands,
2917000	2919000	as far as the new stuff.
2919000	2921000	Just a big fan of the Borderlands series.
2921000	2923000	Can't praise it enough.
2923000	2924000	Yeah.
2924000	2926000	Clearly, you must have picked up the pre-sequel.
2926000	2927000	Oh, yeah.
2927000	2928000	Yep.
2928000	2929000	Awesome.
2929000	2930000	Awesome.
2930000	2931000	Mike, how about you?
2931000	2932000	Oh, gosh.
2932000	2934000	So I'm going to come on the total opposite end
2934000	2936000	of this spectrum.
2936000	2938000	First of all, I've not been playing a lot.
2938000	2939000	Because it's just, I don't know.
2939000	2941000	That's the sad part of being so busy.
2941000	2943000	He is true.
2943000	2947000	But I did pick up the ColecoVision Flashback
2947000	2950000	and the Intellivision Flashback.
2950000	2953000	And I've been playing through some of the new homebrew games
2953000	2954000	on the ColecoVision Flashback.
2954000	2956000	There's about, I don't know, half a dozen of them
2956000	2957000	or so on there.
2957000	2959000	I forgot those were coming.
2959000	2960000	I need to get those.
2960000	2961000	Thank you for reminding me.
2961000	2962000	Those are out.
2962000	2964000	I mean, you know, 40 bucks at Toys R Us.
2964000	2966000	I think Intellivision, I just saw something come down
2966000	2969000	by Facebook, a Groupon for the Intellivision Flashback.
2969000	2971000	Oh, I needed a 60-week original one.
2971000	2972000	You know, 60 built-in games.
2972000	2975000	You know, you've got the original looking Intellivision controller.
2975000	2978000	They're pretty decent little systems, you know.
2978000	2980000	And there's certainly going to be games on there.
2980000	2981000	You've got the base plates.
2981000	2982000	That is awesome.
2982000	2983000	Yeah, yeah.
2983000	2985000	They've got the controller overlays and stuff.
2985000	2986000	They'll come with that.
2986000	2988000	And again, there's some new homebrew games on there
2988000	2991000	that are real good, you know.
2991000	2993000	So if you kind of grew up, you know, in that era
2993000	2995000	and you want some new games to play,
2995000	2998000	the other great thing about these is a lot of the rare games that,
2998000	3000000	you know, the cartridges may be 50 to 100 bucks,
3000000	3002000	there's probably a dozen of them on this thing.
3002000	3003000	So you don't have to get the cartridge.
3003000	3006000	You can get this flashback and play a lot of the harder to find
3006000	3008000	and more expensive games.
3008000	3012000	But I'm trying to think of, like, a current game.
3012000	3014000	No, that was a great answer, Mike,
3014000	3016000	because, like, you literally have me going, like,
3016000	3018000	you know what, I have money on my Groupon account
3018000	3020000	from some gift certificates,
3020000	3023000	and if this Intellivision thing is on there, I'm buying one.
3023000	3026000	It's a great gift to give somebody, too.
3026000	3028000	Like, for that gamer that, you know, that, you know,
3028000	3032000	kind of has everything, I mean, they're really cool systems.
3032000	3034000	Or a great gift to give myself.
3034000	3035000	Exactly.
3035000	3036000	Yeah, there you go.
3036000	3037000	Hey, even better.
3037000	3038000	Yo, hit titles.
3038000	3041000	Adventure, Zaxxon, Pepper 2, Jumpman Engineer.
3041000	3043000	Okay, I'll just buy that right now, then.
3043000	3044000	Right?
3044000	3045000	Right?
3045000	3046000	I can't wait.
3046000	3047000	Is there going to be, like, a Commodore 64?
3047000	3051000	Well, I know they had that newer PC a few years ago
3051000	3053000	that also had the retro mode, but, you know,
3053000	3054000	one of these days, they're going to release,
3054000	3056000	I think they have, like, a Commodore 64 joystick
3056000	3057000	or something that came out some time ago,
3057000	3060000	but, oh, that was my retro console.
3060000	3061000	That was great, yeah.
3061000	3065000	Hey, Mike, what was that TV that they had at CGE with this?
3065000	3067000	Oh, yeah, so there's a new television that's out.
3067000	3069000	It's from Crossley.
3069000	3072000	If you guys Google, I think if you just Google Crossley,
3072000	3075000	C-R-O-S-S-L-E-Y, they're the ones that are making
3075000	3077000	some of the new, like, in Target stores,
3077000	3081000	it's, like, the USB record players and stuff.
3081000	3085000	But Crossley Retro Television.
3085000	3086000	Yeah.
3086000	3089000	You're going to see this beautiful flat screen TV
3089000	3092000	with these big chrome knobs on it and this wood grain,
3092000	3095000	you know, kind of perimeter, you know,
3095000	3098000	around the edge of the TV, and they're pretty expensive,
3098000	3101000	but, man, they're really sharp, they're video game friendly,
3101000	3104000	they've got lots of inputs, and so those have been
3104000	3105000	kind of the new thing.
3105000	3107000	And they've been working with Intellivision
3107000	3109000	and a lot of these companies to bring these TVs
3109000	3110000	into the retro expos.
3110000	3114000	They have a 24-inch one for $229.
3114000	3115000	Wow.
3115000	3116000	I think they have them at Target,
3116000	3118000	or maybe you'd probably get them online,
3118000	3120000	but they're pretty sharp.
3120000	3121000	Awesome.
3121000	3123000	Wow, I learned some new stuff,
3123000	3125000	and now I've just spent more money
3125000	3126000	thanks to this interview.
3126000	3127000	That's fantastic.
3127000	3129000	Thanks, you guys.
3129000	3131000	Well, I want to thank you guys again for coming on.
3131000	3134000	Let me quickly read some of these comments here
3134000	3135000	we're getting in a chat room.
3135000	3136000	SSG100Matt says,
3136000	3139000	The digital PDF subscription are great for any medium.
3139000	3141000	Absolutely, it's a great way to kind of get the magazine
3141000	3143000	on your iPad and all that stuff, right?
3143000	3145000	Dungeonbuster, in response to the zine question,
3145000	3148000	saying, I wonder how many of these fanzine authors
3148000	3151000	went on to become full-fledged writers and editors.
3151000	3152000	I bet quite a few.
3152000	3154000	I know some people that started as podcasters
3154000	3157000	that do a lot of this, you know, big-time stuff now,
3157000	3158000	which is cool.
3158000	3159000	Dungeonbuster also says,
3159000	3162000	The old mags are great snapshots of the past in gaming.
3162000	3165000	The ads, the articles, and the excitement
3165000	3167000	were splashed on every page.
3167000	3170000	Do you guys ever have the urge to run, like,
3170000	3174000	a classic video game ad of sorts in your magazine?
3174000	3176000	Mark, I mean, I don't know.
3176000	3178000	I mean, I guess first of all, I don't know if there's...
3178000	3181000	I know a lot of the ezines and the fan magazines did that.
3181000	3184000	I don't know for, like, a widely distributed magazine
3184000	3187000	if that's infringing on anything, you know?
3187000	3189000	Yeah, we have to be careful we don't get sued.
3189000	3193000	I mean, I'd love to, but I don't know.
3193000	3195000	Some of that stuff, I mean...
3195000	3198000	And, you know, the ads that we've had in our magazine,
3198000	3200000	I mean, we keep it to a minimum.
3200000	3202000	We only have, you know, four to six pages,
3202000	3205000	and we really feel everything we put in there
3205000	3207000	is, like, something you check out, you know?
3207000	3210000	Video game box protectors or some class,
3210000	3212000	you know, retro game coming out.
3212000	3214000	So we've been really fortunate.
3214000	3215000	Yeah, it's relevant.
3215000	3217000	Awesome, awesome.
3217000	3221000	Well, I'm going to go ahead and wish you guys the best of luck
3221000	3223000	with year two of Retro Magazine
3223000	3226000	and any other links or things you want to plug here
3226000	3228000	before I let you guys go.
3228000	3230000	Mike, I'll start with you.
3230000	3232000	Well, I'd just say, you know, readretro.com.
3232000	3234000	That's our website that, you know,
3234000	3236000	is kind of tagged onto that Kickstarter campaign.
3236000	3238000	But the main thing is the website.
3238000	3240000	I mean, we got a ton of writers over there
3240000	3243000	putting a lot of effort and time into creating new content,
3243000	3245000	you know, retro content.
3245000	3247000	We're trying to kind of fill the gaps
3247000	3249000	between the magazine deliveries, you know,
3249000	3251000	give people a place to kind of interact
3251000	3253000	and read what our writers, you know,
3253000	3256000	are talking about online every day, you know?
3256000	3259000	And, again, just fill the gaps between the magazine
3259000	3262000	and really use the website to kind of complement the magazine.
3262000	3264000	And I've just been really proud of the content
3264000	3266000	that we're getting up there,
3266000	3268000	and we just want people to go and read it.
3268000	3270000	We got a lot of people spend a lot of time,
3270000	3272000	and I think there's some neat stuff there.
3272000	3274000	And it's all, you know, pretty timeless.
3274000	3276000	You know, there's not a lot of reviews for...
3276000	3278000	We have some new game reviews,
3278000	3280000	but, I mean, we're getting some pretty exclusive stuff,
3280000	3281000	some cool interviews.
3281000	3283000	We're getting some, you know, cool videos
3283000	3286000	and stuff that you can kind of just read any time,
3286000	3290000	you know, and it's kind of timeless and resourceful.
3290000	3293000	So, you know, I would just say, for me,
3293000	3295000	yeah, check out the website as well.
3295000	3298000	Awesome. Mark, anything you want to add to that?
3298000	3302000	Absolutely. SouthernFriedGameRoomExpo.com.
3302000	3305000	It's a long link, but Bobby Blackwolf was there.
3305000	3308000	I know the host of this show are pinball fans.
3308000	3311000	If you can make it out next year in Atlanta,
3311000	3315000	June 20th through the 22nd, it's a great show.
3315000	3318000	Lots of really cool pinball stuff.
3318000	3320000	Check it out. Like, get it on your bucket list
3320000	3322000	or calendar or whatever. Come out next year.
3322000	3325000	I already do make my one trip to Atlanta a year for DragonCon,
3325000	3328000	but it sounds like you guys have quite the convention.
3328000	3331000	I know Bobby's gone a few years there, and he's a fan.
3331000	3333000	Well, this year was the first year.
3333000	3337000	I mean, it was totally crazy, like naked people in the pool.
3337000	3340000	You know, it was out of control. It was a good time.
3340000	3342000	Why did I think it was like you were on year two or three?
3342000	3344000	I guess I'm getting ahead of myself.
3344000	3346000	I guess it was just that solid.
3346000	3348000	It was like a second or third year convention.
3348000	3350000	It was so amazing. Yeah, it was a really good time.
3350000	3352000	That's why. All right, well, thank you guys again,
3352000	3354000	and congratulations on all your success with Retro Magazine
3354000	3356000	and I'm looking forward to year two,
3356000	3358000	as I'm sure a lot of people are,
3358000	3360000	and thanks for keeping the print media alive.
3360000	3362000	It's fantastic.
3362000	3364000	Thanks, Rob. Thanks for having us on again.
3364000	3366000	Thanks again. Take care, you guys.
3366000	3367000	Yeah, bye. Bye-bye.
3367000	3371000	Again, that was Mike and Mark from Retro Magazine,
3371000	3374000	and we wish them the best of luck with year two,
3374000	3377000	and that Kickstarter's going on right now,
3377000	3379000	and as we mentioned earlier, they have made the goal,
3379000	3381000	but they are looking at stretch goals,
3381000	3383000	like they're going to make the magazine bigger,
3383000	3385000	add more pages, things along that line.
3385000	3388000	So if you are feeling so generous,
3388000	3390000	you want to check out the magazine,
3390000	3392000	I would urge you to go over to the Kickstarter.
3392000	3394000	I believe, too, from what I'm reading on the Kickstarter,
3394000	3395000	if you want to get a subscription,
3395000	3397000	like if this is just even something that interests you,
3397000	3399000	you can lock it in now cheaper
3399000	3401000	than it's going to be after the Kickstarter's over.
3401000	3403000	So if you're like, I want to get the magazine,
3403000	3405000	you might as well do the Kickstarter
3405000	3408000	and get locked in for year two of Retro Magazine.
3408000	3411000	Thanks again for them coming on the show.
3411000	3413000	Always good to have them on.
3413000	3415000	How do you like that, Loki?
3415000	3416000	He's been listening since 2006.
3416000	3419000	I had heard we were the first show that had them on.
3419000	3421000	That's great.
3421000	3422000	That's pretty awesome.
3422000	3423000	That's very awesome.
3423000	3425000	Almost as awesome as this
3425000	3428000	ColecoVision Flashback Game Console that I now need to get.
3428000	3429000	I know, right?
3429000	3432000	Like, I see everybody linking it in our chat room there.
3432000	3435000	In fact, ActDeft sent me a link directly to Groupon
3435000	3438000	of this Intellivision Flashback Console there.
3438000	3440000	How much is that thing going to set me back
3440000	3442000	when it comes up here?
3442000	3444000	Oh man, it even comes with the...
3444000	3446000	Okay, see, here's the thing.
3446000	3448000	I had the Intellivision lives on what, the Xbox
3448000	3449000	or whatever it was?
3449000	3452000	Like, I remember on our old network, All Games,
3452000	3454000	they were really tight with the Intellivision guys
3454000	3455000	and I seem to remember for a while
3455000	3457000	they were pushing that Intellivision lives.
3457000	3459000	It was on like Xbox, right?
3459000	3461000	So I remember getting a copy of that then,
3461000	3463000	but man, this Flashback Console comes
3463000	3465000	with one of those little disk controllers
3465000	3466000	with the number pad on it.
3466000	3468000	Awesome.
3468000	3469000	Forty bucks on Groupon.
3469000	3471000	I think I'm going to have to buy that.
3471000	3473000	Yeah, the regular price on those is like $49.99.
3473000	3477000	I gotta buy it.
3477000	3479000	Somebody stop me.
3479000	3481000	Alright, that's 60 titles on that.
3481000	3483000	Although, if you can't get through Groupon,
3483000	3486000	according to Google here, at least the Colecovision one
3486000	3488000	is $39.99 at Bed Bath & Beyond,
3488000	3491000	the place that you'd probably never think to buy a retro console.
3491000	3493000	Who would think to get a console at Bed Bath & Beyond?
3493000	3495000	Oh my gosh. Wow.
3495000	3496000	Alright, well...
3496000	3498000	That's what I grew up on, man, is the Colecovision,
3498000	3500000	so that's some awesome stuff.
3500000	3503000	Although, those controllers look a little bit different than I remember.
3503000	3505000	Alright, well, let's get into it.
3505000	3507000	So from retro to current gaming,
3507000	3509000	let us get into how was your gaming week
3509000	3511000	and the types of video games that you've been playing this week,
3511000	3513000	and then we can finally get into our news.
3513000	3515000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
3515000	3516000	My gaming week was okay.
3516000	3518000	I mean, obviously, I bought a game system.
3518000	3520000	Sadly, I did not play really anything on it.
3520000	3522000	I just kind of got it ready.
3522000	3525000	I got all those games that kind of bookmarked
3525000	3528000	with PlayStation Plus back when I had it,
3528000	3531000	because I had to renew it, because I let it lapse for a while.
3531000	3533000	But now I have another year in there,
3533000	3535000	because obviously if I'm playing multiplayer games,
3535000	3536000	I got to have it anyways.
3536000	3539000	But I meant to do it at some point.
3539000	3543000	I was just waiting for when I was going to have a PlayStation 4.
3543000	3544000	So I renewed that,
3544000	3549000	and I just kind of downloaded everything that I had marked
3549000	3550000	that I wanted to play.
3550000	3551000	So I have that all installed,
3551000	3553000	so I just had to go and play that.
3554000	3556000	Really, the only game I kind of played
3556000	3560000	was just to test out the camera,
3560000	3563000	the playroom or whatever that's called, I think.
3563000	3564000	Yeah.
3564000	3566000	So I had my son mess around with that.
3566000	3567000	I was going to say,
3567000	3569000	your kids would probably get a real big kick out of that.
3569000	3570000	Yeah, my son liked it.
3570000	3574000	He's always skittish about everything,
3574000	3575000	and I'm like,
3575000	3576000	they have these robots in there,
3576000	3577000	and he's like,
3577000	3579000	well, I don't know, robots are scary.
3579000	3582000	I'm like, no, no, no, it's not scary.
3582000	3584000	So he liked it.
3584000	3585000	He liked, you know,
3585000	3588000	so I'll suck them back up into the controller area.
3588000	3589000	I was like, okay, fine, I'll do that.
3589000	3590000	He's like, what's that noise?
3590000	3592000	I'm like, they're stuck in the controller, see?
3592000	3593000	So I'll shoot them back out.
3593000	3595000	So he had fun with that.
3595000	3597000	So I messed with that a little bit.
3597000	3598000	Sadly, that's probably the,
3598000	3601000	I don't think I'm going to be using the camera very much,
3601000	3603000	but whatever.
3603000	3605000	That's cool to have anyways.
3605000	3608000	And then I just preordered some stuff
3608000	3609000	that's going to be coming out,
3609000	3611000	you know, because Grand Theft Auto V,
3611000	3613000	you know, I got to have that.
3613000	3616000	So I did that digitally, just for the fuck of it.
3616000	3617000	I mean, whatever.
3617000	3618000	I'm not going to sell that game.
3618000	3619000	It's going to be awesome.
3619000	3620000	And then Call of Duty,
3620000	3622000	just because I wanted that on PS3,
3622000	3623000	as well as PlayStation 4,
3623000	3624000	because I still have friends
3624000	3627000	that haven't bought a PlayStation 4 yet,
3627000	3628000	and we're going to be hopefully
3628000	3631000	upgrading that from Modern Warfare 2.
3631000	3633000	So that, and then just working on my game,
3633000	3637000	still working on doing the new Unity GUI stuff
3637000	3640000	to redo my whole editor
3640000	3643000	so that I can quickly go through it
3643000	3645000	to make levels out of it
3645000	3647000	instead of just ships and stuff.
3647000	3648000	And so that's what I've been working on,
3648000	3650000	just getting the new interface down for that
3650000	3653000	so that I can build stuff.
3653000	3656000	And so I was just kind of working away at that.
3656000	3658000	But, uh...
3658000	3660000	Is your game retro-inspired?
3660000	3661000	Because maybe you'll get covered
3661000	3662000	in that magazine someday.
3662000	3663000	Retro magazine.
3663000	3664000	Sort of.
3664000	3666000	I mean, it's a 2D shooter, I guess.
3666000	3668000	And it's got, it's going to have,
3668000	3670000	I mean, the original idea was
3670000	3673000	it was going to be like the NES color palette and stuff,
3673000	3675000	so it was going to be very limited,
3675000	3676000	you know, looking like that.
3676000	3677000	Kind of like, you know,
3677000	3681000	how they have those 3D NES games sometimes,
3681000	3682000	like, you know,
3682000	3684000	where it'll be just kind of blocky-looking stuff.
3684000	3685000	That's what the original idea was,
3685000	3686000	is it was going to look like that.
3686000	3687000	Are you talking about, like, Vector?
3687000	3688000	Are you talking about something like...
3688000	3689000	No, I'm talking about, like,
3689000	3690000	where they, like, take, like,
3690000	3691000	the Super Mario Brothers,
3691000	3692000	original Super Mario Brothers,
3692000	3693000	and they make, like,
3693000	3695000	a 3D web version of that or something like that.
3695000	3697000	Where you can, like, pan the camera and stuff.
3697000	3698000	Oh, okay.
3698000	3699000	That kind of thing.
3699000	3700000	Where it's going to look...
3700000	3701000	Paper Mario.
3701000	3702000	Kind of like Voxels or something.
3702000	3703000	Paper Mario is cool.
3703000	3704000	I love Paper Mario.
3704000	3707000	But, no, not exactly.
3707000	3708000	And I increased the color palette.
3708000	3710000	It's, like, 88 colors now.
3710000	3712000	So, but that's what I'm sticking with,
3712000	3713000	is just 88 colors,
3713000	3715000	and I'm working with that.
3715000	3720000	But, yeah, so, sort of, I guess.
3720000	3721000	It's not entirely retro.
3721000	3724000	It's just kind of a bunch of things combined together.
3725000	3727000	But, yeah, that's pretty much it this week.
3727000	3730000	I mean, hopefully, I'm going to play some stuff
3730000	3731000	on the PlayStation 4 next week,
3731000	3733000	before I get shipped out,
3733000	3736000	and then I'll just be working on my game
3736000	3737000	while it's gone.
3737000	3738000	Well, actually, no.
3738000	3739000	I take that back.
3739000	3741000	There is one game I purchased today
3741000	3743000	that I will probably go back and play,
3743000	3746000	but I'll get to that later.
3746000	3748000	But, yeah.
3748000	3749000	So, I'll be playing some more stuff,
3749000	3750000	hopefully, this week.
3750000	3751000	I'll get back to it.
3751000	3752000	So, I'll be playing some more stuff,
3752000	3753000	hopefully, this week.
3753000	3754000	Okey-dokey.
3754000	3755000	My gaming week.
3755000	3757000	You know, I've been insanely busy with,
3757000	3758000	you know, I took the trip to Vegas.
3758000	3760000	I'm going to BlizzCon in a couple weeks.
3760000	3761000	I know.
3761000	3762000	Poor me.
3762000	3763000	All these trips.
3763000	3765000	But it can still kind of take its toll on you
3765000	3766000	with being busy.
3766000	3767000	And then I have my final Rocky show,
3767000	3768000	which I talked about a couple weeks ago
3768000	3769000	at the end of the show.
3769000	3771000	I have that coming up on Halloween.
3771000	3772000	So, I've been pretty insanely busy.
3772000	3774000	I have been squeezing in some video games
3774000	3775000	here and there.
3775000	3776000	So, I do have a few things to talk about.
3776000	3779000	Final Fantasy XIV, which, you know,
3779000	3781000	going to the Fan Fest, it did re-energize,
3781000	3783000	you know, despite the problems I had with it.
3783000	3785000	It definitely re-energized, like,
3785000	3787000	how, like, my love of the game
3787000	3788000	and how into it I am.
3788000	3790000	And they've got a brand new content patch
3790000	3792000	coming on Tuesday that's going to add
3792000	3793000	the Shiva battle.
3793000	3794000	We'll finally be in there the last
3794000	3796000	Primal Battle for this expansion.
3796000	3799000	And, you know, some new dungeons,
3799000	3800000	some other new features.
3800000	3802000	So, I'm really kind of pumped getting ready
3802000	3804000	for that with that releasing on Tuesday.
3804000	3806000	With some non-MMO games,
3806000	3809000	I played Pagle 2 on our week off
3809000	3811000	because that came out on the PlayStation Marketplace.
3811000	3813000	That's been out for a while for the Xbox One folks
3813000	3815000	because that's been exclusive,
3815000	3817000	but it finally came out for PlayStation 4.
3817000	3818000	So, I've been playing a little bit of that,
3818000	3821000	which, you know, to be expected,
3821000	3822000	a lot like Pagle 1,
3822000	3824000	but they throw in some new little things
3824000	3826000	like armored blocks,
3826000	3828000	which I don't remember seeing in the first one.
3828000	3830000	You have to hit them twice before they disappear.
3830000	3831000	Like, you know, I've kind of seen that
3831000	3832000	in some breakout clone games,
3832000	3834000	but didn't really see that in the first Pagle.
3834000	3837000	So, you know, it's a very familiar formula,
3837000	3839000	but, you know, it works well.
3839000	3841000	And the game's definitely on crack,
3841000	3843000	like the first one was, you know,
3843000	3845000	like the horse that literally will, like,
3845000	3848000	fart like little rainbows and things like that.
3848000	3849000	Very silly types of stuff.
3849000	3851000	So, cute to see that.
3851000	3853000	Other games.
3853000	3856000	Friday was a big, big game release day.
3856000	3857000	There was a couple of them that came out,
3857000	3860000	and I've gotten to spend a little time with each of these.
3860000	3863000	Civilization Beyond Earth would be the first one,
3863000	3866000	which, as you know, I love Civilization.
3866000	3869000	The original's probably my favorite PC game ever,
3869000	3871000	and I've been following with the series
3871000	3873000	through Civilization V.
3873000	3875000	And, you know, at E3, I was fortunate enough
3875000	3878000	to check out a sneak peek of Civilization Beyond Earth,
3878000	3881000	and I was ready to put down the money right there.
3881000	3883000	So I picked up Civilization Beyond Earth,
3883000	3886000	which, you know, a lot of people will look at it and go,
3886000	3889000	hmm, it just looks like Civ V in space,
3889000	3893000	which on a purely kind of, like, just visual level,
3893000	3896000	it probably does, like, look like that.
3896000	3898000	But the game has a little more depth than that.
3898000	3900000	Oh, the one screenshot I saw looked really weird.
3900000	3902000	I'm like, this doesn't look like Civilization.
3902000	3906000	Well, I think that's the hardest thing people are having with it
3906000	3910000	is that Civilization has that familiarity with it.
3910000	3912000	You know, you're gonna research guns
3912000	3914000	because I want to be able to make gunners
3914000	3917000	and musket men that can shoot the enemy.
3917000	3920000	I'm gonna fight people like Queen Elizabeth and Gandhi
3920000	3923000	and, you know, Abe Lincoln and all these very familiar things.
3923000	3927000	Civilization has that very, you know, sense of familiarity with it.
3927000	3929000	Civilization Beyond Earth has none of that
3929000	3931000	because it's all about science fiction
3931000	3933000	and, you know, what could be the future.
3933000	3936000	You know, if you ever played Alpha Centauri,
3936000	3938000	it was very much like that too.
3938000	3943000	So Beyond Earth in some ways is a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri.
3943000	3946000	One of the big, you know, game-changing things it does
3946000	3949000	is that there's not just the land on the planet,
3949000	3951000	but there's the land in orbit
3951000	3954000	because you actually will fire some things into orbit
3954000	3956000	because you have to, let's say you have to clear
3956000	3959000	what they call miasma, or just poison.
3959000	3961000	You might have to clear poison from squares,
3961000	3965000	although miasma may not really be poison
3965000	3968000	depending on how you kind of take the approach to the game.
3968000	3970000	I'll just kind of leave it at that.
3970000	3973000	Something else, the alien race.
3973000	3974000	The first time I played the game, I went,
3974000	3977000	oh, these aliens are like barbarians in civilization.
3977000	3979000	Kill them all, kill them all, kill them all.
3979000	3981000	But as you start to play through the game the first time,
3981000	3984000	you start to realize there's a path you can go down
3984000	3986000	where you can coexist with the aliens
3986000	3989000	instead of necessarily blowing them away.
3989000	3991000	So it was kind of one of those very interesting
3991000	3993000	kind of self-check sort of things
3993000	3997000	where my instinct was to just immediately kill the aliens
3997000	3999000	because that is what civilization has taught me,
3999000	4000000	is kill the intruders,
4000000	4002000	but that may not necessarily always be the case.
4003000	4006000	The technology system is completely different,
4006000	4008000	and there's this whole new system in there,
4008000	4010000	and I apologize, I don't have a guide
4010000	4013000	that tells me what everything is officially called in the game,
4013000	4016000	but there's some type of system that involves harmony
4016000	4020000	and purity and these different types of
4020000	4024000	how do you want your civilization to coexist on the planet,
4024000	4027000	and that really drives the victory conditions for the game,
4027000	4030000	which will also throw you for a loop if you're a Sith player
4030000	4033000	because the victory conditions are not what you're used to before.
4033000	4035000	You can still win through military dominance,
4035000	4037000	but everything else has changed.
4037000	4041000	So that took me a little bit to get used to at first.
4041000	4044000	So yeah, I think there's enough in this game
4044000	4047000	that differentiates it from Civ V.
4047000	4050000	Not everybody's going to like that differentiation,
4050000	4054000	but I think it makes for an interesting and different experience
4054000	4056000	that I think is worth the money.
4056000	4058000	I don't know if necessarily the game
4058000	4060000	is going to end up being superior to Civ V,
4060000	4064000	but it's a really great holdover at least until Civ VI,
4064000	4066000	if you're a Civilization fan.
4066000	4069000	Come on, we all know Civ VI is going to happen at some point.
4069000	4071000	It's just a matter of time, right?
4071000	4076000	Let's see, also in my gaming week, one other thing to mention.
4076000	4080000	Bayonetta 2 came out for the Wii U on Friday, and I did pick that up.
4080000	4082000	Haven't got to play a whole lot.
4082000	4084000	I only really played through the prologue
4084000	4086000	and then the first chapter and a little bit of the second chapter,
4086000	4088000	so I can't really speak at length about the game,
4088000	4093000	but it was all the excess and over-the-top,
4093000	4097000	even in just the first opening scenes in New York City at Christmas time,
4097000	4102000	just such excess over-the-top hilarity
4102000	4105000	that I loved in the original Bayonetta game,
4105000	4107000	and I'm having a great time with it.
4107000	4110000	If you're not very good at action games like me,
4110000	4112000	they've totally dumbed down a mode
4112000	4114000	where basically they'll just do the combos for you.
4114000	4116000	You can literally just button mash your way through Bayonetta,
4116000	4118000	but if you don't want to do that, there's more intense skill levels too.
4118000	4120000	I think they have the one button mode, wasn't that in the first game?
4120000	4122000	They did. Yeah, first climate.
4122000	4124000	I believe that was in the first game.
4124000	4126000	I don't think I played it that way
4126000	4128000	because I think somebody else had introduced me to it.
4128000	4131000	I actually read there was some disabled gamers or something
4131000	4133000	that were saying, like, that's fantastic
4133000	4136000	because now I can play this game without having to, you know...
4136000	4138000	That is very cool. That's very cool.
4138000	4140000	And there's a whole touchscreen control thing too.
4140000	4143000	I haven't really played at that with any extent.
4143000	4146000	Again, I haven't got to spend a lot of time with the game,
4146000	4149000	but I know that is there as well if that's something people want to do.
4149000	4154000	So I realize there's a lot of people really pissed off.
4154000	4158000	The Bayonetta 2 did not come out for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One,
4158000	4160000	that it is a Wii U exclusive,
4160000	4162000	but this is the type of Wii U exclusive
4162000	4165000	that Nintendo really needed in their back pockets.
4165000	4167000	So suck it up.
4167000	4170000	This is what video game competition is about.
4170000	4173000	And this is going to make the Wii U...
4173000	4175000	And I think somebody had asked earlier in chat,
4175000	4177000	is this a Game of the Year contender?
4177000	4179000	It's a little early for me to say personally,
4179000	4181000	but the vibe I'm getting out there on Twitter
4181000	4183000	and the other reviews and so forth
4183000	4185000	is it very well may be,
4185000	4188000	which, you know, the Wii U may not have a lot of games on it,
4188000	4192000	but it sure produces a lot of very highly reviewed games.
4192000	4195000	So definitely something worth looking into.
4195000	4198000	All right. That was it for my gaming week.
4198000	4200000	Some housekeeping we have here coming up.
4200000	4204000	So, of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,
4204000	4207000	and we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio,
4207000	4210000	Google+, google.com slash plus orange launch radio,
4210000	4213000	and on YouTube as well, youtube.com slash orange launch radio.
4213000	4216000	Follow us on all those fantastic websites.
4216000	4218000	Some housekeeping.
4218000	4221000	Even though I was gone just this last weekend,
4221000	4222000	guess what, guys, I'm really sorry,
4222000	4227000	but I'm going to be at another convention November 9th, 10th.
4227000	4229000	I don't remember what the show day is in there,
4229000	4231000	but it's the second week of November.
4231000	4233000	It's basically in two weeks,
4233000	4236000	so unfortunately there will be no live show that night,
4236000	4239000	but good news for podcast listeners,
4239000	4242000	really pushing for us to tape something in advance that week
4242000	4246000	so you at least won't have to go the entire week with no o-l-r again.
4246000	4247000	That's just the way things worked out.
4247000	4249000	I'm going to BlizzCon and Final Fantasy Fan Fest,
4249000	4251000	but that'll be it.
4251000	4254000	No more conventions for me for the year after that,
4254000	4256000	so it just happens that they're all kind of back to back.
4256000	4258000	I will say this, though.
4258000	4263000	I gave really deep thought to that PlayStation convention that's happening in Vegas.
4263000	4264000	You heard about that, right?
4264000	4266000	That was all announced while we were out.
4266000	4267000	Did you hear about this?
4267000	4269000	The PlayStation convention that they're going to do in Vegas?
4269000	4271000	Yeah, so Sony's putting on their own event in Vegas,
4271000	4275000	and I really wanted to go.
4275000	4277000	I just don't think I'm going to be able to make it work financially
4277000	4279000	and with the time away from my day job
4279000	4281000	because I'm doing so much this past month.
4281000	4283000	I wish I'd had more time.
4283000	4285000	I wish they gave more notice so I could have prepared more.
4285000	4289000	I hope those of you guys that do go have a fantastic time, however.
4289000	4290000	All right.
4290000	4293000	Speaking of PlayStation, I think we're going to start off the news tonight
4293000	4296000	with some PS news, right, Loki?
4296000	4298000	Yes.
4298000	4300000	So this is pretty cool.
4300000	4303000	I just got a system, and now they're going to be rolling out that 2.0 update
4303000	4305000	that's going to add a bunch of cool stuff,
4305000	4310000	including that SharePlay, which was the thing that they were talking about
4310000	4312000	originally when they debuted the PlayStation 4,
4312000	4315000	where basically you can connect up with somebody else
4315000	4318000	and do several different things,
4318000	4323000	including either playing a couch co-op game with them over the Internet,
4323000	4325000	which is pretty awesome,
4325000	4328000	or you can literally what they call pass the controller,
4328000	4332000	so you can have someone play one of your games that they don't even own
4332000	4336000	and they don't even need a copy of over the Internet.
4336000	4338000	And so that's going to be pretty cool.
4338000	4341000	It's coming out on Tuesday, October 28th.
4341000	4346000	Along with that, they're going to be also doing the ability to play music
4346000	4350000	from USB drives connected to the console
4350000	4355000	and trying to see what other features that they have in there.
4355000	4362000	I'm sure a whole bunch of other stuff, a dedicated YouTube app as well.
4362000	4366000	So, yeah, a few more days and we'll have this.
4366000	4368000	I am very much looking forward to this.
4368000	4370000	I think that SharePlay sounds awesome.
4370000	4373000	I know they announced this when the PlayStation 4 was first unveiled
4373000	4376000	and they got a lot of shit for not having it out until now.
4376000	4380000	I kind of wasn't even expecting it to get out this soon.
4380000	4382000	And now that I kind of hear about it,
4382000	4385000	if it really works as well as it seems to,
4385000	4388000	that's going to be a game changer, pun intended.
4388000	4393000	That's going to be a really interesting way to try out new games
4393000	4395000	with your friends online.
4395000	4399000	It's almost like what Microsoft was talking about with the Xbox One,
4399000	4402000	how they wanted to have that library that you could share with friends
4402000	4404000	and stuff like that.
4404000	4408000	It's almost like kind of how they're implementing it there.
4408000	4413000	I'd be interested to see if that's something that they end up doing
4413000	4418000	on the Xbox One later on down the road, calling it something else
4418000	4423000	and just kind of piggybacking on the idea, I guess, if it works out.
4423000	4425000	Yeah.
4425000	4429000	Also, very curious, just as somebody who does a lot of the broadcasting things,
4429000	4431000	as I know many of you do,
4431000	4433000	I'm very curious to see what these enhancements to the Twitch
4433000	4436000	and the YouTube integration and all that entails.
4436000	4438000	So that's going to be really cool.
4438000	4441000	I like the fact that we will be able to directly put things on YouTube now
4441000	4445000	instead of me having to copy what I do in ShareFactory to my drive
4445000	4448000	and then taking it over to the computer and doing that whole thing.
4448000	4450000	So that's going to be neat.
4450000	4453000	I wonder if they're going to enable YouTube live streaming
4453000	4455000	because I know that they have that.
4455000	4457000	That is a thing, huh?
4457000	4459000	I keep forgetting that YouTube does have live streaming,
4459000	4462000	but it's the same thing as Google Hangouts pretty much, isn't it?
4462000	4464000	Sort of. I don't know.
4464000	4469000	The only other show that I watch on a weekly basis, Cooking with Unity,
4469000	4471000	they do their shows live,
4471000	4475000	and so they broadcast them live on YouTube
4475000	4480000	and then they have the archive up literally minutes later.
4481000	4483000	It would be cool to see something like that
4483000	4485000	just because I don't know.
4485000	4489000	I don't really use Twitch, but I guess I will.
4489000	4491000	I had a Justin TV account,
4491000	4494000	so I hope that got transitioned over at some point.
4494000	4495000	I'm sure it did.
4495000	4497000	If you were marked as a games channel, then it did.
4497000	4499000	If you didn't, then it didn't.
4499000	4503000	I think I've created a secondary one if I did.
4503000	4506000	I don't ever use it, so whatever.
4507000	4510000	Moving on to some other news.
4510000	4513000	Some big news that came out this week in the Wii U world.
4513000	4519000	One of the other big games this holiday season besides Bayonetta 2 is Smash Bros. Wii U.
4519000	4524000	Until now, I feel like we've been given the impression
4524000	4526000	that there wasn't going to be a lot of differences
4526000	4530000	between the 3DS and the Wii U versions, which makes sense.
4530000	4533000	They want to sell a lot of copies of the 3DS version,
4533000	4537000	but then they announced this Nintendo Direct with 50 things
4537000	4539000	that will be unique to the Wii U version.
4539000	4543000	And I've got to say, the cynic in me was like,
4543000	4546000	oh, it will be eight new colors for these new characters,
4546000	4548000	and those will be the 50 things, right?
4548000	4550000	But then the thing happened, and it was like, wow,
4550000	4554000	there is a lot of new stuff that just kind of made the 3DS version
4554000	4557000	really feel like a demo in some ways.
4557000	4559000	I know the 3DS version has its supporters.
4559000	4561000	We got into this conversation a few weeks ago.
4561000	4563000	Portability has its perks,
4563000	4566000	and there's only so much you can put in that 3DS system, right?
4566000	4570000	So for the 3DS, it's still a heck of a value.
4570000	4573000	It would be kind of weird to see what they could pull off
4573000	4576000	on a Vita or something with that same game,
4576000	4579000	being that it has a little bit more processing muscles.
4579000	4580000	Right, yeah.
4580000	4584000	So here's some of the new stuff that's coming to the Wii U version.
4584000	4586000	First off, the big one that had everybody talking,
4586000	4588000	eight player battles.
4588000	4591000	Eight people all playing each other.
4591000	4593000	That is going to be crazy.
4593000	4595000	But is that locally?
4595000	4598000	I believe it is locally and across.
4598000	4600000	I don't want to misrepresent that, though.
4600000	4602000	Hold on, I have a little story on this here.
4602000	4604000	If it's over the internet, that might be pretty cool.
4604000	4607000	Locally, it's one of those things like I never have eight people over.
4607000	4612000	Well, it would also explain why the 3DSes can be used as controllers.
4612000	4614000	That's how you can get more people in there.
4614000	4617000	Players can use as many as eight Nintendo 3DSes
4617000	4620000	or eight GameCube controllers, but there are some restrictions.
4620000	4624000	Only seven Wii remotes or Wii U Pro controllers can be used simultaneously,
4624000	4629000	and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U only supports a single tablet gamepad.
4629000	4631000	So that's how that will work.
4631000	4635000	And nothing in the face of the earth supports two tablet gamepads.
4635000	4638000	By the way, eight player battles have their own stages
4638000	4640000	that will support eight people because those are going to be,
4640000	4644000	as you can imagine, quite a mess with all those people in them.
4644000	4647000	There's going to be a new board game mode called Smash Tour.
4647000	4649000	There's going to be a ton of trophies.
4649000	4652000	Masterpieces mode returns from Brawl,
4652000	4656000	which is basically demos of all the virtual console games that everybody was in.
4656000	4657000	You know, something.
4657000	4661000	The Stage Builder returns, which you might have forgot was in Brawl.
4661000	4663000	I remember that. I made a stage.
4663000	4666000	But you can now build your own stages in this game as well.
4666000	4670000	And if you have both of the 3DS and the Wii U version,
4670000	4674000	you can get a 2-disc soundtrack if you register them both on Club Nintendo.
4674000	4678000	And DLC character, a new challenger approaches,
4678000	4682000	Mewtwo, going to be added to the game in spring of 2015.
4682000	4686000	They weren't able to show him in combat, but they announced that he would come.
4686000	4691000	Still, this opens the door to, well, if they're going to do that one as DLC,
4691000	4693000	there's going to be more.
4693000	4695000	So, who knows?
4695000	4699000	Hey, your favorite characters that didn't show up in this one.
4699000	4703000	All those pressed Lucas fans and Ice Climbers fans,
4703000	4706000	all the characters that got cut might end up getting something after all.
4706000	4707000	And who knows?
4707000	4709000	I mean, maybe the people that are saying,
4709000	4712000	oh, God, I'd love to see Bayonetta in the game.
4712000	4714000	Anything's possible at this point, right?
4714000	4719000	So, DLC characters are going to be a thing.
4719000	4721000	So, that's pretty cool.
4723000	4726000	I mean, I was already going to buy it anyway,
4726000	4729000	assuming it was just kind of a clone of the 3DS version,
4729000	4733000	but it would be on my TV and in HD, and I'd be able to see it.
4733000	4735000	But then, after seeing this direct,
4735000	4738000	I was just rubbing my credit card on the screen.
4738000	4740000	It's not doing anything type of thing.
4740000	4742000	So, I'm very excited about this.
4742000	4744000	Very, very excited about this. Low-key.
4744000	4745000	Yeah.
4746000	4750000	So, I don't know. I'm hoping that they do something.
4752000	4753000	Maybe it'll bring back Snake.
4753000	4755000	Everyone's hoping for Snake to come back,
4755000	4758000	even though there's no Metal Gear games on the Wii U,
4758000	4761000	and right now it doesn't look like there's going to be.
4763000	4766000	And I don't think they're going to be bringing back any of the assassins,
4766000	4768000	since Ubisoft is actually going to be...
4768000	4770000	Hey, Rayman would be a good character.
4770000	4772000	Speaking of Ubisoft here.
4772000	4777000	Jade Raymond has actually decided to leave the company.
4777000	4783000	Now, she was attached to a lot of really big franchises at Ubisoft,
4783000	4786000	including, she started off with the Assassin's Creed series,
4786000	4790000	and then, of course, Splinter Cell and Watch Dogs, that kind of stuff.
4790000	4793000	Well, now, after 10 years being at the company,
4793000	4797000	she's decided to part ways,
4797000	4802000	and kind of, I guess, leading, going on a different path.
4802000	4804000	I don't know what exactly.
4804000	4807000	Maybe, maybe she is going the whole indie route,
4807000	4810000	because it seems to be that's where all these people are going
4810000	4812000	after they depart these companies for a long time.
4812000	4814000	It's like, oh, hey, I want to work on this.
4814000	4816000	Very well could be.
4816000	4819000	Let me ask the question that I'm sure some cynics are asking,
4819000	4822000	and I kind of don't believe this to be true,
4822000	4824000	but I'm going to say it anyway.
4824000	4827000	Could this be related to the foot-in-mouth Assassin's Creed comment
4827000	4830000	about it's too hard to render female characters?
4830000	4833000	I don't think so, because I don't think she was working on that one.
4833000	4835000	I don't think she was part of...
4835000	4837000	Because she started on the first Assassin's Creed game,
4837000	4839000	but I don't think she was on the latest one.
4839000	4841000	Yeah, I don't think...
4841000	4843000	Let's be honest.
4843000	4845000	But you know people are saying that on Twitter,
4845000	4847000	so I just had to bring it up.
4847000	4849000	It's okay.
4849000	4854000	Obviously, it's not harder to render those characters.
4854000	4860000	It's just extra work to create new characters or something.
4860000	4862000	It's just something that they've got to do.
4862000	4864000	They're cutting corners on a lot of these things.
4864000	4866000	I don't know, whatever.
4866000	4868000	Just take it as it is.
4868000	4871000	They don't want to put a female character in their game.
4871000	4873000	That's it. Done. Whatever.
4873000	4876000	Not every single game on the face of the earth
4876000	4879000	has to have a female character that's playable in the game.
4879000	4881000	Same with male characters.
4881000	4884000	Not every single game out there has to have a male character playable in the game.
4884000	4888000	Where's my male Samus in Metroid?
4888000	4890000	It doesn't matter.
4890000	4892000	Whatever the game that they want to make has this character,
4892000	4895000	and it doesn't have to be fucking equal across the board.
4895000	4897000	I think what was problematic about that whole thing
4897000	4899000	was more the way they answered it.
4899000	4901000	They should have just said,
4901000	4906000	this particular story is going to be a male narrative,
4906000	4909000	and we didn't render other characters for the co-op mode.
4909000	4911000	They did not want to admit that they didn't want to render
4911000	4913000	all these other characters for the co-op mode.
4913000	4915000	That's really what it came down to.
4915000	4917000	But anyway, that's a months-old debate.
4917000	4919000	It's pointless at this point.
4919000	4921000	It's stupid. I mean, come on.
4921000	4923000	It's dumb.
4923000	4925000	Whatever. It is what it is.
4925000	4928000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
4928000	4930000	of some games that are coming out very soon,
4930000	4934000	of which, ironically, isn't the new Assassin's Creed on deck for the US this week?
4934000	4936000	I could be wrong. It's really soon.
4936000	4939000	You would have been right if they hadn't moved the dates.
4939000	4941000	Oh, I didn't realize they moved it.
4941000	4943000	Yeah, because they wanted to put it out at the same time
4943000	4945000	as the Assassin's Creed Rogue game,
4945000	4950000	which is coming out later in November on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4950000	4954000	But since it's not coming out right then,
4954000	4957000	they just didn't do it.
4957000	4959000	But anyways, so this week,
4959000	4963000	a game that I probably would have picked up had I bought an Xbox One.
4963000	4966000	But Sunset Overdrive coming out on Xbox One,
4966000	4969000	one of the best-looking games, I think, out of E3 this year.
4969000	4973000	So that's something to look forward to picking up this week.
4973000	4979000	And hopefully, hopefully, they go the route like they did with Rise and Dead Rising,
4979000	4983000	Sure, it's exclusive to the Xbox One, but we're going to see a PC version sometime.
4983000	4988000	Lords of the Fallen on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
4988000	4994000	We've got Disney's Big Hero 6 on 3DS and Nintendo DS.
4994000	4997000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
4997000	5000000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
5000000	5003000	No, this is almost the same title as the movie,
5003000	5006000	but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Danger of the Ooze.
5006000	5012000	It's a new game coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and I think the 3DS.
5012000	5016000	Freedom Wars from Sony coming out on the Vita.
5016000	5022000	Probably was going to be the last Vita game that they're going to put out from Sony there.
5022000	5025000	Assassin's Creed The Americas Collection,
5025000	5031000	which is a re-release of Assassin's Creed 4 and Assassin's Creed 3.
5031000	5033000	The Murica Collection.
5033000	5037000	Murica and then Liberation as well.
5037000	5040000	So that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5040000	5042000	Yeah, no Wii U, sorry.
5042000	5046000	MX vs ATV Supercross on PS3 and 360.
5046000	5051000	And let's see, WWE 2K15 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
5051000	5056000	And I want to say it's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, although maybe that was delayed.
5056000	5058000	I think that was delayed.
5058000	5061000	And then, also delayed.
5061000	5065000	NBA Live 15 coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5065000	5067000	Hopefully this year doesn't suck.
5067000	5070000	And Power Rangers Super Megaforce.
5070000	5073000	They're just making up names now and that's on 3DS.
5073000	5077000	And The Legend of Korra, a new era begins on 3DS
5077000	5080000	because that was the only game that actually got a physical release.
5080000	5083000	All the other ones were on digitally.
5083000	5084000	That's it.
5084000	5088000	Alright, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases there on the PlayStation 4 this week.
5088000	5091000	Metro Redo is on the PlayStation 4.
5091000	5094000	And Oni Chambara, Z2 Chaos.
5094000	5097000	Hey, there's something you can import for the PS4, Loki.
5097000	5104000	You better believe it that I am importing Earth Defense 4 or whatever the hell they're calling the new one on PlayStation 4.
5104000	5105000	Of course.
5105000	5108000	On the Xbox One in Japan this week, Metro Redo is there as well.
5108000	5110000	And Sunset Overdrive, day one edition.
5110000	5113000	It also sees its Japanese release this coming week.
5113000	5117000	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel makes its way to Japan.
5117000	5120000	We got it first here in the States, but Japan's getting it this coming week.
5120000	5124000	That is also happening on the Xbox 360 for all those Japanese 360 owners.
5124000	5128000	On the Wii U, sadly nothing to report.
5128000	5131000	The next big release over there is on November the 13th.
5131000	5134000	So things are a little dry there on the Wii U front.
5134000	5142000	But on the 3DS, there's Illuminage Ibun Ame no Mi Hashira Kai comes out this week from Starfish.
5142000	5145000	This game is... I'm trying to figure out what this is.
5145000	5146000	There's no screenshots or nothing.
5146000	5151000	It just looks like anime characters holding swords and a cute little like cat avatar character.
5151000	5155000	So maybe somebody in chat knows a little more about this than I do.
5155000	5159000	But there's no screenshots or anything for me to tell you what that game's all about.
5159000	5161000	So let's travel over to Europe.
5161000	5163000	Dark Soccer's not here tonight, but I am.
5163000	5166000	So I will tell you about what is coming out in Europe.
5166000	5177000	And on the 28th, we have MX vs ATV Supercross on PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Mac.
5177000	5181000	I believe I saw this one at E3.
5181000	5185000	And it was like a little racing game, but of course it uses the motorcycles.
5185000	5190000	It kind of felt like what Iron Man's super off-road might look like in motorcycles in 3D.
5190000	5192000	That's kind of what it looked like to me.
5192000	5193000	Which one?
5193000	5194000	You remember Iron Man?
5194000	5195000	MX vs ATV Supercross.
5195000	5196000	What was it?
5196000	5197000	MX vs ATV Supercross.
5197000	5199000	There's other games in this series that are out there.
5199000	5203000	Yeah, this is the first one that I think they've put out since Nordic took them over.
5203000	5204000	Because it used to be THQ.
5204000	5205000	Correct.
5205000	5206000	It is.
5206000	5207000	It is.
5207000	5209000	On the 29th, you have Freedom Wars on the Vita.
5209000	5213000	And The Unfinished Swan gets its PlayStation 4 and Vita release.
5213000	5217000	And then on the 30th of October, Farming Simulator 15 on the PC.
5217000	5219000	I know we got Farming Simulator fans out there.
5219000	5221000	If you want it on consoles, it's coming out in January.
5221000	5225000	Did you know I took a picture of something Farming Simulator.
5225000	5227000	They had a cute mascot or something at E3.
5227000	5230000	And they got some Twitter rando that was like, tell me more, tell me more.
5230000	5233000	I was like, dang, Farming Simulator has some hardcore fans out there.
5233000	5234000	They seriously do.
5234000	5238000	And I think their first version is going to be on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5238000	5240000	Or maybe just PlayStation 4.
5240000	5242000	That's coming out in January.
5242000	5246000	Do not confuse it with Farmville or they will kick your ass.
5246000	5249000	Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition on PC and Mac.
5249000	5254000	And on Halloween or the 31st of October in Europe, Sunset Overdrive.
5254000	5257000	Walking Dead Season 1 for Xbox One.
5257000	5259000	Walking Dead Game of the Year Edition for PlayStation 4.
5259000	5261000	Walking Dead Season 2 for PlayStation 4.
5261000	5263000	Walking Dead Season 2 for Xbox One.
5263000	5268000	And WWE 2K15, PS3, and Xbox 360.
5268000	5272000	Yeah, I'm pretty sure the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were delayed to November 9th, I think of it.
5272000	5273000	Yeah.
5273000	5276000	That was one of the things that happened while I was still working at my old company.
5276000	5277000	Ah, gotcha.
5277000	5280000	Did you start the new job already, by the way? Are you still on your break?
5280000	5284000	No, I was an alternate for the first class and because it's such a good company, everybody showed up.
5284000	5287000	But hey, I got paid for two hours even though I was there for only like five minutes.
5287000	5288000	So it's all good.
5288000	5289000	Dope.
5289000	5290000	I do start officially on the 5th.
5290000	5291000	There you go. Alright.
5291000	5293000	I'm not an alternate this time. First in line.
5293000	5294000	Awesome.
5294000	5295000	Yeah.
5295000	5297000	Alright, let's go to a few more news stories.
5297000	5302000	And then the classic game of the week, which, you know, when Dark Soccer is not here, we take it over.
5302000	5305000	And it was Loki's turn this week, pick classic game of the week.
5305000	5308000	So Loki's gonna pick one in just a minute here. But first, some news.
5308000	5313000	This should be just filed under, like, you gotta be fucking stupid to do this in the first place.
5313000	5316000	But you did it, so suffer the consequences.
5316000	5325000	But apparently, a guy, Mike Malbeck, who is an indie developer who, part of an indie development team, I guess.
5325000	5328000	They created a game called Paranautical Activity.
5329000	5335000	It was a Steam game, like a first-person shooter voxel-looking retro-styled game or something.
5335000	5342000	And he had some issues where, I guess, they were doing, like, a sale or something to that effect.
5342000	5347000	And it was listing the game as early access, even though it wasn't an early access game.
5347000	5351000	It was early access at one point, but now it's like the full version of the game.
5351000	5356000	And he got really miffed that he couldn't, you know, change that.
5357000	5363000	And so he did what any sane, logical person would do. He went to Twitter and said,
5363000	5366000	I'm gonna go kill Gabe Newell. He is gonna die.
5366000	5370000	And apparently, you know, people don't like that sort of thing.
5370000	5378000	So Valve pulled the game off of, you know, the sale, and they, you know, ceased their relationship with the developer.
5378000	5384000	Good. What a fucking idiot. Sorry, not sorry. What a fucking idiot.
5384000	5390000	They're like, yeah, we don't really want to do business with people that make death threats, so sorry, you know.
5390000	5399000	And of course, you know, later on, you know, the Mike Malmak guy, he's basically leaving the developer code avarice,
5399000	5406000	and he sold his half of the company, and he won't be making any money from it, distancing himself as far away from it as he can.
5406000	5413000	But you gotta be fucking stupid. Like, seriously, just, I understand you're frustrated,
5413000	5418000	but, you know, if you're gonna say, oh, I'm gonna fucking kill those guys at Valve, you know,
5418000	5423000	do it in, like, not a public forum if you're gonna make those kind of things.
5423000	5427000	Like, say it to yourself and shake your fist at the sky or something, but just, like, don't, like...
5427000	5432000	Especially with the state of gaming and social media the past couple months.
5432000	5435000	And y'all know what I'm talking about. I don't have to get into it, alright?
5435000	5440000	But especially with how volatile everything has been. We've been in, like, code orange, right?
5440000	5445000	Okay, if, like, gaming had an alert system, we'd be in, like, code orange right now.
5445000	5448000	Especially as how volatile everything has been in the industry.
5448000	5455000	Like, haven't we learned yet that making death threats is not okay ever?
5455000	5463000	And for, like, somebody who develops games to be doing that is just, like, get out of the pool. You out.
5463000	5468000	And you do realize that Gabe Newell isn't the only person that works at Valve that's, you know,
5468000	5472000	he's not behind a computer, he's, like, setting up your fucking game and shit, you know, for the sales.
5472000	5474000	It's not this one dude in, like...
5474000	5482000	Even if you knew the guy that did it or gal that did it, still not okay. I want to make that perfectly clear.
5482000	5488000	But, yeah, I mean, everybody at Valve does everything, though. Nobody has a title at Valve, right?
5488000	5489000	Except for Gabe.
5489000	5496000	Whatever. But, yeah, so, Gabe pulled off there, but, you know, of course, he's just like,
5496000	5501000	eh, it's no big deal. It's, you know, we sold 12 copies off of Steam, so we're gonna be okay. Whatever.
5501000	5510000	But, yeah, it's just a lesson in common sense, you know, as if we even need to tell you, just don't make death threats.
5510000	5518000	Tigerclaw in chat says, these people have to understand that Twitter isn't a place to be venting out frustrations over something because it will cost you your job.
5518000	5525000	This is true in a lot of different facets, and just, you know, with social media becoming more and more a part of culture,
5525000	5533000	I'm just telling you, in general, this even goes beyond video games. Like, if you are really fucking pissed off about something, anything,
5533000	5537000	if you are really, really mad about something, put your goddamn phone down.
5537000	5544000	Put it down, put it away, get it far away from you so that you are not tempted to write something stupid.
5544000	5552000	And I'm not even just talking about, like, death threats, but just, like, you know, stupid shit, complaining about, you know, complaining about where you work,
5552000	5560000	where you have a public Twitter, where your company may be big enough where they have, like, social media people that search Twitter for the name.
5560000	5566000	I mean, like, that kind of shit can get you in so much trouble. It's, like, just a life lesson here.
5566000	5574000	When you are pissed off, get away from your computer ASAP, whether it's gaming or anything.
5575000	5585000	So, now, of course, you know, if you can do it in a reasonable manner, you know, because sometimes you can complain to companies, like, you know, tweet at Taco Bell,
5585000	5590000	that quesarito really sucked, you know, or something like that. That's a little bit different.
5590000	5593000	That quesarito makes me want to die, really.
5593000	5600000	True story, I had a quesarito today for the first time. I got through two bites before I was like, this is fucking disgusting.
5601000	5602000	Anyway.
5602000	5609000	Quesarito in the potty, I don't know. I can't make a pun joke with that.
5609000	5618000	Our pal Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying, there was so, so much I wanted to say this morning on something not vog-related, and I had to put the phone down.
5618000	5627000	Jason in chat says, super good advice, spread happy, not vitriol. See, I'll suggest always keep accounts set to private.
5627000	5631000	You know, I kind of feel like, though, that might not always be an option.
5631000	5637000	You know, like, I feel like I have more to gain from a public account because I have these public-facing things that I do,
5637000	5646000	but I do try really hard to keep my work life or my OLR podcasting life or whatever separate from, you know, the rest of my life.
5646000	5650000	But Bobby, don't you know they cast the shows differently in London than they do over here?
5650000	5656000	I mean, after all, there is the UK office and the US office, right?
5656000	5659000	Sorry, I feel free, man. That's terrible.
5659000	5673000	Alright. Anyway, let's move on. Talking about 3D Realms. 3D Realms is, of course, a classic PC publisher,
5673000	5680000	and, you know, so many great games from back in the day, like Duke Nukem, of course, back when Duke Nukem was a side scroller.
5680000	5681000	Hell yeah.
5681000	5683000	Commander Keen, also amazing.
5683000	5685000	When am I getting my next Commander Keen game?
5685000	5693000	I don't know. Well, maybe if they sell enough copies of this because the 3D Realms Anthology is now available at 3drealms.com,
5693000	5700000	and it's a collection that has games like Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Commander Keen, Goodbye Galaxy, Wolfenstein 3D,
5700000	5707000	Rise of the Triad, Dark War, and all these other classic games. It's in a DRM-free package.
5707000	5712000	Where's my Redneck Rampage? Didn't they do that one? I thought that was in the Duke Nukem 3D engine.
5713000	5719000	I will look here, but there are some games available for free, so if you want to check out Alien Carnage,
5719000	5723000	Major Striker, and Stargunner, I mean, come on, they're not going to give away Commander Keen for free,
5723000	5730000	but these other games, you can get those for free. Now, the article I'm reading says that the pack is $19.99,
5730000	5734000	but actually, looking on the site, it's $39.99, so I'm not sure if it was, like, on sale for a couple days,
5734000	5740000	and then they raised the price back up, but it's $39.99 for the Anthology, so you can check that out.
5740000	5745000	But, I mean, that's a lot of classic games available there, so...
5745000	5750000	Now, just so you know, 3D Realms, the staff has been gone since 2008, because remember, like,
5750000	5756000	Gearbox had to pick up Duke Nukem and all that, right? Duke Nukem and the other PC franchises,
5756000	5763000	they did retain the rights to this. Developer Interceptor Entertainment, who made Rise of the Triad,
5763000	5768000	acquired Apogee Software earlier this year, so now they control the associated IP and branding.
5768000	5772000	It's complicated. Who owns all that stuff? That's why there isn't a new King game.
5772000	5776000	The next time, another Duke Nukem game, because I'm still going to forget who owns what.
5776000	5783000	And Dungeon Buster in chat says Redneck Rampage was pubbed by Interplay, so it was a little bit different arrangement there.
5783000	5786000	So, again, makes things complicated.
5786000	5791000	Damn it. Redneck Rampage would be perfect for a remake.
5791000	5792000	Yeah.
5792000	5795000	Let somebody get Devolver Digital on that.
5796000	5802000	Alright, well, let's take a walk down memory lane here in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
5804000	5811000	And, as you know, Dark Soccer will usually step into the vault and pick out a game that she thinks is worthy of being a classic,
5811000	5814000	and, hey, you guys should be playing this game this week.
5814000	5819000	So, the rules to be a Classic Game of the Week is that the game has to be ten years old or more.
5819000	5822000	That is what we call a classic game.
5822000	5827000	Dark Soccer, of course, is not here tonight, so I think I filled in for her the past two or three times,
5827000	5830000	so I was like, you know what, Loki, it's well past your turn.
5830000	5835000	Loki tonight is going to pick the Classic Game of the Week with Dark Soccer moving this week.
5835000	5838000	So, Loki, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5838000	5843000	The Classic Game of the Week just turned ten years old today.
5844000	5845000	Ten years old today.
5845000	5850000	Today. Today is the tenth anniversary of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
5851000	5858000	One of the best PlayStation 2, Xbox, 3D action games ever.
5858000	5862000	It was seriously the best Grand Theft Auto game up until 4 and 5,
5862000	5866000	and had one of the largest maps in the whole game.
5866000	5871000	Basically, it came out October 26, 2004 on PlayStation 2,
5871000	5879000	later in June the following year on Xbox and PC.
5880000	5886000	Ironically enough, they actually re-released it today on Xbox 360 in the HD version,
5886000	5892000	which you can pick up for the price of the games on demand version, which is only like $3.74.
5892000	5895000	It's ridiculously cheap, so go check that out.
5895000	5901000	But the game followed around kind of an ex-gang banger, CJ.
5901000	5907000	He comes home after his mom's been murdered back to Los Santos,
5907000	5910000	which is kind of the modern day LA.
5910000	5913000	And the whole game is set in the 90s, which is cool.
5913000	5916000	It had one of the greatest soundtracks ever.
5917000	5924000	But anyways, he comes back and finds the gang's kind of torn apart,
5924000	5930000	and he has to regroup his gang and fight against cops,
5930000	5934000	and find out who actually murdered his mother and stuff like that.
5934000	5941000	What's kind of cool is the game takes place not only in the fictional state of San Andreas,
5941000	5943000	which is like California and Nevada,
5943000	5947000	and takes place in Los Santos, which is kind of LA,
5947000	5949000	San Fierro, which is San Francisco-ish,
5949000	5952000	and Las Venturas, which is kind of like Las Vegas.
5952000	5957000	So it was the first time it was like a multi-city game, which is pretty awesome.
5957000	5961000	It was one of the best-selling games of...
5961000	5964000	It became one of the best-selling games on PlayStation 2.
5964000	5966000	27 million copies.
5968000	5972000	It's still one of the best-selling games of all time.
5973000	5977000	Oh, it is the best-selling game of all time on PlayStation 2, so that's pretty awesome.
5979000	5984000	Of course, one of the things that made the game infamous was the fact that
5984000	5990000	there was some content that was taken out of the game that later modders found,
5990000	5993000	which kind of brought this whole controversy with the ESRB,
5993000	5996000	known as the Hot Coffee mod,
5996000	5999000	where it's a hidden sex game that they're going to have in the game,
5999000	6002000	since you can date a bunch of people in the actual game.
6002000	6005000	You can make girlfriends and stuff like that.
6005000	6010000	It was also the first Grand Theft Auto game that featured co-op,
6010000	6013000	and not a lot of people realized this,
6013000	6016000	but you can actually, if you date those girlfriends,
6016000	6022000	you can go out and have a person with you playing on the second controller,
6022000	6025000	and you can go shoot up stuff in Grand Theft Auto.
6025000	6027000	It was awesome.
6030000	6033000	It's been released on a bunch of different platforms,
6033000	6039000	aside from the original release on PlayStation 2 and on the original Xbox.
6039000	6043000	It's been released on Mac, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network.
6043000	6049000	They also did some of these HD versions on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Kindle,
6049000	6051000	that kind of stuff.
6051000	6059000	And they said, of course, they just took down the original game off the Xbox Live Store,
6059000	6062000	and they were saying that they're going to re-release an enhanced version
6062000	6064000	to celebrate the 10th anniversary.
6064000	6068000	Well, that was released today, so pretty awesome.
6068000	6071000	Do you know what is mind-fucking me right now?
6071000	6074000	Because we talk about this game turned 10 years old today, right?
6074000	6077000	And this game was highly controversial because of the hot coffee mod.
6077000	6079000	Okay, get this.
6079000	6083000	Episode 28 of the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition,
6083000	6085000	back when it was a separate thing,
6085000	6088000	taped July 11th, 2005.
6088000	6093000	One of our top stories, rock star investigated by the ESRB over hot coffee.
6093000	6099000	And then Episode 29 on July 18th of 2005 was a follow-up about this whole thing.
6099000	6103000	I was like, I remember this was an early thing we talked about on OLR.
6103000	6108000	I still have the hot coffee version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on PlayStation 2.
6108000	6109000	Oh, my God.
6109000	6111000	It's awesome.
6111000	6113000	But, yeah, they had a bunch of other features in the game.
6113000	6115000	Of course, tons of vehicles in there.
6115000	6122000	It was the first time, well, actually, no, I believe they had airplanes in there.
6122000	6126000	Also, they had a jet pack which was hidden in the game, which was kind of fun.
6127000	6129000	You can sneak into an Area 51 type thing.
6129000	6131000	All sorts of weapons.
6131000	6132000	You can swim underwater.
6132000	6134000	It's the first game to add BMX bikes.
6134000	6138000	So you can do tricks and stuff with your BMX bike if you really wanted to.
6138000	6140000	Like, all this extra stuff.
6140000	6143000	They had a bunch of different kind of RPG elements like gang wars.
6143000	6148000	You can mod your card, a bunch of different side missions, burglary.
6148000	6150000	Lots of fun stuff like that.
6150000	6154000	And Hitstone wants to know, why is the background music replaced by dialogue?
6154000	6156000	Can we put on Radio Los Santos or something?
6156000	6160000	We're actually doing that because we don't want to get copyright strikes on YouTube.
6160000	6166000	I mean, the music in the game was notable for being a lot of great licensed songs.
6166000	6168000	So, unfortunately, we don't want to replay that.
6168000	6174000	So, sorry, you guys get the very coarse dialogue from the game that many people remember.
6174000	6178000	All sorts of F and S and other bombs galore in the background there.
6178000	6179000	Yes.
6179000	6181000	And, of course, won a bunch of game awards there.
6181000	6183000	2004 Spike TV Video Game Awards.
6183000	6184000	It was a game of the year.
6184000	6186000	Best performance by human mail.
6186000	6187000	Best action game.
6187000	6189000	Best soundtrack.
6189000	6191000	They even have a lot of big names in there.
6191000	6196000	I want to say Samuel L. Jackson did Officer Tenpenny in there.
6196000	6198000	I'm trying to remember all the different actors that are in there,
6198000	6204000	but there's just a lot of different people in the game.
6204000	6205000	But, yeah, great game.
6205000	6209000	I mean, it was one of those games that I took off work to go play.
6210000	6213000	Actually, I want to say I've done that with every single Grand Theft Auto game.
6213000	6215000	But, yeah.
6215000	6221000	And, of course, one of the big games that I want to say, even like the ESRB,
6221000	6224000	and I want to say Jack Thompson were even kind of rallying behind this.
6224000	6230000	This is the reason why you should be banning games because they're terrible.
6230000	6232000	But, yeah.
6232000	6234000	So, that's it.
6234000	6235000	All right.
6235000	6237000	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6237000	6241000	Dressed by a hare on its tenth birthday, the day it becomes eligible.
6241000	6242000	There it is.
6242000	6243000	Grand Theft Auto.
6243000	6244000	Oh, here we go.
6244000	6246000	Here's a list of some of the celebrities in there.
6246000	6251000	David Cross, Andy Dick, Ron Foster, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Peter Fonda,
6251000	6257000	Charlie Murphy, Frank Vincent, Chris Penn, Dan Dyer, Sarah Tanaka.
6257000	6259000	Wil Wheaton was in there.
6259000	6260000	They had different rappers.
6260000	6269000	Icy, Chuck D. Frost, MCIte, also the game, George Clinton, Axl Rose, Sly and Robbie,
6269000	6271000	Sean Ryder, Young Melee.
6271000	6275000	I mean, Young Melee, of course, did Carl.
6275000	6279000	And, hopefully, with this being the tenth anniversary and stuff,
6279000	6282000	and Grand Theft Auto 5 also taking place in Los Santos,
6282000	6284000	we're going to get some sort of DLC.
6284000	6286000	I think CJ is going to be coming back.
6286000	6288000	You think some type of crossover might be the worst.
6288000	6289000	Yeah, I think so.
6289000	6290000	That'd be cool.
6290000	6291000	Hopefully.
6291000	6292000	That'd be cool.
6292000	6295000	Maybe on the tenth anniversary of the hot coffee controversy is just in time for that.
6295000	6296000	They should call it that.
6296000	6302000	They should call it like the cappuccino mod or something that references it without saying it.
6302000	6303000	That would crack me the hell up.
6303000	6304000	We'll see.
6304000	6309000	Of course, then again, if you're a rock star, you probably want to get the hell away from all that business.
6309000	6310000	All right, there's your classic game of the week.
6310000	6314000	Of course, Loki picked Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
6314000	6315000	But you know what? It really is.
6315000	6319000	I saw a comment in the chat room here that was,
6319000	6322000	I don't like this game.
6322000	6323000	What is this?
6323000	6324000	Oh, here it is.
6324000	6326000	Bojokawa says, great choice.
6326000	6328000	Don't like the game, but great choice.
6328000	6333000	Even people that weren't so into this, you kind of recognize what a huge title it was in gaming,
6333000	6336000	and the fact that you managed to do it on its tenth birthday.
6336000	6337000	That's pretty good.
6337000	6338000	It just happened to work out that way.
6338000	6339000	Yeah.
6339000	6340000	All right, well, there it is.
6340000	6341000	Part A of our show.
6341000	6343000	But we've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.
6343000	6344000	We have more news.
6344000	6345000	The Fugu Question of the Week.
6345000	6350000	And oh, by the way, did I mention the retro guys that were on the show earlier?
6350000	6352000	They left behind a little giveaway.
6352000	6353000	Something, something.
6353000	6359000	So we'll give you some details on that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
6365000	6369000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live.
6369000	6374000	Tonight with our 572nd episode, October the 26th of 2014.
6374000	6379000	And if you're tuning in to hear our interview with Read Retro Magazine, you're too late.
6379000	6380000	It happened already.
6380000	6382000	It was in the first part of the show, but don't worry.
6382000	6386000	It will be on the podcast feed later tonight after we wrap up the show.
6386000	6391000	And that was a great interview there with Mike and Mark from Retro Magazine.
6391000	6393000	In fact, I think Mark is still in our chat room there.
6394000	6400000	So if you guys have any other questions or so forth, you can ask Mark who's in our chat there right now.
6400000	6402000	And I will say this.
6402000	6410000	Those guys over at Retro Magazine were kind enough to leave behind for us to give away a year's subscription to the print version of the magazine.
6410000	6412000	So we're going to be giving that away.
6412000	6417000	We'll open that up to both our live and our podcast listeners so that everything is fair.
6417000	6423000	So check out that a little later because I want to give that away around our Frugal Question of the Week.
6423000	6427000	Because our Frugal Question of the Week kind of ties into this as well, the whole retro stuff.
6427000	6429000	Anyway, speaking of retro.
6429000	6438000	So during the break tonight, I played some scary songs to go along with the fact that Halloween is this Friday.
6438000	6440000	Are you going to do any trick-or-treating with the kids?
6440000	6442000	Are you probably still too young?
6443000	6445000	I'm not. I'm staying home with the baby.
6445000	6449000	But my son's going out as Captain America.
6449000	6452000	So he's going out with his friend from preschool.
6452000	6454000	That'll be fun.
6454000	6457000	So in Halloween, I played some scary songs.
6457000	6461000	And one of them that I played was a retro classic that I loved.
6463000	6466000	Friday the 13th, which had a great soundtrack.
6466000	6470000	Like even if you hated the game, the soundtrack was still pretty awesome there.
6470000	6472000	So we played that during the break tonight.
6472000	6476000	It kind of had me thinking about that game and how it really gets shit on.
6476000	6479000	I think in a lot of people's memory.
6479000	6481000	But I kind of enjoyed it.
6481000	6483000	It used to legit scare the hell out of me.
6483000	6485000	And I think it was because the music was so good.
6485000	6487000	Like when you were in the little...
6487000	6489000	Because you would go around if you never played it.
6489000	6498000	You played counselors at a camp trying to prevent Jason from killing either the other counselors or the children that for some reason lived in the middle of the lake.
6498000	6500000	I figured that was the safest spot to put him in.
6500000	6502000	So you played these counselors and went around.
6502000	6507000	So when you'd actually go into the other cabins and come across Jason, it would scare the hell out of me.
6507000	6513000	Because you'd actually be going through the NES-style 3D.
6513000	6516000	Where it's like move forward, it's a big old jump.
6516000	6518000	Turn left, the whole screen changes.
6518000	6520000	And then all of a sudden it would go...
6520000	6522000	And Jason would come out of nowhere and you'd have to fight him.
6522000	6524000	And usually he'd kick your ass.
6524000	6526000	Because that game was really, really hard.
6526000	6528000	You could run away from him, I think.
6528000	6531000	And then he would actually chase after you in the 2D section of the game as well.
6531000	6535000	Yeah, and then sometimes he would be in the lake.
6535000	6538000	You'd be rowing across the lake and he'd just be in the lake and it would be boom boom boom.
6538000	6540000	And you couldn't do shit about it.
6540000	6542000	You couldn't hurt him or anything.
6542000	6547000	And then when you would kill Jason, of course he came back at least two more times before you officially beat the game.
6547000	6550000	So that game was impossible.
6551000	6556000	Any classic games that get dumped on, Loki?
6556000	6559000	That everybody seems to hate, but you seem to appreciate?
6559000	6562000	Like, why does everybody hate this game but me?
6562000	6565000	Not to put you on the spot, I didn't prep you on this topic.
6565000	6567000	So I'm just curious if anything comes to mind.
6567000	6569000	Ask this of our chat room as well over at live.voguenetwork.com.
6569000	6572000	Is there any retro classic everybody shits on?
6572000	6575000	But you're like, it wasn't that bad.
6575000	6577000	Leave it alone.
6577000	6581000	I can't think of anything off the top of my head that was like that.
6581000	6587000	I'm sure there's something that I like that a lot of people didn't like.
6587000	6590000	I don't know.
6590000	6593000	There were games I like that I feel like nobody's ever heard of.
6593000	6598000	Like on the Super Nintendo, one of my favorite games to this day was Equinox, which was the sequel to Solstice.
6598000	6600000	I think a lot of people knew that one on the NES.
6600000	6603000	But it was a rare Sony game.
6603000	6605000	I remember, Sony didn't start making consoles.
6605000	6610000	So Sony published this game on the Super Nintendo and it was amazing.
6610000	6613000	It was that whole 3D isometric thing.
6613000	6615000	But I don't think people hated that game.
6615000	6617000	There's probably nobody ever heard of it.
6617000	6619000	So let's see.
6619000	6621000	Some folks in chat talking about Friday the 13th.
6621000	6625000	Mark from Retro says, LJN's only good game, I think.
6625000	6629000	ActDef says, LJN had some good games, but they were mostly crap.
6629000	6632000	ActDef is suggesting Earth Defense Force 2017.
6632000	6634000	People like that though.
6634000	6637000	No one's arguing that it's a high quality game.
6637000	6639000	That's not the case.
6639000	6643000	Everybody that plays it, they have fun with it.
6643000	6645000	That's the thing.
6645000	6649000	Obviously if you're going to read a review score, it's like, well those graphics suck.
6649000	6651000	The physics are terrible.
6651000	6654000	Yeah, of course. Those are all true facts about that game.
6654000	6656000	It's just fun though.
6656000	6658000	Just play it because it's fun.
6658000	6660000	Dungeon Buster says, Deadly Towers.
6660000	6664000	Controls took some getting used to, but when she figured some things out, it was not quite as horrible as some others.
6664000	6669000	Let's see. Rama says, A notable LJN game was Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
6669000	6670000	Oh, I remember that one.
6670000	6676000	Mark from Retro says, My favorite Resident Evil was Outbreak 1 and 2 for PlayStation 2. So underrated.
6676000	6678000	Let's see.
6678000	6683000	Kaijuto says, The Nightmare on Elm Street game with 4 player co-op was my favorite and people shit on it.
6683000	6686000	Back to the Future 2 is another one for me.
6686000	6689000	Oh, wait. Back to the Future 2 on NES?
6689000	6690000	Yeah.
6690000	6692000	Even Back to the Future 2 and 3, but it's...
6692000	6697000	Yeah, I bought that game because I was like, oh, that looks sweet because Back to the Future 1 looked pretty awesome.
6697000	6702000	You know, as an NES game and I played 2 and 3, I'm like, god, these are fucking terrible.
6702000	6706000	It's just like so terrible and I got the cheat code to get Back to the Future 3.
6706000	6709000	I'm like, oh cool, it's Back to the Future 3. Oh wait, it's still fucking terrible.
6709000	6713000	Let's see. S3100Matt says, I know plenty of people who didn't like Thekster.
6713000	6717000	That was one of the few games I grew up with on my i286.
6717000	6724000	Now, Cuntinues in our chatroom flips this around a little bit saying, everyone loves the first Silent Hill, but I think it's not that great.
6724000	6728000	We can have a whole other conversation on what game is fucking overrated.
6730000	6735000	But we'll have to have that on another episode because we have some rapid fire news to get into.
6735000	6738000	Let's be fair though. I say it's overrated, but honestly, I've never played it.
6738000	6739000	What game?
6739000	6740000	Ocarina of Time.
6740000	6741000	Ocarina of Time.
6742000	6744000	See, I just don't like the look of it.
6745000	6747000	No, now we're gonna get emails.
6747000	6755000	No, no, no, stop, stop. Here's a game that people don't like that I like a lot and that would be Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.
6755000	6759000	People hate the art style in that. Absolutely hate it. I think it was fantastic.
6759000	6763000	I think that showed off the graphics on the GameCube really well.
6763000	6770000	I think that's the art direction that they should have gone with on the Wii to make their games look even better.
6770000	6771000	But, whatever.
6771000	6777000	Alright, sorry chatters. Now the chatters are answering the other questions. Sorry chatters, we're rolling that over to another day.
6777000	6784000	We have still plenty more show to go. We gotta get your calls later in the show at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
6784000	6786000	But first, some news. Loki.
6786000	6790000	Alright, so a little bit of rapid fire stuff here.
6790000	6795000	We've got a million copies sold of the Stanley Parable.
6795000	6801000	That's awesome because that's a pretty sweet game and if you haven't played it yet, you really should.
6801000	6812000	But yes, a million copies sold of that. On top of that, if you're kind of a fan of those building games, not necessarily like a voxel game.
6812000	6817000	I mean, it's a sort of voxel, but Space Engineers sold a million copies as well.
6817000	6824000	So, that's awesome. That is for indie developers. That is something that's incredibly hard to do.
6824000	6826000	Congrats, that's amazing.
6826000	6834000	Finally, we've got, oh let's see here. Also, another game for Mojang that you might not hear a lot about, but Scrolls.
6834000	6847000	Scrolls now is going to be exiting the beta stage and it's going to be releasing the game, I believe, November is going to be coming out.
6847000	6853000	The first real version of the game that's not like a beta stage type thing.
6853000	6855000	Is this now a Microsoft product though?
6855000	6857000	No, I don't think it is.
6857000	6860000	Oh, I thought Microsoft bought all the stuff that Mojang had.
6860000	6864000	Maybe they did, I don't know. It's still under Mojang, but that's going to be coming out.
6864000	6870000	They said also that they're going to be dropping the price of the PC version of the game from $20 to $5.
6870000	6883000	Probably right. And then they're going to launch it on iOS and it's going to be free, but you're going to be able to use an in-app purchase to pay for the full version or something like that.
6883000	6891000	Neat. I don't know. Once again, for me, it's not as appealing as say Minecraft.
6891000	6899000	I'm curious. Plus, a lot of this, and I talked about the Microsoft connection a minute there, a lot of that is probably still kind of transitioning.
6899000	6904000	This is probably one of the things where this was already planned before that all took place.
6904000	6911000	But I'm curious. I like that they're going to have the free version, at least on the phones, even though I might prefer to play this on the PC.
6911000	6920000	At least I'd be able to try it and kind of get a sense for is this my type of game, yes or no, before I commit that $5 to it, which is a pretty good deal.
6920000	6928000	And then this is pretty cool. They're going to be putting out a game called The Doctor and the Dalek, which is a web-based game.
6928000	6934000	Featuring, of course, Doctor Who. And it teaches kids on how to code.
6934000	6943000	So I think that's pretty sweet. They're going to have Peter Capaldi playing the Doctor in that.
6943000	6952000	And I think anything that's out there to teach kids on how to do that stuff is fantastic.
6952000	6962000	And the game, of course, if you're in the UK, is going to be free. You can find it. It was at bbc.co.uk slash cbbc.
6962000	6974000	And, yeah, I think that's pretty awesome. And, you know, hopefully if you live in the UK or I'm sure there's going to be a way to get around any sort of region locks.
6975000	6979000	Oh, especially with the Doctor Who fans. They will not be kept away.
6979000	6989000	I think it's awesome to have any sort of way to be able to teach your kids about programming. That should be something that's included.
6989000	6994000	We've come a long way from Rocky's Boots. I'll say that. That was the programming game I remember.
6995000	7004000	Although I've got to say, being not a guy familiar with Doctor Who or anything, I don't know. It looks pretty cool.
7004000	7014000	Alright, well, Amiibo. That whole thing, you know, the Nintendo Amiibo figures, which, Loki, I mean, you think you might pick them up or no way?
7014000	7023000	I haven't seen any sort of actual uses for them other than being collectible figures. I mean, they kind of look cool as collectible figures. I just don't really want to pay for them.
7023000	7027000	Check out the Nintendo Direct. They get into it a little bit with the Super Smash Brothers.
7027000	7035000	Yeah, I get it. They're AI players that you can level up. I don't give a shit about that. All it is, you know what they made it for is fucking Pokemon.
7035000	7044000	You level them up by having them, you know, you train them to level up and then you can play them in the game. It's fucking Pokemon. It's going to be Pokemon.
7044000	7051000	If the figures are of a nice quality, then that alone will be worth it. But if they're kind of crap, then never mind.
7051000	7064000	Doesn't, it's, I just don't see the point yet. Like, why do I care about, you know, fighting an AI player that gets harder or like playing as a character in Mario Kart or something? Just, no.
7064000	7078000	Well, maybe you will enjoy Amiibo a little more in this. It was announced this week that Amiibo will work with Hyrule Warriors. But now, don't go thinking like every single character is going to suddenly show up in Hyrule Warriors. It's not how it works.
7078000	7090000	If you buy the Link figure, Super Smash Brothers for Wii U has the Link figure, of course, coming out. That Link figure can be registered with Hyrule Warriors. There's no other detail about this.
7090000	7102000	However, Nintendo is set to announce more about this soon, probably towards November 21st when Smash Brothers for Wii U comes out. So there will be some sort of functionality for Hyrule Warriors Amiibo there.
7102000	7113000	Yeah, I guess it would be kind of cool if, like, you can level up cross games. Like, you know, if I have my Link character or something like that. If I play Hyrule Warriors, he'll go up levels. And if I play Smash Brothers, he'll go up more levels.
7113000	7126000	Now, I wonder if that might be something, and you might actually be on it, the pulse of what that is. That maybe you can somehow level up your Link Amiibo and then take it over to this game. That would be kind of neat to have that synergy within the Nintendo games.
7127000	7132000	I still think it'd be cooler, though, if you could bring in Mario and put him into Hyrule Warriors.
7132000	7136000	See, that's kind of cool, but, you know, I just, I don't know.
7136000	7139000	That's a lot of rendering and resources.
7139000	7146000	It's not a lot of rendering. Come on, they can render Mario. They can render females in that game. They can render Mario.
7146000	7153000	SSJ100 Matt says, so no Duck Hunt Dog in Hyrule Warriors? Alas, probably not, my friend. Probably not.
7153000	7161000	Hey, in Donkey Kong, like, I'm not talking about the character or the Amiibo. I'm talking about the 80s arcade game Donkey Kong.
7161000	7171000	About 30 years after this game originally came out, a fan went through Donkey Kong and actually found some unused music and voiceovers within the game.
7171000	7179000	This was discovered while looking through the game's original code. There were some quick music clips and some short snippets of Pauline actually speaking,
7179000	7186000	hey, and help, because remember, the lady at the top of the board there that you're trying to rescue is not Princess Toadstool.
7186000	7191000	In the original Donkey Kong, her name was actually Pauline. So Pauline can say, hey, and help.
7191000	7193000	The vicious cycle that Mario got himself into.
7193000	7200000	So, there you go. So that's kind of neat. You can check those out there over on YouTube and around the various blogs there.
7200000	7208000	As I mentioned, Bayonetta 2 came out this past week. Nintendo definitely wants to get awareness out there that Bayonetta 2 is available.
7208000	7214000	They've chosen some very interesting partners to do so. Nintendo has joined up with Playboy.
7214000	7222000	That's right, the magazine you get for the articles. Nintendo has joined up with Playboy to promote Bayonetta 2.
7223000	7230000	Playmate Pamela Horton, who is Miss October 2012, actually, for lack of a better term, put on the cosplay.
7230000	7234000	And then shortly after took it off.
7234000	7242000	And all this can be found on Playboy's official site. And my understanding is that Pamela is a gamer and a Nintendo fangirl herself.
7242000	7249000	So they actually picked somebody. They didn't just pick her because she happens to look like Bayonetta. They picked her because she's a fan.
7249000	7259000	So that's pretty cool. Not gonna do a lot of favors for the whole Bayonetta's over-sexualized argument.
7259000	7268000	But, alright. You know what though? All I'm gonna say is that, you know, there is a lot of excess.
7268000	7275000	For better or for worse, excess exists in the video game industry. When I say excess, I mean things like Grand Theft Auto.
7275000	7282000	Excessive amounts of violence. Like almost a parody of itself level of violence, right?
7282000	7287000	Something like Dead or Alive with breasts. An excessive amount of that, right? Excess...
7287000	7291000	That's just Tecmo. Not Tecmo, Team Ninja.
7291000	7299000	If we want video games to be considered art, which I think many gamers do consider games art, there's always gonna be that excess within art.
7300000	7303000	I think I said this before on an earlier OLR. Maybe it was Hoard House.
7303000	7310000	In movies, you have people like John Waters that are going to really push the envelope of film.
7310000	7314000	In art, you have people like Andy Warhol that push the envelope there too.
7314000	7319000	There's always gonna be these excess sorts of games and I kinda think Bayonetta's one of those games.
7319000	7325000	It's camp to me. I don't take it too seriously. I mean, how fucking could you?
7325000	7330000	It's really, really over the top camp.
7330000	7336000	So, I guess if that's how they want to try to sell it, then I hope it works out for them.
7336000	7341000	Because I do want to see this game do well. I would like to see a Bayonetta 3 happen someday.
7341000	7344000	But we'll see. We'll see. It depends on how well this one does.
7344000	7349000	Alright, let's take a step over to our FUGL question of the week.
7349000	7354000	That's right. When you take Facebook and Google and you throw those words together, you get FUGL.
7355000	7359000	It's time for the FUGL question of the week.
7359000	7363000	And over on our communities, we asked a question.
7363000	7367000	You know, usually when we have interviews on the show, which we've been fortunate to have quite a few lately,
7367000	7371000	we like to ask questions that kind of tie into the interviews we had.
7371000	7378000	So, we said, what is an article that you'd want to read about a classic retro game?
7378000	7381000	Do you want some behind the scenes gossip about the development of a certain game?
7381000	7384000	Or do you want to compare or contrast with a modern game?
7384000	7388000	What kinds of things would you like to read about in a magazine like Retro?
7388000	7390000	So, we got some answers here.
7390000	7394000	On Facebook, we have Gene W. who replied saying,
7394000	7399000	I think an article about classic games like Mario 64 and Zelda Ocarina of Time being reviewed
7399000	7406000	as if it was a new game currently after 20 years of gaming evolution would be interesting.
7406000	7412000	You know, the closest thing I've seen to something like this would be like when re-releases happen.
7412000	7415000	Like when Ocarina of Time 3D came out on the 3DS.
7415000	7420000	It's very interesting to see how a lot of reviewers have to kind of walk that line of it's a classic,
7420000	7422000	but a lot of them don't really, though.
7422000	7425000	They just kind of, well, I guess when they remake them, it's a little bit different,
7425000	7429000	but sometimes when they're just being ported over, it's like, well, just read our original review here
7429000	7433000	and we'll tell you what the differences are between this version and this one.
7434000	7437000	Serping Slurpee. I never can say that.
7437000	7441000	Serping Slurpee responds,
7441000	7443000	Greetings from Cleveland, Ohio.
7443000	7448000	And Ohio is all in caps, I think in reference perhaps to a show of ours a couple of weeks ago
7448000	7450000	where we may have pissed some people off.
7450000	7452000	I've always been a Sega fanboy.
7452000	7456000	When discussing console wars, people focus on Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox,
7456000	7460000	but they omit such important consoles as Sega Saturn and Dreamcast.
7460000	7463000	Both were groundbreaking to their respective generations.
7463000	7466000	What circumstances led to their early demise?
7466000	7469000	Without losers, there could be no winners.
7469000	7471000	Ooh, that's a very interesting little last sentence there.
7471000	7477000	Kind of examining the phoenix of games, so to speak, how we rise up from the ashes, I guess,
7477000	7480000	with these consoles that may have failed.
7480000	7482000	That's a very interesting perspective.
7482000	7483000	They could still make a comeback.
7483000	7486000	I'm confident that Sega could make a comeback if they wanted to.
7486000	7489000	Well, you know what's funny is I was playing Bayonetta 2,
7489000	7491000	and I don't remember if it was Alan or Seamus.
7491000	7493000	Somebody walked into the room and was like,
7493000	7494000	are you playing a Sega Dreamcast game?
7494000	7496000	Because this looks like a freaking Dreamcast game.
7496000	7498000	And the more I thought about it, I was kind of like,
7498000	7502000	Bayonetta totally is a game that would have been on Dreamcast.
7502000	7505000	But it makes sense. Sega's involved.
7505000	7510000	Anyway, Raginator says, I'd like to read a retrospective of early to mid-90s console gaming.
7510000	7516000	The 16-bit console wars, the advent of certain genres like fighting and FMV games,
7516000	7522000	the seemingly explosion of consoles, i.e. Super Nintendo, Genesis, 3DO, CDi, Neo Geo, etc.
7522000	7525000	That's like a whole year's worth of magazines right there, Raginator.
7525000	7527000	That's a big topic.
7527000	7529000	But yes, lots of good stuff.
7529000	7533000	Let's go over to Google Plus because we do have a few answers over there on our Google Plus page,
7533000	7538000	which of course is google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
7538000	7542000	And some of our responses there. We have three comments there.
7542000	7545000	At Def says, maybe about game ROMs and emulation.
7545000	7548000	I know it's taboo for many, but let me explain.
7548000	7552000	I would actually like to read about people working on fan translations and making a game
7552000	7554000	that probably didn't see the light of day in America.
7554000	7556000	Understandable for us.
7556000	7559000	Or even interviews of localizing teams back in the day.
7559000	7563000	You know, sometimes this happens though after the fact, you know, legitimately.
7563000	7566000	I keep thinking of that one Genesis game.
7566000	7570000	It was like, you know, years after the fact they translated it from like a Taiwan game.
7570000	7573000	You know, they actually translated it into English, you know, and that was released.
7573000	7578000	So sometimes it's not necessarily questionable legalities.
7578000	7584000	Sometimes this happens way after the fact completely legitimately with all licenses intact.
7584000	7588000	But yes, I agree though. The fan translations are really something.
7588000	7593000	And to this day, you know, when they translated Second Detsetsu 3 into English, that was huge.
7593000	7597000	And that still to this day remains a game that for whatever reason,
7597000	7601000	Square Enix has not wanted to give out officially in English.
7601000	7605000	Yet there's such a demand for it out there, there's that ROM, you know, the ROM.
7605000	7607000	And we all know it's there.
7607000	7608000	You know, we all know it's out there.
7608000	7611000	Anyway, Tom W. says,
7611000	7616000	I'd really like an in-depth article on how to build a rockin' MAME or multi-system cabinet,
7616000	7619000	complete with diagrams, software, configs, and tool lists.
7619000	7623000	Well, now again, you get into that little bit of a legal gray area,
7623000	7625000	because how legal is MAME?
7625000	7628000	What? There's all these public domain ROMs.
7628000	7631000	So I think as long as we stuck to a conversation, and maybe that could be about,
7631000	7634000	here's how to build a perfectly legal MAME machine.
7634000	7637000	There's a lot of articles out there on the internet.
7637000	7644000	I mean, there's whole, you know, forms and stuff that are dedicated to that kind of thing.
7644000	7649000	Yes, but I mean, it could be very convenient to have a magazine page with a shopping list to take with me.
7649000	7651000	I mean, I guess people have their phones and stuff.
7651000	7652000	Well, it depends what you want.
7652000	7656000	There's so many things. You can find a cabinet, you can build a cabinet.
7656000	7660000	What cabinet type do you want to design, build, or whatever?
7660000	7661000	I'll tell you, having built...
7661000	7662000	You're speaking from experience.
7662000	7669000	Yes, I'm telling you, having built a couple and bought a cabinet that I converted into a MAME cabinet,
7669000	7673000	definitely some choices I would make differently nowadays.
7673000	7674000	All right, lastly, Rettertainment says,
7674000	7679000	I'd like an in-depth piece where they interview several people who developed games during the Atari area,
7679000	7683000	particularly those people who developed games where they were the only person working on it.
7683000	7687000	I think it would be interesting to compare and contrast the stress developers of the Atari era went through
7687000	7691000	compared to the stress that modern-day developers went through.
7691000	7694000	Well, I think we heard a little bit of that in our interview earlier tonight,
7694000	7697000	so it sounds like, you know, Retro's bringing some of that.
7697000	7699000	But I think we want to hear more.
7699000	7704000	More of these guys that had to work by themselves in the teams of one in the past,
7704000	7706000	creating some of the all-time classics.
7706000	7713000	And if you want that now, I recommend checking out, was it the GDC Vault?
7713000	7720000	They've got usually a lot of these kind of postmortems for different games.
7720000	7723000	Like, I remember there was one time when I was, you know,
7723000	7728000	well, I think it was actually when I didn't have anything to do with my company after they took away our system.
7728000	7734000	But I was watching these postmortems because they have stuff from like Maniac Mansion,
7734000	7736000	and just about like all these developers on these games
7736000	7740000	and like all the process that they went through to develop the engines for these games
7740000	7743000	or like design choices that they made and stuff like that.
7743000	7746000	And it's really fun to just watch and listen to.
7746000	7749000	So yeah, GDC Vault is one place I'd check.
7749000	7755000	Or just do a search, I think, for like, you know, postmortems for your favorite game and see if you can find that.
7755000	7758000	Dungeon Buster wants to point out there's a great interview with Carol Shaw,
7758000	7760000	who worked at Activision floating around out there.
7760000	7762000	She did River Raid and a few other games.
7763000	7770000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase CANDLE.
7770000	7777000	Alright, well, I mentioned that our friends at Retro Magazine wanted to give away a print subscription to one lucky listener.
7777000	7781000	So what I'd like you guys to do, if you are interested in this and you're listening either live or on the podcast,
7781000	7786000	I'd like you to email participate at orangeloungeradio.com
7786000	7792000	and I want you to tell me what game would you like to see on the cover of a future magazine.
7792000	7795000	Now, keep in mind, we have nothing to do with the development of the magazine.
7795000	7796000	We've got no pull.
7796000	7798000	But I will let our friends know.
7798000	7802000	If I notice any trends, I will let our friends know.
7802000	7806000	We will pick one emailer at random to win this prize.
7806000	7811000	So if you are interested in this, again, send a message to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7811000	7821000	Make sure somewhere in the subject it says retro and in the body tell us what would you like to see on the cover of the future magazine.
7821000	7828000	Again, we have no say or any pull of any sort and that stuff might already be planned out for the next two years for all we know.
7828000	7834000	But we'll certainly pass it along if we see any trends or anything like that to our friends over at Retro Magazine.
7834000	7840000	So once again, a print subscription to one lucky listener for Retro Magazine available at readretro.com.
7840000	7848000	Email participate at orangeloungeradio.com with what game would you like to see on the cover of the future magazine.
7848000	7852000	We will pick one lucky listener from all the submissions on next week's show.
7852000	7856000	Alrighty, let's get back into some other news. Loki.
7856000	7866000	Alright, so I don't really know how to take this news, but apparently the former CEO of EA, John Rickdello,
7867000	7870000	I think that's how you pronounce his name, is now the CEO of Unity.
7870000	7874000	As in the Unity 3D, the game engine I like to use.
7874000	7887000	You may remember him from such wonderful failures as SimCity's online issues or Star Wars The Old Republic or a lot of the other stuff that he dealt with in his tenure.
7887000	7893000	I want to say he was obviously around during the online pass thing and all that fun stuff.
7894000	7899000	Not exactly too highly thought of by a lot of the gaming community.
7899000	7906000	But he's basically saying, hey, things are going to be different now.
7906000	7916000	He actually went to the Unity forums and was answering questions and stuff there regarding some of the stuff.
7917000	7924000	For example, the company he's working for now is a very different company in a very different place.
7924000	7926000	He says they're not really comparable.
7926000	7935000	The thing that might have been right or wrong with EA when the company was a turnaround situation are entirely different than what's right for Unity.
7935000	7937000	The companies are very, very different.
7938000	7946000	Basically saying, my philosophy is not to get bigger or more profitable for the sake of these things.
7952000	7962000	He wants to recognize that developing a great game is hard and even if you pull it off or having your game discovered and installed is also hard.
7962000	7964000	Earning a good living on this is very hard.
7965000	7971000	I don't know. I think he's trying to skirt around some of the past mistakes and trying to start fresh.
7971000	7980000	So don't fuck this up like you fucked up some of the stuff or had a hand in fucking up at previous companies.
7980000	7986000	That's good advice. To quote a favorite mentor of mine, good luck and don't fuck it up.
7988000	7992000	Any concern because you're using Unity to develop your game. Any concerns here?
7992000	7993000	Not yet.
7993000	8000000	I just hope that maybe they don't change the pricing models. Although the pricing model could be a little bit better.
8000000	8008000	For me being poor, $1500 is a lot. But it's $1500 and that's it.
8008000	8015000	And you don't have to pay for royalties except for say you want to buy the next version of Unity that comes out.
8015000	8017000	The next numbered version.
8018000	8024000	For example, Unity 5. If I pay $1500 for that, I get 4 for right now because it's so close to 5 coming out.
8024000	8031000	And then I get 5, but later on when 6 comes out, I have to pay more money to upgrade to the fancier shit.
8031000	8035000	I guess it makes sense, but it's not that much money.
8035000	8038000	It could always be cheaper.
8038000	8040000	Everything could always be cheaper.
8041000	8049000	Moving on to some stories on Mortal Kombat X. Don't call it Mortal Kombat X. It is actually Mortal Kombat X even though it is the 10th game.
8049000	8053000	This is a game to look forward to early next year. I don't remember if it was on or off air.
8053000	8057000	We're talking about the Wii U and what is there to look forward to in the first few months of next year.
8057000	8060000	Now, of course, Mortal Kombat X would not be one of those games.
8060000	8064000	But for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, this is definitely one that has a lot of people looking forward to it.
8064000	8066000	I thought they had it gated already.
8066000	8072000	It was April something, I think. Which tends to be the time frame for those spring releases.
8072000	8080000	So, to coincide with the 2015 launch of Mortal Kombat X, there's going to be a new live action series.
8080000	8085000	You might remember they've done some live action Mortal Kombat stuff before, but this is going to be something new.
8085000	8093000	This will be a joint production from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Blue Ribbon Content, which is a digital series production house within Warner Bros.
8093000	8099000	This will showcase some of the franchise's most storied characters while introducing a new generation of fighters.
8099000	8103000	Because, as we know, the last Mortal Kombat game was, for the most part, familiar faces.
8103000	8107000	In fact, I think it was really all familiar faces save maybe Freddy Krueger.
8107000	8111000	But this game, we know there's some new people in it and there's people looking forward to that.
8111000	8116000	Some of the characters, I'm really curious to see how they're going to pull off in a live action.
8116000	8120000	Isn't one of them like a flying insect lady or something?
8120000	8123000	That's going to be interesting to see how they pull that off.
8123000	8130000	I think they're just going to be pulling it off like they did some of the flying characters in Injustice.
8130000	8141000	Not even Injustice, but even going back to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe back when they had some of that stuff.
8141000	8145000	But I think Injustice is a little bit more where they're playing off of for some of these characters.
8145000	8149000	So, for the live action, though, I'm curious how they're going to pull off some of that. It's going to be expensive.
8149000	8151000	It's not going to be that expensive.
8151000	8155000	This is true. I keep forgetting how many strides we've made in that.
8155000	8157000	So, yeah, there you go. That's going to be pretty cool.
8157000	8161000	They're just going to have this person jump up every time the camera's on them,
8161000	8165000	and they're just going to have to somehow shoot those scenes very fast.
8165000	8170000	No word on when this is exactly coming, although I would imagine it would be around the game.
8170000	8175000	It should be noted this has nothing to do with Mortal Kombat Legacy from 2011.
8175000	8178000	It's nothing to do with that, just to make that clear.
8178000	8185000	Also, by the way, speaking of comics, since you brought up DC, DC Comics is going to be making a Mortal Kombat X comic.
8185000	8191000	This will, quote, serve as a prequel to the game and will feature many favorite characters in the next generation of combatants.
8191000	8201000	It will be written by Shawn Kittleson in illustrations by Dexter Soy and cover art from Ivan Reiss, January of 2015, when this will be released.
8201000	8203000	So, there you go.
8204000	8212000	I'm looking forward to the game, and all this hype around it will hopefully get a lot of people online to play against.
8212000	8220000	Yeah. All right. And then, let's see. So, this is kind of cool.
8220000	8224000	We, I think, talked a little bit about how they're going to be doing a Dead Rising movie,
8224000	8231000	and now it wasn't necessarily going to be something that was, you know, in theaters or something like that,
8231000	8235000	but it is going to be something that they're going to be debuting, I guess, on Crackle.
8235000	8240000	But the title of the movie was Dead Rising Watchtower, and it actually has,
8240000	8245000	Rob Riggle is going to be playing Frank West in the game.
8245000	8253000	And Rob Riggle, he's done a bunch of different, you know, comedic roles, but he's also, you know, I think,
8253000	8254000	He's on The Daily Show.
8254000	8256000	Yeah, he's known for The Daily Show.
8257000	8261000	I can see him as Frank West, actually. I think that could work.
8261000	8267000	So, I'm curious to see how this movie is actually going to turn out, especially since it's on Crackle.
8267000	8268000	I guess it's free.
8268000	8269000	Hey.
8269000	8270000	I like free.
8270000	8276000	They haven't given a date yet when that's going to be coming out, but hopefully sooner than later.
8276000	8282000	All right. Well, let's talk about some arcade games for 2015, and one game that's going to be making its way to arcades.
8282000	8288000	Yes, thank heavens, more arcade games in 2015, because I start to worry every day that arcades are dying out,
8288000	8291000	because every time I walk into one, it's just a bunch of ticket spitters.
8291000	8294000	But Time Crisis 5 will be happening in 2015.
8294000	8299000	It will be released internationally in March or April of 2015, that time frame.
8299000	8302000	Very cool there that that is happening.
8302000	8307000	This will, I believe, has the whole foot pedal action thing going on with the gun.
8307000	8310000	I'm curious if this will lead into a port.
8310000	8316000	Are we going to have a next generation laser gun or something, or will you be able to plug in a USB mouse or what?
8316000	8320000	I mean, because these Time Crisis games pretty much all came out on PlayStation, right?
8320000	8322000	Even Time Crisis 4.
8322000	8326000	If only PlayStation had some sort of way to do light guns.
8326000	8333000	If only they had a device called the Move that they had a gun peripheral for.
8333000	8335000	The camera, of course.
8335000	8341000	They had a previous Time Crisis game on. They used it just like that in the House of the Dead game, and that's how they would do it.
8341000	8343000	Or maybe this will just stay in the arcades. Who knows?
8343000	8348000	Most likely because it's going to rely on connecting the camera and who's really...
8348000	8356000	Hey, I'm all for more games that use the connect to the camera, since otherwise those peripherals are kind of useless, aside from...
8356000	8360000	Now, Dark Dead City is pointing out there's actually two pedals on Time Crisis 5.
8360000	8364000	There's an L and an R. You can see in some of these pictures here that somebody took of the game.
8364000	8369000	It looks like some pretty fun in-game shots. I see somebody on a little zip line there.
8369000	8370000	Pretty cool.
8370000	8373000	Also, for the arcade, it should be noted there.
8373000	8379000	There is a new Bandai Namco game that's location testing called Synchronica.
8379000	8383000	This is actually a music-based game. It's a touchscreen rhythm arcade game.
8383000	8390000	It looks a little familiar for Beatstream by Konami and Rerave Plus, if you know that game.
8390000	8394000	So, yeah, that is something that Bandai Namco is testing right now, Synchronica.
8394000	8399000	And, interestingly enough, the Taiko No Tatchujin mascots are appearing on the game's art as well.
8399000	8405000	Which, you know, that was a big music game that Bandai Namco did, which does pretty well overseas.
8405000	8409000	I don't think you see a lot of it here. I know they had a couple home releases here, but you definitely don't.
8409000	8411000	It's not in the arcades here, really, unless it's imported.
8411000	8413000	It would be cool if they...
8413000	8418000	Now, this would be kind of hard to do, I guess, but it would be kind of cool if they had one of those games.
8418000	8426000	But it utilized the second-screen stuff of a tablet to actually play those games on a console or something.
8426000	8428000	Because you know how they have all these second-screen apps and stuff.
8428000	8434000	Maybe do a download version of the game or something where you're required to have that in order to play it.
8434000	8438000	Now, I do want to point out this is location testing in Japan.
8438000	8443000	Doubtful, because Taiko No Tatchujin never really made its way over here besides a couple home versions.
8443000	8447000	I don't know if this ever will either outside the imports, but you never know.
8447000	8450000	Sometimes, if something does very well in Japan, it'll make its way over here.
8450000	8453000	All right, let's go to the mailbag.
8453000	8459000	Every week, you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com,
8459000	8463000	and we open up the mailbag and read some of the emails on the program.
8463000	8469000	Except, since I'm having to multitask all night tonight, I actually don't have the mailbag up right now.
8469000	8471000	So let me bring it up.
8471000	8476000	I know we had at least one email when I looked earlier, so I should have something to read.
8476000	8479000	You would think with two weeks off, we would have had a lot.
8479000	8484000	But nope, just one email tonight, because the other one says retro on it, so people are already entering the contest.
8484000	8488000	So here it is, our email for tonight from Gene, who says,
8488000	8494000	Hello, OLR! Tuesday, I finally broke down and bought a PlayStation TV.
8494000	8496000	Oh, we haven't talked a lot about this yet.
8496000	8502000	I seriously thought about picking one of those up when I bought my PlayStation 4, because I saw the box up on the shelf.
8502000	8504000	You're thinking about it, huh?
8504000	8505000	Maybe.
8505000	8507000	Well, let's see what Gene has to say about the PlayStation TV.
8507000	8511000	There has been much talk that this unit is going for the Apple TV market.
8511000	8521000	After almost a week, I can confirm my initial impression is that it is going for the niche market of people that want to play their PS4 remotely, play PSP and Vita games on the big screen.
8521000	8526000	The menus on the big screen are the biggest deterrent, making it an alternative to the Apple TV.
8526000	8533000	Sony had put so little into the system to make it for that audience that I was a bit confused as to how to close programs.
8533000	8538000	Still, a week later, I feel the operating system doesn't translate well on the TV.
8538000	8544000	It works great for what I bought it for, Dissida on a big television with a great controller that doesn't cramp my hands.
8544000	8553000	Since I bought the bundle and will not play it, feel free to give out my code for the LEGO Movie Video Game for the Vita.
8553000	8555000	And it comes with a code.
8555000	8558000	As always, thanks to the podcast, Gene.
8558000	8563000	So there it is. The interface sucks, but if you want to play Dissida on your television, there you go.
8563000	8565000	That sounds about right.
8565000	8567000	I don't know. I'm tempted.
8567000	8576000	I don't want to just buy a PlayStation TV for it, but there is something to be said about the Vita Luminous game, which is one of the best, being able to play that on the TV.
8576000	8582000	Even the PSP games, like Final Fantasy IV, I think the PSP version of Final Fantasy IV is the best one.
8582000	8585000	I prefer it to the 3D remake. I know not everybody agrees with me.
8585000	8587000	But it's the original and the after years.
8587000	8590000	Yeah, I don't know. I'm tempted.
8590000	8592000	I'm tempted.
8592000	8596000	I'm sure if you just wait a little bit, like wait until Black Friday, wait until they drop in price.
8596000	8602000	Because I bet you a lot of people are going to be, you know, maybe people will be dropping those, I don't know.
8602000	8604000	I hope it does well.
8605000	8612000	Well, gosh, you know, I kind of want to keep this code for myself, but I see actdeft in chat going, I want it! I want it!
8612000	8614000	I want that LEGO movie game code!
8614000	8617000	So you know what? Alright, cool, you want it, you got it.
8617000	8619000	There you go. Thanks for listening.
8619000	8623000	I'm going to pass that code on to actdeft, just because he's clamoring about wanting that in our chat room.
8623000	8625000	So there you go. You got it.
8625000	8626000	Thanks, Gene.
8626000	8628000	I hear the movie game's not that bad.
8628000	8630000	I mean, just saying.
8630000	8632000	I like the movie.
8632000	8634000	Don't make me regret that. I should have kept it for myself.
8634000	8636000	Have you watched the movie? Have you seen the LEGO movie?
8636000	8637000	I haven't yet.
8637000	8639000	What the hell is your problem? Go watch the LEGO movie.
8639000	8640000	Is it on Blu-ray?
8640000	8642000	It is on Blu-ray already.
8642000	8647000	I still have not bought a fucking table for that little arcade machine. I've been that busy.
8647000	8654000	But things are clearing up in a couple weeks, so I'll be able to watch movies and things like that again.
8654000	8656000	Alright.
8656000	8660000	Let's move on and get to the FUs of the week.
8660000	8665000	We usually use this part of the show to get a little bit angsty, so here we go.
8665000	8683000	Alright.
8683000	8690000	I guess, since Jamie's not here, I'll make an FU for my cat.
8690000	8692000	My cat is an asshole.
8692000	8703000	And, you know, sometimes I give her the benefit of the doubt where, oh yeah, I just think that she's an asshole, but maybe she's actually pretty nice.
8703000	8706000	But no, she actually goes out of her way to be an asshole.
8706000	8708000	Let me give you an example here.
8708000	8710000	I was getting my son his...
8710000	8715000	We have a full-size whiteboard that I normally let him play on and draw and stuff like that.
8715000	8720000	So while I was getting it out, I had to move this box that had our fake Christmas tree in it.
8720000	8729000	And lo and behold, the cat had decided to jump up on the box and vomit into the box onto the Christmas tree.
8729000	8730000	Nasty!
8730000	8732000	She literally ruined the Christmas tree.
8732000	8734000	Ruined Christmas for everybody.
8734000	8742000	So now I have to go buy a new fucking tree because the cat decided to jump up on the box when she knew she had to throw up and throw up into said box.
8742000	8744000	Thank you.
8746000	8750000	Alright, I want to give an F.U. to the fact that our fucking livestream just went down again.
8750000	8755000	This is... I'm really giving consideration going somewhere else. This is happening way too much.
8755000	8761000	So yeah, our livestream is currently down and I'm trying to furiously reconnect so we can get our live listeners back.
8761000	8766000	Because, yeah, having a good feed is really the lifeblood of the show.
8766000	8767000	Alan, are you here to...
8767000	8768000	Are you an F.U.s?
8768000	8769000	Yeah, we're doing F.U.s.
8769000	8771000	Oh, Alan wants to give a guest F.U. of the week.
8771000	8778000	Alan's here home early for a change for the show and wants to give an F.U. of the week while I try to fix our livestream.
8779000	8793000	F.U. to the huge giant Safeway near my work that's huge like an airport hanger, yet in spite of it being a fancy Safeway, I was trying to get Rob more Stacy's salted caramel pita chips.
8793000	8795000	Oh, they're so good!
8795000	8800000	Yeah, they don't have the Stacy's brand of pita chips at all. Couldn't find them.
8800000	8807000	I mean, I was in a rush, but I went up and down that chip aisle like four times and then I went over to where they have like the kale chips and the frou-frou stuff.
8807000	8809000	None. No Stacy's.
8809000	8816000	Then I looked for the popcorn that you like. The microwave popcorn, the garlic. Didn't have that either.
8816000	8819000	So, fuck them.
8819000	8828000	F.U. to the fact that I like all this food that makes me fat, but seriously, those pita chips, the salted caramel ones, are so good. I can't. I can't.
8828000	8842000	They have the cappuccino Lay's that I almost got as a replacement, but the thing is that's why the cappuccino Lay's lost that contest because if you want sweet chips, you get the Stacy's salted caramel or the Stacy's sugar cinnamon.
8842000	8844000	There are better chips like that.
8845000	8850000	I will agree. Those salted caramel chips are way better than the stupid cappuccino chips at a Lay's.
8850000	8851000	But anyway.
8851000	8858000	Alright, thankfully we got our live listeners back, so my rage has calmed down a little bit with losing the stream there.
8858000	8859000	Very frustrating.
8859000	8863000	But don't worry guys, you only missed the F.U.'s of the week and those will be up in full on our podcast feed.
8863000	8870000	As you can hear, Alan came in the room to help contribute to that segment while I was furiously trying to get our feed back up.
8870000	8875000	Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 Game O.L.R.
8875000	8877000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
8877000	8878000	Loki.
8878000	8880000	Alright, this is pretty cool.
8880000	8884000	I watched this last time that they had it up, but awesome games done quick.
8884000	8891000	It's coming back if you like watching speedruns and really if you haven't watched this yet, you really should check it out.
8891000	8899000	It's coming out January or starting January 4th next year and they're going to be doing it for about six days.
8899000	8900000	It's going to end on January 10th.
8900000	8905000	All our proceeds from donations are going to Prevent Cancer Foundation.
8905000	8920000	And if you haven't heard of this event, it's basically a bunch of really great speedrunners playing a bunch of different games and kind of talking about what they do in those games to go fast.
8920000	8922000	And there's races and all sorts of fun stuff.
8922000	8924000	Seriously, check it out.
8925000	8929000	Games Done Quick I think is the Twitch channel.
8929000	8934000	So they'll be coming out on the 4th and they have the whole lineup.
8934000	8937000	The trailer for my next story started playing in the background.
8937000	8941000	I didn't realize it was on and it made a great ambience for what you were talking about.
8941000	8944000	I'm going to spoil what I'm going to talk about.
8945000	8948000	I know there's a lot of fans out there at this marathon.
8948000	8953000	I know Flaco Jones here at OLR, an extro at Hoard House, they love this.
8953000	8955000	It is a very fun thing to watch.
8955000	8961000	Do you think they would get mad if maybe we did an offshoot on a different week called Mediocre Games Done Slow?
8961000	8964000	There's something a little bit more our pace.
8964000	8966000	Invitation is the finest form of flattery, right?
8966000	8967000	It's all for a good cause, right?
8967000	8968000	I don't think they would care.
8968000	8969000	It's just whatever.
8971000	8973000	I think it looks awesome.
8973000	8976000	I can't wait to watch it again because last year was fantastic.
8976000	8979000	They even do it I think twice a year. They do Summer Games Done Quick also.
8979000	8981000	Check it out.
8981000	8990000	Maybe in 2015, Mediocre Games Done Slow from Loki and Rob and Darth Zagara and pals.
8990000	8997000	Mediocre Games Done as fast as we can, but our limited skills limit our speed through said game and possibly won't finish it.
8997000	8998000	The end.
8998000	9001000	Mediocre Games Done until we need a nap.
9002000	9005000	I was trying to play through, like, was it, I want to be the guy.
9005000	9010000	It's like, give us an hour until we throw the controller down on the ground because we don't want to play this.
9010000	9015000	Alright, Tigerclaw in chat says, I think they did an awful games done quick before.
9015000	9017000	Actually, that does sound familiar.
9017000	9020000	Again, I don't want to steal anyone's idea.
9020000	9024000	It's for charity. It's all great stuff.
9024000	9026000	Alright, well, I think I spoiled what I'm going to talk about.
9026000	9030000	This is, okay, this is a game I'm not fucking playing during a marathon.
9030000	9032000	Let's just make that real clear.
9032000	9036000	That is the game Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
9036000	9040000	Loki, you familiar with the Five Nights at Freddy's game?
9040000	9042000	I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the game.
9042000	9044000	You don't, okay, here's the thing.
9044000	9050000	I haven't played it because I kind of refuse to and I've actually had several people request me to stream it.
9050000	9054000	And I've watched other people play it on YouTube and I'm like, no thanks.
9054000	9064000	So here's what it is. It's a survival horror game where you're working as the security guy at a Chuck E. Cheese type of place where the animatronics are basically trying to kill you.
9064000	9067000	That's awesome. That sounds so cool.
9067000	9069000	I can't believe you haven't heard of this game.
9069000	9071000	I haven't heard of this, but that's really cool.
9071000	9075000	Alright, let me play this trailer full screen so Loki can see it here.
9076000	9087000	So they do have the sequel available on Greenlight and you're trapped in a room and you just have the security cameras.
9087000	9091000	You don't actually walk around or whatever. It's all through security cameras.
9091000	9097000	And you watch the different cameras and try to make sure that the little monsters aren't trying to get close to you.
9097000	9102000	Because if they get too close there will be a hell of a jump scare where they burst through the door and basically kill you.
9102000	9106000	And it's like they make these little sounds when they do it like blah.
9106000	9108000	They make these really hideous noises.
9108000	9112000	So I'm letting Loki see the trailer here in studio.
9112000	9116000	Because Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is on Steam Greenlight.
9116000	9122000	And it looks like as the taping of the show they've actually posted an update that says they made it.
9122000	9125000	So yeah, you can see the game area and they switch between all these different cams.
9125000	9128000	And some of the cameras are broken and they're audio only.
9128000	9132000	And so you look at the different areas and you have to basically survive all night.
9132000	9135000	Which runs like six or seven minutes.
9135000	9139000	And then at some point, come on if we get to that part of the show.
9139000	9142000	Don't those monsters look freaky?
9144000	9149000	And at some point in the trailer here, they come and get you.
9149000	9154000	It looks kind of stupid but it kind of looks a little janky there.
9155000	9158000	It almost looks like an old Saturn game.
9158000	9161000	Like a night trap type thing.
9161000	9164000	So how are you supposed to prevent the monsters from getting you?
9164000	9167000	Because when they're on the camera they don't move.
9167000	9169000	Click, click, click, click.
9169000	9172000	Somehow I don't think that works. I don't think you can rapidly click everything.
9172000	9174000	Let's see, Rama in chat says,
9174000	9177000	I know people that are doing Five Nights at Freddy's cosplays.
9177000	9179000	That is fucked up.
9179000	9182000	That's just mean.
9182000	9184000	That's like furries gone wrong.
9184000	9186000	Really, really wrong.
9189000	9190000	Act Def says,
9190000	9194000	But after a while you don't feel scared of the animatronics but rather just not fucking it up.
9194000	9196000	Yeah, I can see that.
9196000	9199000	The animatronics themselves probably lose the scare a little bit.
9199000	9203000	But later on it's a tense game.
9203000	9205000	I've played games that weren't necessarily scary.
9205000	9207000	They were just tense.
9207000	9209000	Like if I screw this up I'm going to have to do it all over again.
9209000	9212000	Even Pagle 2 got tense for me.
9212000	9214000	It's like, I have to get three of these in a row.
9214000	9217000	And it's like, okay, one, two, am I going to get the third shot?
9217000	9221000	Why are you still working at like this place that's abandoned as a security guard?
9221000	9223000	And there's like...
9223000	9226000	As soon as you see any of those animatronic things trying to kill you be like,
9226000	9229000	Oh fuck it, I'm out, gone.
9229000	9231000	It's video game logic, Loki.
9231000	9232000	That doesn't make sense.
9232000	9233000	Dungeon Buster says,
9233000	9237000	Alien isolation is kind of like that but it took almost 15 or so hours for it to get there for me.
9237000	9240000	That's another game that people have suggested I buy and stream live.
9240000	9242000	And I'm like, nope.
9242000	9245000	Because, A, it's a pricier game.
9245000	9248000	At least Five Nights at Freddy's is only what, five, ten bucks?
9248000	9251000	But Alien Isolation is still pretty expensive and it's like,
9251000	9254000	I don't know, I don't think I could make it through that.
9254000	9256000	Alright, let's do it.
9256000	9258000	Let's open up the Skype line and take your calls.
9258000	9262000	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,
9262000	9265000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9265000	9269000	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9269000	9271000	If you want to give us a call and be on the program tonight.
9271000	9274000	And the phone line is already lighting up to take some calls.
9274000	9275000	Let's do it.
9275000	9277000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9277000	9278000	Hey, this is FTF.
9278000	9280000	Hey my friend, how you doing?
9280000	9282000	Hey, pretty good, pretty good.
9282000	9284000	Well, you talked about Five Nights at Freddy's.
9284000	9286000	Yes.
9286000	9290000	And yeah, I said it in chat and you pretty much repeated it.
9290000	9292000	Or said it.
9292000	9294000	The game starts really scary.
9294000	9296000	It's a scary atmosphere.
9296000	9300000	At the first, early in your first playthrough maybe,
9300000	9303000	you're going to get scared because yeah, that's the feeling.
9303000	9306000	But after a while, it doesn't get that scary.
9306000	9308000	Does it support the Oculus Rift?
9308000	9311000	No, it doesn't actually.
9311000	9313000	But it should.
9313000	9318000	It's a game that pretty much could take advantage of that really well.
9318000	9322000	I don't know, though, if the whole fact that you're watching on cameras.
9322000	9325000	I mean, not everything should necessarily be crammed into the Rift.
9325000	9327000	And the fact that this is about watching security cameras,
9327000	9330000	that might not work so well on the Rift, actually.
9330000	9333000	So, I know people want to, you know,
9333000	9335000	they want people to actually die having a heart attack
9335000	9337000	from playing a video game at some point
9337000	9339000	by putting all these scary games on the Rift.
9339000	9343000	But isn't Slender Man enough?
9343000	9345000	I don't remember who talked me into doing that stream,
9345000	9347000	if it was Shane or Gemet or what,
9347000	9350000	but I did that livestream of Slender Man and I screamed so loud.
9350000	9353000	Hey, Slender, the arrival is coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One very soon.
9353000	9354000	Oh, is it really?
9354000	9356000	And also the Wii U, yeah.
9356000	9358000	Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
9358000	9362000	Yeah, and speaking, turning to Five Nights at Freddy's,
9362000	9364000	speaking of the Wii U,
9364000	9367000	it actually would work on the Wii U,
9367000	9371000	especially since you use a tablet to watch the other cameras.
9371000	9373000	Yeah, it actually worked.
9373000	9376000	It's basically a horror version of that stupid prototype
9376000	9378000	that, was it, Miyamoto's working on?
9378000	9381000	Like, look at my genius idea.
9381000	9384000	No, no, it's kind of dumb, you know,
9384000	9388000	watching Rob the Robot try to infiltrate your shit.
9390000	9393000	Yeah, Five Nights at Freddy's 2,
9393000	9398000	it's gonna be pretty much, maybe not the same thing,
9398000	9402000	but it's gonna do a lot of stuff that the first one didn't,
9402000	9406000	and it's gonna be way, way more creepier,
9406000	9408000	and probably way more harder.
9408000	9413000	I got to the Fortnite and I had to stop playing
9413000	9416000	because it was getting on my nerves really bad.
9416000	9420000	Not in a scary sense, but like I said,
9420000	9423000	it's mostly not to fuck it up,
9423000	9425000	because you have to check all the cameras,
9425000	9428000	you have to be very careful of what you do,
9428000	9430000	and not waste energy and all that.
9430000	9433000	It really gets on your nerves in that way.
9433000	9436000	It's not the animatronics getting you.
9436000	9439000	Like I said, and again, I'm repeating myself,
9439000	9441000	it's mostly not to fuck it up.
9441000	9443000	The game was cheating, right?
9443000	9445000	I do that all the time.
9445000	9447000	You're really frustrated because the game's cheating.
9447000	9449000	Yeah, kind of.
9449000	9453000	Even some of the animatronics actually cheat.
9453000	9457000	They give you one kill,
9457000	9462000	but they don't give you a chance even to do something.
9462000	9467000	There's this, well not an animatronic,
9467000	9471000	but a thing called Golden Freddy,
9471000	9474000	that if you catch it on your monitors,
9474000	9476000	on the security cameras,
9476000	9480000	and it appears immediately on your station,
9480000	9483000	it will pretty much crash your game.
9483000	9487000	It's a one-hit kill, and you cannot do anything about it.
9487000	9489000	Oh my gosh, that does look pretty cheap.
9489000	9491000	That would suck.
9491000	9493000	Well, I guess it is that time of year
9493000	9495000	where everybody's thinking about scary games.
9495000	9498000	I'm sure there'll be plenty of people live streaming
9498000	9501000	and playing scary games with friends on Friday night.
9501000	9504000	Good luck to everybody,
9504000	9506000	and I hope these games don't scare you too bad.
9506000	9510000	Speaking of the furry community and Five Nights at Freddy's,
9510000	9513000	you haven't seen anything of it.
9513000	9515000	Like, anything.
9515000	9517000	You know what? That is something...
9517000	9519000	Haven't seen, don't want to seen.
9519000	9520000	Yeah, that's the only difference.
9520000	9522000	I will keep that nicely stored away in Pandora's box.
9522000	9525000	Thank you very much.
9525000	9527000	All right, Actif, anything else on your mind, my friend?
9527000	9529000	That's all, that's all.
9529000	9530000	All right, take care.
9530000	9532000	Yeah, you too. Thanks for having me.
9532000	9534000	Bye.
9534000	9535000	All right, one of these days,
9535000	9537000	I'm going to just end up downloading that game
9537000	9538000	and live streaming it inevitably.
9538000	9539000	We'll see, we'll see though.
9539000	9541000	Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9541000	9542000	Hey, guys, it's Jason.
9542000	9544000	Hey, Jason, and I can see you.
9544000	9546000	I'm waving at you, you just can't see it.
9546000	9549000	I know, your beard's getting fluffier.
9549000	9551000	It hasn't even been winter yet.
9551000	9553000	It's not even cold in Colorado yet,
9553000	9554000	at least not regularly, but...
9554000	9557000	Are you planning on cosplaying Santa Claus?
9557000	9558000	Because you're about there.
9558000	9562000	I, at this rate, given two more months,
9562000	9564000	well, I don't have a Halloween costume yet,
9564000	9567000	so why not use it for two occasions this year?
9567000	9568000	There you go, there you go.
9568000	9569000	This is great radio, by the way.
9569000	9570000	This is fantastic radio.
9570000	9573000	Jason has a big, fluffy Santa Claus beard right now.
9573000	9576000	Well, it's not gray though, it's black, but still.
9576000	9577000	All right, what's on your mind?
9577000	9579000	Maybe hair dye, things can happen.
9579000	9580000	Exactly.
9580000	9582000	Can I toot my own horn for a minute?
9582000	9584000	Toot, toot, I suppose.
9584000	9588000	So, back in, I think it was late last year,
9588000	9592000	but it may have even been 20, what year is it, 2012.
9592000	9594000	At least a year ago, and possibly more,
9595000	9598000	I made this comment about how game worlds,
9601000	9604000	in the general sense, can finally come to consoles,
9604000	9606000	now that in the current generation,
9606000	9609000	everything not only has the capability,
9609000	9612000	but is largely expected to always be on,
9612000	9614000	possible to connect to the internet,
9614000	9617000	phoning home to services, all that kind of stuff.
9617000	9619000	And yeah, consoles have gotten MMOs,
9619000	9621000	Final Fantasy has been on all of them,
9622000	9625000	has been on consoles even as far back as the PS2,
9625000	9629000	so the MMO itself isn't exactly a surprise.
9629000	9631000	But it's really interesting to me,
9631000	9634000	because Destiny, a lot of people have said
9634000	9637000	a lot of negative things about Destiny,
9637000	9640000	and provided Bungie keeps up, which I really expect them to,
9640000	9644000	I expect that sentiment to change in the end,
9644000	9649000	by the time that Destiny as it stands is considered done,
9649000	9651000	whether that's a sequel, or just run its course,
9651000	9654000	or what have you, I just expect the game
9654000	9656000	to be something completely different,
9656000	9659000	and the opinions of them, if not better,
9659000	9662000	than to be different along with the change of content.
9663000	9666000	What brought this up, what really gobsmacked me with that,
9666000	9670000	this week, is that Titanfall released Patch 8,
9670000	9672000	and it was just a patch,
9672000	9674000	they've had three pieces of DLC already,
9674000	9676000	all just map packs,
9676000	9678000	and not actually doing anything else with the game,
9678000	9681000	but a patch update, free to all players
9681000	9682000	that came out this week,
9682000	9686000	added an entirely new mode to the game.
9686000	9688000	Nothing crazy, nothing revolutionary,
9688000	9693000	it was just survival, what did Halo Reach call it?
9695000	9697000	Was it actually Reach mode?
9697000	9700000	Whatever Halo Reach or ODST,
9700000	9702000	whichever one came between 3 and 4
9702000	9704000	that was actually first person shooter,
9704000	9706000	you get waves, tower defense FPS
9706000	9709000	is basically the quickest way that I can explain that.
9709000	9712000	But it's just super interesting that now that
9712000	9715000	we have the capability to do this and keep up,
9715000	9717000	and capacity, mandatory storage,
9717000	9719000	and all of that kind of thing,
9719000	9722000	that games are now shifting so that certain experiences
9722000	9724000	you probably only would have gotten on the computer before,
9724000	9726000	now are finally on the console,
9726000	9730000	and whatever doors open are interesting,
9730000	9733000	but it's just interesting to finally see that
9733000	9736000	with very specific AAA examples here and now.
9736000	9737000	Right.
9737000	9739000	Well, yeah, and it's pretty impressive
9739000	9742000	how a lot of these big games are being very well supported,
9742000	9745000	like Destiny is being, for all its criticisms,
9745000	9747000	they have been working pretty regularly
9747000	9749000	and quickly on these patches to improve
9749000	9751000	the quality of life for the game.
9751000	9753000	I really feel like I kind of hit a point in Destiny
9753000	9755000	where I kind of ran out of things to do,
9755000	9757000	and I realized I haven't done the raid,
9757000	9760000	I could still push my character forward and so forth,
9760000	9763000	but I don't know, I wasn't really super motivated.
9763000	9765000	I kind of felt like I hit the end of the story,
9765000	9767000	I did all the single-player stuff,
9767000	9769000	and I wasn't really motivated to push my character further
9769000	9772000	by going on a gear hunt and relying on RNG,
9772000	9773000	you know what I mean?
9773000	9775000	But I feel like Destiny and Bungie
9775000	9777000	did address some of those concerns,
9777000	9779000	the whole criticisms that the Crypt arc
9779000	9781000	would give you crap items,
9781000	9783000	even when you brought in purple engrams and stuff,
9783000	9785000	they at least kind of listened to some of that,
9785000	9787000	so that doesn't make me hopeful for the future of the game,
9787000	9789000	and like I said then, and like I say now,
9789000	9791000	and like I'll say forever,
9791000	9793000	if Blizzard could fix Diablo 3,
9793000	9795000	and boy did they ever,
9795000	9797000	you know, anything is possible
9797000	9800000	as far as changing a game around with free patches.
9800000	9801000	Right.
9801000	9803000	It's just interesting, because Destiny,
9803000	9805000	every couple of days, I actually haven't played it
9805000	9807000	in about a week or something like that,
9807000	9809000	and I'm going to turn it on and get all the content updates.
9809000	9811000	I haven't even been keeping up with the news,
9811000	9816000	just bits of things that I hear about around Twitter and whatnot.
9816000	9821000	For somebody who has all but checked out of PC gaming,
9821000	9824000	at least as far as new titles are concerned,
9824000	9826000	it's super interesting to be like
9826000	9829000	back in this familiar environment from my past,
9829000	9831000	but be doing it on a newer console.
9831000	9834000	Yeah, and like you brought up earlier,
9834000	9838000	MMOs, I think a lot of this is kind of borrowed from MMOs,
9838000	9841000	and I talk ad nauseam about Final Fantasy XIV,
9841000	9843000	but tomorrow they're getting another huge patch,
9843000	9845000	which is quote unquote for free,
9845000	9847000	and I put that in my quotey fingers
9847000	9849000	because you are paying a monthly sub
9849000	9851000	to play Final Fantasy XIV,
9851000	9854000	so you should get some reasonable upkeep and so forth
9854000	9856000	in some of these kind of free perks,
9856000	9860000	but it's nice to see the games supported like that,
9860000	9863000	and the fact that these games aren't paying monthly fees
9863000	9867000	for giving us this stuff that's not necessarily tied to DLC.
9867000	9869000	Right. Amazon Prime's free two-day shipping,
9869000	9871000	et cetera, et cetera.
9871000	9873000	Yeah, we all know the, oh, here's your free games
9873000	9875000	that you get for the low, low price of money
9875000	9877000	directly debited every month.
9877000	9879000	Yes, or release day shipping
9879000	9881000	for something, that's how I got Bayonetta 2
9881000	9883000	on Friday.
9883000	9885000	Ultimately, I suppose it's not really outlandish,
9885000	9887000	it's just like, not to mention
9887000	9889000	like being back in gaming regularly
9889000	9891000	and all that kind of stuff since I've been home
9891000	9893000	for a month and a half straight now,
9893000	9895000	been able to actually like sit down
9895000	9897000	and see this stuff happening to myself firsthand.
9897000	9899000	It's also the positive side
9899000	9901000	of the patching world we live in,
9901000	9903000	and I know we've focused a lot, I mean, gamers
9903000	9905000	focusing on the negative, get out.
9905000	9907000	I know we've oftentimes focused on the negative
9907000	9909000	of, well, with these stupid patches,
9909000	9911000	you know, these companies can release
9911000	9913000	these half-finished games, and we just have to get
9913000	9915000	this day one patch and blah, blah, blah,
9915000	9917000	but this is kind of the positive end of it,
9917000	9919000	is like, oh, patching can also make
9919000	9921000	an old game new again
9921000	9923000	when there's a lot of games competing for your attention.
9923000	9925000	Yeah. Speaking of games competing for my attention,
9925000	9927000	I have that 3D Realms anthology
9927000	9929000	to get to, so hooray!
9929000	9931000	You bought it, huh? Oh, yes, absolutely.
9931000	9933000	Like, those games are my childhood, period.
9933000	9935000	Like, those games were the ones
9935000	9937000	that were on AOL Games,
9937000	9939000	AOL Kids Games
9939000	9941000	download section. Some of these things
9941000	9943000	I even downloaded off BBS's,
9943000	9945000	Zmodem for Life.
9945000	9947000	Yeah, like, this
9947000	9949000	is my childhood, and I
9949000	9951000	owned almost
9951000	9953000	none of them until the last couple of years,
9953000	9955000	and now they're all here.
9955000	9957000	I have, like, literally full versions
9957000	9959000	of my entire, my entire
9959000	9961000	childhood, and it's gonna be a good
9961000	9963000	rest of the year. What game are you most looking
9963000	9965000	forward to in that collection?
9965000	9967000	My eyes immediately
9967000	9969000	crossed Raptor and Monster Bash.
9969000	9971000	I don't even know those.
9971000	9973000	Raptor was a vertical
9973000	9975000	shoot-em-up. You know,
9975000	9977000	1942, very standard affair. I don't
9977000	9979000	remember what interested me in it. Good soundtrack,
9979000	9981000	good visuals, I guess. I don't know. I'm gonna
9981000	9983000	find out, though. Monster Bash
9983000	9985000	was a
9985000	9987000	side-scrolling
9987000	9989000	platformer. You
9989000	9991000	played Johnny Dash,
9991000	9993000	I think, and you
9993000	9995000	had to rescue cats and dogs
9995000	9997000	in this monster
9997000	9999000	world of zombies and
9999000	10001000	crows and skeletons and a bunch of
10001000	10003000	other really, it's super
10003000	10005000	cartoony, very, like, overdone
10005000	10007000	sound effects and vivid colors,
10007000	10009000	but again, that's a game
10009000	10011000	that I only ever played the demo, and I played the
10011000	10013000	demo to death multiple times.
10013000	10015000	That whole collection is freaking
10015000	10017000	amazing. I bet you can't
10017000	10019000	wait to play such classics like Math
10019000	10021000	Rescue, as well.
10021000	10023000	And the same thing,
10023000	10025000	like, with 3D Realms,
10025000	10027000	what 3Drealms.com used to be,
10027000	10029000	like, I used to, even as an adult,
10029000	10031000	even in the last couple of years, I would go to
10031000	10033000	3Drealms.com, look at their games list,
10033000	10035000	and just see the same shareware
10035000	10037000	version, patch updates, retail
10037000	10039000	updates, the Duke
10039000	10041000	Nukem, various Duke Nukem patches
10041000	10043000	for, like, getting
10043000	10045000	restoring
10045000	10047000	mature, filtered,
10047000	10049000	restoring violence in, like,
10049000	10051000	clean versions that were rebuilt for, like,
10051000	10053000	Walmart, whenever they used to actually sell stuff
10053000	10055000	like that, that kind of thing.
10055000	10057000	And, like, 3D Realms and Apogee have been,
10057000	10059000	have always
10059000	10061000	held a place in my heart, and it's here.
10061000	10063000	It's fantastic. Fantastic. Well, have a lot of fun
10063000	10065000	with that, Jason. I shall.
10065000	10067000	Alright, you take care, buddy. You too. Alright, bye-bye.
10067000	10069000	Always good to hear from the man, Jason,
10069000	10071000	there, on the call. Oh, Wacky Wheels.
10071000	10073000	I remember Wacky Wheels. Yeah.
10073000	10075000	Like a Mario Kart type game. I gotta be honest, a lot
10075000	10077000	of those, I don't, oh my god, that,
10077000	10079000	I do remember Wacky Wheels.
10079000	10081000	Yeah. Oh, god, that game was the bomb.
10081000	10083000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR,
10083000	10085000	or username on Skype,
10085000	10087000	Orange Lounge Radio, if you wanna give us a call.
10087000	10089000	Let's see, I do have some tweets
10089000	10091000	I wanna get to. We've accumulated quite
10091000	10093000	a few tweets. I'm gonna apologize if I missed your
10093000	10095000	tweet. If you tweeted us, like, earlier in the week,
10095000	10097000	especially when we were out, I'm probably gonna miss your tweet
10097000	10099000	cause we get mentioned sometimes in other
10099000	10101000	conversations and things get lost.
10101000	10103000	Uh, but let's see, uh, tweet here from
10103000	10105000	Spaznator who says,
10105000	10107000	if you could buy any one non-MAME
10107000	10109000	cabinet, what would it be?
10109000	10111000	For me, it would be a 4-slot
10111000	10113000	Neo Geo MVS.
10113000	10115000	Um,
10115000	10117000	I came super close
10117000	10119000	to legit buying a BurgerTime cabinet not that
10119000	10121000	long ago. I saw one at the auction.
10121000	10123000	And if I was in the financial place I was in
10123000	10125000	now, then I would've bought
10125000	10127000	it. But unfortunately I was
10127000	10129000	going through a phase where I wasn't as fortunate
10129000	10131000	so I didn't buy it. Only if you had a cabinet sitting within
10131000	10133000	the computer that you could play BurgerTime on.
10133000	10135000	But this, okay, but there's a, you have to admit, Loki,
10135000	10137000	there is a difference. I mean, yes, it's awesome that there's
10137000	10139000	but to have, like, the real thing
10139000	10141000	is also very attractive.
10141000	10143000	I understand. So, uh, that was
10143000	10145000	one I came very close to buying.
10145000	10147000	You know my friends would've eaten that,
10147000	10149000	would've ate that shit up. What about,
10149000	10151000	Loki, what about you? Something, uh, you could buy.
10151000	10153000	That's easy. What?
10153000	10155000	I could get a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet.
10155000	10157000	Of course. Easy, I mean. Of course.
10157000	10159000	Come on, I mean, that's super easy.
10159000	10161000	Or, or if, I'm an idiot for not
10161000	10163000	saying that. I am, you know, pretty
10163000	10165000	out of shape, but hopefully that would help.
10165000	10167000	But if I was gonna go lazy route, I would
10167000	10169000	probably pick, like, a, I don't
10169000	10171000	know, like a racing cabinet or something.
10171000	10173000	Maybe, like, uh,
10173000	10175000	I don't know, F-Zero,
10175000	10177000	AX, or, um. Oh.
10177000	10179000	That'd be awesome. I don't know.
10179000	10181000	You know what pisses me off is I went back to that
10181000	10183000	place to see if I could get it, and it was
10183000	10185000	gone. You know, well, I can say this, I guess
10185000	10187000	on air, it doesn't matter. You know, uh, Denia was out
10187000	10189000	in Roseville, right? Yeah. It used to be that place across the
10189000	10191000	street, the, uh, auction town
10191000	10193000	or whatever it was called. Oh, I never went there. Gone.
10193000	10195000	They had that, oh, man.
10195000	10197000	I'm so, so angry about that.
10197000	10199000	Seriously, just look on Craigslist. There's so many
10199000	10201000	people selling like that. Yeah, and actually, uh,
10201000	10203000	and a baby Pac-Man is something I've
10203000	10205000	always considered for a long time, too.
10205000	10207000	And Dark Soccer knows about that one, cause that's,
10207000	10209000	that's that half pinball, half game
10209000	10211000	one. That one's a lot of fun.
10211000	10213000	They have some, well, yeah, yeah.
10213000	10215000	Alan, you'd understand if I bought
10215000	10217000	a baby Pac-Man machine, right? If you came home from work
10217000	10219000	one day and there's a baby Pac-Man machine in the living room,
10219000	10221000	would you, uh, would you understand that?
10221000	10223000	Oh, he's coming over. I would,
10223000	10225000	and it is such a rare
10225000	10227000	novelty to see
10227000	10229000	a half and half
10229000	10231000	game like that, but at the
10231000	10233000	same time as either version
10233000	10235000	of the screen game or the pinball, they're
10235000	10237000	both not that
10237000	10239000	great. It's just the fact that they're
10239000	10241000	integrated together that makes it like
10241000	10243000	cool, but the pinball's kind of
10243000	10245000	jank if I remember.
10245000	10247000	Crushing my dreams live on air, did you hear
10247000	10249000	that? Well, you can bring one home if you want,
10249000	10251000	but it kind of sucks.
10251000	10253000	You could bring it home if your taste is
10253000	10255000	crap.
10255000	10257000	Fine. What do you want me to bring home, Alan?
10257000	10259000	What, what, what, what arcade machine or
10259000	10261000	thing would you want to see?
10261000	10263000	Oh, he says Killer Instinct 1 or 2.
10263000	10265000	Can I just get a Nintendo 64 and
10265000	10267000	Killer Instinct Gold? Wouldn't that be enough?
10267000	10269000	I'm offended.
10269000	10271000	Alan just said, I'm offended
10271000	10273000	and walked out. Alright,
10273000	10275000	um, I need to get a room
10275000	10277000	ambient mic so you guys can hear him.
10277000	10279000	Uh, anyway, S. Jonah and Matt
10279000	10281000	tweeted us and said, I went to a friend's wedding
10281000	10283000	this weekend and the bride and groom walked
10283000	10285000	the aisle to Lindsey Stirling's
10285000	10287000	rendition of the Halo theme.
10287000	10289000	So I ask, what gaming tune
10289000	10291000	would you like to hear at a wedding?
10291000	10293000	No happy wedding jokes
10293000	10295000	from BeatMania 2DX.
10295000	10297000	I actually went to a wedding that was
10297000	10299000	Halo themed as well. I don't think it was that
10299000	10301000	same thing, but they walked down the aisle
10301000	10303000	the music from Halo. I'm not kidding.
10303000	10305000	That was, and that was over ten years
10305000	10307000	ago at this point. That's what sold me on an Xbox.
10307000	10309000	Was, uh, getting to play
10309000	10311000	Halo for the first time. Uh, local
10311000	10313000	area, not Halo 2, but Halo 1
10313000	10315000	LAN, uh, style
10315000	10317000	at that wedding reception. That
10317000	10319000	sold me on the Xbox.
10319000	10321000	That and DDR Ultimix.
10321000	10323000	Loki, I know you already had
10323000	10325000	your wedding, but, um,
10325000	10327000	you know, let's say you got to
10327000	10329000	do it again and, uh, the wife would let
10329000	10331000	you do anything you want.
10331000	10333000	What video game? She's like, okay, I want you to ruin
10333000	10335000	this. Exactly.
10335000	10337000	Exactly. Okay, if I'm gonna pick the
10337000	10339000	song that's gonna ruin,
10339000	10341000	ruin the, um,
10341000	10343000	let's see, the most inappropriate
10343000	10345000	song I can think of,
10345000	10347000	um, walking down the aisle too
10347000	10349000	just because it would really script the tempo
10349000	10351000	and everything would be like,
10351000	10353000	I don't know, like, drop
10353000	10355000	out or, you know, uh,
10355000	10357000	maybe, uh,
10357000	10359000	you know, max 300 or something
10359000	10361000	stupid. Drop the bomb. Drop the
10361000	10363000	bomb.
10363000	10365000	Uh, no, I got
10365000	10367000	this, what is it, uh,
10367000	10369000	secret rendezvous or something.
10369000	10371000	Stop.
10371000	10373000	Um, let's see, now,
10373000	10375000	now see, here's the problem is that I already
10375000	10377000	know I'm gonna walk down the aisle
10377000	10379000	to ABBA music just like in Muriel's Wedding
10379000	10381000	for anybody that's ever seen that movie. That's, that's what it's going
10381000	10383000	to be and it's non-negotiable, but
10383000	10385000	I suppose if it had
10385000	10387000	to be video game music, I don't know,
10387000	10389000	like, maybe something
10389000	10391000	Final Fantasy-ish?
10391000	10393000	I'm sure there's tons of people that have done,
10393000	10395000	like, a thousand words or something. One-winged angel, yeah.
10395000	10397000	Okay.
10397000	10399000	Okay, you got it. One-winged angel.
10399000	10401000	That would do it.
10401000	10403000	I'm sure someone has
10403000	10405000	walked down the aisle to that. I'm sure
10405000	10407000	there's some, like, nerd couple out there that
10407000	10409000	walked down the aisle to that.
10409000	10411000	Alright, one more, uh, plug for
10411000	10413000	phone calls here. Last chance to get in.
10413000	10415000	1-877-GAME-OLR
10415000	10417000	her username on Skype, Orange
10417000	10419000	Lounge Radio. Could somebody,
10419000	10421000	like, mod the lyrics so it was, like,
10421000	10423000	me, da, de, da,
10423000	10425000	da, da, da, Rob Roberts.
10425000	10427000	Could we, could we get it modded somehow?
10427000	10429000	I don't know. Alright.
10429000	10431000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
10431000	10433000	Rob will walk down the aisle to Leviathan.
10433000	10435000	No, that's Shane.
10435000	10437000	That would be, that would be Shane
10437000	10439000	that would want to get married to, uh, the Leviathan
10439000	10441000	song from Final Fantasy 14.
10441000	10443000	Just saying.
10443000	10445000	Alright, uh, Loki, do you have any last minute
10445000	10447000	stories for us? Because our phones aren't lining
10447000	10449000	up. I'm about to close them.
10449000	10451000	Um, yeah, we can talk a little bit about,
10451000	10453000	um, they're saying that, uh,
10453000	10455000	I guess right now
10455000	10457000	the first idea
10457000	10459000	of what Microsoft's gonna do with the
10459000	10461000	Minecraft property is
10461000	10463000	trying to, um,
10463000	10465000	merge the console, PC,
10465000	10467000	and mobile versions together a little bit
10467000	10469000	like maybe having them interact with
10469000	10471000	each other or something like that.
10471000	10473000	It's incredibly vague.
10473000	10475000	I guess it was coming from some sort of
10475000	10477000	IGN podcast or something like that.
10477000	10479000	Um, I guess the
10479000	10481000	PlayStation 4 has outsold the
10481000	10483000	Xbox One by 40% worldwide.
10483000	10485000	As of right now, so that's
10485000	10487000	interesting, I guess.
10487000	10489000	Um, and then, of course,
10489000	10491000	um, what was it?
10491000	10493000	They're saying that the Xbox One sales are up.
10493000	10495000	But,
10495000	10497000	I think it's gonna, I think the Xbox One's gonna do
10497000	10499000	fine. They've got really good
10499000	10501000	first party games coming out.
10501000	10503000	Halo Collection will be a good.
10503000	10505000	Yeah, Halo Collection, I mean, they've got strong
10505000	10507000	titles coming out. What's Sony have?
10507000	10509000	Sony has
10509000	10511000	Drive Club, which is just a fucking mess,
10511000	10513000	unfortunately. And Little Big Planet 3,
10513000	10515000	which Little Big Planet 3 is a good game,
10515000	10517000	but it's not gonna fucking sell systems.
10517000	10519000	Uh, Inertia is what, I mean,
10519000	10521000	and everything you talked about earlier about all my friends
10521000	10523000	already have one type of thing. I mean,
10523000	10525000	that's my honest answer. I mean,
10525000	10527000	it's a bigger deal than
10527000	10529000	you think, because, you know, it's like
10529000	10531000	Destiny. Like, for a lot
10531000	10533000	of people I know, PlayStation 4 is
10533000	10535000	the console to have Destiny on. Why?
10535000	10537000	Because that's where everybody else has it, and I want to play with my friends.
10537000	10539000	Like, we had our buddy Delvin from
10539000	10541000	Video Game Realness was on Hoard House,
10541000	10543000	and he was talking about Destiny,
10543000	10545000	and I'm like, Delvin, you play Destiny?
10545000	10547000	Why have we never played together? And he's like, because I'm on
10547000	10549000	Xbox One.
10549000	10551000	And nobody's over here on
10551000	10553000	Xbox One that I know.
10553000	10555000	So, it's kind of unfortunate.
10555000	10557000	Yeah.
10557000	10559000	Alright. Any other
10559000	10561000	last minute stories here for us to get to?
10561000	10563000	That's it.
10563000	10565000	That's about it. Well, the phones are not lighting up,
10565000	10567000	so I think that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange
10567000	10569000	Lounge Radio. I want to
10569000	10571000	thank you guys for listening to the show tonight, and
10571000	10573000	taking time out of your day or
10573000	10575000	night, whatever the case may be, if you're listening
10575000	10577000	to the show, to listen to the show.
10577000	10579000	I want to thank, once again, the folks at Retro
10579000	10581000	Magazine for coming on tonight, and best of luck
10581000	10583000	on that Kickstarter. Usually I would say I hope
10583000	10585000	you get the Kickstarter, but they already made the
10585000	10587000	goals, so I hope, I hope they
10587000	10589000	attain enough stretch goals so that they
10589000	10591000	can do something even bigger
10591000	10593000	than they did in year one. That's the wishes
10593000	10595000	that I send over to Retro Magazine.
10595000	10597000	Best of luck to them. And
10597000	10599000	you can, again, find them at
10599000	10601000	reidretro.com and
10601000	10603000	their Kickstarter, reidretro.com slash
10603000	10605000	Kickstarter. Again,
10605000	10607000	thank you guys for listening to us. I know we were gone
10607000	10609000	last week, so I appreciate you sticking with us
10609000	10611000	and coming right back to the show tonight.
10611000	10613000	If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
10613000	10615000	please, don't forget to tell a friend or
10615000	10617000	two or five or twenty about
10617000	10619000	the show. Help spread the word about
10619000	10621000	Orange Lounge Radio. And if you don't like this show,
10621000	10623000	then you know what? Screw you. No,
10623000	10625000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Go support a show,
10625000	10627000	go support another indie
10627000	10629000	show, because there probably is somebody
10629000	10631000	out there making a show that's right up your alley
10631000	10633000	and it's a hardworking indie producer
10633000	10635000	just like us, so please support
10635000	10637000	independent broadcasting.
10637000	10639000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10639000	10641000	DarkSakura's not here tonight.
10641000	10643000	She'll be back on the show next week.
10643000	10645000	She's been moving, so I'm
10645000	10647000	sure her final thought would probably be
10647000	10649000	along the lines of, I'm really tired
10649000	10651000	and I want a taco.
10651000	10653000	I'm gonna guess that would be DarkSakura's final thought.
10653000	10655000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10655000	10657000	I guess I'll just work more of my game
10657000	10659000	this week and hopefully maybe get some actual
10659000	10661000	Playstation 4 games so that I can
10661000	10663000	well, hopefully play some Playstation 4
10663000	10665000	games. I don't know if I'm really gonna
10665000	10667000	I don't wanna buy any more digital games.
10667000	10669000	I already have three physical games that I just
10669000	10671000	haven't gotten to play yet and two digital ones
10671000	10673000	coming out in November, plus
10673000	10675000	I'm probably gonna buy like Far Cry 4
10675000	10677000	and maybe The Crew,
10677000	10679000	we'll see.
10679000	10681000	So I don't wanna like
10681000	10683000	I don't wanna do what I do with every single console
10683000	10685000	launch where I'm like, oh, games, games, games, games, games!
10685000	10687000	And don't play any of them, so it's like, you know.
10687000	10689000	So, yeah.
10689000	10691000	Alright. Well,
10691000	10693000	when that patch comes out, you and I have to
10693000	10695000	play some Diablo online and test that thing
10695000	10697000	out at some point. I'm gonna be
10697000	10699000	with my show on Friday, I'm gonna be a little
10699000	10701000	busy this week, but maybe Tuesday or Thursday
10701000	10703000	somewhere around there, I'll be available
10703000	10705000	if the patch works right away on Tuesday
10705000	10707000	which I'm not always anticipating it to.
10707000	10709000	But we'll get around to it.
10709000	10711000	Actually, my final thought tonight is
10711000	10713000	I need to go finish my game
10713000	10715000	of Beyond Earth because I made the mistake
10715000	10717000	of playing on like a normal-sized map
10717000	10719000	and I'm on like turn 200 plus
10719000	10721000	and still nowhere close to being done
10721000	10723000	so I need to go finish my game of Beyond Earth.
10723000	10725000	So, and,
10725000	10727000	oh my gosh, Final Fantasy XIV goes down tonight
10727000	10729000	for an entire day and I still have to get my drop
10729000	10731000	out of Circus Tower! I got games to play,
10731000	10733000	people! I hope you do, too.
10733000	10735000	Have a great week. Be nice to each other,
10735000	10737000	people. It's a crazy time right now
10737000	10739000	on gaming, so, you know, treat people
10739000	10741000	how you want to be treated. Don't be a jerk.
10741000	10743000	Take care of each other. Good night.
10767000	10769000	See you next week.
10797000	10799000	Thanks for watching!
