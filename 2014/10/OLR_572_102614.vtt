WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, we interview Mike Kennedy, publisher of Retro Magazine, with their plans of a second year of crowdfunded retro publishing goodness and much more.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
It's been a busy two weeks, so without any further delay, let's get to the news, your chat, comments, calls, and emails right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:42.000
Jason, you forgot about the delay for food talk. That's the thing that always happens. Hi everybody, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:42.000 --> 00:50.000
And yes, we are back after a week off live with this episode number 572 for October the 26th of 2014.

00:50.000 --> 01:00.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and not here with you unfortunately tonight in studio, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I know, we were just gone last week, shouldn't she be here tonight?

01:00.000 --> 01:13.000
But actually, DarkSakura actually moved this week, so she is moving into a new house, so she's finishing up some business that comes with moving, because moving is certainly no fun task, I can attest to that.

01:13.000 --> 01:22.000
But that means, for those of you that have been listening to OLR for a while, we currently tape at what we call studio N7, because it's number 7, the seventh studio we've had.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
This means that studio number 5 is no more. It's gone though, she's moved into a new place, so she should be back on the program next week.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Joining us here in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hi Loki, how are you? Welcome back.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, did you have a good week off?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah, I guess.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Sorry, you were muted there for a minute there, but what did you do, it was my fault, what did you do with your week off?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I think watched the kids.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, working on your game, did you get to play games?

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh, you know what, actually I did work on my game, that's right, that's what I was doing.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
I didn't really play a whole ton of games. I bought a PlayStation 4.

02:04.000 --> 02:15.000
Sadly enough, I didn't really get to play any games on it, because it was one of those, you buy it off of Craigslist for a discounted price, and everything seems good.

02:15.000 --> 02:26.000
And I even was smart enough to power it on, I brought my portable HDMI monitor with me, plugged it in, made sure that I got something on the screen.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
I forgot to bring a game disc to see if it played, and unfortunately the disc drive was busted.

02:33.000 --> 02:45.000
But fortunately, it's under warranty, and the dude even had an extended warranty on it, so I, instead of sending it off to the extended warranty place, I just went ahead and sent it to Sony.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Because they're like, oh well if it's in within a year, you know, it's under warranty.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm like, well the PlayStation 4 hasn't been out for a year yet, so I'm pretty sure it's under your warranty.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
So there's no problems, and they're sending me a box to send it back, and they'll fix it, and that'll be that.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
So what made you decide to finally take the plunge, and you got PlayStation 4, as opposed to Xbox One?

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
Because you and I were talking a little bit before the show, catching up from a couple weeks, and you kind of mentioned that Xbox One has a lot of really attractive, exclusive software right now.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
With the, you know, the Fantasia, Disney, and with the Forza Horizon 2, what made you decide ultimately for PS4?

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, basically it's just, you know, what my friends have.

03:26.000 --> 03:39.000
So, I picked that console because I wanted a PlayStation 4 more than I wanted an Xbox One as far as like third-party stuff goes, because everything seems to play better on a PlayStation 4 versus an Xbox One.

03:39.000 --> 03:50.000
And, you know, the first-party stuff that I really wanted right now, like Sunset Overdrive and Forza Horizon 2, I mean, it's okay, but even like next year is going to have some pretty good stuff with like Crackdown and stuff.

03:50.000 --> 04:07.000
I still have time to get a system for that, but there's not a lot of our friends right now that have Xbox Ones, and so if I want to play like, you know, Call of Duty with my friends and stuff, or if I want to play, you know, like Grand Theft Auto, or even, you know, you guys are playing Destiny and stuff, you know, everybody has a PlayStation 4 to do that, so that's...

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Or Final Fantasy XIV, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I just, I really don't have time for an MMO.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I know, I know.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Hey, if it wasn't, you know, monthly, you know, that would be a whole different story.

04:19.000 --> 04:35.000
But very interesting that, in a way, I don't want to say it's peer pressure that caused you to do it, because it's not so much that, but it's definitely that inertia and why the launches of systems are so important, because, you know, you kind of say, well, because all my friends have this, because, you know, PS4 kind of had the bigger boom out the gate,

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
a lot of people kind of adopted that. That's kind of what swayed you. It's kind of interesting to see how that inertia really plays into things.

04:43.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah, and on top of that, I mean, that's also why, you know, like, and if it was the opposite, yeah, I'd probably be buying an Xbox One, because if all my friends had an Xbox One...

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
Well, I got a 360 before a PlayStation 3 for very similar reasons. I mean, I think they were launched a year apart, but I was a later adopte...

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
The PS4 is the first system I bought at launch in a while.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.000
Well, you see, I had a lot of store credit built up from selling off our LAN systems, because I had a lot of those.

05:12.000 --> 05:21.000
And so I sold those off and sold off a lot of my duplicate games and stuff, and even I sold my Kinect and, you know, all that stuff.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
I still have my PlayStation 3, my, you know, original one, and I've still got my Xbox 360.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
So I'm still playing stuff on... I'm going to be playing stuff on those still, at least for a little bit.

05:34.000 --> 05:43.000
And then, I don't know, but I just wanted to get, like, a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One, and I just kind of like, well, I'm just going to get PlayStation 4.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
And then, mainly because Grand Theft Auto V is coming back out again.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Aha!

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Call of Duty. Call of Duty looked really good, you know, next-gen.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And I was like, you know, it's just not going to be the same.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
But, I see, and this is kind of even weird, because, like, you know, I never understood the point of pre-ordering games digitally.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
Obviously, though, with Call of Duty, we talked a few weeks ago that they have that deal where if you buy it on, you know...

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
And they've even done that with, like, Destiny and stuff, where you buy it on one system, you get it...

06:13.000 --> 06:22.000
It's cross-buy, so, since I still play with people on PlayStation 3 Call of Duty, I have bought it digitally, because now I'll have it on PlayStation 3 for the people that haven't upgraded yet.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
And we can still play on that, and then when everybody upgrades the PlayStation 4, I'll have it for that as well.

06:28.000 --> 06:39.000
Let's go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.

06:39.000 --> 06:49.000
And if you're listening live, you should join us in chat. Live.vognetwork.com, just like SSG100Matt, who says, apparently it was too much effort to get it fixed and then sell it to someone.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
What a jerk. Talk about the Craigslist guy. Have you learned your lesson about Craigslist yet? You don't...

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
I had good... Well, I've only done three deals on Craigslist, and to be honest, this wasn't so bad, because the system works. It is really strange, though.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
Don't you think that the dude broke the disk drive and was just like, eh, I'll just sell it to some sucker?

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
Here's the thing, though. He didn't break the disk drive. The launched PS4s actually have a problem with their disk drives. Like, a lot of them failed.

07:18.000 --> 07:30.000
And that was something that's well-known, but I just... It's under warranty. You fucking bought it. It's under warranty. Why didn't you just send it off for like a few days, and it would be fixed. Done.

07:30.000 --> 07:40.000
But I think what happened is he ended up buying like another PlayStation 4 or something, and he just said, eh, fuck it. I'm just gonna... I can't wait to...

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
Well, the only game he had on the hard drive was NBA 2K14, so I guess he couldn't wait to play NBA 2K14, so...

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay, you know, and whatever. I mean, it works. I mean, I can still play games on it right now. I just only play digital games.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Have you played NBA 2K14?

07:57.000 --> 08:08.000
No, because it's not licensed to my account. Not that I would even want to, but I played the... I played that one because I bought a camera with it, so...

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Oh, the playroom.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah, I played the playroom a little bit.

08:11.000 --> 08:21.000
Actually, TigerClaw is kind of referencing that there. TigerClaw says, with Loki now owning a PlayStation 4, hopefully we can see him stream some games on Twitch. Is that part of your long-term plan?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
I guess I could.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Everybody's doing that now. It's so interesting.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
That's what it looks like, you know, now that everybody's doing it. It's like, eh, who cares?

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, you and I were talking before the show about the whole, like, you can't, you know, you're gonna have to send your PlayStation 4 in, but then I was like, oh, wait a minute, on Tuesday...

08:35.000 --> 08:44.000
You know, I know we'll get into this a little later in the show, so sorry to jump ahead, but on Tuesday we're gonna get that patch, and it's gonna have the whole SharePlay thing, so I could pop in Diablo 4, or...

08:44.000 --> 08:52.000
Diablo 4, I wish. Diablo 3, and we could do the co-op, you know, over the SharePlay, at least for an hour before we get cut off, but...

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
See, that'd be cool. I mean, you know, I'd like to check that out, and it's not a big deal if it's gone for, like, you know, because I...

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
Just because I have it doesn't mean I'm playing the system right now, and, you know, really I'm gonna want to play Call of Duty when it comes out, but...

09:05.000 --> 09:13.000
Assuming I get that box pretty soon. They said it takes about seven to ten business days, I think, to turn it around, so it won't be too bad, so I'll miss a few days on it.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I can always play it on PlayStation 3 because I bought it digitally, so...

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah, and you haven't had a PS4 for this long, so what's another...

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
Exactly, I'm just, I'm not in a huge hurry. I was just like, aw, I want to play Watch Dogs and Infamous, and, you know, the other game I...

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Oh, Destiny, so...

09:25.000 --> 09:36.000
Going to our chat room, a name I have not seen before, so welcome, continues in our chat room, says, people don't think about that when a system breaks after they buy it, so maybe...

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah, I mean, maybe this guy, like, sure, he had the extended warranty, but he just kind of was... said, screw it.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
Or maybe he bought the game digitally and literally didn't know that that drive was bad, because it was installed on there digitally, so...

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
It could be.

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
It could be just that he literally didn't know. I think he did know, but whatever, I mean, it's so stupid, and it's not, like, something I can't get fixed.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Exactly.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
It's going to get fixed.

10:00.000 --> 10:12.000
Well, you know, my launch, Xbox 360, broke, red-ringed after I had it, like, four days. You can go back in the show archive and find it, it was about February, it was around Valentine's Day, right after the 360s came out.

10:12.000 --> 10:23.000
And I could have this point now that, you know, PlayStation Plus has Dust and the Legion tale is free right now. Yeah, see, that's the problem, is all those games that are free right now, a lot of them, I have on my Steam library.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
So it's like, I could play this, but I'm not playing it on the Steam.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
Not Pix the Cat, which is, like, actually way more awesome than you would think it is, looking at screenshots.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I will have to try that.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Alright, there you go. Play Pix the Cat, then send back your PlayStation 4.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I have it downloaded, yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Alright, get on that.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
Alright, let's talk about a couple quick things here. We are going to bring in, of course, as Jason said there at the top of the show, we have a return guest this week.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
We haven't had a lot of these in the history of OLR, but we like to support indie productions, meaning indie podcasts, and indie publications.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
And Mike Kennedy, the publisher of Retro Magazine, is going to be coming back on the show tonight.

10:59.000 --> 11:11.000
He was on about a year ago when Retro Magazine was just an idea, and here we are a year later, and the Kickstarter for year number two is currently underway, and we'll talk to Mike all about that.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So that's in about ten minutes.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
So I've got about ten minutes to talk about other stuff that happened while we weren't here.

11:17.000 --> 11:26.000
Namely, Final Fantasy Fan Fest. That is where I was last weekend in Vegas. This all took place at the Rio.

11:26.000 --> 11:34.000
I talked about this in depth a little bit on my other program, Hoard House, so I don't want to repeat myself too much, but I know there's some of you that listen here that don't listen to Hoard House.

11:34.000 --> 11:47.000
Just to kind of clear a few things up, even though it's Final Fantasy Fan Festival, if you actually look at the logo, there's a very big 14 logo in it, meaning this festival was not about all things Final Fantasy.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
It was only about Final Fantasy 14.

11:50.000 --> 12:06.000
They had some demo kiosks for Final Fantasy Theatrhythm, where they were giving away codes for the song Good King Mooglemog, which is a stage in Final Fantasy 14, except they ran out of those halfway through the first day, but whatever, I'd already bought the song anyway.

12:06.000 --> 12:19.000
That was it. There was no 11, which really surprised me, because Squares had four other Fan Fests before dedicated to Final Fantasy 11, but this was purely 14, not a peep set about Final Fantasy 11.

12:19.000 --> 12:33.000
Nothing about 13 being on Steam, or the other ones, like 4 just came out on Steam, or the Monster Hunter game coming out next year, that one, the Final Fantasy Explorers, or whatever it's called.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
Nothing about that. It was strictly about 14, and there was a lot of good things, a lot of not-so-good things.

12:41.000 --> 12:53.000
Community was great, met a lot of good people, had a great time with my link shell. The developers of the game, so personable, and a real standout star from the whole thing, I think, is Soken, who's the music producer.

12:53.000 --> 13:03.000
Who's kind of, you know, I know Nobui Matsu does stuff with Square still, but he's also kind of branched out on his own. He's not really tied so much to the Final Fantasy brand right now.

13:03.000 --> 13:15.000
So Soken is kind of like their guy right now, and he's very different, because he's a little more contemporary, probably, but he's really, really personable, and just a lot of fun, and you really see the passion he has for it.

13:15.000 --> 13:32.000
I really just loved watching him, and his band played the closing ceremonies, and they were very good, even though their repertoire was very limited, because as The Primals, the name of the band, they only played Primal songs, meaning the five boss themes that are in the game right now, that's all they could play.

13:32.000 --> 13:41.000
Oh no, and then Moogle Mog, they played that song too, and had Koji, who's the localization guy who does all the voices of the Moogles in the game, I did not realize this, he does all those voices in that song.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
He actually sung it on stage, which was actually kind of a hoot to watch live, so yeah, it was pretty funny.

13:46.000 --> 14:00.000
So, and then some of the events, they had a really neat too, like they actually had an archery studio that like came in, and you could learn for like two minutes how to fire a legit bow and arrow, we had like signed releases and everything, and you could do that.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Pull bow back, or pull arrow back, let go of arrow.

14:04.000 --> 14:23.000
It's harder than it looks, trust me, because I really flopped at it, and you actually had a little real, I should have brought him out here in the studio so you could see it, Loki, but they actually had like a little real life quest log book, and as you did all these events, you get it stamped, and then you could turn it in, you get like a participation badge for some of these things that you did, and the Odin battle was neat, because that's something that's not in the game.

14:23.000 --> 14:46.000
So this was all, you know, kind of neat, all these events. The part that wasn't so great was the glue that held it all together, like there wasn't enough for everybody to do, the lines were really badly long, and in fact I know like the merchandise line was like crazy long, it was like four hours at one point,

14:46.000 --> 15:15.000
so yeah, there was this whole thing about where we had some seats, we got kicked out, and that really pissed me off, because we've been there for 90 minutes, I'm not going to get into the whole thing, I talked about it on Hoard House, so there's just some organization things that were kind of bad, which I don't consider this the first year of Fan Fest, I consider it the fifth, and so I would have hoped some more of these things would have been worked out, but granted Final Fantasy 14 is in a much higher place, so to speak, sub-number wise, than Final Fantasy 11 ever was,

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
so maybe they really truly did under anticipate the volume, I really hope they learn a lot, and I would consider going to a year or two if they do one.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
Joining us here in studio just for a bit, because I know we have an interview to get to here before too long, but joining us here in studio for a bit is our pal Shane.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
And I'm going to go to sleep, because I'm super tired.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
You're super tired, because that 6am shift or whatever it is you work, kicks your butt, right?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Waking up at 4.30.

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
Now you weren't able to come on Hoard House this week, because I wanted to have you on there to talk about Fan Fest, but you and I went to Vegas together on that 9 hour drive.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
It was fine.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
How'd you like the desert?

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
The desert's stupid, the desert needs to die somehow more than it already has.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah, I can't believe people live there, right?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Just old people.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
What did you think of Fan Fest, because you kind of disagreed with me on some things, so quickly, what was your take on the whole thing?

15:58.000 --> 16:12.000
I think it was amazing. I understand the frustration with some of the parts. The lines were terrible at times. There wasn't a lot of things to do, unless you wanted to wait in line.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
You stood in that merch line for 4 hours, and you still come out of this going, I had a great time.

16:17.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah, I did. For one thing, I didn't have to stand the entire time, because I got in so late that they were seating people to get in line.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
So I sat through my favorite panel of the entire thing, the music panel, so it was great.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Did you hear what I said when you were in the other room about Soken?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
No.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
He's kind of like, you know, with Uematsu.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
He's amazing.

16:37.000 --> 16:44.000
Well, with Uematsu, not really, I mean, he does stuff with Square, but now he kind of does other things too.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Like, Soken's really kind of like the face of music in the Final Fantasy games right now.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Yes, he's way more interesting, I think.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
He's just different, I think. He's just different.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
Like, I don't want to shade Nobuo Uematsu, who is a legend of legends, but Soken is...

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
He's more personable.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Well, Soken's also contemporary. He's more contemporary to me. I think he's a great face.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
Well, I just watched the London ceremony, and he was awesome in it.

17:05.000 --> 17:15.000
But anyway, no, I don't also consider it its fifth attempt, because the Vana Deal Fest, Vana Fests or whatever, I don't think those are even remotely the same thing.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
It's the same company, but I don't think it's the same people involved.

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
But I had a great time. Arrow shooting was fun. The cannon stuff was dumb. It was really dumb, actually.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
It was a cute idea, but if I was four, I might have liked it.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
And yeah, I thought everything was really great, even if I didn't get to do everything.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Like, I didn't do the Primal Battle. I didn't do Frontlines. I didn't do Speed Challenge, but we did Odin.

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
We did the panels, and really, I was there for the information in the panels. The other stuff was just extra.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It was worth $120 to you?

17:50.000 --> 17:58.000
It was amazing, yes. And I want them to do a second year, but they said they might not do it yearly, because people will expect an expansion every time.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
Which I'm like, no, just say there's not going to be an expansion announcement and still do it, because people would still go.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
We had free company members show up that decided they were going to go the day before it happened, and they had a blast.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Yeah. I was really amazed that they pulled that together.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
But Final Fantasy XIV, one thing they've been very good at is that they've been putting out patches really regularly.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, we have one on Tuesday.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, exactly. I feel like they'd still have something to talk about with all these regular patches if they still go down that path.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
Yeah, and think about it. Our Fan Fest, we got the announcement of the expansion.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
The rest of Fan Fest was dedicated to the upcoming patch, and then just other random things like music or lore.

18:37.000 --> 18:46.000
Not anything to do with the new expansion. So, yeah, they could really just base it around a patch, and I think people would be happy.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
Acteft is linking to something on eBay asking, did Shane get this? And it's Fan Festival 2014 Delivery Moogle with in-game minion codes.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Yes, I already have my minion, and it's all running around in-game with me.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
And that's why the line was so long, because this was the first time they were selling these exclusive Fan Fests with in-game minions.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
Yes, the Moogle is going to be on the online store, but they were only taking pre-orders in every region for it. It wasn't out yet.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
The art book was also there, and I believe...

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Which also has a minion.

19:13.000 --> 19:21.000
Which also has a minion. I believe Japan had just got the art book when we were able to get it at Fan Fest, but it's still up for just pre-order in the site.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
So since I don't know anything about this game, what exactly are the minions?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
They're just little pets that follow you. Sometimes they interact with things like...

19:28.000 --> 19:37.000
Okay, so I have this adorable dog minion, and so you have a pet emote, and when you do that to him, he lays on his back so you can rub his stomach.

19:37.000 --> 19:43.000
It's adorable. Sometimes the Moogles, no matter if it's a regular Moogle or the delivery one, they will...

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
If you have multiple out, like you have one out and your friend has one out, they will link up and start doing a little dance around with each other.

19:49.000 --> 19:56.000
You can beckon some of them to hop on your shoulder. It's pretty neat. I mean, it's stupid, but it just gives you more things to do in the game.

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah, and honestly, when I saw that merch line, I was like, screw that. I'm like, Alan will understand if I don't bring one of those home because I'm not going to stand in that line.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
And then I got extraordinarily lucky, and somebody who had connections did me a really nice favor, and I got one anyway.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
One thing that I didn't mind...

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
If you're listening, thank you.

20:11.000 --> 20:19.000
One thing I didn't mind about the line is that the people I was standing with were pleasant enough that I could talk with them the entire time.

20:19.000 --> 20:26.000
I found that to be something... One of the biggest pluses about Fan Fest was that the community was really awesome.

20:26.000 --> 20:36.000
And I was worried about that going in. I thought we were going to get the hardcore Final Fantasy fans that know everything, and if you say something wrong, they will look at you and say bad things at you.

20:36.000 --> 20:43.000
Because I played 11 a lot. I played 14 a lot. The other Final Fantasies, to be honest, I haven't beat a Final Fantasy since 7.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
And I didn't care for a lot of the ones after that.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
And I thought it was awesome because there were 7 of us from the free company there. A party in Final Fantasy XIV is 8 people.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
So to do Odin, we were one short to do a party. So we pugged somebody.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Well, you guys pugged him before you got the us three.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
To make a long story short, because I'm running out of time.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.000
We ended up pugging a guy that was there by himself from a low-pop server, didn't know anybody there, and he was really awesome and helped explain the fight to us.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And we were like, why don't you just hang out with us?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
He hung out with us for the rest of the weekend.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
For the rest of the weekend, he hung out with us. And we invited him up to party.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And I don't think he's joined our free company.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah, he has a factory teacher. Actually, this is really funny. I think I got him in my trial today.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Because...

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
You know his name?

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
I know his name because our friend, his friends, I'm trying to keep this for public radio.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
But yeah, I saw that name pop up in Duty Finder as a tank.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I got Leviathan, and I was like, I think that's...

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
But he was one of those ones that was like, in and out. Pulled, and then left the thing right away.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
So I couldn't say, oh my god, were you FanFest?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I couldn't get any of that.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
That's another reason why our FanFest was great. Because in our concert, we got Leviathan twice.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
We got it as the second song, and we got it as the encore.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
And that is my favorite song in the game.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
And so I was beaming the entire time that song was being played live. So good.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
Quickly here, because I have to transition topics here, but what was your favorite thing about FanFest?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Leviathan.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And what does that mean for the listeners that don't know?

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
Leviathan, the concert they had at the closing ceremonies was the Soken, the guy that does all the music.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
And he has a band called the Primals, and they played the theme songs to all the current Primals in the game.

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
And Leviathan's song is my absolute favorite, probably song of all Final Fantasy games ever that I've heard.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
And now that I have theater in them, I can hear a lot of the other songs I've never heard before.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
And they played it second. I was kind of going crazy about it.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
And then they did an encore, and they asked what song we wanted to hear.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
And Leviathan won the encore, and they played it again.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
But they wouldn't play Shiva, yet they did this weekend in Europe, which is bull.

22:52.000 --> 22:59.000
Yeah, and now that I've heard it, we didn't really miss out on much. I'm glad we got Leviathan twice. I'd rather have that than Shiva.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
And what's my least favorite? Because I assume that was the other side to this.

23:04.000 --> 23:13.000
My least favorite probably was...

23:13.000 --> 23:21.000
It being in a casino hotel, which I understand Vegas is probably all that, but I really don't like the smell of cigarette smoke.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
When you're walking through the casino areas to get to the event, you walk through a lot of cigarette smoke.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
And I did not like that at all.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
And that was your first trip to Vegas, right?

23:34.000 --> 23:43.000
Yeah, and you know what? Maybe. I'm just not a Vegas person, but I didn't drink or gamble, and I just didn't really see the point.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I was there with a purpose.

23:45.000 --> 23:53.000
And I noticed one other thing I'll quickly say is that a ton of Street Passes, especially for 3 of them, I've got 99 Chaos maps now.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
Theater of the M and Smash Brothers, that was the highlight for your 3DS there. And getting all your puzzle pieces, that was easy to do.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Anyhow, Shane, if you want to come back later and hang, that's cool.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
We'll be in bed.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
You're probably going to bed.

24:07.000 --> 24:13.000
Well, I gotta go park my character in front of the Rogue Guild in Final Fantasy to be prepared on Tuesday.

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
Well, good luck. But I gotta shift gears here because it is time for us to give our pal Mike Kennedy a call.

24:19.000 --> 24:26.000
Mike is with Retro Magazine, and they're just coming off their first year of Retro Magazine.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
And they're starting a Kickstarter for the second year, which is actually in progress. We're going to get a status update on that.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
And I believe we have Mike on the line. Hi, Mike. You there?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Hey, I'm here. Thanks again for having us on.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
No problem. And actually, we're going to have a second person, too, here in this interview.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Do you want to introduce this guy for us here, Mike?

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah, I wanted to bring on Mark Kaminsky. He's the co-founder and also our creative director.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
He's the guy responsible for all the pretty pages in the magazine, among lots of other things.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Very nice. Welcome to the show, Mark. How you doing?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Hey, thanks for having me.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Hey, thank you guys for being here. I appreciate it.

24:59.000 --> 25:07.000
Well, first off, I just want to say congratulations. You guys have successfully completed one year of Retro Magazine.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
And I know we're here to talk about the Kickstarter for year two.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
And usually when we're talking about Kickstarter progress, I want to give an update and say,

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
Oh, go donate because they have this much further to go. But you made it.

25:19.000 --> 25:25.000
You've accomplished already your Kickstarter goal for year two of Retro Magazine, right?

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
We have hit our goal, but the goal was really set, something that we thought we could achieve.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
And really our goal for this second year is to make the magazine bigger and better,

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
add more pages and lots of other cool things to the magazine.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
So right now, we're really excited that we hit the goal within, I think it was about a week.

25:43.000 --> 25:50.000
And we've got three weeks left to start hitting some stretch goals, which means just more pages and more inserts and more cool things.

25:50.000 --> 25:57.000
So we're really excited that we hit it early on. So we've got this nice launching pad for hitting some of these stretch goals, hopefully.

25:57.000 --> 26:04.000
Awesome. Well, let me take a step back a little bit here because even though we had you on the show last year, Mike, we're fortunate enough.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
We have some new listeners every week here on the show. So some people out there listening might not have heard about Retro Magazine before.

26:10.000 --> 26:16.000
So maybe I'll ask you, Mark, since you weren't here last year, tell us a little bit about Retro Magazine, Mark. What is it?

26:16.000 --> 26:24.000
Well, it's just an old school magazine. It's a double entente, so it's retro. We cover retro content.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
It's also a retro throwback magazine, kind of like the old school magazines that we had in the past.

26:29.000 --> 26:38.000
Nintendo Power, Game Fan, Game Pro, that kind of thing. So we want to resurrect a print magazine for guys that still collect games and don't emulate stuff.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
And it felt like there was a void in the market, and we just kind of went out and created one.

26:43.000 --> 26:58.000
And created you did. You guys have been very successful at that. How does it feel to see that there's all these people out there saying print is dead, print is dead, but yet you guys are still able to make this successful thing? How does that kind of feel?

26:58.000 --> 27:08.000
Well, as Mark said, we're a retro magazine, and it is that double entendre being that we talk about retro and we deliver it in a retro format.

27:08.000 --> 27:17.000
Although there are still a few video game magazines out there, but obviously the great ones are dying off with Nintendo Power last year.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
And hopefully that's about where it stops. There's still a few on the rack, and it's great to see that.

27:22.000 --> 27:31.000
We certainly don't want to be the only one on there. We just want to add to that cornucopia of video gaming goodness that you can still get and hold onto in your hands.

27:31.000 --> 27:43.000
And that's kind of what we want to deliver. And I think so far our fans and readers, that's kind of what we're seeing because we do sell quite a few more print subscriptions than digital.

27:43.000 --> 27:53.000
We offer it in both formats, so we're trying to cover all of the bases there. But generally, people seem to really resonate with the print.

27:53.000 --> 28:01.000
Awesome. And if you guys have questions for Mike or Mark, you can ask them in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com if you are listening live here.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
And of course, if you want to find out more about the Kickstarter, there's not an easy way for me to give Kickstarter links out on the show.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
We have a link that's friendly.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
Oh, because usually they're so long and slash, dot, so what is the link?

28:13.000 --> 28:23.000
We have thought of that. We think of everything. Well, we think we do. We have a link for that, guys. It's readretro.com slash Kickstarter.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Simple enough.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Yeah, so there it is.

28:26.000 --> 28:35.000
Good thinking. All right, I can just say that. Readretro.com slash Kickstarter. Much easier than go here and search for this person's name. Good job on thinking that through.

28:35.000 --> 28:44.000
Well, let's talk about Kickstarter for a minute here, Mike. I want to ask a question that might be kind of tough, but I think just to clear the air and make sure everybody kind of understands.

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
You've gone to Kickstarter for year two of the magazine, but I know there's probably going to be those cynical people out there that say, well, doesn't year one pay for year two?

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
So do you want to elaborate on why that is not the case here and why you do need this Kickstarter for year two?

28:58.000 --> 29:07.000
Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, we're using the Kickstarter not to fund the second year because we've committed to doing year two already. We've been selling subscriptions all year long.

29:07.000 --> 29:16.000
But we wanted to use Kickstarter for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's a marketing, you know, people use it for marketing right now.

29:16.000 --> 29:27.000
I mean, there's lots of sophomore follow-up deals or things that people are working on where they'll go back to Kickstarter again and again and again because it brings new people for whatever reason.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
I mean, there's enough new people kind of on Kickstarter that will see this project maybe for the first time.

29:32.000 --> 29:38.000
So, you know, it's kind of, for us, it's being used as a supplemental campaign to what we've already done.

29:38.000 --> 29:47.000
And we're really just using it to grow the subscriber base, get in front of new people because, you know, there's just buzz around a Kickstarter project.

29:47.000 --> 29:55.000
And so we just wanted to continue to use Kickstarter in whatever way that we can. I mean, it's kind of a smart way.

29:55.000 --> 30:04.000
And other magazines, you know, Nintendo Force is another great magazine that they just completed their second year Kickstarter a few months ago and that was very successful.

30:04.000 --> 30:13.000
And again, it's just a way to fund more growth and I think most people will understand, I hope, anyway why we're doing it.

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
So far we really haven't had too many questions about it. But it's just a great way to bring in new people, new eyes, new subscribers.

30:21.000 --> 30:30.000
There's some marketing value that Kickstarter offers these days that, you know, again, a lot of people use it just to keep things going.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
That's a very honest answer that I wouldn't have really thought of but you're absolutely right.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
It's because, you know, these crowdfunding things are so, is really the buzz and what a lot of people are talking about right now.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
And I'm sure it does kind of put this in front of more people that maybe were not even aware of year one.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
So that's a great response. Thank you.

30:49.000 --> 30:57.000
Let's talk a little bit about some of the contributors to the magazine, Mike, because you talked about how there's some of these magazines that aren't around anymore.

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
But it seems like some of the people you might recognize in those magazines, you've got writing for Retro.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Can you tell us a little bit about some of the contributors you have?

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
Yeah, yeah. So it was, you know, when we started this thing, it was always our goal to bring on a great team of writers.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
And, you know, it didn't necessarily mean it was some big name. Everybody had heard of it.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
You know, we wanted to try to kind of make it a mix of some well-known, you know, industry writers.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
But if you look at our magazines, you'll notice lots of new names, you know, coming in and out of every issue.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
So we certainly try to mix it up and give people opportunities to get in print.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Because, I mean, those opportunities are falling by the wayside these days, right?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Right.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
But people want to see their name in print still, and I think always will.

31:37.000 --> 31:45.000
And so we wanted to be an avenue for that, not for, you know, the kind of the more, I guess, well-known people, but the newer people as well.

31:45.000 --> 31:54.000
But as far as the well-known people, I mean, yeah, people like Jeremy Parrish, Chris Koehler, Sean Baby, Kath Bailey, Alexandra Hall, Andy Eddy.

31:54.000 --> 32:03.000
You know, he's been writing for video game magazines, he's published, he's been publisher or, I'm sorry, editor, you know, back in the 90s at Video Games and Computer Entertainment.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
So he goes way back.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Dave Halverson.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
Yeah, Dave Halverson, we brought him back, you know, in issue four, did our cover story.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
So, you know, we try to mix things up, you know, we kind of have this, kind of our core group that you're going to see probably in every magazine.

32:19.000 --> 32:25.000
But the other half of the people, you know, we're going to bring in and kind of new people and keep things fresh.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
And, you know, kind of, and it's been, you know, it's a pretty successful model, I think, so far.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
Awesome. And, yeah, you've got some great names there.

32:34.000 --> 32:42.000
And when you say a name like Sean Baby, I kind of go like, oh, man, I remember reading that guy's stuff when there wasn't OLR, which I can't even remember that far back some days.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Like, this show's been going on so long.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
And we got new people, you know, we just had Scott Sharkey sign on.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Oh, cool.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
So a lot of you guys may remember Scott Sharkey.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
I mean, he's kind of disappeared, you know, the last couple of years.

32:54.000 --> 33:01.000
He went out and basically bartended out in the Nevada, middle of the Nevada desert for the last two years.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Wow.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
So I caught up with him at Portland Retro Gaming Expo last weekend.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
And, you know, really great guy.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
And he's really excited to be back. He's really excited to be writing for the magazine.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
So, you know, he's just one of the people that we're bringing on.

33:17.000 --> 33:26.000
We've got kind of a handful of a few other kind of interesting folks that may be joining the contributor list that I think will surprise a lot of people.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
But we're just sort of keeping wraps on those just for right now.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
But there may be some revealing going on in the next three weeks before the Kickstarter ends.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
All right. Then stay tuned to that.

33:36.000 --> 33:44.000
Mark, let me ask you this one since, you know, you've done a lot with making the magazine pretty, as Mike said earlier.

33:44.000 --> 33:50.000
What is a personal favorite article or contribution of yours from the first year of publication?

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
And I know it's probably a tough making you pick between all this stuff.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
But try to pick just one that was a personal favorite of yours.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
I'm going to have to say, you know, content-wise, some of the interviews that we've done.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
It was really cool to get Ed Semrad in the first issue.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
You know, he was one of the original guys at EGM.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
Had some really cool custom stuff.

34:13.000 --> 34:21.000
Another interview, we found a guy in Pittsburgh that was sort of in the closet with his collection of pinball machines.

34:21.000 --> 34:26.000
Has over 800 machines in his private collection.

34:26.000 --> 34:32.000
You know, never talked to anybody before, like not part of Papa or any of the big events.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
So he was sort of like an unknown quantity.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
And we kind of, you know, dug him out and got an exclusive interview.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
So that's kind of my personal favorite.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Awesome. That's always kind of cool.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
It sounds like you guys have been very good at kind of, I don't want to say digging up people,

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
but seeking out these people that maybe haven't kept up with the industry as it is today.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
But really finding these folks that contributed to gaming in the past and letting us catch up with them.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Because maybe they don't all have Twitter accounts or what have it.

35:04.000 --> 35:10.000
Well, in our first issue, we have an interview with Inafune.

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
Actually, one of the images that his team sent us wasn't supposed to be sent.

35:15.000 --> 35:21.000
And I guess there's some scribbling in Japanese there where it says something like this is just like Mega Man.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
And they were a little concerned about it.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
It wasn't supposed to be released publicly kind of thing.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
And that's in the book. So that's kind of cool.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Whoops.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I love that.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
We might have done something bad, but it's in the book now.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Hey, we just published what they gave us.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
That's right. You didn't do anything wrong.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
That's right. But yeah, that's a great comment.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Part of what we want to do moving forward, adding more pages and content.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
We had polled all of our readers back in probably March, kind of first quarter.

35:55.000 --> 36:03.000
And a lot of people loved the retro gaming interviews that we do with some of these gaming legends.

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
And coming back and trying to find some of these people that haven't been interviewed hundreds of times.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
I think it's going to be a new challenge of ours.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
There's a lot of these legends that for whatever reason have flown under the radar for years.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
And they're all getting a lot older now.

36:19.000 --> 36:27.000
So it's important to find some of these people that maybe wrote some really great hit game back in the 80s or early 90s.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
And then they've just disappeared.

36:29.000 --> 36:35.000
So we're trying to find these people and give them an opportunity to come in and tell us about their time in the industry.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
Everybody's heard David Crane, Gary Kitchen, at least kind of the pre-NES era.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
Those guys have been interviewed a bazillion times.

36:43.000 --> 36:51.000
So I know when we interviewed them on our latest issue, part of the angle I took with them is that issue was about platforming.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
It was kind of the theme.

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
And so I pretty much centered all my questions around platforming, which a lot of these questions they've probably never been asked before.

36:58.000 --> 37:04.000
So it's still kind of a cool way to ask them and get information out of them that maybe they hadn't told people before.

37:04.000 --> 37:11.000
There was a section of that article that we actually cut when we had to edit it down.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
And I think we've still got this and we're going to probably get it on the website sooner or later.

37:16.000 --> 37:24.000
But there was this real in-depth explanation that Gary Kitchen had given us about porting over Donkey Kong to the Atari 2600.

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
And that's generally a port that people either love it or hate it, but unfortunately a lot of people didn't like it.

37:30.000 --> 37:36.000
Me, I thought it was great. I've spent zillions of hours playing Donkey Kong on Atari 2600.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
But he talked about how hard it was to angle the girders like in the first level of Donkey Kong,

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
because for whatever reason the architecture of Atari, everything had to be on a straight line.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
And so it was just this great explanation.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
And you could tell that this was something that he just had struggled with because he went on and on and on

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
about how much of an accomplishment it was for him to actually figure out how to angle the girders.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
Because if you played Donkey Kong level one and they were flat, it just wouldn't look like Donkey Kong, right?

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
So he figured out how to do that.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
And those are just the great stories that we loved to hear and talk about.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
And although we cut that piece, there's still a ton of great information that we left in,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
and we'll probably have that here someplace else.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
But just hearing these people's struggles, they didn't have anybody they could learn from.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
They were there first.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
And while it's a unique opportunity that few people can find themselves in,

38:32.000 --> 38:41.000
it's pretty amazing to see what they did without any training, no school, nobody to ask how to do something.

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
I think people nowadays just sort of forget where it all started. And it wasn't that long ago, really.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Well, and that kind of ties into some of the new content that we cover as well,

38:50.000 --> 38:56.000
where it's almost like the golden age of resurgence of indie game publishing right now.

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
These little guys are going out there, and they worked with big developers,

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
and now they're coming out and they're like, you know, I want to make a cool platforming game,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
or I want to make my own RPG.

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
And they're small teams of a handful of people, and they're making the game that they really want to make.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
And it's just a really interesting space right now.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
I don't know if you know this, but we literally had one of those guys on the show here two weeks ago

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
talking about his game, Timespinner.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
I don't know if that's one of you guys' radar, but literally what you just said there.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
And I kind of agree. There's a lot of love of the retro going on there.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
And yeah, you are seeing people that are stepping away from maybe these AAA studios

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
to really do their quote-unquote pet projects, such as when we had Bodhi on a couple weeks ago.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
Curious, are there any of these types of retro nostalgic games?

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
Because Retro Magazine doesn't only cover classics.

39:51.000 --> 39:59.000
Like, you guys had Mighty No. 9 on your very first issue, which is certainly a retro-inspired game, right?

39:59.000 --> 40:06.000
What kinds of these retro-inspired games do you think might not be on our radar right now, but should be?

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Mike, is some of this stuff from E3?

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
I don't know. I was just looking at actually recovering Timespinner in our next issue.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
So I knew you had mentioned that. I'm going through a pagination here going,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
that really sounds familiar.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
You know what, one of the things for me being kind of an older gamer,

40:22.000 --> 40:28.000
I'm 45, I'm the pre-NES kind of demographic that we try to shoot some of our content towards.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
There's tons of these games coming out that I would never hear about

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
if I wasn't publishing this magazine or reading this magazine.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
Because I read it, you know, when we're doing the pagination

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
and people are turning their stories in and everything, that's when I get to read the magazine.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
And I tell you what, I go through this stuff and we learn about these games.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
And I tell you, there's not that many really great indie games that are coming out right now

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
that people haven't heard of because the industry has totally changed.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
I mean, Sony, they're going after exclusives.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
We're covering Axiom Verge, which is this great Metroidvania game.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
That's kind of our cover story for the next issue.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Oh my god, that's a Sony exclusive.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
So you've got companies like Sony going out to these single-person dev teams.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
It's not even a team, it's just you.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And your game is so good.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
They're trying to give you an exclusive deal on it.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Think about that.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I mean, it's insane.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
And it's great.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
That's why the industry is changing right now.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
So there was Indiecade a couple of weekends ago.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
I went out there and Nintendo had a tent there

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
showcasing all of these great indie titles that are coming out.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Ouya had a booth there and Sony had a booth there.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
And so they're really trying to get these games out to the public.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
And there's really no other magazines, at least at this point,

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
that are really covering it and giving these types of games top billing.

41:48.000 --> 41:53.000
So I think that's a great place for us to come in

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
and kind of help get these people's games kind of permanently recorded

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
on paper and everything else because it's just kind of eroding right now.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
But I don't know.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
Mark, is there any other games that you can think of?

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
Well, right now on the Ouya, I'm playing Never Ending Nightmare.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
It's that time of year, Survival War.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
I'll tell you what, that is one of the creepiest games you will ever play.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I love the Ouya platform.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I think there's a lot of great stuff on there.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
I wish them the best of luck. I hope they can continue on.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Me too.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
My appreciation for the Ouya really didn't grow until I really saw

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
probably about E3 this year or GamerX,

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
where I really started to see more of the indie stuff

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
that they were really opening up that platform to

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
and really kind of going over and championing these indies.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Yeah, it made me really appreciate the Ouya a lot more as a system.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
They had a tent full of people at IndieCade, full of people.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
And there's probably a dozen flat screens in there playing all these games.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
And almost every single one of them was a retro title.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
So it's really turning into a pretty decent format.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
So they had some rocky times.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
But I think they're bringing the games,

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
which ultimately hopefully will work out really well for them.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
Rob, I want to take a quick step back and just first of all thank you.

43:11.000 --> 43:17.000
You were the first show that we got on last year to promote the Kickstarter.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
And it really means a lot.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
I've listened to your show since about 2006 on and off.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
I ran into Bobby at Southern Fried Gaming Expo,

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
and we put your name in the magazine.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
I just want to say thanks a lot for having us on.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
Thank you so much. It's an absolute pleasure.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
And I like to kind of say,

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
oh, well, we were there catching this wave before it got big.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Yeah, absolutely.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
When the first issue came out, I noticed,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
and I looked at the backer pages, I was like,

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
oh, orangeontrated.com is right there in the first position.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I was like, well, that's kind of neat.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
And then, yeah, I had heard that that could be part of the reason why.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
We were the first show that had you guys on.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
So fantastic.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I'm glad we can give you guys a boost again this year,

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
just in case there's folks out there that still,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
for whatever reason, have not heard of Retro Magazine.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
And yes, print media is still happening out there, still happening.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Speaking of that, let me ask one more question I have here.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
Do you have advice to anybody else

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
that might decide to venture into the world of print media?

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
Now, we are the voice of geeks network,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
so we have a lot of different fandoms, not just video gaming.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
We've got people that like British television shows and anime

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and all sorts of fandoms here.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
And I'm sure a lot of people are feeling like

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
they see the print media for their stuff slip away.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
I've seen everything from newsletters

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
and what we used to call zines many years ago.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I've seen all sorts of things.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
So what advice would you guys have

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
from what you've learned over the past year

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
to anybody else that might be ready to venture down this path?

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
I think, first of all, it's easy to say,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
but you've got to just go for it.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
And then you figure out a way to make it happen,

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
especially if what you want to talk about

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
would resonate with people to read magazines.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Like old video game magazines, that resonates with people.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
So generally, I'm thinking,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
probably a lot of your people grew up reading magazines

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
and whatever hobby they like.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
And those magazines probably are disappearing.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Maybe they didn't have magazines in the first place

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
if they were really small hobbies.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
But generally, you're not the only kind of people that like something.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
There's other people out there.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
And we've just found that people still really like the magazines

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
and don't think that we're crazy.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
But there's a lot of work that's involved.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And it helps if you've got connections.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Honestly, if Marc wouldn't have come to me,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I was going to do a digital magazine originally,

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
and Marc, who happens to be in that business,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
kind of sought me out and heard what I wanted to do

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
and said, let's do a print magazine.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
And at first I thought, you're nuts.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
But luckily for me, he had a background in it.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
He had the printing contacts and the desire and will

46:00.000 --> 46:05.000
and aptitude to lay out a complete magazine by himself.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
It's insane.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
So we got a little bit lucky that way.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
But with the software and stuff out there these days,

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
if you wanted to do it and do it yourself and start small,

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
I think you probably could do it.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
But just nail your costs down.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
Yeah, just go out there and do it, really.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
There's a lot of technological advances

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
that happen with printing.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
So we print on a traditional big web press.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
We ship out through the mail and everything,

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
polybagger magazines.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
But I mean, there's print on demand services

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
through places like Jumag or MagCloud,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
and all these other things.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
So you could put out a digital magazine.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
And let's say it's something that you

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
start with some people you know.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
And then you want to offer a print version.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
People can ante up and pay and have it shipped to them

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
directly, sort of like a one-off print on demand.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
So I mean, go out there and do it.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I mean, we love it.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
And we didn't really skip on any of the,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
we don't print on cheap toilet paper.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
We have really nice quality paper.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
We have high quality stock for our covers and everything.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
We want this to be something that you put on the shelf.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
And we're going after a certain market, people

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
that collect games, that want to have something to hold on to.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
So I mean, if you love it, go out, do it.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
You'll feel better for it.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
And there's a lot of options right now.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
So yeah, absolutely.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Follow your dream.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Excellent.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Well, again, if you guys want to check out Retro Magazine,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
check out their website, readretro.com.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
And of course, the Kickstarter, readretro.com slash Kickstarter.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
I got that right.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Correct?

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
You got it.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
All right.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Awesome.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Well, before we close up here, I always

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
like to ask this question of all the guests

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
out there on the show.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
What games are you playing right now?

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
So what games are you into right now?

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
I'm curious if you're playing retro games

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
or maybe there's newer games that have your eye right now,

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
which is totally fine too.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
I play both.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Mark, I'll start with you.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
What games are you playing right now?

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
OK.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Classic games right now.

48:11.000 --> 48:18.000
I'm playing through R-Type 1 and 2 as best I can on Ouya.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
Really hard.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
I keep going back to it.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
I'm like, man, I don't remember this being so hard.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
But any shmup that I can't.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
And I'm pretty good.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I have a Neo Geo cabinet and everything.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
I mean, having a hard time getting past the third level

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
in both games.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
And it's like, ugh.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
But Borderlands, Borderlands, Borderlands,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
as far as the new stuff.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Just a big fan of the Borderlands series.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Can't praise it enough.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Yeah.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Clearly, you must have picked up the pre-sequel.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Oh, yeah.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Yep.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Awesome.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Awesome.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Mike, how about you?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Oh, gosh.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
So I'm going to come on the total opposite end

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
of this spectrum.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
First of all, I've not been playing a lot.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Because it's just, I don't know.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
That's the sad part of being so busy.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
He is true.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
But I did pick up the ColecoVision Flashback

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
and the Intellivision Flashback.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
And I've been playing through some of the new homebrew games

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
on the ColecoVision Flashback.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
There's about, I don't know, half a dozen of them

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
or so on there.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I forgot those were coming.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
I need to get those.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Thank you for reminding me.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Those are out.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I mean, you know, 40 bucks at Toys R Us.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I think Intellivision, I just saw something come down

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
by Facebook, a Groupon for the Intellivision Flashback.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Oh, I needed a 60-week original one.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
You know, 60 built-in games.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
You know, you've got the original looking Intellivision controller.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
They're pretty decent little systems, you know.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And there's certainly going to be games on there.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
You've got the base plates.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
That is awesome.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Yeah, yeah.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
They've got the controller overlays and stuff.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
They'll come with that.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
And again, there's some new homebrew games on there

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
that are real good, you know.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
So if you kind of grew up, you know, in that era

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
and you want some new games to play,

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
the other great thing about these is a lot of the rare games that,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
you know, the cartridges may be 50 to 100 bucks,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
there's probably a dozen of them on this thing.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
So you don't have to get the cartridge.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
You can get this flashback and play a lot of the harder to find

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
and more expensive games.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
But I'm trying to think of, like, a current game.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
No, that was a great answer, Mike,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
because, like, you literally have me going, like,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
you know what, I have money on my Groupon account

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
from some gift certificates,

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
and if this Intellivision thing is on there, I'm buying one.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
It's a great gift to give somebody, too.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Like, for that gamer that, you know, that, you know,

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
kind of has everything, I mean, they're really cool systems.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Or a great gift to give myself.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Exactly.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
Yeah, there you go.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Hey, even better.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Yo, hit titles.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
Adventure, Zaxxon, Pepper 2, Jumpman Engineer.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Okay, I'll just buy that right now, then.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
Right?

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Right?

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
I can't wait.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Is there going to be, like, a Commodore 64?

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
Well, I know they had that newer PC a few years ago

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
that also had the retro mode, but, you know,

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
one of these days, they're going to release,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I think they have, like, a Commodore 64 joystick

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
or something that came out some time ago,

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
but, oh, that was my retro console.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
That was great, yeah.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
Hey, Mike, what was that TV that they had at CGE with this?

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Oh, yeah, so there's a new television that's out.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
It's from Crossley.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
If you guys Google, I think if you just Google Crossley,

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
C-R-O-S-S-L-E-Y, they're the ones that are making

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
some of the new, like, in Target stores,

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
it's, like, the USB record players and stuff.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
But Crossley Retro Television.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
Yeah.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
You're going to see this beautiful flat screen TV

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
with these big chrome knobs on it and this wood grain,

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
you know, kind of perimeter, you know,

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
around the edge of the TV, and they're pretty expensive,

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
but, man, they're really sharp, they're video game friendly,

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
they've got lots of inputs, and so those have been

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
kind of the new thing.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
And they've been working with Intellivision

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
and a lot of these companies to bring these TVs

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
into the retro expos.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
They have a 24-inch one for $229.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Wow.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
I think they have them at Target,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
or maybe you'd probably get them online,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
but they're pretty sharp.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Awesome.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Wow, I learned some new stuff,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
and now I've just spent more money

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
thanks to this interview.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
That's fantastic.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Thanks, you guys.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Well, I want to thank you guys again for coming on.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Let me quickly read some of these comments here

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
we're getting in a chat room.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
SSG100Matt says,

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
The digital PDF subscription are great for any medium.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Absolutely, it's a great way to kind of get the magazine

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
on your iPad and all that stuff, right?

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Dungeonbuster, in response to the zine question,

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
saying, I wonder how many of these fanzine authors

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
went on to become full-fledged writers and editors.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
I bet quite a few.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I know some people that started as podcasters

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
that do a lot of this, you know, big-time stuff now,

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
which is cool.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Dungeonbuster also says,

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
The old mags are great snapshots of the past in gaming.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
The ads, the articles, and the excitement

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
were splashed on every page.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
Do you guys ever have the urge to run, like,

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
a classic video game ad of sorts in your magazine?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Mark, I mean, I don't know.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I mean, I guess first of all, I don't know if there's...

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
I know a lot of the ezines and the fan magazines did that.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
I don't know for, like, a widely distributed magazine

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
if that's infringing on anything, you know?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Yeah, we have to be careful we don't get sued.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
I mean, I'd love to, but I don't know.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Some of that stuff, I mean...

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
And, you know, the ads that we've had in our magazine,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I mean, we keep it to a minimum.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
We only have, you know, four to six pages,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
and we really feel everything we put in there

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
is, like, something you check out, you know?

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
Video game box protectors or some class,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
you know, retro game coming out.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
So we've been really fortunate.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
Yeah, it's relevant.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Awesome, awesome.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
Well, I'm going to go ahead and wish you guys the best of luck

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
with year two of Retro Magazine

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
and any other links or things you want to plug here

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
before I let you guys go.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Mike, I'll start with you.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Well, I'd just say, you know, readretro.com.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
That's our website that, you know,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
is kind of tagged onto that Kickstarter campaign.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
But the main thing is the website.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
I mean, we got a ton of writers over there

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
putting a lot of effort and time into creating new content,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
you know, retro content.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
We're trying to kind of fill the gaps

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
between the magazine deliveries, you know,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
give people a place to kind of interact

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
and read what our writers, you know,

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
are talking about online every day, you know?

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
And, again, just fill the gaps between the magazine

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
and really use the website to kind of complement the magazine.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
And I've just been really proud of the content

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
that we're getting up there,

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
and we just want people to go and read it.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
We got a lot of people spend a lot of time,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
and I think there's some neat stuff there.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
And it's all, you know, pretty timeless.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
You know, there's not a lot of reviews for...

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
We have some new game reviews,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
but, I mean, we're getting some pretty exclusive stuff,

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
some cool interviews.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
We're getting some, you know, cool videos

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
and stuff that you can kind of just read any time,

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
you know, and it's kind of timeless and resourceful.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
So, you know, I would just say, for me,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
yeah, check out the website as well.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
Awesome. Mark, anything you want to add to that?

54:58.000 --> 55:02.000
Absolutely. SouthernFriedGameRoomExpo.com.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
It's a long link, but Bobby Blackwolf was there.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
I know the host of this show are pinball fans.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
If you can make it out next year in Atlanta,

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
June 20th through the 22nd, it's a great show.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
Lots of really cool pinball stuff.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Check it out. Like, get it on your bucket list

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
or calendar or whatever. Come out next year.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
I already do make my one trip to Atlanta a year for DragonCon,

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
but it sounds like you guys have quite the convention.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
I know Bobby's gone a few years there, and he's a fan.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Well, this year was the first year.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
I mean, it was totally crazy, like naked people in the pool.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
You know, it was out of control. It was a good time.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Why did I think it was like you were on year two or three?

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I guess I'm getting ahead of myself.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I guess it was just that solid.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
It was like a second or third year convention.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
It was so amazing. Yeah, it was a really good time.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
That's why. All right, well, thank you guys again,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
and congratulations on all your success with Retro Magazine

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
and I'm looking forward to year two,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
as I'm sure a lot of people are,

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
and thanks for keeping the print media alive.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
It's fantastic.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Thanks, Rob. Thanks for having us on again.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Thanks again. Take care, you guys.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Yeah, bye. Bye-bye.

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
Again, that was Mike and Mark from Retro Magazine,

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
and we wish them the best of luck with year two,

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
and that Kickstarter's going on right now,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
and as we mentioned earlier, they have made the goal,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
but they are looking at stretch goals,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
like they're going to make the magazine bigger,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
add more pages, things along that line.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
So if you are feeling so generous,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
you want to check out the magazine,

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I would urge you to go over to the Kickstarter.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
I believe, too, from what I'm reading on the Kickstarter,

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
if you want to get a subscription,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
like if this is just even something that interests you,

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
you can lock it in now cheaper

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
than it's going to be after the Kickstarter's over.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
So if you're like, I want to get the magazine,

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
you might as well do the Kickstarter

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
and get locked in for year two of Retro Magazine.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Thanks again for them coming on the show.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Always good to have them on.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
How do you like that, Loki?

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
He's been listening since 2006.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
I had heard we were the first show that had them on.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
That's great.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
That's pretty awesome.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
That's very awesome.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Almost as awesome as this

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
ColecoVision Flashback Game Console that I now need to get.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
I know, right?

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
Like, I see everybody linking it in our chat room there.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
In fact, ActDeft sent me a link directly to Groupon

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
of this Intellivision Flashback Console there.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
How much is that thing going to set me back

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
when it comes up here?

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Oh man, it even comes with the...

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Okay, see, here's the thing.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I had the Intellivision lives on what, the Xbox

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
or whatever it was?

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
Like, I remember on our old network, All Games,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
they were really tight with the Intellivision guys

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
and I seem to remember for a while

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
they were pushing that Intellivision lives.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
It was on like Xbox, right?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
So I remember getting a copy of that then,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
but man, this Flashback Console comes

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
with one of those little disk controllers

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
with the number pad on it.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Awesome.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Forty bucks on Groupon.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
I think I'm going to have to buy that.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Yeah, the regular price on those is like $49.99.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
I gotta buy it.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Somebody stop me.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Alright, that's 60 titles on that.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Although, if you can't get through Groupon,

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
according to Google here, at least the Colecovision one

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
is $39.99 at Bed Bath & Beyond,

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
the place that you'd probably never think to buy a retro console.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Who would think to get a console at Bed Bath & Beyond?

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Oh my gosh. Wow.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Alright, well...

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
That's what I grew up on, man, is the Colecovision,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
so that's some awesome stuff.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
Although, those controllers look a little bit different than I remember.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Alright, well, let's get into it.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
So from retro to current gaming,

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
let us get into how was your gaming week

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
and the types of video games that you've been playing this week,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
and then we can finally get into our news.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
My gaming week was okay.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I mean, obviously, I bought a game system.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Sadly, I did not play really anything on it.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
I just kind of got it ready.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
I got all those games that kind of bookmarked

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
with PlayStation Plus back when I had it,

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
because I had to renew it, because I let it lapse for a while.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
But now I have another year in there,

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
because obviously if I'm playing multiplayer games,

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
I got to have it anyways.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
But I meant to do it at some point.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
I was just waiting for when I was going to have a PlayStation 4.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
So I renewed that,

59:04.000 --> 59:09.000
and I just kind of downloaded everything that I had marked

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
that I wanted to play.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
So I have that all installed,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
so I just had to go and play that.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Really, the only game I kind of played

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
was just to test out the camera,

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
the playroom or whatever that's called, I think.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Yeah.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
So I had my son mess around with that.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
I was going to say,

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
your kids would probably get a real big kick out of that.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Yeah, my son liked it.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
He's always skittish about everything,

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
and I'm like,

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
they have these robots in there,

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
and he's like,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
well, I don't know, robots are scary.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
I'm like, no, no, no, it's not scary.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
So he liked it.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
He liked, you know,

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
so I'll suck them back up into the controller area.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
I was like, okay, fine, I'll do that.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
He's like, what's that noise?

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I'm like, they're stuck in the controller, see?

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
So I'll shoot them back out.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
So he had fun with that.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
So I messed with that a little bit.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Sadly, that's probably the,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I don't think I'm going to be using the camera very much,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
but whatever.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
That's cool to have anyways.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And then I just preordered some stuff

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
that's going to be coming out,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
you know, because Grand Theft Auto V,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
you know, I got to have that.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
So I did that digitally, just for the fuck of it.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I mean, whatever.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I'm not going to sell that game.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
It's going to be awesome.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And then Call of Duty,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
just because I wanted that on PS3,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
as well as PlayStation 4,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
because I still have friends

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
that haven't bought a PlayStation 4 yet,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
and we're going to be hopefully

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
upgrading that from Modern Warfare 2.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So that, and then just working on my game,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
still working on doing the new Unity GUI stuff

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
to redo my whole editor

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
so that I can quickly go through it

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
to make levels out of it

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
instead of just ships and stuff.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And so that's what I've been working on,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
just getting the new interface down for that

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
so that I can build stuff.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And so I was just kind of working away at that.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But, uh...

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Is your game retro-inspired?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Because maybe you'll get covered

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
in that magazine someday.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Retro magazine.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Sort of.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I mean, it's a 2D shooter, I guess.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And it's got, it's going to have,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I mean, the original idea was

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
it was going to be like the NES color palette and stuff,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
so it was going to be very limited,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
you know, looking like that.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Kind of like, you know,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
how they have those 3D NES games sometimes,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
like, you know,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
where it'll be just kind of blocky-looking stuff.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
That's what the original idea was,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
is it was going to look like that.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Are you talking about, like, Vector?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Are you talking about something like...

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
No, I'm talking about, like,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
where they, like, take, like,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
the Super Mario Brothers,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
original Super Mario Brothers,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
and they make, like,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
a 3D web version of that or something like that.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Where you can, like, pan the camera and stuff.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Oh, okay.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
That kind of thing.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Where it's going to look...

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Paper Mario.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Kind of like Voxels or something.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Paper Mario is cool.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I love Paper Mario.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
But, no, not exactly.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And I increased the color palette.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It's, like, 88 colors now.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So, but that's what I'm sticking with,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
is just 88 colors,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
and I'm working with that.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But, yeah, so, sort of, I guess.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It's not entirely retro.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It's just kind of a bunch of things combined together.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
But, yeah, that's pretty much it this week.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I mean, hopefully, I'm going to play some stuff

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
on the PlayStation 4 next week,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
before I get shipped out,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and then I'll just be working on my game

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
while it's gone.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Well, actually, no.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I take that back.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
There is one game I purchased today

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
that I will probably go back and play,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
but I'll get to that later.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
But, yeah.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So, I'll be playing some more stuff,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
hopefully, this week.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I'll get back to it.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
So, I'll be playing some more stuff,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
hopefully, this week.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Okey-dokey.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
My gaming week.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
You know, I've been insanely busy with,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
you know, I took the trip to Vegas.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I'm going to BlizzCon in a couple weeks.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I know.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Poor me.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
All these trips.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
But it can still kind of take its toll on you

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
with being busy.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And then I have my final Rocky show,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
which I talked about a couple weeks ago

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
at the end of the show.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I have that coming up on Halloween.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So, I've been pretty insanely busy.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I have been squeezing in some video games

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
here and there.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
So, I do have a few things to talk about.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Final Fantasy XIV, which, you know,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
going to the Fan Fest, it did re-energize,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
you know, despite the problems I had with it.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
It definitely re-energized, like,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
how, like, my love of the game

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
and how into it I am.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And they've got a brand new content patch

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
coming on Tuesday that's going to add

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
the Shiva battle.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
We'll finally be in there the last

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Primal Battle for this expansion.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And, you know, some new dungeons,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
some other new features.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
So, I'm really kind of pumped getting ready

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
for that with that releasing on Tuesday.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
With some non-MMO games,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I played Pagle 2 on our week off

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
because that came out on the PlayStation Marketplace.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
That's been out for a while for the Xbox One folks

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
because that's been exclusive,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
but it finally came out for PlayStation 4.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So, I've been playing a little bit of that,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
which, you know, to be expected,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
a lot like Pagle 1,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
but they throw in some new little things

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
like armored blocks,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
which I don't remember seeing in the first one.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
You have to hit them twice before they disappear.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Like, you know, I've kind of seen that

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
in some breakout clone games,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
but didn't really see that in the first Pagle.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
So, you know, it's a very familiar formula,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
but, you know, it works well.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And the game's definitely on crack,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
like the first one was, you know,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
like the horse that literally will, like,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
fart like little rainbows and things like that.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Very silly types of stuff.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
So, cute to see that.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Other games.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Friday was a big, big game release day.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
There was a couple of them that came out,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
and I've gotten to spend a little time with each of these.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Civilization Beyond Earth would be the first one,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
which, as you know, I love Civilization.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
The original's probably my favorite PC game ever,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
and I've been following with the series

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
through Civilization V.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And, you know, at E3, I was fortunate enough

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
to check out a sneak peek of Civilization Beyond Earth,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and I was ready to put down the money right there.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
So I picked up Civilization Beyond Earth,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
which, you know, a lot of people will look at it and go,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
hmm, it just looks like Civ V in space,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
which on a purely kind of, like, just visual level,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
it probably does, like, look like that.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
But the game has a little more depth than that.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Oh, the one screenshot I saw looked really weird.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I'm like, this doesn't look like Civilization.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Well, I think that's the hardest thing people are having with it

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
is that Civilization has that familiarity with it.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
You know, you're gonna research guns

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
because I want to be able to make gunners

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
and musket men that can shoot the enemy.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I'm gonna fight people like Queen Elizabeth and Gandhi

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
and, you know, Abe Lincoln and all these very familiar things.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Civilization has that very, you know, sense of familiarity with it.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Civilization Beyond Earth has none of that

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
because it's all about science fiction

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
and, you know, what could be the future.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
You know, if you ever played Alpha Centauri,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
it was very much like that too.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
So Beyond Earth in some ways is a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
One of the big, you know, game-changing things it does

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
is that there's not just the land on the planet,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
but there's the land in orbit

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
because you actually will fire some things into orbit

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
because you have to, let's say you have to clear

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
what they call miasma, or just poison.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
You might have to clear poison from squares,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
although miasma may not really be poison

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
depending on how you kind of take the approach to the game.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I'll just kind of leave it at that.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Something else, the alien race.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
The first time I played the game, I went,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
oh, these aliens are like barbarians in civilization.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Kill them all, kill them all, kill them all.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
But as you start to play through the game the first time,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
you start to realize there's a path you can go down

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
where you can coexist with the aliens

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
instead of necessarily blowing them away.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
So it was kind of one of those very interesting

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
kind of self-check sort of things

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
where my instinct was to just immediately kill the aliens

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
because that is what civilization has taught me,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
is kill the intruders,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
but that may not necessarily always be the case.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
The technology system is completely different,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
and there's this whole new system in there,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and I apologize, I don't have a guide

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
that tells me what everything is officially called in the game,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
but there's some type of system that involves harmony

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
and purity and these different types of

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
how do you want your civilization to coexist on the planet,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and that really drives the victory conditions for the game,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
which will also throw you for a loop if you're a Sith player

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
because the victory conditions are not what you're used to before.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
You can still win through military dominance,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
but everything else has changed.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
So that took me a little bit to get used to at first.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
So yeah, I think there's enough in this game

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
that differentiates it from Civ V.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Not everybody's going to like that differentiation,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
but I think it makes for an interesting and different experience

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
that I think is worth the money.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I don't know if necessarily the game

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
is going to end up being superior to Civ V,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
but it's a really great holdover at least until Civ VI,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
if you're a Civilization fan.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Come on, we all know Civ VI is going to happen at some point.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
It's just a matter of time, right?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Let's see, also in my gaming week, one other thing to mention.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Bayonetta 2 came out for the Wii U on Friday, and I did pick that up.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Haven't got to play a whole lot.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I only really played through the prologue

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
and then the first chapter and a little bit of the second chapter,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
so I can't really speak at length about the game,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
but it was all the excess and over-the-top,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
even in just the first opening scenes in New York City at Christmas time,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
just such excess over-the-top hilarity

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
that I loved in the original Bayonetta game,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
and I'm having a great time with it.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
If you're not very good at action games like me,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
they've totally dumbed down a mode

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
where basically they'll just do the combos for you.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
You can literally just button mash your way through Bayonetta,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
but if you don't want to do that, there's more intense skill levels too.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I think they have the one button mode, wasn't that in the first game?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
They did. Yeah, first climate.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I believe that was in the first game.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I don't think I played it that way

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
because I think somebody else had introduced me to it.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I actually read there was some disabled gamers or something

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
that were saying, like, that's fantastic

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
because now I can play this game without having to, you know...

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
That is very cool. That's very cool.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And there's a whole touchscreen control thing too.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I haven't really played at that with any extent.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Again, I haven't got to spend a lot of time with the game,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
but I know that is there as well if that's something people want to do.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
So I realize there's a lot of people really pissed off.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
The Bayonetta 2 did not come out for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
that it is a Wii U exclusive,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
but this is the type of Wii U exclusive

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
that Nintendo really needed in their back pockets.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
So suck it up.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
This is what video game competition is about.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And this is going to make the Wii U...

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And I think somebody had asked earlier in chat,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
is this a Game of the Year contender?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
It's a little early for me to say personally,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
but the vibe I'm getting out there on Twitter

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
and the other reviews and so forth

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
is it very well may be,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
which, you know, the Wii U may not have a lot of games on it,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
but it sure produces a lot of very highly reviewed games.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
So definitely something worth looking into.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
All right. That was it for my gaming week.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Some housekeeping we have here coming up.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
So, of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
and we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Google+, google.com slash plus orange launch radio,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and on YouTube as well, youtube.com slash orange launch radio.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Follow us on all those fantastic websites.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Some housekeeping.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Even though I was gone just this last weekend,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
guess what, guys, I'm really sorry,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
but I'm going to be at another convention November 9th, 10th.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I don't remember what the show day is in there,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
but it's the second week of November.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
It's basically in two weeks,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
so unfortunately there will be no live show that night,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
but good news for podcast listeners,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
really pushing for us to tape something in advance that week

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
so you at least won't have to go the entire week with no o-l-r again.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
That's just the way things worked out.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I'm going to BlizzCon and Final Fantasy Fan Fest,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
but that'll be it.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
No more conventions for me for the year after that,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
so it just happens that they're all kind of back to back.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I will say this, though.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I gave really deep thought to that PlayStation convention that's happening in Vegas.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
You heard about that, right?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
That was all announced while we were out.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Did you hear about this?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
The PlayStation convention that they're going to do in Vegas?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Yeah, so Sony's putting on their own event in Vegas,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
and I really wanted to go.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I just don't think I'm going to be able to make it work financially

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
and with the time away from my day job

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
because I'm doing so much this past month.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I wish I'd had more time.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I wish they gave more notice so I could have prepared more.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I hope those of you guys that do go have a fantastic time, however.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
All right.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Speaking of PlayStation, I think we're going to start off the news tonight

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
with some PS news, right, Loki?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Yes.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
So this is pretty cool.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I just got a system, and now they're going to be rolling out that 2.0 update

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
that's going to add a bunch of cool stuff,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000
including that SharePlay, which was the thing that they were talking about

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
originally when they debuted the PlayStation 4,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
where basically you can connect up with somebody else

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
and do several different things,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
including either playing a couch co-op game with them over the Internet,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
which is pretty awesome,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
or you can literally what they call pass the controller,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
so you can have someone play one of your games that they don't even own

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
and they don't even need a copy of over the Internet.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And so that's going to be pretty cool.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
It's coming out on Tuesday, October 28th.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Along with that, they're going to be also doing the ability to play music

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
from USB drives connected to the console

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
and trying to see what other features that they have in there.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I'm sure a whole bunch of other stuff, a dedicated YouTube app as well.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
So, yeah, a few more days and we'll have this.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I am very much looking forward to this.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I think that SharePlay sounds awesome.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I know they announced this when the PlayStation 4 was first unveiled

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
and they got a lot of shit for not having it out until now.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I kind of wasn't even expecting it to get out this soon.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
And now that I kind of hear about it,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
if it really works as well as it seems to,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
that's going to be a game changer, pun intended.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
That's going to be a really interesting way to try out new games

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
with your friends online.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
It's almost like what Microsoft was talking about with the Xbox One,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
how they wanted to have that library that you could share with friends

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and stuff like that.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
It's almost like kind of how they're implementing it there.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I'd be interested to see if that's something that they end up doing

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.000
on the Xbox One later on down the road, calling it something else

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and just kind of piggybacking on the idea, I guess, if it works out.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Yeah.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Also, very curious, just as somebody who does a lot of the broadcasting things,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
as I know many of you do,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I'm very curious to see what these enhancements to the Twitch

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
and the YouTube integration and all that entails.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
So that's going to be really cool.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I like the fact that we will be able to directly put things on YouTube now

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
instead of me having to copy what I do in ShareFactory to my drive

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
and then taking it over to the computer and doing that whole thing.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
So that's going to be neat.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I wonder if they're going to enable YouTube live streaming

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
because I know that they have that.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
That is a thing, huh?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I keep forgetting that YouTube does have live streaming,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
but it's the same thing as Google Hangouts pretty much, isn't it?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Sort of. I don't know.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
The only other show that I watch on a weekly basis, Cooking with Unity,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
they do their shows live,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and so they broadcast them live on YouTube

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
and then they have the archive up literally minutes later.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
It would be cool to see something like that

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
just because I don't know.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I don't really use Twitch, but I guess I will.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I had a Justin TV account,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
so I hope that got transitioned over at some point.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I'm sure it did.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
If you were marked as a games channel, then it did.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
If you didn't, then it didn't.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I think I've created a secondary one if I did.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I don't ever use it, so whatever.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Moving on to some other news.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Some big news that came out this week in the Wii U world.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.000
One of the other big games this holiday season besides Bayonetta 2 is Smash Bros. Wii U.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Until now, I feel like we've been given the impression

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
that there wasn't going to be a lot of differences

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
between the 3DS and the Wii U versions, which makes sense.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
They want to sell a lot of copies of the 3DS version,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
but then they announced this Nintendo Direct with 50 things

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
that will be unique to the Wii U version.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And I've got to say, the cynic in me was like,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
oh, it will be eight new colors for these new characters,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
and those will be the 50 things, right?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
But then the thing happened, and it was like, wow,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
there is a lot of new stuff that just kind of made the 3DS version

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
really feel like a demo in some ways.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I know the 3DS version has its supporters.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
We got into this conversation a few weeks ago.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Portability has its perks,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
and there's only so much you can put in that 3DS system, right?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
So for the 3DS, it's still a heck of a value.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
It would be kind of weird to see what they could pull off

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
on a Vita or something with that same game,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
being that it has a little bit more processing muscles.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Right, yeah.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
So here's some of the new stuff that's coming to the Wii U version.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
First off, the big one that had everybody talking,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
eight player battles.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Eight people all playing each other.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
That is going to be crazy.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
But is that locally?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I believe it is locally and across.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I don't want to misrepresent that, though.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Hold on, I have a little story on this here.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
If it's over the internet, that might be pretty cool.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Locally, it's one of those things like I never have eight people over.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Well, it would also explain why the 3DSes can be used as controllers.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
That's how you can get more people in there.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Players can use as many as eight Nintendo 3DSes

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
or eight GameCube controllers, but there are some restrictions.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Only seven Wii remotes or Wii U Pro controllers can be used simultaneously,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U only supports a single tablet gamepad.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
So that's how that will work.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And nothing in the face of the earth supports two tablet gamepads.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
By the way, eight player battles have their own stages

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
that will support eight people because those are going to be,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
as you can imagine, quite a mess with all those people in them.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
There's going to be a new board game mode called Smash Tour.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
There's going to be a ton of trophies.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Masterpieces mode returns from Brawl,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
which is basically demos of all the virtual console games that everybody was in.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
You know, something.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
The Stage Builder returns, which you might have forgot was in Brawl.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I remember that. I made a stage.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
But you can now build your own stages in this game as well.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And if you have both of the 3DS and the Wii U version,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
you can get a 2-disc soundtrack if you register them both on Club Nintendo.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And DLC character, a new challenger approaches,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Mewtwo, going to be added to the game in spring of 2015.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
They weren't able to show him in combat, but they announced that he would come.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Still, this opens the door to, well, if they're going to do that one as DLC,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
there's going to be more.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
So, who knows?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Hey, your favorite characters that didn't show up in this one.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000
All those pressed Lucas fans and Ice Climbers fans,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
all the characters that got cut might end up getting something after all.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And who knows?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I mean, maybe the people that are saying,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
oh, God, I'd love to see Bayonetta in the game.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Anything's possible at this point, right?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
So, DLC characters are going to be a thing.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
So, that's pretty cool.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I mean, I was already going to buy it anyway,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
assuming it was just kind of a clone of the 3DS version,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
but it would be on my TV and in HD, and I'd be able to see it.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But then, after seeing this direct,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I was just rubbing my credit card on the screen.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
It's not doing anything type of thing.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
So, I'm very excited about this.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Very, very excited about this. Low-key.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Yeah.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
So, I don't know. I'm hoping that they do something.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Maybe it'll bring back Snake.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Everyone's hoping for Snake to come back,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
even though there's no Metal Gear games on the Wii U,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
and right now it doesn't look like there's going to be.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And I don't think they're going to be bringing back any of the assassins,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
since Ubisoft is actually going to be...

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Hey, Rayman would be a good character.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Speaking of Ubisoft here.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Jade Raymond has actually decided to leave the company.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Now, she was attached to a lot of really big franchises at Ubisoft,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
including, she started off with the Assassin's Creed series,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
and then, of course, Splinter Cell and Watch Dogs, that kind of stuff.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Well, now, after 10 years being at the company,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
she's decided to part ways,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
and kind of, I guess, leading, going on a different path.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I don't know what exactly.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Maybe, maybe she is going the whole indie route,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
because it seems to be that's where all these people are going

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
after they depart these companies for a long time.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It's like, oh, hey, I want to work on this.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Very well could be.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Let me ask the question that I'm sure some cynics are asking,

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
and I kind of don't believe this to be true,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
but I'm going to say it anyway.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Could this be related to the foot-in-mouth Assassin's Creed comment

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
about it's too hard to render female characters?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I don't think so, because I don't think she was working on that one.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
I don't think she was part of...

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Because she started on the first Assassin's Creed game,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
but I don't think she was on the latest one.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Yeah, I don't think...

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Let's be honest.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
But you know people are saying that on Twitter,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
so I just had to bring it up.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
It's okay.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Obviously, it's not harder to render those characters.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.000
It's just extra work to create new characters or something.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It's just something that they've got to do.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
They're cutting corners on a lot of these things.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I don't know, whatever.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Just take it as it is.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
They don't want to put a female character in their game.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
That's it. Done. Whatever.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Not every single game on the face of the earth

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
has to have a female character that's playable in the game.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Same with male characters.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Not every single game out there has to have a male character playable in the game.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Where's my male Samus in Metroid?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
It doesn't matter.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Whatever the game that they want to make has this character,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
and it doesn't have to be fucking equal across the board.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I think what was problematic about that whole thing

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
was more the way they answered it.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
They should have just said,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
this particular story is going to be a male narrative,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
and we didn't render other characters for the co-op mode.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
They did not want to admit that they didn't want to render

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
all these other characters for the co-op mode.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
That's really what it came down to.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
But anyway, that's a months-old debate.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
It's pointless at this point.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It's stupid. I mean, come on.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It's dumb.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Whatever. It is what it is.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
of some games that are coming out very soon,

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
of which, ironically, isn't the new Assassin's Creed on deck for the US this week?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I could be wrong. It's really soon.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
You would have been right if they hadn't moved the dates.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Oh, I didn't realize they moved it.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Yeah, because they wanted to put it out at the same time

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
as the Assassin's Creed Rogue game,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
which is coming out later in November on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But since it's not coming out right then,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
they just didn't do it.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
But anyways, so this week,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
a game that I probably would have picked up had I bought an Xbox One.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
But Sunset Overdrive coming out on Xbox One,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
one of the best-looking games, I think, out of E3 this year.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
So that's something to look forward to picking up this week.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And hopefully, hopefully, they go the route like they did with Rise and Dead Rising,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Sure, it's exclusive to the Xbox One, but we're going to see a PC version sometime.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Lords of the Fallen on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.000
We've got Disney's Big Hero 6 on 3DS and Nintendo DS.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
No, this is almost the same title as the movie,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Danger of the Ooze.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000
It's a new game coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and I think the 3DS.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Freedom Wars from Sony coming out on the Vita.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Probably was going to be the last Vita game that they're going to put out from Sony there.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Assassin's Creed The Americas Collection,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000
which is a re-release of Assassin's Creed 4 and Assassin's Creed 3.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
The Murica Collection.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Murica and then Liberation as well.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
So that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Yeah, no Wii U, sorry.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
MX vs ATV Supercross on PS3 and 360.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000
And let's see, WWE 2K15 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
And I want to say it's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, although maybe that was delayed.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I think that was delayed.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And then, also delayed.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
NBA Live 15 coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Hopefully this year doesn't suck.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And Power Rangers Super Megaforce.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
They're just making up names now and that's on 3DS.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And The Legend of Korra, a new era begins on 3DS

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
because that was the only game that actually got a physical release.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
All the other ones were on digitally.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
That's it.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Alright, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases there on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Metro Redo is on the PlayStation 4.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And Oni Chambara, Z2 Chaos.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Hey, there's something you can import for the PS4, Loki.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:04.000
You better believe it that I am importing Earth Defense 4 or whatever the hell they're calling the new one on PlayStation 4.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Of course.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
On the Xbox One in Japan this week, Metro Redo is there as well.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And Sunset Overdrive, day one edition.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
It also sees its Japanese release this coming week.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel makes its way to Japan.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
We got it first here in the States, but Japan's getting it this coming week.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
That is also happening on the Xbox 360 for all those Japanese 360 owners.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
On the Wii U, sadly nothing to report.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
The next big release over there is on November the 13th.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
So things are a little dry there on the Wii U front.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:42.000
But on the 3DS, there's Illuminage Ibun Ame no Mi Hashira Kai comes out this week from Starfish.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
This game is... I'm trying to figure out what this is.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
There's no screenshots or nothing.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000
It just looks like anime characters holding swords and a cute little like cat avatar character.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
So maybe somebody in chat knows a little more about this than I do.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
But there's no screenshots or anything for me to tell you what that game's all about.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So let's travel over to Europe.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Dark Soccer's not here tonight, but I am.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
So I will tell you about what is coming out in Europe.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And on the 28th, we have MX vs ATV Supercross on PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Mac.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I believe I saw this one at E3.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And it was like a little racing game, but of course it uses the motorcycles.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000
It kind of felt like what Iron Man's super off-road might look like in motorcycles in 3D.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
That's kind of what it looked like to me.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Which one?

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
You remember Iron Man?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
MX vs ATV Supercross.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
What was it?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
MX vs ATV Supercross.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
There's other games in this series that are out there.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Yeah, this is the first one that I think they've put out since Nordic took them over.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Because it used to be THQ.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Correct.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
It is.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000
It is.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
On the 29th, you have Freedom Wars on the Vita.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And The Unfinished Swan gets its PlayStation 4 and Vita release.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And then on the 30th of October, Farming Simulator 15 on the PC.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I know we got Farming Simulator fans out there.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
If you want it on consoles, it's coming out in January.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Did you know I took a picture of something Farming Simulator.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
They had a cute mascot or something at E3.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And they got some Twitter rando that was like, tell me more, tell me more.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I was like, dang, Farming Simulator has some hardcore fans out there.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
They seriously do.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
And I think their first version is going to be on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Or maybe just PlayStation 4.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
That's coming out in January.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Do not confuse it with Farmville or they will kick your ass.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition on PC and Mac.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And on Halloween or the 31st of October in Europe, Sunset Overdrive.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Walking Dead Season 1 for Xbox One.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Walking Dead Game of the Year Edition for PlayStation 4.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Walking Dead Season 2 for PlayStation 4.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Walking Dead Season 2 for Xbox One.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And WWE 2K15, PS3, and Xbox 360.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were delayed to November 9th, I think of it.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Yeah.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
That was one of the things that happened while I was still working at my old company.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Ah, gotcha.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Did you start the new job already, by the way? Are you still on your break?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
No, I was an alternate for the first class and because it's such a good company, everybody showed up.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
But hey, I got paid for two hours even though I was there for only like five minutes.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
So it's all good.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Dope.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I do start officially on the 5th.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
There you go. Alright.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I'm not an alternate this time. First in line.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Awesome.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Yeah.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Alright, let's go to a few more news stories.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And then the classic game of the week, which, you know, when Dark Soccer is not here, we take it over.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
And it was Loki's turn this week, pick classic game of the week.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
So Loki's gonna pick one in just a minute here. But first, some news.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.000
This should be just filed under, like, you gotta be fucking stupid to do this in the first place.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
But you did it, so suffer the consequences.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But apparently, a guy, Mike Malbeck, who is an indie developer who, part of an indie development team, I guess.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
They created a game called Paranautical Activity.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.000
It was a Steam game, like a first-person shooter voxel-looking retro-styled game or something.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
And he had some issues where, I guess, they were doing, like, a sale or something to that effect.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And it was listing the game as early access, even though it wasn't an early access game.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
It was early access at one point, but now it's like the full version of the game.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.000
And he got really miffed that he couldn't, you know, change that.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.000
And so he did what any sane, logical person would do. He went to Twitter and said,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I'm gonna go kill Gabe Newell. He is gonna die.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And apparently, you know, people don't like that sort of thing.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:38.000
So Valve pulled the game off of, you know, the sale, and they, you know, ceased their relationship with the developer.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Good. What a fucking idiot. Sorry, not sorry. What a fucking idiot.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:50.000
They're like, yeah, we don't really want to do business with people that make death threats, so sorry, you know.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And of course, you know, later on, you know, the Mike Malmak guy, he's basically leaving the developer code avarice,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:06.000
and he sold his half of the company, and he won't be making any money from it, distancing himself as far away from it as he can.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:13.000
But you gotta be fucking stupid. Like, seriously, just, I understand you're frustrated,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
but, you know, if you're gonna say, oh, I'm gonna fucking kill those guys at Valve, you know,

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000
do it in, like, not a public forum if you're gonna make those kind of things.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Like, say it to yourself and shake your fist at the sky or something, but just, like, don't, like...

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Especially with the state of gaming and social media the past couple months.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And y'all know what I'm talking about. I don't have to get into it, alright?

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
But especially with how volatile everything has been. We've been in, like, code orange, right?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Okay, if, like, gaming had an alert system, we'd be in, like, code orange right now.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Especially as how volatile everything has been in the industry.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Like, haven't we learned yet that making death threats is not okay ever?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And for, like, somebody who develops games to be doing that is just, like, get out of the pool. You out.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.000
And you do realize that Gabe Newell isn't the only person that works at Valve that's, you know,

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
he's not behind a computer, he's, like, setting up your fucking game and shit, you know, for the sales.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
It's not this one dude in, like...

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Even if you knew the guy that did it or gal that did it, still not okay. I want to make that perfectly clear.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:28.000
But, yeah, I mean, everybody at Valve does everything, though. Nobody has a title at Valve, right?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Except for Gabe.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Whatever. But, yeah, so, Gabe pulled off there, but, you know, of course, he's just like,

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000
eh, it's no big deal. It's, you know, we sold 12 copies off of Steam, so we're gonna be okay. Whatever.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:50.000
But, yeah, it's just a lesson in common sense, you know, as if we even need to tell you, just don't make death threats.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, these people have to understand that Twitter isn't a place to be venting out frustrations over something because it will cost you your job.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:05.000
This is true in a lot of different facets, and just, you know, with social media becoming more and more a part of culture,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:13.000
I'm just telling you, in general, this even goes beyond video games. Like, if you are really fucking pissed off about something, anything,

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
if you are really, really mad about something, put your goddamn phone down.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Put it down, put it away, get it far away from you so that you are not tempted to write something stupid.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And I'm not even just talking about, like, death threats, but just, like, you know, stupid shit, complaining about, you know, complaining about where you work,

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:40.000
where you have a public Twitter, where your company may be big enough where they have, like, social media people that search Twitter for the name.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I mean, like, that kind of shit can get you in so much trouble. It's, like, just a life lesson here.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:54.000
When you are pissed off, get away from your computer ASAP, whether it's gaming or anything.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:05.000
So, now, of course, you know, if you can do it in a reasonable manner, you know, because sometimes you can complain to companies, like, you know, tweet at Taco Bell,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000
that quesarito really sucked, you know, or something like that. That's a little bit different.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
That quesarito makes me want to die, really.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:20.000
True story, I had a quesarito today for the first time. I got through two bites before I was like, this is fucking disgusting.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Anyway.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Quesarito in the potty, I don't know. I can't make a pun joke with that.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Our pal Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying, there was so, so much I wanted to say this morning on something not vog-related, and I had to put the phone down.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Jason in chat says, super good advice, spread happy, not vitriol. See, I'll suggest always keep accounts set to private.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
You know, I kind of feel like, though, that might not always be an option.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:57.000
You know, like, I feel like I have more to gain from a public account because I have these public-facing things that I do,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:06.000
but I do try really hard to keep my work life or my OLR podcasting life or whatever separate from, you know, the rest of my life.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
But Bobby, don't you know they cast the shows differently in London than they do over here?

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I mean, after all, there is the UK office and the US office, right?

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Sorry, I feel free, man. That's terrible.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Alright. Anyway, let's move on. Talking about 3D Realms. 3D Realms is, of course, a classic PC publisher,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:40.000
and, you know, so many great games from back in the day, like Duke Nukem, of course, back when Duke Nukem was a side scroller.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Hell yeah.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Commander Keen, also amazing.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
When am I getting my next Commander Keen game?

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I don't know. Well, maybe if they sell enough copies of this because the 3D Realms Anthology is now available at 3drealms.com,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.000
and it's a collection that has games like Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Commander Keen, Goodbye Galaxy, Wolfenstein 3D,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Rise of the Triad, Dark War, and all these other classic games. It's in a DRM-free package.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Where's my Redneck Rampage? Didn't they do that one? I thought that was in the Duke Nukem 3D engine.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I will look here, but there are some games available for free, so if you want to check out Alien Carnage,

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Major Striker, and Stargunner, I mean, come on, they're not going to give away Commander Keen for free,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:30.000
but these other games, you can get those for free. Now, the article I'm reading says that the pack is $19.99,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000
but actually, looking on the site, it's $39.99, so I'm not sure if it was, like, on sale for a couple days,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000
and then they raised the price back up, but it's $39.99 for the Anthology, so you can check that out.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
But, I mean, that's a lot of classic games available there, so...

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Now, just so you know, 3D Realms, the staff has been gone since 2008, because remember, like,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Gearbox had to pick up Duke Nukem and all that, right? Duke Nukem and the other PC franchises,

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.000
they did retain the rights to this. Developer Interceptor Entertainment, who made Rise of the Triad,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
acquired Apogee Software earlier this year, so now they control the associated IP and branding.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
It's complicated. Who owns all that stuff? That's why there isn't a new King game.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000
The next time, another Duke Nukem game, because I'm still going to forget who owns what.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:23.000
And Dungeon Buster in chat says Redneck Rampage was pubbed by Interplay, so it was a little bit different arrangement there.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
So, again, makes things complicated.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Damn it. Redneck Rampage would be perfect for a remake.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Yeah.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Let somebody get Devolver Digital on that.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Alright, well, let's take a walk down memory lane here in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:51.000
And, as you know, Dark Soccer will usually step into the vault and pick out a game that she thinks is worthy of being a classic,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
and, hey, you guys should be playing this game this week.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000
So, the rules to be a Classic Game of the Week is that the game has to be ten years old or more.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
That is what we call a classic game.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Dark Soccer, of course, is not here tonight, so I think I filled in for her the past two or three times,

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
so I was like, you know what, Loki, it's well past your turn.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Loki tonight is going to pick the Classic Game of the Week with Dark Soccer moving this week.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
So, Loki, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
The Classic Game of the Week just turned ten years old today.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Ten years old today.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Today. Today is the tenth anniversary of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:38.000
One of the best PlayStation 2, Xbox, 3D action games ever.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
It was seriously the best Grand Theft Auto game up until 4 and 5,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000
and had one of the largest maps in the whole game.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Basically, it came out October 26, 2004 on PlayStation 2,

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:59.000
later in June the following year on Xbox and PC.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Ironically enough, they actually re-released it today on Xbox 360 in the HD version,

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:12.000
which you can pick up for the price of the games on demand version, which is only like $3.74.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
It's ridiculously cheap, so go check that out.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:21.000
But the game followed around kind of an ex-gang banger, CJ.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.000
He comes home after his mom's been murdered back to Los Santos,

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
which is kind of the modern day LA.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And the whole game is set in the 90s, which is cool.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000
It had one of the greatest soundtracks ever.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:44.000
But anyways, he comes back and finds the gang's kind of torn apart,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000
and he has to regroup his gang and fight against cops,

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
and find out who actually murdered his mother and stuff like that.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:01.000
What's kind of cool is the game takes place not only in the fictional state of San Andreas,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
which is like California and Nevada,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
and takes place in Los Santos, which is kind of LA,

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
San Fierro, which is San Francisco-ish,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
and Las Venturas, which is kind of like Las Vegas.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.000
So it was the first time it was like a multi-city game, which is pretty awesome.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
It was one of the best-selling games of...

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
It became one of the best-selling games on PlayStation 2.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
27 million copies.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000
It's still one of the best-selling games of all time.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Oh, it is the best-selling game of all time on PlayStation 2, so that's pretty awesome.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Of course, one of the things that made the game infamous was the fact that

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:50.000
there was some content that was taken out of the game that later modders found,

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
which kind of brought this whole controversy with the ESRB,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
known as the Hot Coffee mod,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
where it's a hidden sex game that they're going to have in the game,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
since you can date a bunch of people in the actual game.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
You can make girlfriends and stuff like that.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.000
It was also the first Grand Theft Auto game that featured co-op,

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
and not a lot of people realized this,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
but you can actually, if you date those girlfriends,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:22.000
you can go out and have a person with you playing on the second controller,

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
and you can go shoot up stuff in Grand Theft Auto.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
It was awesome.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
It's been released on a bunch of different platforms,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:39.000
aside from the original release on PlayStation 2 and on the original Xbox.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
It's been released on Mac, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:49.000
They also did some of these HD versions on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Kindle,

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
that kind of stuff.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And they said, of course, they just took down the original game off the Xbox Live Store,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
and they were saying that they're going to re-release an enhanced version

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
to celebrate the 10th anniversary.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Well, that was released today, so pretty awesome.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Do you know what is mind-fucking me right now?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Because we talk about this game turned 10 years old today, right?

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
And this game was highly controversial because of the hot coffee mod.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Okay, get this.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Episode 28 of the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition,

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
back when it was a separate thing,

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
taped July 11th, 2005.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
One of our top stories, rock star investigated by the ESRB over hot coffee.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And then Episode 29 on July 18th of 2005 was a follow-up about this whole thing.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000
I was like, I remember this was an early thing we talked about on OLR.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I still have the hot coffee version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on PlayStation 2.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Oh, my God.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
It's awesome.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
But, yeah, they had a bunch of other features in the game.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Of course, tons of vehicles in there.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:02.000
It was the first time, well, actually, no, I believe they had airplanes in there.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Also, they had a jet pack which was hidden in the game, which was kind of fun.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
You can sneak into an Area 51 type thing.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
All sorts of weapons.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
You can swim underwater.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
It's the first game to add BMX bikes.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
So you can do tricks and stuff with your BMX bike if you really wanted to.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Like, all this extra stuff.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
They had a bunch of different kind of RPG elements like gang wars.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.000
You can mod your card, a bunch of different side missions, burglary.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Lots of fun stuff like that.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000
And Hitstone wants to know, why is the background music replaced by dialogue?

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Can we put on Radio Los Santos or something?

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
We're actually doing that because we don't want to get copyright strikes on YouTube.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I mean, the music in the game was notable for being a lot of great licensed songs.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
So, unfortunately, we don't want to replay that.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000
So, sorry, you guys get the very coarse dialogue from the game that many people remember.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
All sorts of F and S and other bombs galore in the background there.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Yes.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
And, of course, won a bunch of game awards there.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
2004 Spike TV Video Game Awards.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
It was a game of the year.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Best performance by human mail.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Best action game.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Best soundtrack.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
They even have a lot of big names in there.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000
I want to say Samuel L. Jackson did Officer Tenpenny in there.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I'm trying to remember all the different actors that are in there,

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:24.000
but there's just a lot of different people in the game.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
But, yeah, great game.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I mean, it was one of those games that I took off work to go play.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Actually, I want to say I've done that with every single Grand Theft Auto game.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
But, yeah.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And, of course, one of the big games that I want to say, even like the ESRB,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
and I want to say Jack Thompson were even kind of rallying behind this.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:50.000
This is the reason why you should be banning games because they're terrible.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
But, yeah.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
So, that's it.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
All right.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Dressed by a hare on its tenth birthday, the day it becomes eligible.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
There it is.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Grand Theft Auto.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Oh, here we go.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Here's a list of some of the celebrities in there.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.000
David Cross, Andy Dick, Ron Foster, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Peter Fonda,

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Charlie Murphy, Frank Vincent, Chris Penn, Dan Dyer, Sarah Tanaka.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Wil Wheaton was in there.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
They had different rappers.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Icy, Chuck D. Frost, MCIte, also the game, George Clinton, Axl Rose, Sly and Robbie,

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Sean Ryder, Young Melee.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I mean, Young Melee, of course, did Carl.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And, hopefully, with this being the tenth anniversary and stuff,

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
and Grand Theft Auto 5 also taking place in Los Santos,

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
we're going to get some sort of DLC.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I think CJ is going to be coming back.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
You think some type of crossover might be the worst.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Yeah, I think so.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
That'd be cool.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Hopefully.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
That'd be cool.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Maybe on the tenth anniversary of the hot coffee controversy is just in time for that.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000
They should call it that.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:02.000
They should call it like the cappuccino mod or something that references it without saying it.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
That would crack me the hell up.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
We'll see.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Of course, then again, if you're a rock star, you probably want to get the hell away from all that business.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000
All right, there's your classic game of the week.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Of course, Loki picked Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
But you know what? It really is.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I saw a comment in the chat room here that was,

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
I don't like this game.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
What is this?

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Oh, here it is.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Bojokawa says, great choice.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Don't like the game, but great choice.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Even people that weren't so into this, you kind of recognize what a huge title it was in gaming,

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
and the fact that you managed to do it on its tenth birthday.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
That's pretty good.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
It just happened to work out that way.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Yeah.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
All right, well, there it is.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Part A of our show.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
But we've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
We have more news.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
The Fugu Question of the Week.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000
And oh, by the way, did I mention the retro guys that were on the show earlier?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
They left behind a little giveaway.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Something, something.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:59.000
So we'll give you some details on that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Tonight with our 572nd episode, October the 26th of 2014.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000
And if you're tuning in to hear our interview with Read Retro Magazine, you're too late.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000
It happened already.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
It was in the first part of the show, but don't worry.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000
It will be on the podcast feed later tonight after we wrap up the show.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.000
And that was a great interview there with Mike and Mark from Retro Magazine.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
In fact, I think Mark is still in our chat room there.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:40.000
So if you guys have any other questions or so forth, you can ask Mark who's in our chat there right now.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
And I will say this.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Those guys over at Retro Magazine were kind enough to leave behind for us to give away a year's subscription to the print version of the magazine.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
So we're going to be giving that away.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000
We'll open that up to both our live and our podcast listeners so that everything is fair.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000
So check out that a little later because I want to give that away around our Frugal Question of the Week.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Because our Frugal Question of the Week kind of ties into this as well, the whole retro stuff.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Anyway, speaking of retro.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:18.000
So during the break tonight, I played some scary songs to go along with the fact that Halloween is this Friday.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Are you going to do any trick-or-treating with the kids?

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Are you probably still too young?

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I'm not. I'm staying home with the baby.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
But my son's going out as Captain America.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
So he's going out with his friend from preschool.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
That'll be fun.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
So in Halloween, I played some scary songs.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.000
And one of them that I played was a retro classic that I loved.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Friday the 13th, which had a great soundtrack.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Like even if you hated the game, the soundtrack was still pretty awesome there.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
So we played that during the break tonight.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
It kind of had me thinking about that game and how it really gets shit on.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
I think in a lot of people's memory.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
But I kind of enjoyed it.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
It used to legit scare the hell out of me.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
And I think it was because the music was so good.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Like when you were in the little...

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Because you would go around if you never played it.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:18.000
You played counselors at a camp trying to prevent Jason from killing either the other counselors or the children that for some reason lived in the middle of the lake.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I figured that was the safest spot to put him in.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
So you played these counselors and went around.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000
So when you'd actually go into the other cabins and come across Jason, it would scare the hell out of me.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Because you'd actually be going through the NES-style 3D.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Where it's like move forward, it's a big old jump.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Turn left, the whole screen changes.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
And then all of a sudden it would go...

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
And Jason would come out of nowhere and you'd have to fight him.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And usually he'd kick your ass.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Because that game was really, really hard.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
You could run away from him, I think.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
And then he would actually chase after you in the 2D section of the game as well.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Yeah, and then sometimes he would be in the lake.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
You'd be rowing across the lake and he'd just be in the lake and it would be boom boom boom.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
And you couldn't do shit about it.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
You couldn't hurt him or anything.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000
And then when you would kill Jason, of course he came back at least two more times before you officially beat the game.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
So that game was impossible.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Any classic games that get dumped on, Loki?

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
That everybody seems to hate, but you seem to appreciate?

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Like, why does everybody hate this game but me?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Not to put you on the spot, I didn't prep you on this topic.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
So I'm just curious if anything comes to mind.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Ask this of our chat room as well over at live.voguenetwork.com.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Is there any retro classic everybody shits on?

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
But you're like, it wasn't that bad.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Leave it alone.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I can't think of anything off the top of my head that was like that.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I'm sure there's something that I like that a lot of people didn't like.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I don't know.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000
There were games I like that I feel like nobody's ever heard of.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Like on the Super Nintendo, one of my favorite games to this day was Equinox, which was the sequel to Solstice.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I think a lot of people knew that one on the NES.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
But it was a rare Sony game.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I remember, Sony didn't start making consoles.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.000
So Sony published this game on the Super Nintendo and it was amazing.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
It was that whole 3D isometric thing.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
But I don't think people hated that game.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
There's probably nobody ever heard of it.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
So let's see.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Some folks in chat talking about Friday the 13th.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Mark from Retro says, LJN's only good game, I think.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
ActDef says, LJN had some good games, but they were mostly crap.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
ActDef is suggesting Earth Defense Force 2017.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
People like that though.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
No one's arguing that it's a high quality game.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
That's not the case.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Everybody that plays it, they have fun with it.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
That's the thing.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Obviously if you're going to read a review score, it's like, well those graphics suck.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
The physics are terrible.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Yeah, of course. Those are all true facts about that game.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
It's just fun though.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Just play it because it's fun.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Dungeon Buster says, Deadly Towers.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Controls took some getting used to, but when she figured some things out, it was not quite as horrible as some others.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Let's see. Rama says, A notable LJN game was Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Oh, I remember that one.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Mark from Retro says, My favorite Resident Evil was Outbreak 1 and 2 for PlayStation 2. So underrated.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Let's see.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Kaijuto says, The Nightmare on Elm Street game with 4 player co-op was my favorite and people shit on it.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Back to the Future 2 is another one for me.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Oh, wait. Back to the Future 2 on NES?

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Yeah.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Even Back to the Future 2 and 3, but it's...

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Yeah, I bought that game because I was like, oh, that looks sweet because Back to the Future 1 looked pretty awesome.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.000
You know, as an NES game and I played 2 and 3, I'm like, god, these are fucking terrible.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000
It's just like so terrible and I got the cheat code to get Back to the Future 3.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I'm like, oh cool, it's Back to the Future 3. Oh wait, it's still fucking terrible.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Let's see. S3100Matt says, I know plenty of people who didn't like Thekster.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
That was one of the few games I grew up with on my i286.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Now, Cuntinues in our chatroom flips this around a little bit saying, everyone loves the first Silent Hill, but I think it's not that great.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000
We can have a whole other conversation on what game is fucking overrated.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
But we'll have to have that on another episode because we have some rapid fire news to get into.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Let's be fair though. I say it's overrated, but honestly, I've never played it.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000
What game?

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Ocarina of Time.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Ocarina of Time.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
See, I just don't like the look of it.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
No, now we're gonna get emails.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:35.000
No, no, no, stop, stop. Here's a game that people don't like that I like a lot and that would be Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
People hate the art style in that. Absolutely hate it. I think it was fantastic.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I think that showed off the graphics on the GameCube really well.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I think that's the art direction that they should have gone with on the Wii to make their games look even better.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
But, whatever.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Alright, sorry chatters. Now the chatters are answering the other questions. Sorry chatters, we're rolling that over to another day.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:04.000
We have still plenty more show to go. We gotta get your calls later in the show at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
But first, some news. Loki.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Alright, so a little bit of rapid fire stuff here.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000
We've got a million copies sold of the Stanley Parable.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:21.000
That's awesome because that's a pretty sweet game and if you haven't played it yet, you really should.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:32.000
But yes, a million copies sold of that. On top of that, if you're kind of a fan of those building games, not necessarily like a voxel game.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I mean, it's a sort of voxel, but Space Engineers sold a million copies as well.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.000
So, that's awesome. That is for indie developers. That is something that's incredibly hard to do.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Congrats, that's amazing.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Finally, we've got, oh let's see here. Also, another game for Mojang that you might not hear a lot about, but Scrolls.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Scrolls now is going to be exiting the beta stage and it's going to be releasing the game, I believe, November is going to be coming out.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:13.000
The first real version of the game that's not like a beta stage type thing.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Is this now a Microsoft product though?

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
No, I don't think it is.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Oh, I thought Microsoft bought all the stuff that Mojang had.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Maybe they did, I don't know. It's still under Mojang, but that's going to be coming out.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.000
They said also that they're going to be dropping the price of the PC version of the game from $20 to $5.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Probably right. And then they're going to launch it on iOS and it's going to be free, but you're going to be able to use an in-app purchase to pay for the full version or something like that.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Neat. I don't know. Once again, for me, it's not as appealing as say Minecraft.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I'm curious. Plus, a lot of this, and I talked about the Microsoft connection a minute there, a lot of that is probably still kind of transitioning.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.000
This is probably one of the things where this was already planned before that all took place.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:11.000
But I'm curious. I like that they're going to have the free version, at least on the phones, even though I might prefer to play this on the PC.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:20.000
At least I'd be able to try it and kind of get a sense for is this my type of game, yes or no, before I commit that $5 to it, which is a pretty good deal.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:28.000
And then this is pretty cool. They're going to be putting out a game called The Doctor and the Dalek, which is a web-based game.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Featuring, of course, Doctor Who. And it teaches kids on how to code.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:43.000
So I think that's pretty sweet. They're going to have Peter Capaldi playing the Doctor in that.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:52.000
And I think anything that's out there to teach kids on how to do that stuff is fantastic.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:02.000
And the game, of course, if you're in the UK, is going to be free. You can find it. It was at bbc.co.uk slash cbbc.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And, yeah, I think that's pretty awesome. And, you know, hopefully if you live in the UK or I'm sure there's going to be a way to get around any sort of region locks.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Oh, especially with the Doctor Who fans. They will not be kept away.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:29.000
I think it's awesome to have any sort of way to be able to teach your kids about programming. That should be something that's included.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.000
We've come a long way from Rocky's Boots. I'll say that. That was the programming game I remember.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Although I've got to say, being not a guy familiar with Doctor Who or anything, I don't know. It looks pretty cool.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Alright, well, Amiibo. That whole thing, you know, the Nintendo Amiibo figures, which, Loki, I mean, you think you might pick them up or no way?

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I haven't seen any sort of actual uses for them other than being collectible figures. I mean, they kind of look cool as collectible figures. I just don't really want to pay for them.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Check out the Nintendo Direct. They get into it a little bit with the Super Smash Brothers.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Yeah, I get it. They're AI players that you can level up. I don't give a shit about that. All it is, you know what they made it for is fucking Pokemon.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:24.000
You level them up by having them, you know, you train them to level up and then you can play them in the game. It's fucking Pokemon. It's going to be Pokemon.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:31.000
If the figures are of a nice quality, then that alone will be worth it. But if they're kind of crap, then never mind.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Doesn't, it's, I just don't see the point yet. Like, why do I care about, you know, fighting an AI player that gets harder or like playing as a character in Mario Kart or something? Just, no.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Well, maybe you will enjoy Amiibo a little more in this. It was announced this week that Amiibo will work with Hyrule Warriors. But now, don't go thinking like every single character is going to suddenly show up in Hyrule Warriors. It's not how it works.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:10.000
If you buy the Link figure, Super Smash Brothers for Wii U has the Link figure, of course, coming out. That Link figure can be registered with Hyrule Warriors. There's no other detail about this.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:22.000
However, Nintendo is set to announce more about this soon, probably towards November 21st when Smash Brothers for Wii U comes out. So there will be some sort of functionality for Hyrule Warriors Amiibo there.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Yeah, I guess it would be kind of cool if, like, you can level up cross games. Like, you know, if I have my Link character or something like that. If I play Hyrule Warriors, he'll go up levels. And if I play Smash Brothers, he'll go up more levels.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Now, I wonder if that might be something, and you might actually be on it, the pulse of what that is. That maybe you can somehow level up your Link Amiibo and then take it over to this game. That would be kind of neat to have that synergy within the Nintendo games.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:52.000
I still think it'd be cooler, though, if you could bring in Mario and put him into Hyrule Warriors.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000
See, that's kind of cool, but, you know, I just, I don't know.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000
That's a lot of rendering and resources.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:06.000
It's not a lot of rendering. Come on, they can render Mario. They can render females in that game. They can render Mario.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:13.000
SSJ100 Matt says, so no Duck Hunt Dog in Hyrule Warriors? Alas, probably not, my friend. Probably not.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Hey, in Donkey Kong, like, I'm not talking about the character or the Amiibo. I'm talking about the 80s arcade game Donkey Kong.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:31.000
About 30 years after this game originally came out, a fan went through Donkey Kong and actually found some unused music and voiceovers within the game.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:39.000
This was discovered while looking through the game's original code. There were some quick music clips and some short snippets of Pauline actually speaking,

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:46.000
hey, and help, because remember, the lady at the top of the board there that you're trying to rescue is not Princess Toadstool.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000
In the original Donkey Kong, her name was actually Pauline. So Pauline can say, hey, and help.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
The vicious cycle that Mario got himself into.

01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:00.000
So, there you go. So that's kind of neat. You can check those out there over on YouTube and around the various blogs there.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:08.000
As I mentioned, Bayonetta 2 came out this past week. Nintendo definitely wants to get awareness out there that Bayonetta 2 is available.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:14.000
They've chosen some very interesting partners to do so. Nintendo has joined up with Playboy.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:22.000
That's right, the magazine you get for the articles. Nintendo has joined up with Playboy to promote Bayonetta 2.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Playmate Pamela Horton, who is Miss October 2012, actually, for lack of a better term, put on the cosplay.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000
And then shortly after took it off.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:42.000
And all this can be found on Playboy's official site. And my understanding is that Pamela is a gamer and a Nintendo fangirl herself.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:49.000
So they actually picked somebody. They didn't just pick her because she happens to look like Bayonetta. They picked her because she's a fan.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:59.000
So that's pretty cool. Not gonna do a lot of favors for the whole Bayonetta's over-sexualized argument.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:08.000
But, alright. You know what though? All I'm gonna say is that, you know, there is a lot of excess.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:15.000
For better or for worse, excess exists in the video game industry. When I say excess, I mean things like Grand Theft Auto.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Excessive amounts of violence. Like almost a parody of itself level of violence, right?

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Something like Dead or Alive with breasts. An excessive amount of that, right? Excess...

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.000
That's just Tecmo. Not Tecmo, Team Ninja.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:39.000
If we want video games to be considered art, which I think many gamers do consider games art, there's always gonna be that excess within art.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
I think I said this before on an earlier OLR. Maybe it was Hoard House.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:50.000
In movies, you have people like John Waters that are going to really push the envelope of film.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.000
In art, you have people like Andy Warhol that push the envelope there too.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:59.000
There's always gonna be these excess sorts of games and I kinda think Bayonetta's one of those games.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:05.000
It's camp to me. I don't take it too seriously. I mean, how fucking could you?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000
It's really, really over the top camp.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
So, I guess if that's how they want to try to sell it, then I hope it works out for them.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Because I do want to see this game do well. I would like to see a Bayonetta 3 happen someday.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000
But we'll see. We'll see. It depends on how well this one does.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Alright, let's take a step over to our FUGL question of the week.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:34.000
That's right. When you take Facebook and Google and you throw those words together, you get FUGL.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000
It's time for the FUGL question of the week.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
And over on our communities, we asked a question.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.000
You know, usually when we have interviews on the show, which we've been fortunate to have quite a few lately,

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000
we like to ask questions that kind of tie into the interviews we had.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:58.000
So, we said, what is an article that you'd want to read about a classic retro game?

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Do you want some behind the scenes gossip about the development of a certain game?

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Or do you want to compare or contrast with a modern game?

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
What kinds of things would you like to read about in a magazine like Retro?

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
So, we got some answers here.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.000
On Facebook, we have Gene W. who replied saying,

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I think an article about classic games like Mario 64 and Zelda Ocarina of Time being reviewed

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:26.000
as if it was a new game currently after 20 years of gaming evolution would be interesting.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:32.000
You know, the closest thing I've seen to something like this would be like when re-releases happen.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Like when Ocarina of Time 3D came out on the 3DS.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.000
It's very interesting to see how a lot of reviewers have to kind of walk that line of it's a classic,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
but a lot of them don't really, though.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
They just kind of, well, I guess when they remake them, it's a little bit different,

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000
but sometimes when they're just being ported over, it's like, well, just read our original review here

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000
and we'll tell you what the differences are between this version and this one.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Serping Slurpee. I never can say that.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Serping Slurpee responds,

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Greetings from Cleveland, Ohio.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:08.000
And Ohio is all in caps, I think in reference perhaps to a show of ours a couple of weeks ago

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
where we may have pissed some people off.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
I've always been a Sega fanboy.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000
When discussing console wars, people focus on Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox,

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000
but they omit such important consoles as Sega Saturn and Dreamcast.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Both were groundbreaking to their respective generations.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.000
What circumstances led to their early demise?

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Without losers, there could be no winners.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Ooh, that's a very interesting little last sentence there.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Kind of examining the phoenix of games, so to speak, how we rise up from the ashes, I guess,

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000
with these consoles that may have failed.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
That's a very interesting perspective.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
They could still make a comeback.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:46.000
I'm confident that Sega could make a comeback if they wanted to.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Well, you know what's funny is I was playing Bayonetta 2,

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
and I don't remember if it was Alan or Seamus.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Somebody walked into the room and was like,

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000
are you playing a Sega Dreamcast game?

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Because this looks like a freaking Dreamcast game.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
And the more I thought about it, I was kind of like,

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Bayonetta totally is a game that would have been on Dreamcast.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
But it makes sense. Sega's involved.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Anyway, Raginator says, I'd like to read a retrospective of early to mid-90s console gaming.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:16.000
The 16-bit console wars, the advent of certain genres like fighting and FMV games,

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:22.000
the seemingly explosion of consoles, i.e. Super Nintendo, Genesis, 3DO, CDi, Neo Geo, etc.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000
That's like a whole year's worth of magazines right there, Raginator.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
That's a big topic.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
But yes, lots of good stuff.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Let's go over to Google Plus because we do have a few answers over there on our Google Plus page,

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:38.000
which of course is google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
And some of our responses there. We have three comments there.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000
At Def says, maybe about game ROMs and emulation.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I know it's taboo for many, but let me explain.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I would actually like to read about people working on fan translations and making a game

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
that probably didn't see the light of day in America.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Understandable for us.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Or even interviews of localizing teams back in the day.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000
You know, sometimes this happens though after the fact, you know, legitimately.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I keep thinking of that one Genesis game.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.000
It was like, you know, years after the fact they translated it from like a Taiwan game.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.000
You know, they actually translated it into English, you know, and that was released.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:18.000
So sometimes it's not necessarily questionable legalities.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Sometimes this happens way after the fact completely legitimately with all licenses intact.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000
But yes, I agree though. The fan translations are really something.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:33.000
And to this day, you know, when they translated Second Detsetsu 3 into English, that was huge.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.000
And that still to this day remains a game that for whatever reason,

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Square Enix has not wanted to give out officially in English.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Yet there's such a demand for it out there, there's that ROM, you know, the ROM.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
And we all know it's there.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
You know, we all know it's out there.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Anyway, Tom W. says,

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I'd really like an in-depth article on how to build a rockin' MAME or multi-system cabinet,

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
complete with diagrams, software, configs, and tool lists.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Well, now again, you get into that little bit of a legal gray area,

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
because how legal is MAME?

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000
What? There's all these public domain ROMs.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000
So I think as long as we stuck to a conversation, and maybe that could be about,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
here's how to build a perfectly legal MAME machine.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.000
There's a lot of articles out there on the internet.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I mean, there's whole, you know, forms and stuff that are dedicated to that kind of thing.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Yes, but I mean, it could be very convenient to have a magazine page with a shopping list to take with me.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
I mean, I guess people have their phones and stuff.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Well, it depends what you want.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
There's so many things. You can find a cabinet, you can build a cabinet.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000
What cabinet type do you want to design, build, or whatever?

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I'll tell you, having built...

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
You're speaking from experience.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Yes, I'm telling you, having built a couple and bought a cabinet that I converted into a MAME cabinet,

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:53.000
definitely some choices I would make differently nowadays.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
All right, lastly, Rettertainment says,

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I'd like an in-depth piece where they interview several people who developed games during the Atari area,

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.000
particularly those people who developed games where they were the only person working on it.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I think it would be interesting to compare and contrast the stress developers of the Atari era went through

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.000
compared to the stress that modern-day developers went through.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Well, I think we heard a little bit of that in our interview earlier tonight,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000
so it sounds like, you know, Retro's bringing some of that.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
But I think we want to hear more.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:24.000
More of these guys that had to work by themselves in the teams of one in the past,

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
creating some of the all-time classics.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:33.000
And if you want that now, I recommend checking out, was it the GDC Vault?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:40.000
They've got usually a lot of these kind of postmortems for different games.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Like, I remember there was one time when I was, you know,

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000
well, I think it was actually when I didn't have anything to do with my company after they took away our system.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:54.000
But I was watching these postmortems because they have stuff from like Maniac Mansion,

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
and just about like all these developers on these games

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000
and like all the process that they went through to develop the engines for these games

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000
or like design choices that they made and stuff like that.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000
And it's really fun to just watch and listen to.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
So yeah, GDC Vault is one place I'd check.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Or just do a search, I think, for like, you know, postmortems for your favorite game and see if you can find that.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Dungeon Buster wants to point out there's a great interview with Carol Shaw,

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
who worked at Activision floating around out there.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
She did River Raid and a few other games.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:30.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase CANDLE.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Alright, well, I mentioned that our friends at Retro Magazine wanted to give away a print subscription to one lucky listener.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000
So what I'd like you guys to do, if you are interested in this and you're listening either live or on the podcast,

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I'd like you to email participate at orangeloungeradio.com

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:52.000
and I want you to tell me what game would you like to see on the cover of a future magazine.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Now, keep in mind, we have nothing to do with the development of the magazine.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.000
We've got no pull.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
But I will let our friends know.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000
If I notice any trends, I will let our friends know.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.000
We will pick one emailer at random to win this prize.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:11.000
So if you are interested in this, again, send a message to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Make sure somewhere in the subject it says retro and in the body tell us what would you like to see on the cover of the future magazine.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Again, we have no say or any pull of any sort and that stuff might already be planned out for the next two years for all we know.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:34.000
But we'll certainly pass it along if we see any trends or anything like that to our friends over at Retro Magazine.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:40.000
So once again, a print subscription to one lucky listener for Retro Magazine available at readretro.com.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Email participate at orangeloungeradio.com with what game would you like to see on the cover of the future magazine.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
We will pick one lucky listener from all the submissions on next week's show.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Alrighty, let's get back into some other news. Loki.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Alright, so I don't really know how to take this news, but apparently the former CEO of EA, John Rickdello,

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I think that's how you pronounce his name, is now the CEO of Unity.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000
As in the Unity 3D, the game engine I like to use.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:27.000
You may remember him from such wonderful failures as SimCity's online issues or Star Wars The Old Republic or a lot of the other stuff that he dealt with in his tenure.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:33.000
I want to say he was obviously around during the online pass thing and all that fun stuff.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Not exactly too highly thought of by a lot of the gaming community.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:46.000
But he's basically saying, hey, things are going to be different now.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:56.000
He actually went to the Unity forums and was answering questions and stuff there regarding some of the stuff.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:04.000
For example, the company he's working for now is a very different company in a very different place.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
He says they're not really comparable.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:15.000
The thing that might have been right or wrong with EA when the company was a turnaround situation are entirely different than what's right for Unity.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
The companies are very, very different.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Basically saying, my philosophy is not to get bigger or more profitable for the sake of these things.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:42.000
He wants to recognize that developing a great game is hard and even if you pull it off or having your game discovered and installed is also hard.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Earning a good living on this is very hard.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.000
I don't know. I think he's trying to skirt around some of the past mistakes and trying to start fresh.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:13:00.000
So don't fuck this up like you fucked up some of the stuff or had a hand in fucking up at previous companies.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:06.000
That's good advice. To quote a favorite mentor of mine, good luck and don't fuck it up.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Any concern because you're using Unity to develop your game. Any concerns here?

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Not yet.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:20.000
I just hope that maybe they don't change the pricing models. Although the pricing model could be a little bit better.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:28.000
For me being poor, $1500 is a lot. But it's $1500 and that's it.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:35.000
And you don't have to pay for royalties except for say you want to buy the next version of Unity that comes out.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
The next numbered version.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:44.000
For example, Unity 5. If I pay $1500 for that, I get 4 for right now because it's so close to 5 coming out.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:51.000
And then I get 5, but later on when 6 comes out, I have to pay more money to upgrade to the fancier shit.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
I guess it makes sense, but it's not that much money.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000
It could always be cheaper.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Everything could always be cheaper.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Moving on to some stories on Mortal Kombat X. Don't call it Mortal Kombat X. It is actually Mortal Kombat X even though it is the 10th game.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000
This is a game to look forward to early next year. I don't remember if it was on or off air.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.000
We're talking about the Wii U and what is there to look forward to in the first few months of next year.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Now, of course, Mortal Kombat X would not be one of those games.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000
But for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, this is definitely one that has a lot of people looking forward to it.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I thought they had it gated already.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:32.000
It was April something, I think. Which tends to be the time frame for those spring releases.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:40.000
So, to coincide with the 2015 launch of Mortal Kombat X, there's going to be a new live action series.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.000
You might remember they've done some live action Mortal Kombat stuff before, but this is going to be something new.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:53.000
This will be a joint production from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Blue Ribbon Content, which is a digital series production house within Warner Bros.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:59.000
This will showcase some of the franchise's most storied characters while introducing a new generation of fighters.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Because, as we know, the last Mortal Kombat game was, for the most part, familiar faces.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.000
In fact, I think it was really all familiar faces save maybe Freddy Krueger.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.000
But this game, we know there's some new people in it and there's people looking forward to that.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Some of the characters, I'm really curious to see how they're going to pull off in a live action.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Isn't one of them like a flying insect lady or something?

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
That's going to be interesting to see how they pull that off.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I think they're just going to be pulling it off like they did some of the flying characters in Injustice.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Not even Injustice, but even going back to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe back when they had some of that stuff.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.000
But I think Injustice is a little bit more where they're playing off of for some of these characters.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:49.000
So, for the live action, though, I'm curious how they're going to pull off some of that. It's going to be expensive.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
It's not going to be that expensive.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000
This is true. I keep forgetting how many strides we've made in that.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
So, yeah, there you go. That's going to be pretty cool.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.000
They're just going to have this person jump up every time the camera's on them,

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:05.000
and they're just going to have to somehow shoot those scenes very fast.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:10.000
No word on when this is exactly coming, although I would imagine it would be around the game.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:15.000
It should be noted this has nothing to do with Mortal Kombat Legacy from 2011.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:18.000
It's nothing to do with that, just to make that clear.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Also, by the way, speaking of comics, since you brought up DC, DC Comics is going to be making a Mortal Kombat X comic.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:31.000
This will, quote, serve as a prequel to the game and will feature many favorite characters in the next generation of combatants.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:41.000
It will be written by Shawn Kittleson in illustrations by Dexter Soy and cover art from Ivan Reiss, January of 2015, when this will be released.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
So, there you go.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:52.000
I'm looking forward to the game, and all this hype around it will hopefully get a lot of people online to play against.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Yeah. All right. And then, let's see. So, this is kind of cool.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000
We, I think, talked a little bit about how they're going to be doing a Dead Rising movie,

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:11.000
and now it wasn't necessarily going to be something that was, you know, in theaters or something like that,

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.000
but it is going to be something that they're going to be debuting, I guess, on Crackle.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:20.000
But the title of the movie was Dead Rising Watchtower, and it actually has,

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Rob Riggle is going to be playing Frank West in the game.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:33.000
And Rob Riggle, he's done a bunch of different, you know, comedic roles, but he's also, you know, I think,

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
He's on The Daily Show.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Yeah, he's known for The Daily Show.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I can see him as Frank West, actually. I think that could work.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.000
So, I'm curious to see how this movie is actually going to turn out, especially since it's on Crackle.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.000
I guess it's free.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Hey.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
I like free.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.000
They haven't given a date yet when that's going to be coming out, but hopefully sooner than later.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:02.000
All right. Well, let's talk about some arcade games for 2015, and one game that's going to be making its way to arcades.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Yes, thank heavens, more arcade games in 2015, because I start to worry every day that arcades are dying out,

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:11.000
because every time I walk into one, it's just a bunch of ticket spitters.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000
But Time Crisis 5 will be happening in 2015.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:19.000
It will be released internationally in March or April of 2015, that time frame.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Very cool there that that is happening.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:27.000
This will, I believe, has the whole foot pedal action thing going on with the gun.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000
I'm curious if this will lead into a port.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Are we going to have a next generation laser gun or something, or will you be able to plug in a USB mouse or what?

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I mean, because these Time Crisis games pretty much all came out on PlayStation, right?

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Even Time Crisis 4.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000
If only PlayStation had some sort of way to do light guns.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:53.000
If only they had a device called the Move that they had a gun peripheral for.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
The camera, of course.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:01.000
They had a previous Time Crisis game on. They used it just like that in the House of the Dead game, and that's how they would do it.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Or maybe this will just stay in the arcades. Who knows?

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Most likely because it's going to rely on connecting the camera and who's really...

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Hey, I'm all for more games that use the connect to the camera, since otherwise those peripherals are kind of useless, aside from...

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Now, Dark Dead City is pointing out there's actually two pedals on Time Crisis 5.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.000
There's an L and an R. You can see in some of these pictures here that somebody took of the game.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:29.000
It looks like some pretty fun in-game shots. I see somebody on a little zip line there.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Pretty cool.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Also, for the arcade, it should be noted there.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:39.000
There is a new Bandai Namco game that's location testing called Synchronica.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.000
This is actually a music-based game. It's a touchscreen rhythm arcade game.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:50.000
It looks a little familiar for Beatstream by Konami and Rerave Plus, if you know that game.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:54.000
So, yeah, that is something that Bandai Namco is testing right now, Synchronica.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.000
And, interestingly enough, the Taiko No Tatchujin mascots are appearing on the game's art as well.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Which, you know, that was a big music game that Bandai Namco did, which does pretty well overseas.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:09.000
I don't think you see a lot of it here. I know they had a couple home releases here, but you definitely don't.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
It's not in the arcades here, really, unless it's imported.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
It would be cool if they...

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Now, this would be kind of hard to do, I guess, but it would be kind of cool if they had one of those games.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:26.000
But it utilized the second-screen stuff of a tablet to actually play those games on a console or something.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Because you know how they have all these second-screen apps and stuff.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Maybe do a download version of the game or something where you're required to have that in order to play it.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Now, I do want to point out this is location testing in Japan.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Doubtful, because Taiko No Tatchujin never really made its way over here besides a couple home versions.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:47.000
I don't know if this ever will either outside the imports, but you never know.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Sometimes, if something does very well in Japan, it'll make its way over here.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.000
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Every week, you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:03.000
and we open up the mailbag and read some of the emails on the program.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Except, since I'm having to multitask all night tonight, I actually don't have the mailbag up right now.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
So let me bring it up.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:16.000
I know we had at least one email when I looked earlier, so I should have something to read.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.000
You would think with two weeks off, we would have had a lot.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:24.000
But nope, just one email tonight, because the other one says retro on it, so people are already entering the contest.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.000
So here it is, our email for tonight from Gene, who says,

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Hello, OLR! Tuesday, I finally broke down and bought a PlayStation TV.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Oh, we haven't talked a lot about this yet.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:42.000
I seriously thought about picking one of those up when I bought my PlayStation 4, because I saw the box up on the shelf.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
You're thinking about it, huh?

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Maybe.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Well, let's see what Gene has to say about the PlayStation TV.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.000
There has been much talk that this unit is going for the Apple TV market.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:22:01.000
After almost a week, I can confirm my initial impression is that it is going for the niche market of people that want to play their PS4 remotely, play PSP and Vita games on the big screen.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:06.000
The menus on the big screen are the biggest deterrent, making it an alternative to the Apple TV.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Sony had put so little into the system to make it for that audience that I was a bit confused as to how to close programs.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Still, a week later, I feel the operating system doesn't translate well on the TV.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:24.000
It works great for what I bought it for, Dissida on a big television with a great controller that doesn't cramp my hands.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Since I bought the bundle and will not play it, feel free to give out my code for the LEGO Movie Video Game for the Vita.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
And it comes with a code.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.000
As always, thanks to the podcast, Gene.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:43.000
So there it is. The interface sucks, but if you want to play Dissida on your television, there you go.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
That sounds about right.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
I don't know. I'm tempted.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I don't want to just buy a PlayStation TV for it, but there is something to be said about the Vita Luminous game, which is one of the best, being able to play that on the TV.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Even the PSP games, like Final Fantasy IV, I think the PSP version of Final Fantasy IV is the best one.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.000
I prefer it to the 3D remake. I know not everybody agrees with me.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
But it's the original and the after years.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Yeah, I don't know. I'm tempted.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
I'm tempted.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:16.000
I'm sure if you just wait a little bit, like wait until Black Friday, wait until they drop in price.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Because I bet you a lot of people are going to be, you know, maybe people will be dropping those, I don't know.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
I hope it does well.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Well, gosh, you know, I kind of want to keep this code for myself, but I see actdeft in chat going, I want it! I want it!

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
I want that LEGO movie game code!

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000
So you know what? Alright, cool, you want it, you got it.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
There you go. Thanks for listening.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.000
I'm going to pass that code on to actdeft, just because he's clamoring about wanting that in our chat room.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
So there you go. You got it.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Thanks, Gene.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
I hear the movie game's not that bad.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I mean, just saying.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
I like the movie.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Don't make me regret that. I should have kept it for myself.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Have you watched the movie? Have you seen the LEGO movie?

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.000
I haven't yet.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
What the hell is your problem? Go watch the LEGO movie.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Is it on Blu-ray?

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
It is on Blu-ray already.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:07.000
I still have not bought a fucking table for that little arcade machine. I've been that busy.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:14.000
But things are clearing up in a couple weeks, so I'll be able to watch movies and things like that again.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Alright.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Let's move on and get to the FUs of the week.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.000
We usually use this part of the show to get a little bit angsty, so here we go.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Alright.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I guess, since Jamie's not here, I'll make an FU for my cat.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
My cat is an asshole.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:25:03.000
And, you know, sometimes I give her the benefit of the doubt where, oh yeah, I just think that she's an asshole, but maybe she's actually pretty nice.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000
But no, she actually goes out of her way to be an asshole.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Let me give you an example here.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
I was getting my son his...

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:15.000
We have a full-size whiteboard that I normally let him play on and draw and stuff like that.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:20.000
So while I was getting it out, I had to move this box that had our fake Christmas tree in it.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:29.000
And lo and behold, the cat had decided to jump up on the box and vomit into the box onto the Christmas tree.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Nasty!

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
She literally ruined the Christmas tree.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Ruined Christmas for everybody.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:42.000
So now I have to go buy a new fucking tree because the cat decided to jump up on the box when she knew she had to throw up and throw up into said box.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Thank you.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Alright, I want to give an F.U. to the fact that our fucking livestream just went down again.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:55.000
This is... I'm really giving consideration going somewhere else. This is happening way too much.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:01.000
So yeah, our livestream is currently down and I'm trying to furiously reconnect so we can get our live listeners back.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Because, yeah, having a good feed is really the lifeblood of the show.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Alan, are you here to...

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Are you an F.U.s?

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Yeah, we're doing F.U.s.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Oh, Alan wants to give a guest F.U. of the week.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Alan's here home early for a change for the show and wants to give an F.U. of the week while I try to fix our livestream.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:33.000
F.U. to the huge giant Safeway near my work that's huge like an airport hanger, yet in spite of it being a fancy Safeway, I was trying to get Rob more Stacy's salted caramel pita chips.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Oh, they're so good!

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Yeah, they don't have the Stacy's brand of pita chips at all. Couldn't find them.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:47.000
I mean, I was in a rush, but I went up and down that chip aisle like four times and then I went over to where they have like the kale chips and the frou-frou stuff.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
None. No Stacy's.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Then I looked for the popcorn that you like. The microwave popcorn, the garlic. Didn't have that either.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.000
So, fuck them.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:08.000
F.U. to the fact that I like all this food that makes me fat, but seriously, those pita chips, the salted caramel ones, are so good. I can't. I can't.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:22.000
They have the cappuccino Lay's that I almost got as a replacement, but the thing is that's why the cappuccino Lay's lost that contest because if you want sweet chips, you get the Stacy's salted caramel or the Stacy's sugar cinnamon.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
There are better chips like that.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:30.000
I will agree. Those salted caramel chips are way better than the stupid cappuccino chips at a Lay's.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000
But anyway.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Alright, thankfully we got our live listeners back, so my rage has calmed down a little bit with losing the stream there.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Very frustrating.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000
But don't worry guys, you only missed the F.U.'s of the week and those will be up in full on our podcast feed.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:50.000
As you can hear, Alan came in the room to help contribute to that segment while I was furiously trying to get our feed back up.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 Game O.L.R.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Loki.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Alright, this is pretty cool.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.000
I watched this last time that they had it up, but awesome games done quick.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:11.000
It's coming back if you like watching speedruns and really if you haven't watched this yet, you really should check it out.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:19.000
It's coming out January or starting January 4th next year and they're going to be doing it for about six days.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:20.000
It's going to end on January 10th.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.000
All our proceeds from donations are going to Prevent Cancer Foundation.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:40.000
And if you haven't heard of this event, it's basically a bunch of really great speedrunners playing a bunch of different games and kind of talking about what they do in those games to go fast.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
And there's races and all sorts of fun stuff.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Seriously, check it out.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Games Done Quick I think is the Twitch channel.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:54.000
So they'll be coming out on the 4th and they have the whole lineup.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000
The trailer for my next story started playing in the background.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I didn't realize it was on and it made a great ambience for what you were talking about.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000
I'm going to spoil what I'm going to talk about.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:08.000
I know there's a lot of fans out there at this marathon.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.000
I know Flaco Jones here at OLR, an extro at Hoard House, they love this.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
It is a very fun thing to watch.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Do you think they would get mad if maybe we did an offshoot on a different week called Mediocre Games Done Slow?

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.000
There's something a little bit more our pace.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Invitation is the finest form of flattery, right?

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.000
It's all for a good cause, right?

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000
I don't think they would care.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.000
It's just whatever.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
I think it looks awesome.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:36.000
I can't wait to watch it again because last year was fantastic.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.000
They even do it I think twice a year. They do Summer Games Done Quick also.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Check it out.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Maybe in 2015, Mediocre Games Done Slow from Loki and Rob and Darth Zagara and pals.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Mediocre Games Done as fast as we can, but our limited skills limit our speed through said game and possibly won't finish it.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000
The end.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Mediocre Games Done until we need a nap.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:05.000
I was trying to play through, like, was it, I want to be the guy.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:10.000
It's like, give us an hour until we throw the controller down on the ground because we don't want to play this.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Alright, Tigerclaw in chat says, I think they did an awful games done quick before.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Actually, that does sound familiar.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Again, I don't want to steal anyone's idea.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.000
It's for charity. It's all great stuff.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Alright, well, I think I spoiled what I'm going to talk about.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000
This is, okay, this is a game I'm not fucking playing during a marathon.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Let's just make that real clear.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.000
That is the game Five Nights at Freddy's 2.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Loki, you familiar with the Five Nights at Freddy's game?

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the game.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
You don't, okay, here's the thing.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:50.000
I haven't played it because I kind of refuse to and I've actually had several people request me to stream it.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.000
And I've watched other people play it on YouTube and I'm like, no thanks.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:04.000
So here's what it is. It's a survival horror game where you're working as the security guy at a Chuck E. Cheese type of place where the animatronics are basically trying to kill you.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:07.000
That's awesome. That sounds so cool.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
I can't believe you haven't heard of this game.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
I haven't heard of this, but that's really cool.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Alright, let me play this trailer full screen so Loki can see it here.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:27.000
So they do have the sequel available on Greenlight and you're trapped in a room and you just have the security cameras.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.000
You don't actually walk around or whatever. It's all through security cameras.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:37.000
And you watch the different cameras and try to make sure that the little monsters aren't trying to get close to you.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Because if they get too close there will be a hell of a jump scare where they burst through the door and basically kill you.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:46.000
And it's like they make these little sounds when they do it like blah.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
They make these really hideous noises.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:52.000
So I'm letting Loki see the trailer here in studio.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Because Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is on Steam Greenlight.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:02.000
And it looks like as the taping of the show they've actually posted an update that says they made it.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
So yeah, you can see the game area and they switch between all these different cams.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000
And some of the cameras are broken and they're audio only.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.000
And so you look at the different areas and you have to basically survive all night.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Which runs like six or seven minutes.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:19.000
And then at some point, come on if we get to that part of the show.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Don't those monsters look freaky?

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:29.000
And at some point in the trailer here, they come and get you.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:34.000
It looks kind of stupid but it kind of looks a little janky there.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:38.000
It almost looks like an old Saturn game.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Like a night trap type thing.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:44.000
So how are you supposed to prevent the monsters from getting you?

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Because when they're on the camera they don't move.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Click, click, click, click.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Somehow I don't think that works. I don't think you can rapidly click everything.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Let's see, Rama in chat says,

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.000
I know people that are doing Five Nights at Freddy's cosplays.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
That is fucked up.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
That's just mean.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
That's like furries gone wrong.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Really, really wrong.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Act Def says,

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:14.000
But after a while you don't feel scared of the animatronics but rather just not fucking it up.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Yeah, I can see that.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.000
The animatronics themselves probably lose the scare a little bit.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:23.000
But later on it's a tense game.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
I've played games that weren't necessarily scary.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
They were just tense.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Like if I screw this up I'm going to have to do it all over again.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Even Pagle 2 got tense for me.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
It's like, I have to get three of these in a row.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.000
And it's like, okay, one, two, am I going to get the third shot?

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Why are you still working at like this place that's abandoned as a security guard?

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
And there's like...

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.000
As soon as you see any of those animatronic things trying to kill you be like,

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Oh fuck it, I'm out, gone.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
It's video game logic, Loki.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
That doesn't make sense.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Dungeon Buster says,

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Alien isolation is kind of like that but it took almost 15 or so hours for it to get there for me.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.000
That's another game that people have suggested I buy and stream live.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
And I'm like, nope.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Because, A, it's a pricier game.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.000
At least Five Nights at Freddy's is only what, five, ten bucks?

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000
But Alien Isolation is still pretty expensive and it's like,

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I don't know, I don't think I could make it through that.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Alright, let's do it.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Let's open up the Skype line and take your calls.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:22.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
If you want to give us a call and be on the program tonight.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000
And the phone line is already lighting up to take some calls.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Let's do it.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Hey, this is FTF.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Hey my friend, how you doing?

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Hey, pretty good, pretty good.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Well, you talked about Five Nights at Freddy's.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Yes.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.000
And yeah, I said it in chat and you pretty much repeated it.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Or said it.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
The game starts really scary.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
It's a scary atmosphere.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:00.000
At the first, early in your first playthrough maybe,

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:03.000
you're going to get scared because yeah, that's the feeling.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.000
But after a while, it doesn't get that scary.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Does it support the Oculus Rift?

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:11.000
No, it doesn't actually.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
But it should.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.000
It's a game that pretty much could take advantage of that really well.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000
I don't know, though, if the whole fact that you're watching on cameras.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:25.000
I mean, not everything should necessarily be crammed into the Rift.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
And the fact that this is about watching security cameras,

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:30.000
that might not work so well on the Rift, actually.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.000
So, I know people want to, you know,

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
they want people to actually die having a heart attack

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
from playing a video game at some point

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
by putting all these scary games on the Rift.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000
But isn't Slender Man enough?

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
I don't remember who talked me into doing that stream,

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
if it was Shane or Gemet or what,

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.000
but I did that livestream of Slender Man and I screamed so loud.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Hey, Slender, the arrival is coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One very soon.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Oh, is it really?

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
And also the Wii U, yeah.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Yeah, and speaking, turning to Five Nights at Freddy's,

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
speaking of the Wii U,

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:07.000
it actually would work on the Wii U,

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.000
especially since you use a tablet to watch the other cameras.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Yeah, it actually worked.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.000
It's basically a horror version of that stupid prototype

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
that, was it, Miyamoto's working on?

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Like, look at my genius idea.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:24.000
No, no, it's kind of dumb, you know,

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.000
watching Rob the Robot try to infiltrate your shit.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Yeah, Five Nights at Freddy's 2,

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:38.000
it's gonna be pretty much, maybe not the same thing,

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:42.000
but it's gonna do a lot of stuff that the first one didn't,

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.000
and it's gonna be way, way more creepier,

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
and probably way more harder.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.000
I got to the Fortnite and I had to stop playing

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:56.000
because it was getting on my nerves really bad.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Not in a scary sense, but like I said,

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:03.000
it's mostly not to fuck it up,

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
because you have to check all the cameras,

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:08.000
you have to be very careful of what you do,

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
and not waste energy and all that.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000
It really gets on your nerves in that way.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.000
It's not the animatronics getting you.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Like I said, and again, I'm repeating myself,

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
it's mostly not to fuck it up.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
The game was cheating, right?

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
I do that all the time.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
You're really frustrated because the game's cheating.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Yeah, kind of.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Even some of the animatronics actually cheat.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.000
They give you one kill,

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:42.000
but they don't give you a chance even to do something.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:47.000
There's this, well not an animatronic,

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:51.000
but a thing called Golden Freddy,

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.000
that if you catch it on your monitors,

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
on the security cameras,

02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:00.000
and it appears immediately on your station,

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.000
it will pretty much crash your game.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:07.000
It's a one-hit kill, and you cannot do anything about it.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Oh my gosh, that does look pretty cheap.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
That would suck.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Well, I guess it is that time of year

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
where everybody's thinking about scary games.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:18.000
I'm sure there'll be plenty of people live streaming

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.000
and playing scary games with friends on Friday night.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Good luck to everybody,

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
and I hope these games don't scare you too bad.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Speaking of the furry community and Five Nights at Freddy's,

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.000
you haven't seen anything of it.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Like, anything.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
You know what? That is something...

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Haven't seen, don't want to seen.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Yeah, that's the only difference.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I will keep that nicely stored away in Pandora's box.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Thank you very much.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
All right, Actif, anything else on your mind, my friend?

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
That's all, that's all.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
All right, take care.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Yeah, you too. Thanks for having me.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Bye.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
All right, one of these days,

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
I'm going to just end up downloading that game

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.000
and live streaming it inevitably.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.000
We'll see, we'll see though.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Hey, guys, it's Jason.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Hey, Jason, and I can see you.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
I'm waving at you, you just can't see it.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:09.000
I know, your beard's getting fluffier.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
It hasn't even been winter yet.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
It's not even cold in Colorado yet,

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:14.000
at least not regularly, but...

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Are you planning on cosplaying Santa Claus?

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Because you're about there.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.000
I, at this rate, given two more months,

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
well, I don't have a Halloween costume yet,

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.000
so why not use it for two occasions this year?

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000
There you go, there you go.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000
This is great radio, by the way.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000
This is fantastic radio.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Jason has a big, fluffy Santa Claus beard right now.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Well, it's not gray though, it's black, but still.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:37.000
All right, what's on your mind?

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Maybe hair dye, things can happen.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Exactly.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Can I toot my own horn for a minute?

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Toot, toot, I suppose.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.000
So, back in, I think it was late last year,

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.000
but it may have even been 20, what year is it, 2012.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
At least a year ago, and possibly more,

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:58.000
I made this comment about how game worlds,

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:04.000
in the general sense, can finally come to consoles,

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
now that in the current generation,

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.000
everything not only has the capability,

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.000
but is largely expected to always be on,

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
possible to connect to the internet,

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.000
phoning home to services, all that kind of stuff.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
And yeah, consoles have gotten MMOs,

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Final Fantasy has been on all of them,

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:25.000
has been on consoles even as far back as the PS2,

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.000
so the MMO itself isn't exactly a surprise.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
But it's really interesting to me,

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:34.000
because Destiny, a lot of people have said

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:37.000
a lot of negative things about Destiny,

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:40.000
and provided Bungie keeps up, which I really expect them to,

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:44.000
I expect that sentiment to change in the end,

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:49.000
by the time that Destiny as it stands is considered done,

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
whether that's a sequel, or just run its course,

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.000
or what have you, I just expect the game

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
to be something completely different,

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.000
and the opinions of them, if not better,

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.000
than to be different along with the change of content.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:06.000
What brought this up, what really gobsmacked me with that,

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:10.000
this week, is that Titanfall released Patch 8,

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
and it was just a patch,

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
they've had three pieces of DLC already,

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
all just map packs,

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
and not actually doing anything else with the game,

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.000
but a patch update, free to all players

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:22.000
that came out this week,

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.000
added an entirely new mode to the game.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Nothing crazy, nothing revolutionary,

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:33.000
it was just survival, what did Halo Reach call it?

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Was it actually Reach mode?

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Whatever Halo Reach or ODST,

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
whichever one came between 3 and 4

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
that was actually first person shooter,

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
you get waves, tower defense FPS

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:49.000
is basically the quickest way that I can explain that.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.000
But it's just super interesting that now that

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
we have the capability to do this and keep up,

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
and capacity, mandatory storage,

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
and all of that kind of thing,

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:02.000
that games are now shifting so that certain experiences

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
you probably only would have gotten on the computer before,

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
now are finally on the console,

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.000
and whatever doors open are interesting,

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.000
but it's just interesting to finally see that

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:16.000
with very specific AAA examples here and now.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Right.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Well, yeah, and it's pretty impressive

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.000
how a lot of these big games are being very well supported,

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:25.000
like Destiny is being, for all its criticisms,

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
they have been working pretty regularly

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
and quickly on these patches to improve

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
the quality of life for the game.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
I really feel like I kind of hit a point in Destiny

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
where I kind of ran out of things to do,

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
and I realized I haven't done the raid,

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:40.000
I could still push my character forward and so forth,

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.000
but I don't know, I wasn't really super motivated.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
I kind of felt like I hit the end of the story,

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
I did all the single-player stuff,

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
and I wasn't really motivated to push my character further

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.000
by going on a gear hunt and relying on RNG,

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:53.000
you know what I mean?

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
But I feel like Destiny and Bungie

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
did address some of those concerns,

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
the whole criticisms that the Crypt arc

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
would give you crap items,

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
even when you brought in purple engrams and stuff,

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
they at least kind of listened to some of that,

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
so that doesn't make me hopeful for the future of the game,

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
and like I said then, and like I say now,

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
and like I'll say forever,

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
if Blizzard could fix Diablo 3,

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
and boy did they ever,

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
you know, anything is possible

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:20.000
as far as changing a game around with free patches.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Right.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
It's just interesting, because Destiny,

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
every couple of days, I actually haven't played it

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
in about a week or something like that,

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
and I'm going to turn it on and get all the content updates.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
I haven't even been keeping up with the news,

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:36.000
just bits of things that I hear about around Twitter and whatnot.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:41.000
For somebody who has all but checked out of PC gaming,

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:44.000
at least as far as new titles are concerned,

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
it's super interesting to be like

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:49.000
back in this familiar environment from my past,

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
but be doing it on a newer console.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Yeah, and like you brought up earlier,

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:58.000
MMOs, I think a lot of this is kind of borrowed from MMOs,

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.000
and I talk ad nauseam about Final Fantasy XIV,

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
but tomorrow they're getting another huge patch,

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
which is quote unquote for free,

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
and I put that in my quotey fingers

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
because you are paying a monthly sub

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
to play Final Fantasy XIV,

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000
so you should get some reasonable upkeep and so forth

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
in some of these kind of free perks,

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:20.000
but it's nice to see the games supported like that,

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:23.000
and the fact that these games aren't paying monthly fees

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:27.000
for giving us this stuff that's not necessarily tied to DLC.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Right. Amazon Prime's free two-day shipping,

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
et cetera, et cetera.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Yeah, we all know the, oh, here's your free games

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
that you get for the low, low price of money

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
directly debited every month.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Yes, or release day shipping

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
for something, that's how I got Bayonetta 2

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
on Friday.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Ultimately, I suppose it's not really outlandish,

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
it's just like, not to mention

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
like being back in gaming regularly

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
and all that kind of stuff since I've been home

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
for a month and a half straight now,

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
been able to actually like sit down

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
and see this stuff happening to myself firsthand.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
It's also the positive side

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
of the patching world we live in,

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
and I know we've focused a lot, I mean, gamers

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
focusing on the negative, get out.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
I know we've oftentimes focused on the negative

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
of, well, with these stupid patches,

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
you know, these companies can release

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
these half-finished games, and we just have to get

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
this day one patch and blah, blah, blah,

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
but this is kind of the positive end of it,

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
is like, oh, patching can also make

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
an old game new again

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
when there's a lot of games competing for your attention.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Yeah. Speaking of games competing for my attention,

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
I have that 3D Realms anthology

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
to get to, so hooray!

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
You bought it, huh? Oh, yes, absolutely.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Like, those games are my childhood, period.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Like, those games were the ones

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
that were on AOL Games,

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
AOL Kids Games

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
download section. Some of these things

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
I even downloaded off BBS's,

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Zmodem for Life.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Yeah, like, this

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
is my childhood, and I

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
owned almost

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
none of them until the last couple of years,

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
and now they're all here.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
I have, like, literally full versions

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
of my entire, my entire

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
childhood, and it's gonna be a good

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
rest of the year. What game are you most looking

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
forward to in that collection?

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
My eyes immediately

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
crossed Raptor and Monster Bash.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
I don't even know those.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
Raptor was a vertical

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
shoot-em-up. You know,

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
1942, very standard affair. I don't

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
remember what interested me in it. Good soundtrack,

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
good visuals, I guess. I don't know. I'm gonna

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
find out, though. Monster Bash

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
was a

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
side-scrolling

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
platformer. You

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
played Johnny Dash,

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
I think, and you

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
had to rescue cats and dogs

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
in this monster

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
world of zombies and

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
crows and skeletons and a bunch of

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
other really, it's super

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
cartoony, very, like, overdone

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
sound effects and vivid colors,

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
but again, that's a game

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
that I only ever played the demo, and I played the

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
demo to death multiple times.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
That whole collection is freaking

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
amazing. I bet you can't

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
wait to play such classics like Math

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Rescue, as well.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
And the same thing,

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
like, with 3D Realms,

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
what 3Drealms.com used to be,

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
like, I used to, even as an adult,

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
even in the last couple of years, I would go to

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
3Drealms.com, look at their games list,

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
and just see the same shareware

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
version, patch updates, retail

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
updates, the Duke

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Nukem, various Duke Nukem patches

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
for, like, getting

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
restoring

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
mature, filtered,

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
restoring violence in, like,

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
clean versions that were rebuilt for, like,

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Walmart, whenever they used to actually sell stuff

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
like that, that kind of thing.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
And, like, 3D Realms and Apogee have been,

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
have always

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
held a place in my heart, and it's here.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
It's fantastic. Fantastic. Well, have a lot of fun

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
with that, Jason. I shall.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
Alright, you take care, buddy. You too. Alright, bye-bye.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
Always good to hear from the man, Jason,

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
there, on the call. Oh, Wacky Wheels.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
I remember Wacky Wheels. Yeah.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Like a Mario Kart type game. I gotta be honest, a lot

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
of those, I don't, oh my god, that,

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
I do remember Wacky Wheels.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Yeah. Oh, god, that game was the bomb.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR,

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
or username on Skype,

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio, if you wanna give us a call.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Let's see, I do have some tweets

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
I wanna get to. We've accumulated quite

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
a few tweets. I'm gonna apologize if I missed your

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
tweet. If you tweeted us, like, earlier in the week,

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
especially when we were out, I'm probably gonna miss your tweet

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
cause we get mentioned sometimes in other

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
conversations and things get lost.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Uh, but let's see, uh, tweet here from

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Spaznator who says,

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
if you could buy any one non-MAME

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
cabinet, what would it be?

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
For me, it would be a 4-slot

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Neo Geo MVS.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Um,

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
I came super close

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
to legit buying a BurgerTime cabinet not that

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
long ago. I saw one at the auction.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
And if I was in the financial place I was in

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
now, then I would've bought

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
it. But unfortunately I was

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
going through a phase where I wasn't as fortunate

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
so I didn't buy it. Only if you had a cabinet sitting within

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
the computer that you could play BurgerTime on.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
But this, okay, but there's a, you have to admit, Loki,

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
there is a difference. I mean, yes, it's awesome that there's

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
but to have, like, the real thing

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
is also very attractive.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
I understand. So, uh, that was

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
one I came very close to buying.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
You know my friends would've eaten that,

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
would've ate that shit up. What about,

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
Loki, what about you? Something, uh, you could buy.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
That's easy. What?

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
I could get a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Of course. Easy, I mean. Of course.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Come on, I mean, that's super easy.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Or, or if, I'm an idiot for not

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
saying that. I am, you know, pretty

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
out of shape, but hopefully that would help.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
But if I was gonna go lazy route, I would

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
probably pick, like, a, I don't

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
know, like a racing cabinet or something.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Maybe, like, uh,

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
I don't know, F-Zero,

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
AX, or, um. Oh.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
That'd be awesome. I don't know.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
You know what pisses me off is I went back to that

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
place to see if I could get it, and it was

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
gone. You know, well, I can say this, I guess

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
on air, it doesn't matter. You know, uh, Denia was out

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
in Roseville, right? Yeah. It used to be that place across the

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
street, the, uh, auction town

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
or whatever it was called. Oh, I never went there. Gone.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
They had that, oh, man.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
I'm so, so angry about that.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Seriously, just look on Craigslist. There's so many

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
people selling like that. Yeah, and actually, uh,

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
and a baby Pac-Man is something I've

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
always considered for a long time, too.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
And Dark Soccer knows about that one, cause that's,

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
that's that half pinball, half game

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
one. That one's a lot of fun.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
They have some, well, yeah, yeah.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
Alan, you'd understand if I bought

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
a baby Pac-Man machine, right? If you came home from work

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
one day and there's a baby Pac-Man machine in the living room,

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
would you, uh, would you understand that?

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Oh, he's coming over. I would,

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
and it is such a rare

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
novelty to see

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
a half and half

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
game like that, but at the

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
same time as either version

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
of the screen game or the pinball, they're

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
both not that

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
great. It's just the fact that they're

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
integrated together that makes it like

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
cool, but the pinball's kind of

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
jank if I remember.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
Crushing my dreams live on air, did you hear

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
that? Well, you can bring one home if you want,

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
but it kind of sucks.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
You could bring it home if your taste is

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
crap.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
Fine. What do you want me to bring home, Alan?

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
What, what, what, what arcade machine or

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
thing would you want to see?

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Oh, he says Killer Instinct 1 or 2.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Can I just get a Nintendo 64 and

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Killer Instinct Gold? Wouldn't that be enough?

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
I'm offended.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Alan just said, I'm offended

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
and walked out. Alright,

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
um, I need to get a room

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
ambient mic so you guys can hear him.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Uh, anyway, S. Jonah and Matt

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
tweeted us and said, I went to a friend's wedding

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
this weekend and the bride and groom walked

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
the aisle to Lindsey Stirling's

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
rendition of the Halo theme.

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
So I ask, what gaming tune

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
would you like to hear at a wedding?

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
No happy wedding jokes

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
from BeatMania 2DX.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
I actually went to a wedding that was

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
Halo themed as well. I don't think it was that

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
same thing, but they walked down the aisle

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
the music from Halo. I'm not kidding.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
That was, and that was over ten years

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
ago at this point. That's what sold me on an Xbox.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Was, uh, getting to play

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Halo for the first time. Uh, local

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
area, not Halo 2, but Halo 1

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
LAN, uh, style

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
at that wedding reception. That

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
sold me on the Xbox.

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
That and DDR Ultimix.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Loki, I know you already had

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
your wedding, but, um,

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
you know, let's say you got to

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
do it again and, uh, the wife would let

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
you do anything you want.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
What video game? She's like, okay, I want you to ruin

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
this. Exactly.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
Exactly. Okay, if I'm gonna pick the

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
song that's gonna ruin,

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
ruin the, um,

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
let's see, the most inappropriate

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
song I can think of,

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
um, walking down the aisle too

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
just because it would really script the tempo

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
and everything would be like,

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
I don't know, like, drop

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
out or, you know, uh,

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
maybe, uh,

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
you know, max 300 or something

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
stupid. Drop the bomb. Drop the

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
bomb.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Uh, no, I got

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
this, what is it, uh,

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
secret rendezvous or something.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Stop.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
Um, let's see, now,

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
now see, here's the problem is that I already

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
know I'm gonna walk down the aisle

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
to ABBA music just like in Muriel's Wedding

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
for anybody that's ever seen that movie. That's, that's what it's going

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
to be and it's non-negotiable, but

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
I suppose if it had

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
to be video game music, I don't know,

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
like, maybe something

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Final Fantasy-ish?

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
I'm sure there's tons of people that have done,

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
like, a thousand words or something. One-winged angel, yeah.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Okay.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Okay, you got it. One-winged angel.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
That would do it.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
I'm sure someone has

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
walked down the aisle to that. I'm sure

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
there's some, like, nerd couple out there that

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
walked down the aisle to that.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Alright, one more, uh, plug for

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
phone calls here. Last chance to get in.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
her username on Skype, Orange

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
Lounge Radio. Could somebody,

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
like, mod the lyrics so it was, like,

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
me, da, de, da,

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
da, da, da, Rob Roberts.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Could we, could we get it modded somehow?

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
I don't know. Alright.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Rob will walk down the aisle to Leviathan.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
No, that's Shane.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
That would be, that would be Shane

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
that would want to get married to, uh, the Leviathan

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
song from Final Fantasy 14.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Just saying.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Alright, uh, Loki, do you have any last minute

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
stories for us? Because our phones aren't lining

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
up. I'm about to close them.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
Um, yeah, we can talk a little bit about,

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
um, they're saying that, uh,

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
I guess right now

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
the first idea

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
of what Microsoft's gonna do with the

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
Minecraft property is

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
trying to, um,

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
merge the console, PC,

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
and mobile versions together a little bit

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
like maybe having them interact with

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
each other or something like that.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
It's incredibly vague.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
I guess it was coming from some sort of

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
IGN podcast or something like that.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Um, I guess the

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
PlayStation 4 has outsold the

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
Xbox One by 40% worldwide.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
As of right now, so that's

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
interesting, I guess.

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Um, and then, of course,

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
um, what was it?

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
They're saying that the Xbox One sales are up.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
But,

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
I think it's gonna, I think the Xbox One's gonna do

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
fine. They've got really good

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
first party games coming out.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Halo Collection will be a good.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Yeah, Halo Collection, I mean, they've got strong

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
titles coming out. What's Sony have?

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
Sony has

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
Drive Club, which is just a fucking mess,

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
unfortunately. And Little Big Planet 3,

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
which Little Big Planet 3 is a good game,

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
but it's not gonna fucking sell systems.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Uh, Inertia is what, I mean,

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
and everything you talked about earlier about all my friends

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
already have one type of thing. I mean,

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
that's my honest answer. I mean,

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
it's a bigger deal than

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
you think, because, you know, it's like

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Destiny. Like, for a lot

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
of people I know, PlayStation 4 is

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
the console to have Destiny on. Why?

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Because that's where everybody else has it, and I want to play with my friends.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
Like, we had our buddy Delvin from

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
Video Game Realness was on Hoard House,

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
and he was talking about Destiny,

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
and I'm like, Delvin, you play Destiny?

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Why have we never played together? And he's like, because I'm on

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
Xbox One.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
And nobody's over here on

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Xbox One that I know.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
So, it's kind of unfortunate.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
Yeah.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Alright. Any other

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
last minute stories here for us to get to?

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
That's it.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
That's about it. Well, the phones are not lighting up,

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
so I think that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
Lounge Radio. I want to

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
thank you guys for listening to the show tonight, and

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
taking time out of your day or

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
night, whatever the case may be, if you're listening

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
to the show, to listen to the show.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
I want to thank, once again, the folks at Retro

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
Magazine for coming on tonight, and best of luck

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
on that Kickstarter. Usually I would say I hope

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
you get the Kickstarter, but they already made the

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
goals, so I hope, I hope they

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
attain enough stretch goals so that they

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
can do something even bigger

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
than they did in year one. That's the wishes

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
that I send over to Retro Magazine.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Best of luck to them. And

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
you can, again, find them at

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
reidretro.com and

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
their Kickstarter, reidretro.com slash

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Kickstarter. Again,

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
thank you guys for listening to us. I know we were gone

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
last week, so I appreciate you sticking with us

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
and coming right back to the show tonight.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
please, don't forget to tell a friend or

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
two or five or twenty about

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
the show. Help spread the word about

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
Orange Lounge Radio. And if you don't like this show,

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
then you know what? Screw you. No,

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Go support a show,

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
go support another indie

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
show, because there probably is somebody

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
out there making a show that's right up your alley

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
and it's a hardworking indie producer

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
just like us, so please support

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
independent broadcasting.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
DarkSakura's not here tonight.

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
She'll be back on the show next week.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
She's been moving, so I'm

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
sure her final thought would probably be

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
along the lines of, I'm really tired

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
and I want a taco.

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
I'm gonna guess that would be DarkSakura's final thought.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
I guess I'll just work more of my game

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
this week and hopefully maybe get some actual

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Playstation 4 games so that I can

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
well, hopefully play some Playstation 4

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
games. I don't know if I'm really gonna

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
I don't wanna buy any more digital games.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
I already have three physical games that I just

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
haven't gotten to play yet and two digital ones

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
coming out in November, plus

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
I'm probably gonna buy like Far Cry 4

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
and maybe The Crew,

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
we'll see.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
So I don't wanna like

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
I don't wanna do what I do with every single console

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
launch where I'm like, oh, games, games, games, games, games!

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
And don't play any of them, so it's like, you know.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
So, yeah.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Alright. Well,

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
when that patch comes out, you and I have to

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
play some Diablo online and test that thing

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
out at some point. I'm gonna be

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
with my show on Friday, I'm gonna be a little

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
busy this week, but maybe Tuesday or Thursday

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
somewhere around there, I'll be available

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
if the patch works right away on Tuesday

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
which I'm not always anticipating it to.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
But we'll get around to it.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
Actually, my final thought tonight is

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
I need to go finish my game

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
of Beyond Earth because I made the mistake

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
of playing on like a normal-sized map

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
and I'm on like turn 200 plus

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
and still nowhere close to being done

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
so I need to go finish my game of Beyond Earth.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
So, and,

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
oh my gosh, Final Fantasy XIV goes down tonight

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
for an entire day and I still have to get my drop

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
out of Circus Tower! I got games to play,

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
people! I hope you do, too.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Have a great week. Be nice to each other,

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
people. It's a crazy time right now

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
on gaming, so, you know, treat people

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
how you want to be treated. Don't be a jerk.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
Take care of each other. Good night.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
See you next week.

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Thanks for watching!
