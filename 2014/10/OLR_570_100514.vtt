00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
This week, the news comes in pairs as Twitch and Steam instate new policies involving sponsored broadcasts and video game curation. Also in pairs this week, handheld console themed Star Wars games as well as plastic Strider and Halo. We'll tell you more along with your tweets, calls, and chat comments right here on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live here on October the 5th, 2014 with episode number 570 of our show.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts and we've got a really busy show for you guys tonight so let me get right to it and introduce our co-host. Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
How are you?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
You're full.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm very full.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
This yummy bread that you brought to the show that tastes like Cinnabon as bread.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
But it's better than the Cinnabon bread.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Cinnabon does make a bread, a loaf of bread, and it's not nearly as good as the stuff.

01:08.000 --> 01:18.000
Why is it that every, and you know we love to talk food here at OLR so I'm going to start with this. This is tonight's kickoff topic. Why does every airport have a Cinnabon? What is it about planes?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
They want you to be in a food coma for the trip.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Clearly.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm so full of Cinnabon. I can't get out of my seat.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
That means that fewer people are going to the bathroom.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Hold on, I know Tech Master Loki over there has got to have an answer for this. Hi Tech Master Loki.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
It's because Cinnabon is awesome and normally it's just in the mall. I mean occasionally you'll find it in a strip mall but it's usually just in like a major shopping mall.

01:43.000 --> 01:53.000
And so it's, and every time I go to an airport it's like, ooh Cinnabon. That's it. It's like, ooh Cinnabon. I got to get a Cinnabon.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
I had a friend, this was about a year ago, was like, man I really want Cinnabon but I hate going to malls that go to the airport. It'll be faster.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
And she went.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
That's actually kind of true.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
It is true.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Well she also lived closer to the airport.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
Alright. We do tape live of course every Sunday night, excuse me, at the voice of Geeks Network.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
vaughanetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sunday nights.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
And Dark Tetsuya in chat says, wow a whole minute before the food talk. That has to be a record.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Hey Dark Tetsuya, shut up.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Look, like I said, it is a busy show tonight.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
So we have, you know.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
We need energy.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
So yeah, we have, we got to get through some of these segments real quick.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Tonight, not only all that news that Jason mentioned in the intro there, but we have another interview this week.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
And this is going to be great to talk about this because Dark Sakura, I know you love your pinball.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yes.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
And so we have an awesome guest this week.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Unfortunately the scheduling didn't work out.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
He couldn't be here live, but so we already actually taped this. It's already done.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
But I did mention you quite a few times in the interview because of your love of pinball.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And you're okay.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
But we have tonight, if you love pinball, stay tuned because we have Farsight Studios.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Bobby King from Farsight Studios is going to be joining us to talk about the pinball arcade.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Which is on like every platform.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Like I could start naming the platforms it's on.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Like oh it's on PS3 and PS4 and Xbox 360 and the Ouya.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
And I mean it's on like every modern gaming console.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And I actually will ask him about that in the interview a little bit later on in the program.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
We'll get into that in about probably about an hour and a half.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
We'll actually do that usually where we would have a break between parts A and B of our show.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
We will get to that interview and lots of good stuff in that. So stay tuned for that.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Meanwhile we're going to get to our gaming weeks.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
But we got to get to some kickoff topics.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I thought it was food.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
No we're done with food chat for now.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
You wouldn't stop burping so I had to end food chat.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Alright let's get to a couple kickoff topics tonight.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
I thought since we do have Bobby coming on the show tonight to talk about the pinball arcade.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
And the Kickstarter for the Addams Family table.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
That they're trying to make happen.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Which I think they're like super close to their goal.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
So maybe our listeners will be enough to push it over.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Wait wait wait. Goal!

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Goal!

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
The Addams Family is like one of the few tables I don't see in your house.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Yes but we have the table that came as a result of Addams Family.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Oh really?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Twilight Zone.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Oh I did not know that was a result of that.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Addams Family was such a runaway success.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
They're like here's our list of licenses do whatever you want.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
And he's like I'm going to make Twilight Zone.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
And I'm going to make it a wide table and we're going to put MagnaRamps in it and all this stuff.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
So yeah but Addams Family is one.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I do like Prop Addams Family.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Prop Cycle Addams Family.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Oh god. I didn't even think to ask about that during the interview.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
It's a real bummer that you couldn't be here to ask about those types of things.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
But I did ask about the gold edition Addams Family so we'll talk. We'll get into that later.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
It's too bad the Twilight Zone table didn't have the Twilight Zone song. The techno song.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yes it did.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
It did?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
No no it had the golden earring one.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Oh.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
No no see.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Loki is talking about the Twilight Zone that was in DDR.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Oh.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
I think the table might have predated or been around the same time.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
But they got like an all synth version of golden earrings Twilight Zone.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Twilight Zone is a rad table.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Ten minutes long.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
How did you get into pinball, Dark Sakura?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Dan.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Well actually I should take a step back.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Why is it seen that pinball and video games tend to go hand in hand?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I mean technically they are different.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
A pinball is not a video game.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
But at the same time it's like okay I don't know many gamers who are like I hate pinball.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And I don't know many pinball players who are like I hate video games.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
They tend to be pretty closely related.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
They're electronic entertainment.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
You stand, you press buttons and things happen.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
You have scores involved. It's a game.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
So they are technically in the same genre.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Right.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Just variants of it.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Right.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Whereas one is kind of like a physics game in a way.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Pinball is kind of a physics game but that's not a bad thing at all.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
That's what's kind of fun about it.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I think pinball went on two divergent paths.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah.

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
You have, they all started with the same you know the ball goes and hits different things to what we know as pinball and then pachinko.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Ooh.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
See I thought you were going to go towards like virtual pinball because a lot of my memories for pinball quite honestly have to do with virtual tables.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
I mean I love the physical, don't get me wrong, I love the physical tables.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
You know I remember when the roller rink, oh yeah I went there, would have pinball machines and that was a lot of fun.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Hey I was only good at Frogger if I was on roller skates.

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
But I also remember pinball on the NES but also more importantly like okay those collections they had like I remember there was a collection on the Amiga.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
Pinball Dreams I think and they brought it over to like early PCs like in the 90s and those collections were so flipping good.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I think those actually exist on like iPhone now today.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
So I love that stuff.

07:10.000 --> 07:22.000
Well I'm counting virtual pinball in the same category as pinball because it's really just a, it's pinball facsimile.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
You know it's pinball simulation.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
So just like you know some video games are simulations of other things.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Which is basically what the pinball arcade is.

07:33.000 --> 07:42.000
But they do a great job and I like it because you know pinball tables can be hard to find in this day and age.

07:42.000 --> 07:50.000
And you know unfortunately it is somewhat of a, I don't want to say a dying trend but it's popularity seems to not be where it was.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
It's just because arcades aren't that popular anymore.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yes I think it's tied to that.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Not necessarily amongst the collectors.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
No not amongst the collectors, oh god no never.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
The market is actually, the value of tables is really shooting up now.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
But like where in town can I play a theater of magic? Not in somebody's house.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
See she was about to say something.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Wait not in somebody's house.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I could name four people's houses you could go play it at.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
But see that's the problem.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
It's you know if I want to play theater of magic well now I can, I do have a way to do that.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
It's like I can do the next best thing like literally.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Okay maybe it's not the physical table.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
We could borrow somebody's again.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
We do table swaps all the time.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
You know what the problem is? It's because 7-11 doesn't have arcade games anymore.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
That's the problem.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
It's because arcades don't have arcade games anymore.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
7-11 was the first place I played Mortal Kombat 2.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
You know what they have now? ATM machines. And that's not a fun game.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
That's also redundant.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Well it says ATM on the machines so you know.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
That's what the M stands for.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I understand that.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
That's like saying pin number.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Department of Redundancy Department. How can I help you?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Anyhow.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Hello I'd like to have an argument.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Let's quickly just to you know kind of throw this out there.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Because I'm going to ask this of Bobby later when he comes on.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
And Jamie I know this might be, no actually I already know what you're going to answer this with.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
But just for those that may not know.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
What is your favorite pinball table of all time and why?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
World Cup Soccer 94.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
And why?

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Because it was the table I had at college when I went to the University of South Alabama.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
And I was pretty damn good at it. And I have the table practically memorized.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm not as good as I used to be at it.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
But it's one of, I'd probably say it's my favorite right now.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
It just has a lot of memories attached to it for me.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
If I was going to name another one I'd probably say Last Action Hero.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
Because that was the table that Dan and I played a lot when I was working at GNC back in the day.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
They had a Last Action Hero at GNC?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
No. We had to take...

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
That would probably get me into a GNC.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
You want to get buffed like Schwarzenegger?

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
I had to take the deposit and the deposit was right next to a Godfather's in Natomas.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
I think it's in Mt. Mike's now or something.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
I was going to say is Godfather still around? They all went under around here.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
But Dan and I would go and pick up a cheap pizza and play Last Action Hero.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
And Snow Brothers. They had Snow Brothers.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
That's love. That's love right there. Cheap pizza and Snow Brothers.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
But then they changed out the Last Action Hero and then we started going there.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Because then I got my first full-time job.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Another one I'd actually have to say that I really, really, really like...

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Alright, last one. You can't name them all, Jamie.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I actually really like Brighter Pin Bot.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
That's a good table.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Brighter Pin Bot is a very good one. It's a classic.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
Some people will look over it, but it was a very interesting one in the series.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
It had a lot of different tricks to it, so it was very cool.

10:51.000 --> 10:59.000
Okay, so my favorite table legitimately is, of all time, my favorite table really is The Addams Family.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
And that's actually part of the reason I reached out to Farsight and wanted to invite them on the show.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
I personally am just excited of the idea that The Addams Family could get into the series alongside these other tables.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Because for me, I think The Addams Family was the best table there ever was.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
But for me, see, I love the movie.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
And I was probably 12 or 13 when that movie came out, and I love the movie.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
And even still to this day, it's such a great movie, right?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Like Raul Julia was great in it.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Angelica Huston is the perfect Morticia.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
It's just such great. Christina Ricci is Wednesday. Just an amazing film.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
I will have to tell you something. Did you know the sound bite from The Addams Family made it into Twilight Zone?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
No, I didn't know that.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Greed.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Really? I never noticed that.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
And they had all those cool little references that actually tied into the movie.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
It didn't feel like it was some weirdly tacked on thing.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
It actually felt like an extension of the movie, but as a pinball table.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
You had the bookcase that was in the movie. You had the thing.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
You had the memushka. It was a big scene in the movie.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
And it's a big type of multi-ball or something in the table.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I just love the way it ties in.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
But my second favorite table of all time would be Pinbot.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
And that might be partially because of the NES version.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Which, granted, I understand to some people the NES version is super hokey.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
But to me as a kid, I loved it.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
Although I will say, Alan has really brought my love of the Elvira table up.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Actually, there's two Elvira tables.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
There is.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I like them both.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
There was some of the madness, wasn't it?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Well, they're both in the pinball market.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
But the Elvira tables, he has really raised my love of those tables as well.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I had to double check, but yeah, it was designed by Pat Lawler.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Oh, there you go.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
For the life of me, I knew it wasn't one of Steve Ritchie's.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
But yeah, it's one of Pat Lawler's ones.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Talk about the two best pinball designers.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Pat Lawler and Steve Ritchie.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And Steve Ritchie is such a nice guy.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Yeah, you met him at one of those California exchanges.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I've met him a couple times. I hung out with his wife for like two hours one night.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
So, they're both really cool people.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Alright, now I'm dying to know this.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Because, Loki, you don't talk a lot about pinball, but I know you've played some machines.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
So, what's your favorite?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
My favorite is Adam Stanley, actually.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
Because I used to play that at Qsar, where I worked and stayed a lot of the time.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
So, you know, they had Adam's family there.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I think they had Twilight Zone also.

13:29.000 --> 13:36.000
They also had my second favorite game, which was Attack from Mars, I think.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Attack from Mars is a good one.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
That was great.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
There's the classic and then there's the hologram.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
The hologram.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
The hologram was Revenge from Mars.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Revenge from Mars. I'm sorry. Revenge from Mars.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
So, that one was pretty cool.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
And then, before that, I didn't really play a whole ton of pinball.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
So, I'd have to say, what was it? The default shareware table that was in Epic Pinball.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Oh, the Rockstar or something? Is that the one?

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
No, no, it wasn't Rockstar. It was like a cyborg thing.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Like some cyborg chick. I don't remember.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Oh, god. Epic Pinball was so good. Oh, my gosh.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Did you guys ever play any, though, of the weird specialty tables?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Like, there was the, what was the giant one?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
The Titan pinball?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Not, like, physical? No.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I remember, like, Rollerball on the NES. There was three screens.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Have you ever been to the pinball museum in Las Vegas?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
No, but I'm going to Las Vegas.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
There's a pinball museum in Las Vegas?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I think that they moved it from the location I saw it at, but they have a pinball circus there.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Well, there's a pinball museum now in Alameda.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I need to go.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
But, like, you remember Hyperball?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Or, uh, what was the one that I really liked?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Black Hole.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Where the ball goes and then you're playing it upside down.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Oh, yeah, I played that at California Street. Good times.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
It was like Theater of Magic. That was pretty cool.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Theater of Magic is a great one.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
It was very solid.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
The Genie. The one with the spinning lamp.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
What the hell is that one, Jamie?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
It's like Aladdin's Tales from the Lamp.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Oh, my god.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
It wasn't like an Arabian Nights.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Oh, my god. I can't remember the name of that table.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I think it was Arabian Nights.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Yeah, I think it was Arabian Nights.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Or Black Rose.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
The one where you shoot a cannon.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Okay, so quickly before we get to our gaming week,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I want to kind of talk about this up front

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
because I know this is on a lot of your minds out there

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
and that is the release of

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Smash Bros. on the 3DS.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Got it.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Smash Bros. for 3DS. Have you had a chance to play it yet, though?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
No, because I was sick yesterday

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
and it was also Yom Kippur.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Which I hope my fellow Jews out there had a good fast.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Um, but I've actually been doing a lot of catch up today.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
And, Loki, you still don't even own a 3DS, right?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I don't really have an opinion on this.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Dan's been playing the crap out of it.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah, I know some of you guys,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
and I've played a little bit of it, too,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
so I'm curious of your thoughts on the new Smash Bros.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
in our chat room over at live.volgnetwork.com.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
And I've played a little bit of it

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
and I'm always impressed at how much they cram

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
into a Smash Bros. game.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Because you know it's not just, like,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
clusterfuck rumble, free-for-all mode.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
They also have, like, solo mode

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
and hit the punching bag as far as you can.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And bombs, and get the trophies.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And adventure mode's really cool.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Like, I'm always impressed at, like,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
how many freaking modes they cram into the game.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Like, it's so much.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Is the adventure- do they have, like,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
the adventure mode in this one? Is that, like-

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's not like it is, like, in the Wii one.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
See, the Wii one is really awesome.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I do like what they did here, though.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
They basically- you have a maze that you go through

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
and you get five minutes or something in the maze

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
and you try to collect as many items as you can

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
and the items will increase your attack,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
your roll, your jump, you know, all these various things.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
And the more you get of all that,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
then you, at the end of the five minutes,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
you do an epic battle with all the players

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
that were in the maze.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
So it's actually- it's a cool little minigame,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
you know, for the 3DS. Keep in mind.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And here's the one drawback to Smash on the 3DS,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
is that- and I'm gonna get shit for this comment

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
from my Nintendo-loving friends,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
but I'm sorry, guys.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
This is opinion. Take it or leave it.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
If you wanna, you know, throw in your two cents,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
you can in our chat room.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Or our email bag, participate at orangeontrated.com,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
but here it is.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
The 3DS is just the wrong system for this game.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And I kinda said this,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
you know, when I played the demo,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I thought I was worried a little bit that this might be the case.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I know Bobby Blackwolf on his show,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
he talked about, you know,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
his issues with it, especially

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
being on an older 3DS,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
but like-

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I can't stand the circle pad, for one,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
as a controller. Like, um,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I love to use NES, and I

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
find that, like, I do the wrong

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
PK thing, because, like,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
my up flick should've been a right-

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
you know, like, I flicked the thing the wrong way,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
and it goes weird. And like, jumping

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
feels so weird

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
in this to me, and I- again, I think it's that stinking

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
circle pad. And I don't like that you can't

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
flip that and the D-pad, because the

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
D-pad is meant for taunts. Um,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
so, I don't know. Um,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
so that part of it is, uh,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
uh, a little bit

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
annoying. But, for me,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
here's the thing. This acts

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
as a great teaser, and a great

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
build-up for the Wii U version,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
which will be the, like,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
piece de resistance, for- for,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
you know, for me. Like, that's- that's the one

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I really wanna get. I understand

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
why Nintendo kinda had to do the

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
3DS version, because, you know,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
with the Wii U not being in as many homes

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
as- as maybe they'd want,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
they can probably sell a lot more by

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
putting it on the 3DS. And there's gonna be people-

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
a lot of people that end up buying it on both.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Um, but,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
you know, I- I- again, there's a lot of

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
good in this game as well. Like, the character

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
customization is fun. And I-

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I actually liked designing the Miis an awful

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
lot, and I liked being able to make your own character and all this

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
stuff. Again, it's just, like, playing

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
all this makes me really excited to play it

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
on the system I think it was really

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
meant for, which is the Wii U.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
That's my opinion. Take it or leave it.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Uh, let's see, uh,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Uh, Codeman

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
says, I'm waiting for Wii U, I don't own a

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
3DS. Uh, Codeman

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
says, are Ness and Lucas back

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
in the game? Um, Ness only,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Lucas was cut out, and I was really

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
surprised they didn't do a palette swap

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
for Lucas on Ness, which,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I understand they had their differences in the last game,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
but they could've done a little bit of

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
fan service having Lucas as a palette swap, but

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
yeah, only Ness is in it. Um,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Kaijuto in chat

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
suggests, if you have a problem with the circle pad

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
jump, use wire X.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
That's true, I could do that, it's still,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I don't know why, it just doesn't feel

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
right to me, because again, I

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
think, because of the way the circle pad is

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
designed, sometimes I end up jumping when I don't mean to jump.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Like, I don't know. It's just

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
bleh. Uh,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
S2100Matt says, apparently some people

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
broke their circle pads. Yeah, I saw some of that from

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Japan. Uh, S2100Matt

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
says, Smash Run has some cool fan

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
service moments when fighting old school

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
and lesser known enemies. Yeah, man, the

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
trophies. There's some really

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
excellent trophies that really

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
dig deep into the Nintendo

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
universe, and for that matter,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
uh, the Mega Man universe,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
the Pac-Man universe, you know, and

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
all that with all the people that are

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
assisting, you know, cause Sega's involved, Capcom's

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
involved, Namco's involved, it's pretty impressive.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Um, I wanna say this as well,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
speaking of the other companies involved,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I gotta say, one of the most

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
impressive things for me, like being able to play

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
it in the game that makes me so happy and so

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
frustrated at the same time,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
playing Mega Man on

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
that Dr. Wily stage. Like,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
oh my god, it's so good,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
like, like, but it makes

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
me so upset that they are

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
not doing another Mega Man game. Like,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
they could just make a Mega Man game

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
like that, and I would be so happy,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
but I just feel like it's never gonna

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
happen, and it makes me so sad.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Have you played your Mii yet? I have

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
played as the Mii. My Mii's a little sword fighter.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Dan, I think, went with the default

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
set for his. Uh-huh. I'm planning on doing

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
like a Sheik style, so.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Uh, Kossan in

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
chat says, stands outside of NOA headquarters

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
with a sign that says, no Ice Climbers and

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
no Lucas equals no sale.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Well, here's the thing. Um, Ice Climbers,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
and we talked about this on a previous week's

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
show, Ice Climbers apparently were

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
cut from the 3DS version because

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
it's a hardware issue, a hardware limitation,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
or a hardware limitation, excuse me. If all

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
four people in the match were playing Ice

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Climbers, the system couldn't handle it.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Maybe the new 3DS can handle it,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
but the old 3DS's can't. And

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I think we're seeing some things where the

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
3DS version of the game

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
changed a few things. In fact,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
there were some stories that came out this week

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
about, like, what's going on with some

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
of the hardware limitations. Did you know

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
the 3DS is the reason that

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Sheik and Zelda were split into

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
separate characters? Uh, yeah,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
that is in a translation from

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Sakurai's Famitsu column.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Of course, Masahiro Sakurai, who's behind

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Super Smash Brothers, said, quote,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It's basically due to the 3DS limitations.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
It was impossible to have both characters

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
exist together as one on 3DS.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
However, reaching that limit can

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
sometimes lead in good directions. Transforming

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
characters had the drawback of ambiguous

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
tactics and such, and I believe they've

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
become more fresh now.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
So, 3DS, the reason

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
why Sheik and Zelda were

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
split into separate characters.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Kind of interesting.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Not available on the

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
3DS, by the way, the Circle Pad

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Pro. Again,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Masahiro Sakurai explained,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Supporting the Circle Pad Pro requires

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
the use of some of the CPU's processing

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
load. From the information received

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
during the development of Kid Icarus Uprising, this

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
is quite a large load at around 5%.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Kid Icarus Uprising and Smash

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
both use the maximum capability of the

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
device, so we had to abandon

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
the idea of the Circle Pad

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
support. I don't understand why that would

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
be. I mean,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
aside from just, you know, the infrared

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
communication with it or something, but...

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Is it battery drain, maybe?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
It's not battery drain, because it's got an

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
external battery, but it's

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
just... I think

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
it's because they're using infrared to

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
send signals back and forth with it.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Instead of having to actually plug into

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
a port or something.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Which is dumb. It's really

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
stupid, because it should be absolutely

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
no extra load since

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
it's just buttons. It's not doing any

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
sort of processing other than

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
reading the inputs coming from those buttons.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
But the fact that it has to

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
translate that data into something it can send over

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
IR and then re-translate that

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
back into something that the machine can understand is

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
that's where your overhead comes through. And why

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
is it 5%? That's retarded. That

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
should be 5% for something so

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
stupid and simple.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I honestly

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
think it's a power. It comes down to the power

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
source and the fact that the new one, since

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
it's built in, it's not going to drain from the same

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
power source. I really think that's what it comes down to.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Alright, one other thing I want to say

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
on Smash for the 3DS.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
If for whatever reason you haven't bought it yet,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I know some of you are holding off for Pay Day

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
or whatever the case may be,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
keep in mind you will have to grab an

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
update before you can actually play the game.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
There is a patch out there.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
You have to patch to 1.0.2.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
That will allow you to play online,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I should say, because technically if your 3DS

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
never goes online, the game will never know it needs a patch.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
But you will have to get this patch to play

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
online. So you can do

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
that by, you can actually go into the

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
eShop on the 3DS and grab

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
the patch now. You don't need the game

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
to get the patch and

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
that will get some of you guys ahead of the game.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
So check that out if you think

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
you will be picking up Smash Bros. in the coming

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
days. So, there

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
you go. I hope you guys

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
are having fun with Smash Bros., those of you that do have

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
the game. So even though I said I'm not

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
so sure about the system and so forth, I still

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
think it's, I mean, you can't

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
say you don't get your money's worth out of this game.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
That's for sure. So there's a

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
lot there.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Alright, let's move on to our

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
gaming weeks and what type of video games

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
we've been playing this week, I suppose besides

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Smash Bros., to sort of

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
establish our frame of reference on

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
what we're up to in the gaming world.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
DarkSakura, how about you?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Well, I did get Smash Bros.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I haven't played it yet.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I played Final Fantasy 14.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I played some Mass Effect.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I tried playing this

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
puzzle game on Steam. I forgot what it was called

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
but it sucked, so I stopped playing it.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And I played some Fractal because

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I miss playing Fractal, make Blooms

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
not war. Fractal's really good.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And then I've also been playing a lot

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
of Moonlight Mahjong at work

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
during lunch.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
It's actually ridiculously

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
fun because it makes my

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
brain do things. Is it actual Mahjong or is it

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
like that old, like the Solitaire Mahjong,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
like that game Shanghai? Remember like

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
in the early, late 90's

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
like every computer had Shanghai.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It's single player

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Mahjong puzzles.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
It's the whole like moving the tiles? Okay, yeah.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Well, you don't move them around, you just pick the matches.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Yeah, but it has to be like certain rules, right?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Like you can only move the tiles left or

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
right to get them off the board. You can't move them up and down.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Something like that. You just click on them.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I know, but you can't click on any tile.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
No, some of them you can only

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
move the ones off the sides or at the top.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
You can only click tiles that are fully

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
exposed, I believe. That's it, something like that.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Like one or two times playing Mahjong.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Yeah, I mean, it's got the rules in it

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
but you just click them and they go.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And it makes my brain

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
not hurt anymore.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
And things.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Alright. Loki, how was your

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
gaming week? I only really played a little

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
bit of Call of Duty multiplayer 2

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
because we finally did our game night again.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
And then

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
just worked on my game.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
That was pretty much it.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I'm probably going to play some more stuff.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I want to get a next gen system.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
It's just

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
you know, having enough

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
extra money and having a job

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
to do that. Well, by the way,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
thank you for bringing that up

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
because I wanted to at some point in the show congratulate

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
you. You got a job.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Yeah. Already. So, I mean, that's

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
amazing. Congratulations. I just don't start

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
yet. So, you know. You have a little

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
gap before you start. You have a little gap.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Hey, you know what?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Like a month gap, not nearly as bad.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Dude, Alan was out of work for like a year

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
and a half before he found something. And a lot of people

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
faced hard times like that. So, you know what?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Enjoy the time off to work

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
on your game. Yeah.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Hopefully. I'm still going to be applying for stuff.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I still have interviews and stuff.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
In fact, I'm doing a couple phone interviews

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
tomorrow. Make them fight over you.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Yeah. Whoever's going to

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
offer me the most money. So, that's really

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
what it comes down to. There you go.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
It's almost something I want to do.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
So, I'm going to be doing that. But, yeah.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I worked on my game a little bit more. Still working

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
on the editor.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I'm almost done with it

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
because I was just trying to get a few tools

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
too. Because the editor's done as far

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
as what I needed for building

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
like ships and

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
the smaller things. But,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
if I were to use that same editor

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
for building like a whole

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
level, it would take forever.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
So, I needed to build like

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
basically

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
tools that we would see since it's

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
voxel based.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Similar tools you would see like in

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
World Build or something like that in Minecraft.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Where it's really fast.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Where you can just

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
design stuff

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
really fast with brushes and all

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
sorts of things. So, that's what I was coming

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
up with for my game right

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
now. So, I'm working on that so I can finish

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
actually start building some of the

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
assets for the game.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And that's pretty much it. I'm almost done

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
with that one. I finally

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
start working on it some more. Hopefully

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
get something that I can actually show. Once

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
the editor's done. Alright. Can't wait to see it.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Let's see. My

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
gaming week. I

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
played a lot of the same stuff

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
that you've heard me talk about before. Theatrythm.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Because Smash didn't come out until Friday. So, early

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
in the week I was like, must play more Theatrythm.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And I played a whole lot more.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I even did some DLC.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
They released the Mooglemog song

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
from Final Fantasy XIV in Theatrythm. And I love

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
that song. And then I had to get Crazy

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Chocobo. And I dedicate that to you

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Acteft.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Crazy Chocobo from Final Fantasy

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
XIII-2 which is the heavy metal version

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
of the Chocobo theme that is

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
very divisive in people's opinions.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And let's see.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
What else did I play this week?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I played more Diablo 3. I'm working on a hardcore

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
seasonal character. And I beat

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
story mode. And I'm all the way to level

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
52. And last night I

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
got very daring. Because it's a hardcore

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
character, right? So, I play it very conservative.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Because in hardcore, once you die,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
you die. Like it's done.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Your character is done. You have to start over from the very beginning.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
So, I've been playing on

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
normal. Like easy, normal, not

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
amping it up difficulty. But last night I said

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
you know what? I'm feeling

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
a little risky. Now that I've beaten the story mode

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
at least once, I'm gonna play a little risky.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
So I amped up the difficulty one

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
notch to hard. And

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
it was definitely harder and kept me on my toes.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I had an oh shit moment.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
But luckily my character is still alive.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Junior Mintz, my hunter.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Demon Hunter is still alive.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I named him after a box of candy that was sitting on my desk

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
when I made him. So there you go.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Junior Mintz is now level 52.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
And let's see.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Other games I played this week.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I played

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Final Fantasy 14

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
of course. Because I play a lot of that.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
And

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Destiny. That's the other one.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I played more Destiny. I hit

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
level 20 in Destiny.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And that ridiculous where you

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
have to get gear that has light on it

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
to level up. I really think that's the most

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
redonkulous thing I've heard.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Level up a character past level cap.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
But whatever. I'm up to level 21

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
now. I'm like three quarters of the way through level

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
21 just praying I can get

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
a good loot drop to level up my stupid

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
character. I don't understand why it's called

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
a level cap if you can level up past

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
it. Because without the gear

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
you'll never level past it. It's all gear

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
based. Yeah I know. I can't stand it. I think

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
it's ridiculous design flaw.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
But that's my opinion. Not everybody

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
is going to agree with me. Hey Rob.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I finally got around to naming my chocobo. Did you?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Hot Wings. Hot Wings

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
is the name in Final Fantasy 14 right?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
My chocobo's name is Hot Wings. Good times.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Good times.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
So yeah. Then I was playing Destiny. And I've done like

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
some random online stuff with that.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Including like doing some

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
strikes with like Shane and Extifer.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Or my friend Ian from Koopa Club.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
You know. Whoever is on

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
and can do stuff. We will do that.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Dungeon Buster in chat

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
says 20 is the soft cap

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
and the hard cap is 30.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
And then Alan letting everybody

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
know about this. That I did a live stream

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
of Final Fantasy 14 this week and I got

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
him to agree to do hunts. And he got

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
so mad he was real real mad.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
That is accurate. Alan was like let's do

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
a hunt. And I hate

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
hunts in Final Fantasy 14. I think they're ridiculous.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I think they're way

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
too much of a necessity

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
for people to do to hit the cap if that's

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
what they want. And I think they made

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
they made them way too powerful.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
And they're just a joke. Because everybody

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
just cluster fucks the mob and the

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
thing is dead in like 5 seconds.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
You got like 60 people attacking this one thing.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
And yeah. So they called

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
it out like oh here's where the mob is.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I ran to the wrong coordinates.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
On accident. And so I was like 10

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
10 squares away on the

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
map or whatever. So as I'm running

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
to the right location the mob's already

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
dead. Like literally I walk

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
into the screen to see that the mob

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
just died. And I'm just like you know what? Fuck

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
hunts. And I logged out. And that was the end of my

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
livestream.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
But I don't have anger issues

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
or anything. I actually get to

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
make a hunt tomorrow.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
For what? For treasure hunting.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Sorry. Oh. Oh that. Oh that's

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
different. Yeah. Treasure hunts are different.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I'm okay with the treasure hunts.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Alright. Let us take care of

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
a few housekeeping things. I have a couple things to

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
mention. We will not

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
be here live on October

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
19th. That's two weeks from tonight.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
The reason why I will be at

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
speaking of all this Final Fantasy talk. I will be at

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Final Fantasy Fan Fest. And if I get to talk to

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Yoshida-san I'm gonna say hunts

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
suck. So. But I love your game.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I love your game so much. That one part. Since I'm

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
not playing Final Fantasy 14 do they do any

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
of like the cool like holiday stuff that they

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
did in 11? I got a

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
bikini. Yeah they do. Cause my favorite was

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
that tree. The very first one that they did

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
with the tree that you couldn't kill because

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
there was a bug in it. And so

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
you just keep wailing on it and it's like

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
it just wouldn't die. They don't have like a

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
killer tree but they'll do like quests

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
and you get rewards

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
like usually their costumes. Some of the

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
end game. I've noticed that some of the end game holidays

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
tend to be referencing

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
back to some Japanese holidays as well

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
as Western holidays. Yeah.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
So we're getting sort of the best of both.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Like didn't they do something for Golden Week?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Or they did the Midsummer

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
thing didn't they? They did the Midsummer thing for sure.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Yeah. So. Yeah.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Um. But uh.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
You should

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
you should come play with us.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
One of us. Alright.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Do the thing. So we

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
will not be here in two weeks live

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
although we're hoping to have something on the feet.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Yes. Bodies. That might be a busy week

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
for a lot of us. So we will not be here October

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
19th. Um.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Follow us on Twitter.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Follow us on

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
YouTube. We're also on YouTube. Orange Lounge Radio.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
And also on Facebook.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. And Google Plus.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Google.com slash Plus.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Orange Lounge Radio. Before I get into

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
news. Before I get to our interview with Farsight

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Studio. I also want to talk about

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
some stuff that our pal Bobby Blackwolf

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
is up to. Speaking of interviews. It's

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
raining interviews here at VOG and we

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
love it. And Bobby has some of

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
his own going on. In fact

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
next week on his show. That's October 12th.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
He's going to have Kyle Pittman

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
who's the creator of the recently

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
released Super Win the Game.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Kyle used to be with Gearbox

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Software. He worked on Borderlands 2

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
and now he's Indie. Also

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
this is interesting because Bobby has some ties

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
in with Kyle Pittman.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
He's never actually spoken

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
to him. However

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
he's one half of the brothers that

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
made the game that Bobby did a

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
soundtrack for in 99.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
So this is an interesting reunion

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
of sorts. Even though they've never actually met.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So that will be a fun interview. So check that out

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
next week on Bobby's show. He is of course

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
live before us

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
here at the Voice of the Geese Network. VOGnetwork.com

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Now tonight he wasn't live. He had

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
an interview from Siege with

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Snarfquest Tales

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
and this is based on the comic

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
series by Larry

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Elmore who I know Dar Sockra is a big fan

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
of. Oh hell yeah. Dragon

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Lance. I thought for a second

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
there that it might have something to do with

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
the character from

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Thundercats. Wasn't it?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
No not in this case. Not in this case.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
But yeah you can check out the

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
interview on Bobby's show. You can also check out the game

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
itself if you want. Snarfquesttales.com

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
So check that

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
out. And oh my gosh

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
the interviews don't stop and we are

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
so excited because here at

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio we actually

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
have another interview planned for next

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
week and this is pretty cool because this is some

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Indie stuff going on. But

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
we will have Bodhi from

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Lunar Ray Games on

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
the show next week live.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
They're making a game called Time

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Spinner and it's a Metroidvania

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
type of game with some really cool like retro

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
looks to it. This game was on Kickstarter

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
and did very well on Kickstarter.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
So we're going to check in and see how the game's coming

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
along and see what folks can

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
look forward to with that. And we will have

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
him on live next week.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
So the 12th is going to be a very

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
busy night Sunday nights here at VOG.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Alright let's get into tonight

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
however with some gaming news.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Loke you want to start us off with some news.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Yes. When I'm not eating

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
waffle fries I read the news.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Waffle fries are pretty damn good. They're pretty good.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
So thanks

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
to I guess a lot of pressure from

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
consumers

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
gamers everywhere. There's

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
been some policy changes now

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
with Twitch including

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
that they now want

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
broadcasters that are

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
broadcasting stuff with you know

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
sponsorship from

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
you know a company

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
basically to be transparent

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
about that. So if you're getting paid to

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
play something on

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Twitch by

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
that publisher

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
that you say hey this is going to be

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
this is a sponsored

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
broadcast so that

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
people know that it's not just like

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
you know

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
it may

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
not be entirely unbiased I guess

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
if you will. You know they do

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
that like sponsored content I see that sometimes

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
on well you see that on Twitter

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
actually quite a bit. It's sort of like similar

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
like here at VOG when we and we

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
don't get to do a lot of reviews

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
because you know we don't most of our

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
staff makes podcasts so

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
we don't have a whole lot of dedicated writers

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
but like when we do

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
have the chance to review things we always

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
kind of put at the end of it like

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
you know either this was something we bought

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
this was something that was you know

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
we were given a key to you know it's like

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
the acquisition method just to

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
just to make sure everybody

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
understands you know throwing

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
it out there because honestly

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I think for a lot of people

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
like if it's free

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
versus if it's $60 could

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
sway your opinion one way or the other. Now when you

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
review a game and it was giving you free

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
you're really supposed to ask yourself

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
you know treat it like you paid the $60

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
for it and is it that value but

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
we still put that out there just to make sure everything

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
you know full disclosure. Well this I think is

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
a little bit more like you know say

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
you follow someone and even I think they

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
were talking about something and this may

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
have even come from YouTube where there's a lot of

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
content streamers out there that oh yeah we have

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
deals with some of these guys where you know

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
we will

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
be in like some sort of you know

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
partnership with this company

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
to do you know they're

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
going to pay us to do let's plays for this

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
game or something and a lot

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
of times they don't disclose that.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
So this you know is

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
kind of along the lines where you

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
know they want to make sure that it's

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
completely clear that you know

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
you're getting paid to do that. Same

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
goes with Steam. Steam now also

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
thanks to their new curator

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
you know feature

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
on there. Now they also

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
are requiring you to disclose

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
if you're a sponsored

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
curator so like you know if it's

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
a company that's you know

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
putting out a certain game

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
and they have a Steam curation thing

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
that you know hey

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
let you guys know

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
that if you're paying somebody

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
that feature that on their

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
curator I guess

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
curator page so if you

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
basically you know it boils down to if

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
you've accepted money or other

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
compensation for making a product review

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
or posting a recommendation

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
you must disclose this fact for

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
in your recommendation.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
And also

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
this should not link or link to

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
or promote any stores other than

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Steam of course you know because

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
they want the sales from their

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
websites list yeah of course

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
so I haven't explored

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
setting that all up like is that something

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I thought if I set up a curator

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
page would people care? Like I kind of

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I kind of think you all know my opinions on a lot of

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
games anyway you know. And then honestly

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I think a lot of well I thought the page was

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
for groups only so like you had

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
to I don't know if like if I could make my own

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
curator page oh it would have to be like a vog

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
yeah I think it has to be a group

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I thought I don't know I haven't really

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
looked too much into it but

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I don't know

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I mean it's good I guess that there's this transparency

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
because that's what a lot of people have been complaining about

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
so you know

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
more power to them I guess.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Now before we move on

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
since you brought up YouTube and that too

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
you know one of the stories that

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I don't think is on our show or otherwise tonight

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
but there was these

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
stories going around a lot of the gaming blogs about

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
how there's people out there that are

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
impersonating

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
celebrity or

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
professional YouTubers for lack of a better term

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
to get free keys for games

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
that they then flip and sell on

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
eBay. Did you read about this?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Well they're not even selling them yeah not even just on eBay

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
but like on like other

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
key reseller sites you know

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
some of which have

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
in the past bought the cheap

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
bundle stuff and flip it for

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
you know more money. Yeah

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I mean it's just unfortunately

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
something you're going to run into I think even

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
not even necessarily

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
just

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
you know just

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
this type of thing but in people

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
impersonating other people but even just like

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
no name people just kind of asking

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
hey can I have a key you know that type of thing

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
and they've kind of

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
in the different stories I read that their advice

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
was you know either A

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
handle it through like a

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
PR firm or something like that

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
B you know handle it through

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
like if it's you're getting

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
requests from different YouTube

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
guys that you

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
follow up or have them make that

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
request via like a

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
message through YouTube

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
you know send them like a

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
you know a private message or whatever through YouTube

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
that way you can you know

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
say OK this is actually from this person not

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
just someone impersonating

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
them. So

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I mean that makes sense.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Unfortunately you know

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
when you're you know sending out

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
emails or letting people know

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
PR and stuff that hey

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
you know if you want to review this game I can get

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
you a key for it and stuff and unfortunately

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
people want handouts you know

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
they want free stuff so they're going to do

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
whatever they can to manipulate

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
the system. Well it's not even the it's not even the free

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
stuff it's the people that turn them around and

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
resell them on these on these code sites and so forth

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
like it's more than that it's stolen

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
goods basically. Yeah crazy.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Yeah because I read it was I forget what game it was

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
but it was he'd actually

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
saw it was available on this one site

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
he's like well that's weird because I haven't even

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
released it you know other than

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
you know these reviewers

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
so houses on it. Yeah

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
the code. Yeah. Yeah. So

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
wow. Yeah.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
That's that's pretty pretty bad

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
that people are you know singing

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
that low to do that. But you know it's

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I'm not completely surprised

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
by it. And now

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
just quickly to answer the curator question

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
in our chatroom. Actf says a friend of mine

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
set up his own curator page

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
so yeah you can make your own. Groups

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
have curator pages made by default

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
so that might be. So VOG

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
has its own curator page now but

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
nobody has done recommendations since

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
it's only for group admins. Oh I didn't

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
know that that was a thing. But again

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
like I don't know like

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
what we would do because we're

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
really about like a variety of games

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
like should we do a list of these are games

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
that got a B or better review

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
on VOG or yeah I don't know I don't know what we do

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
so I think for now it'll stay

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
blank. I don't know. I kind of

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
feel like if you want to know our thoughts on games

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
check out the podcast. But

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
maybe we can think of a use for it.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Well hey hey I know we can do

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
we can just wait for you know Aaron

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
to port over

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
you know bungee ferret tossing. There you go.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
So once bungee ferret tossing makes us

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
esteem it'll just be our list of one game

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
you need to check out. Oh there you go. Absolutely I'm all for that.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Alright well here's a game

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
a lot of people want to check out but some people

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
are very frustrated by

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
the number of systems that

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
it's on. Jamie you want to jump in here?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I just remember the other game I played.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Oh my gosh why? Hot to Full Boyfriend

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
which I would totally give recommendations

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
for since it's on Steam. Speaking of streaming

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
and all that right? Yeah.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Alright. I don't know why I didn't think about it.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Well I have a feeling you're going to dig this game

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
to Dark Sakura if you ever get a chance to play it.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
You might have to come over here. Does it include dating pigeons?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Actually it might.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
And it would be here at

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
my house for sure

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
because I actually have the Wii U

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
so you could play Bayonetta 2

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
which yeah see

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
a lot of folks looking forward to that and I know I'm looking

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
forward to this too.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Hideki Kamiya who's

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
with Platinum Games one of the producers there

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
has reiterated to fans

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
this week that you know other publishers

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
turned down Bayonetta 2

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
only Nintendo stepped in to help.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
That's bullshit. I'm sorry.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I haven't even read the damn quote yet. I'm sorry.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Sit down.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I think I've discussed this many times before

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
but here goes. First of all, we, Platinum

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Games are developers and receive

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
support from publishers by making games that they

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
request or suggest. As for Bayonetta

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
we developed the game after signing a deal with

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Sega. Later it was decided to also

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
develop the sequel so we started working on Bayonetta 2.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
When development had progressed

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
to a certain degree and Sega's situation

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
had turned into this isn't a good plan

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
so development halted temporarily.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Without funding we didn't have the possibility

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
to continue development but we wanted to get this

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
partially developed Bayonetta 2 available to

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
public one way or another so we offered it to various

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
publishers but as it is a big title

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
we couldn't find a partner company. Finally

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Bayonetta 2 is about to get terminated completely

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
when Nintendo came in and lent

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
a hand we were able to restart the development

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
we so desired. Finally the game was released

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
last week in Japan so five years

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
we were able to make Bayonetta 2 available

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
to the public. Knowing those

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
circumstances if someone is still angry

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
for heading towards Nintendo I wonder what's

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
the reason for that? Wouldn't you tell me in a way

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
that's easy to understand? As I have

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
said earlier if you want Bayonetta 2 on

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
PS4 or Xbox One how about trying to

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
ask Nintendo? If Nintendo doesn't

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
say yes it's not going to happen.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
While you're at it try asking for Mario

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
and Zelda 2. Ooh!

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Somebody's

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
somebody had carried a little

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
whip with that comment but he's right

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
in a way. But Loki you claim

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
shenanigans. I claim shenanigans because

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
there's companies like Axes Games

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
that will fucking pay to have

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
almost anything localized. I mean

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
just ridiculous

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
niche games. This isn't a matter

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
of localization though. Localization

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
is way cheaper than development.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
There's a big difference.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I don't think Axes Games has

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
quite the pockets. Now maybe

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Atlas but maybe

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
that's somebody that was approached we don't know.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Or here's another thing.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Fucking self-publish on

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
PS4 or Xbox One. You can do

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
that you know. You don't need

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
a publisher. But who

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
pays for the development? You can't say

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
oh I'll pay you when we're

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
done. Like you can't do that.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
You have to pay these people as the game is

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
development. Who's going to pay for that?

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Kickstarter it.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Well okay.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Now that could

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
be an option. Now we could

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Kickstarter it. But I think when this game was being

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
developed that really hadn't

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
gone through yet. So I don't know

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Loki. Hold out hope for Bayonetta 3.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
I hope they make

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
their money back on you know. I hope they do

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
too. On this

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
game cause

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
it's not looking good so far.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Let me put it that way. It's going to really suck

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
if they invested so

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
much into this game and

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
it doesn't end up making

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
that money back. I just hope

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
the Wii U audience doesn't limit them. I hope

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Bayonetta and Smash can kinda

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
exist together. I just think

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
they develop on

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
PC

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
and it gets ported to the Wii U.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I mean they don't develop on a Wii U.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
It's just something they test on.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
It's developed on PC. It's fucking

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
apparently really easy to port

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
over to the PlayStation. I would imagine it's gotta be

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
pretty easy to port on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
being that they're more powerful systems.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
But he's right. Nintendo paid for it.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
It's Nintendo's game. Nintendo will have to be the one

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
to put it on the PC. Will Nintendo do that?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I mean they could.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I mean I just don't think

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Nintendo will cause they're kinda stubborn like that.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
It's like you'd have better luck

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
getting a Mario game on the PC.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
They're not a company like Microsoft where

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
oh Halo 2 had a PC version.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
You know. Well

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I guess

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
it's just gonna

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
just sell like you know Mad World

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
did where you know it's

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
a great game and you know both

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Platinum games and you know more power to them

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
but unfortunately it's just not something that's

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
gonna sell a lot of copies. Or let's

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
do crazy internet forum

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
speak. Let's do crazy wank theories

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
that people come up with like oh oh

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
this is what's gonna happen. Oh oh you guys you guys

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
this is what's gonna happen. This is what's gonna happen. Okay okay

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
you guys. Apple's gonna buy Nintendo

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
and then Bayonetta 2 will be on

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
the Mac. That's cause Apple and Nintendo

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
they have to be in bed together. That's right. Apple and

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Nintendo they're like the same. Like Nintendo

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
is like Apple in Japan.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
That's what's gonna happen. Loki that's what's gonna happen.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
It's gonna happen.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Well

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
first off

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
you know

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
first off there's not a lot of games on them you know

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
you know the Mac anyways

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
but I mean I don't know. I could see them

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
maybe putting out

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
something for like you know

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
another

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
you know iPad or something like that. I mean

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
cause they're really pushing you know gaming.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Is there a Bayonetta on the fucking iPad?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Like it's just it doesn't. Why they've got like

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
what is it Infinity Blade on the fucking iPad?

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I just don't see it. You know it's an action game

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I mean I don't know.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I don't know. I'm

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I'm looking forward very much to checking out

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Bayonetta 2. I have a Wii U.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
This isn't a problem for me.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
It's the Xbox One exclusives that are

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
bugging me right now like Forza Horizon 2. Oh yeah.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I wanted to play that shit. No yeah exactly.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Forza Horizon 2 I totally want that.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Alright. Uh

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Moving on. Dark Soccer. What do you have for us?

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Uh we do have uh something

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
a new game coming out but not new new

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
new new. It's uh Star Wars Arcade

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Machine is gonna be coming out. Yes.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
They uh it's gonna be

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
uh uh

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
premiered at New York Comic Con

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
and Namco Bandai will be bringing out the new

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Star Wars Arcade. It's uh totally coin

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
op so

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
very surprising but I guess

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
if they say it can be done it can be done. Prequels

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
aren't in it right? I don't think so.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
But they said um there is

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
a press unveiling on October 8th

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
so we're not gonna

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
see it until it's actually out so

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
who knows. What kind of game

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
is it though? What does it say?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Is it gonna be like

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
well I mean they seem to

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
do these Star Wars arcade games pretty

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
regularly like you know there's the old school

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Atari vector one right and then they had that one

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
not that long ago well actually probably yeah

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
it was a long time ago like 10 years at this point

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
which was like the right when the

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
prequels were probably like big where you

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
like you had the big lightsaber thing

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
the pod racer game was kind of okay. Stick in the

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
middle that you would like fight lightsaber

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
battles with. It was kind of neat.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I think the only good thing that ever came out of the prequels was

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the pod racer game. Yeah. That was kind of

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
fun. Other than that. And the new

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Star Tours. Like believe it or not

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
when you go to Jar Jar Binks' planet that's

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
like the best one. I know

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
I know bite my tongue but seriously

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
that's the best. That was the one that made me jump.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Yeah. That ending. Yeah. I finally

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
got Hoth did I tell you. Did you?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Yeah. It took me forever to get Hoth.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Hoth is cool. Hoth was the best. Literally.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
It is. It's literally

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
cool. It's cold.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Anyway. You know who else

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
is cool. These guys who like to drop

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
into OLR occasionally and they're

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
back with us tonight. They snuck into the

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
studio through the door

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
and came back to say hi for another week

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
but I'm glad they're here. Welcome back you guys

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
from the big

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
yes the big anime

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
game room. Did I give that

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
out of order? Anyway. Jonas and

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Diego are back tonight. Did I say that right?

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Hello. I think it's the big ass game

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
anime room. The big ass game room?

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
No it's the big anime game room.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Is it the big ass game room?

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Some people in this room like ass an awful lot.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Sounds like room for future

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
development.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
We got another A in there I guess.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Big ass ass. That's right.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Big ass anime. So how you guys doing?

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
We're doing good. How are you doing?

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
How are things? Good. You missed us talking

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
about Smash. Have you guys

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
checked out the new Smash on 3DS yet?

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I've been trying to keep up on it right now and people are

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
figuring out stuff left and right.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Even when the demo was out people were just figuring out things

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
but as they unlock more characters

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
they're just figuring out that some of these characters

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
are somewhat broken from what I heard.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Uh oh. They're breaking the game as we

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
speak right now.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
It's only been out for a couple of days

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
now and people had just

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
a few tournaments locally around here and

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
people were saying things. I'm seeing people who are appearing

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
that I've never seen in my life that play games

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
that are winning. Wait they're already

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
having tournaments and this game came out on Friday?

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Yes they are. What the

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
hell?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Yeah I had a couple of locals in some of the comic

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
stores around here and uh

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
yeah it's been pulling crowds. Oh my gosh.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Just on Saturday there was a big

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
one in San Jose in the GameStop and it

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
pulled enough. You literally would have like 30 hours

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
to prepare for this. Oh my god.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
You know somebody was like Red Bull

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Red Bull just in my

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
veins. They just want to get

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Did Loki just get up to go get a Red Bull?

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Oh my

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
god. Product placement. They're just trying to

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
unlock everything and figure out the game as fast as they can.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
It's still relatively new so like it's anyways

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
game right now. Okay I'm struggling to

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
unlock characters because I'm just really bad

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
at Smash okay? And what the hell did they do

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
to Meta Knight? Oh my god.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Meta Knight used to be my go to. Like I understand he was

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
like so unbalanced like he was banned in tournaments

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
and shit but like now he does this

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
like torpedo shit. That just means he's bad ass

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
and you need to buff up everybody else.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Right? You know what Dan said

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
yesterday? Huh. You know

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I miss Jigglypuff.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Uh Jigglypuff's an unlock. Spoiler

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
alerts. Okay. So you'll get Jigglypuff

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
eventually. Keep playing. But Dan

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
was just like I can't believe

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
he said that. I miss

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Jigglypuff. Really? What about Snake?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Does anyone miss Solid Snake being

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
a little bit cause I thought

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Snake was cool as a character but I understand

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I understand like why.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
He's also on the game too.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
He's an unlock. Snake is in the

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
new game as well. No.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I thought he was like a DLC or something

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
like supposedly. No. He's either

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
one of the two. They said he was gonna be in this game.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I think he was on a list for supposed

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
DLC so but I do not believe

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
he's an unlock in the base roster.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Yeah I'm pretty sure cause you wouldn't

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
you wouldn't have a third party character. They already have the whole

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
game unlocked in Japan I thought already.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Yeah no I don't think Snake is in there.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Sonic is though.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Which you know that was cool

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
to have him back. Are his legs normal

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
sized?

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Or is that like you know a pallet swap where you can

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
adjust the size of his legs. No

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
his legs are not.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Act F says the last unlock

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
is Jigglypuff. There you go.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Kaijuto in chat says Wii Fit Trainer

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
kicks ass and Little Mac. I like

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
all the different skins you can do

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
because like with Little Mac

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
you can like have the wire frame

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
with Little Mac from the old school punch out.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Like did anybody play punch out in the arcades

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
like back in the day before it was an NES game? Like it was a big

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
wire frame character he used to play as.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
So I thought that was really cool. Yeah that was a nice feature

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
they did there. Yeah I love that. And

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Bowser Jr. I didn't know this until

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Shane was telling me about it. You can cycle

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
through and Bowser Jr. all the

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
pallet swaps are all of the Koopa

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
kids with Bowser Jr.'s moves.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
So you can play every single one of them.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
That's amazing. And

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
spoiler I'm totally glad that

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Rob the Robot is back. Yes.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
That was a fun character to play as.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
It is, it is. So I just found

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
a fun screenshot that I will link in the chat room

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
of everyone who made the

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
cast of

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
King of the Hill

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
as Mies. Oh as Mies.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
What the hell does that have to do with what we're talking about?

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Oh it's in Smash Bros. It's Mies. I saw

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
one with RuPaul's Drag Race characters

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
as Mies. And I thought that was great. Someone had a

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Neil deGrasse Tyson. Nice.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I saw a doctor.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Doctor Who. So I thought that was pretty cool.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Jonas how about you?

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Have you been playing Smash at all?

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I haven't gotten Smash yet because I'm just

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
waiting for the Wii U version. I know everyone says

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
get the 3DS version. But

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
again the 3DS I have

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
is actually my fiancé's.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
And it's mainly for her Pokemon plays.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Because she's been

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
playing more Pokemon competitively

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
because of the upcoming regionals.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I actually think that's an okay

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
perspective. Not everybody's going to agree with me

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
but I also kind of put it out there during

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
my little review of it. As I said

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
the biggest problem with Smash Bros.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
is the platform that it's on. Honestly.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
It's too much for the 3DS.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
And I think it'll be great on

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
the Wii U. For me this is like

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
a demo for the Wii U version.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Don't get me wrong. Yes it's in the 3DS version.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
But I think this is just an opinion based.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I think in terms of

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
processing power it was designed mainly for

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
the new Nintendo 3DS.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Yeah. I mean this thing pushes

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
the limits of the 3DS and kind of

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
then some. Honestly it pushes it beyond

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
because you can't even do Miiverse with it.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
So.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
That's sad that we're already at

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
the limits of this system

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
what? A couple years from

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
its release? It's been longer than you think.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I think 3DS has been out like what?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
5 years now I want to say?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
No. 4. Maybe 4.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
2010, 2011 I think.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Maybe 2010. About 4 years.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
So. It was after

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
well because I bought my 3DS after I was

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
living at the house so it would have been

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
2009 or

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
after 2009 so it would have been 2010 or

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
later. Yeah.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
But yeah. I mean

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
technology is a rapidly

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
evolving industry. I mean look at a lot of

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
phones. Like you know a lot of people talk

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
about like the Apple like the iOS

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
doesn't run on you know certain older

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
phones and the same thing happens on Android

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
you can't run the new

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Kit Kat or whatever they call them. Little candy bar

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
platforms on certain older Android

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
devices like they just they have to be refreshed every few years.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I'm really looking forward to the

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
3DX XL that's coming out

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
on October 10th that's the old school

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
NES controller. I

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
have mixed feelings on that because I so

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
like what bogs me about is that they didn't

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
change the inside at all like they did with the

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
advanced SP that looked like the NES

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
so the outside just kind of looks like

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
somebody put a sticker on it you know. That's

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
the only but I love my retro

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
NES too don't get me wrong but it's just

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
I wish they'd done a little more with it.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
The only thing else that just kind of applies to is that the box

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
that comes with it looks like the regular NES

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
that's about all they just kind of add it to that

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
so you have the controller which is the actual

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
console itself and the box that's the

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
NES. That's kind of cool. That part's cool.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Alright well

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
we're going to move on with some news

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
but by all means guys chime in as you

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
hear things in the news you want to comment on so

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
let's move on with some more news. Loki.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Sorry I was checking my progress

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
on Clicker Heroes because I haven't played

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
it in a week. I saw at least two

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
people on Twitter like say

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
God damn it Loki why did you have to bring up that game?

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
So I have was it uh

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
yeah I can't even

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I don't even know where was it

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
2.56

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
tillion it's earned

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
in gold. You made that word up.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Let's go. There's a key

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
on the side because like I'm like I don't

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
even know so yeah whatever.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Okay so

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
this is kind of related

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
to what we were just talking about with Star Wars. Yeah I know

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
we went kind of on the Smash Brothers route

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
there but apparently

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Disney has pulled a few

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Star Wars games off of the

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
iOS and Google Play stores

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
and Windows Store can't forget Windows.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Yeah you can.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Yeah that's like

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I was talking about my phone sucking the other day

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
and my wife's like well she's like well I have

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
a new phone. I'm like you have a Windows

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
phone. It doesn't do

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
anything. Okay like have you used your

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
phone to use Facebook. No it makes

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
calls. I'm like yeah

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
that's about all this. Alright so

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
anyways so Star Wars assault team

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
has been

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
removed. It was a free to play game and

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
was it

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I guess they're focusing now on

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Star Wars Commander but the one I was

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
kind of disappointed with is Nimblebits

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Tiny Death Star was removed

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and the best part about it is they didn't even fucking

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
tell Nimblebit oh hey we removed your game.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
That was

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
nice. That's

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
that's so crazy. I actually

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
have Tiny Death Star. I downloaded

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
that because you know Tiny Tower was kind of cool.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Um you know I got a little

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I kind of was over it after

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
a couple days of play but for a free

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
game you know it entertained me for a while but I'm very

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
surprised especially with such a tie in

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
like that with Tiny Tower they got rid of it. Why would you

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
remove that? They want to focus

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
on this Star Wars

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Commander what the new one is called.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
That's the one they want to focus on. But it's not even the same

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
type of game. I know it's weird isn't it?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Like you know

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
casual like you know moms and stuff

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
are probably not going to play Star Wars Commander

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I mean well well I don't know because

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Star Wars Commander apparently is doing insanely well.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Like and a lot of good feedback

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
on the game you know and so forth so I

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Is it like you know Smurf Village or

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I haven't played it myself so I can't really

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
comment on it but I've just I see a lot about it on

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Facebook so anyways

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
um yeah so they basically

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
basically said hey we're very disappointed to see Tiny

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Earth Star shuttered in less than a year after

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
launch. We had no prior knowledge

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
that the game was going to be removed

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
and no longer even have

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
a contract with Disney after recent layoffs.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Suffice to say

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I guess if you're looking to partner

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
with Disney this might not be the

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
partnership you're looking for. Wow

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
shady shade. So

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
uh well you know what. Well

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
earned advice. Well uh

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
no Tiny Disneyland coming to your phones

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
anytime soon I'm sure. Dude see that would have been awesome.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Right. That would have been awesome.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
That would have been so awesome. Maybe like um

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I don't know

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Jurassic Park's coming out pretty soon you know

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Tiny Jurassic Park

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I don't know. Tiny

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Velociraptor

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It's like you bred Tiny Raptors

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Oh my god

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Tiny Dinos

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
that would be funny

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Dungeon Buster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
says I should check on my Tiny Death

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Star and see how it's doing. Well someone

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
might have blown it up apparently and that might have

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
been Disney. Just flew an

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
X-Winger. Just blew the damn thing up.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Alright anyhow

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
uh moving on. A follow

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
up to something we were talking about in a previous

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
week. The Wii U is going to be

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
getting a Minecraft clone

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
or two and the

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
developer yeah the developer behind the

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Minecraft clone on the Wii U which is apparently

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
called Ucraft is

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Nexus Games

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
that is. You guys laughing over there at that name?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Yeah yeah

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
What's that Jonas?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
That company sounds familiar. Nexus

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
No no not that Nexus Games

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Nexus with an I

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Nexus with an I Games

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
No not the good Nexus Games

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Hold on. Hold on. Jonas may be a fan of

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Brick Blast U which is on

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
the Nintendo eShop

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Ok wrong game. That's fine. Wrong company

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
But they are working on

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Ucraft for the Wii U

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and uh yeah

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
saying it could arrive for the Nintendo eShop

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
before Christmas. Don't

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
have that set in stone however

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
so uh that is in development

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
however that's not the only

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
one being made.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Stone Shire is also in

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
development by the two man

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
team over at Finger Gun Games

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
which if you think about it though I mean

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
you know one guy kind of made the original Minecraft

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
so two people making a clone

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I guess would make sense. Uh

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
so there it is. Apparently this game will have dwarves

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
elves, hobbits and goblins roaming

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
the land. So just because we call it a Minecraft

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
clone doesn't mean it is actually like a clone

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
it might have its own stuff and this

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
sounds like it may have some extra kind of

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
stuff in it so you know

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
don't write off these games just because we're calling

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
the Minecraft clones. They might end up

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
being actually kind of cool but we won't really

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
know until we see more about them. Well we can call it

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Minecraft-like like we do roguelikes

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Sure I like that. Minecraft-like

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Craft-like. Craft-like.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Now it sounds like we're talking about cheese

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
like they're craft singles or anyways.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
It's not real cheese. That's like cheese

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
food. That's what cheese eats.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Let me put it this way okay

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and I not to throw shade

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
because you know indie developers

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
and stuff but if you

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
look at the other games that this guy

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
that Nexus has made that like that game

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
that's on there it looks really

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
uh

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
low production quality. I mean

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
don't get me wrong I understand it's a unity game

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and stuff but it looks like

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
they like kicked that out in maybe a

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
week like spent no time on it

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and seeing how many tutorials

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
there are out there that make voxel

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
like games. Hell I'm making a voxel like

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
game but it's not necessarily going to be a

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
voxel game just

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I use it to build my models because I can't fucking

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I can't 3D model for

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
shit but I can build with Legos

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
so hey let's do that.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
So uh

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
it's pretty easy to

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
you know to build one of these things and there's a lot

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
of tutorials out there so all you would have to do is

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
build something for the Wii U get a

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
dev kit and port it over. Unity does

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
the porting for you.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
All you really got to do is sign up for Nintendo

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
and get fucking dev kit to test it on that's it

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
and just looking at this

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I mean

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
it's got well the the other one had

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
the default you know standard

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
asset you know skybox

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
and default

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
shaders it really looks like it was

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
thrown together in a few days

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
so

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
but hey you know what though um

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
there will be better games out there I mean

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
look at the xbox indie games there was

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
how many minecraft clones a

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
ton of fucking minecraft clones and you know what

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
it's not a bad idea to do that

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
because they made a ton of money

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
they weren't great but people want to play

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
minecraft so badly if that's their only

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
option they're going to fucking buy it

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
so they're going to make tons of money

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
even if it's absolute shit

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
well let's hope it's not though I hope

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I hope it's good turn out pretty decent

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
we'll kind of want to make a minecraft clone

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
but not right now uh act

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
deaf in chat says the trailer for you

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
craft is hilariously awful the game

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
looks okay but oh god the trailer

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
they have a trailer apparently and

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
kaijuto and chat says survival craft

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
on the tablet is awesome so you know

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
there's some clones that people people dig

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I mean uh the one I was

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
playing you see what I did there dig because it's

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
minecraft I think it was a

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
castle maker her

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
and that was like a buck on indie games and it was

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
it was fun it was a minecraft game with

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
guns I mean the graphics weren't great but it

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
was just kind of something to mess around

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
with cool guns

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
all right uh one more story and then

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
we'll get to some release dates star sakura

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
well you know I never remembered if

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
it was west one

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
or west stone I always thought was

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
west one but the

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
company that created wonder boy is filing for bankruptcy

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
uh after 30

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
years of being in business

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
since 1986

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
which is hard to think of the 80s as being

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
30 years ago um

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
but basically they have

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
uh filed for

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
bankruptcy um they actually uh

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
the the wonder boy series

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
was actually adapted

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
into uh the nes

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
adventure island so

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
if you don't remember too much about

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
and don't forget about you know

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
wonder boy in monster world um

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
you could actually play in the sega vintage

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
collection monster world so

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
it's a sad day

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
we're sorry to see them go

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I I actually used to love

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
adventure island when I was younger

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and like I was actually good at those type of games

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
and uh I'll give a shout out to my pal

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
uh jeremy over at uh the koopa

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
club podcast was doing some uh

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
youtubes and and uh livestreams

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
of adventure island he was talking about

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
that wonder boy connection I was like oh yeah

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
that's right the games were related and I never like you don't

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
really realize that as a kid but like

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
it's kind of cool to hear those connections now

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
but very sad to hear about um

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
them shutting down I think I've covered two of the wonder

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
boy games for a classic game you probably

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
have but that would imply that I have

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
some type of memory or you know

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
the sequels were on the master system

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
sega genesis turbo graphics 16

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
or as it was in japan the pc engine

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
uh there was uh in japan

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
only there was a monster world complete collection

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
of the ps2 and then like

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I said there was a sega vintage collection monster world

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
uh dark tetsuya

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
man I loved wonder boy 3 the dragons

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
trap or dragons curse on pc

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
engine turbo graphics so yeah I'm legit

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000

there's always what virtual console

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000

uh wonder boy 3 had come out for those

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
so alright

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000

to go along with that they've got that with its

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I don't know if you'd call it free version

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
but the playstation plus version

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
has some of the tracks uh

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
nbh the bear the starter

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
edition let's say cause like a starter

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
in a car the starter edition

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
possibly you could do piecemeal

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
edition because they're gonna have like you know

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
where you can buy content

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
for it and then or if you want

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
buy the full game um so they've got that coming

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
out this week and then also um

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
alien isolation on playstation 4

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
xbox 360 playstation

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
3 and xbox one uh

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
tenkai knights brave battle

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
uh nba 2k15

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
360 playstation 4 xbox

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
one and pc

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
uh oh and also I guess uh

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
alien isolation was also on pc

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
um the disc version

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I'm not sure if this is the only way

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
you can get this cause I thought this was free to play

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
but project spark on xbox one

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
is coming out um

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I guess that's a disc

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
version of the game although I thought it was free

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
to play so I thought so too

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I don't know maybe it's extra content or something

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
uh minecraft playstation 4

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
editions getting its disc based version

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
coming out this week

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
uh they're doing a

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
re-release of dead rising 3

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
the apocalypse edition on xbox one

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and also the rise son of rome legendary

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
edition on xbox one sorry to butt in

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
but with minecraft releasing on playstation 4

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
you have microsoft releasing a game

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
on ps4 so hey hey

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
bayonetta fans anything's possible never lose hope

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
well technically that was already in the works

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
so yeah

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
uh let's see

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
and uh finally

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
forza motorsports 5

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
racing or is it the

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
game of the year edition on xbox one

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
so a lot of re-releases there

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and that would be it

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I thought there was more games this week but I guess that's it

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
well let's travel over to japan and check out

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
what's coming out there on the playstation 4

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
drive club releases for them as well

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
and fifa 15 this week in japan as well

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
also that white playstation 4

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
makes its way to japan this week all on

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000

and the project spark starter

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
pack so maybe I'm

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
thinking it's like what you said

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
like a disc version with maybe some

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
uh things included with it that you

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
would buy otherwise uh over on

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
the playstation 3 this week in japan also

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
fifa 15 can you tell that it's gonna

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
be out for everything and uh

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
some major price reductions on the tales

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
of series so you want

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
graces f or vesperia or

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
even zilia 2 which has been out in japan

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
a little longer than it has been here those are all

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
going into playstation 3 the best

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
series so uh

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000

i have no idea what game this is this

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
looks like it's based off a manga

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
maybe

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
is that a vile plume or a radish

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
i guess it's a radish chew

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
and they all do cute

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000

pikmin thing in a blender

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
well there you go

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
somehow i don't think that's a game that's coming over here

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
but if it does delicious

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
of living things

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
so on the 7th of october we have alien

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
isolation on everything

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
just about on the 8th

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
we have drive club on ps4

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000

undressed and nba

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
2k15

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
undead and undressed

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
undead and undressed in order to find the

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
witches and i think it's witches or

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
vampires you have to fight them and

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
undress them so that they're it's vampires

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
that's right because they have to expose their

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
their body parts to the sun in order

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
to um stop the vampires

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
ps3 and ps vita

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
brilliant brilliant it came out already

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
over here at the beginning of august

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
oh my god that's awesome

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
we also have project spark

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
which i misread as project spank

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
hahaha

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
that'd be a better game uh rise son

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
of rome on pc and

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
skylanders trap team on a bunch of

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
stuff sleeping dogs

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
definitive edition on ps4x

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
bone and pc

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
so with project spark you know

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
i don't know if it's officially out already

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
or if it's coming out this um

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
tuesday

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
time to penis what do you think

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
you know how long before we get

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
like how long to unlock all the

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
the stuff needed to well

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
i'm telling you there's a very good

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
chance that the time to penis is actually going to be very short

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
being that conquer is in the game

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
so this is going to be a very short one

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
do you guys know uh from from the uh big anime game room

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
do you know about our time to penis estimations

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
i don't know if you know this but any game that

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
allows you any type of creativity

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
we always ask the question how

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
long till somebody puts a penis in it

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
so that's probably around the time

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
when picto chat came out and people were drawing

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
penises all over the place

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
literally they should have just called it penis chat

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
right it wasn't a

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
well obviously it was just part of the system

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
but it wasn't a game but yeah that was just being thrown

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
all over the place especially going to conventions

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
people were just passing around pictures

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
and sending them to each other that looked like penises

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
the closest uh private part

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
yeah or you know they they had that game

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
ping pals it was just ping pals

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
that's all it was you know

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
do you ever remember reading vg cats

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
yes i've heard of them

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
and they had the optimus prime versus megatron

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
picto chat that was pretty funny

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
did they show penis yes

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
i think i don't remember but it was

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
basically them just going back

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
that's what picto chat was for

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
at least you know picked it or was it uh

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
was it ping pals

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
it's better than like tinder pals or something like that

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
tinder pals

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
just a bunch of like little picto chat penises

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
come up on the screen swipe left

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
swipe left ooh swipe right

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
a lot of other common things

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
i saw with like a bell spout and they tried to put the

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
penis in the mouth it was pretty bad

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
i don't know what they were

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
doing with pokemon at the time that's what they're doing

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
that's what they're doing in smash brothers

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
picture mode right now is like you know

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
let's see how many sexual positions we can put these characters

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
in anyway

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
a couple more gaming stories for you

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
guys than the classic game of the week

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
back to a simpler time in gaming before

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
you all filthied it up with your

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
dicks alright hey hey hey

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
we had custers revenge

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
that's true alright

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
uh loki alright

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
um so this is a little

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
disappointing but unfortunately there has been

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
some layoffs at rovio

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
they're cutting 130 jobs

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
to as they put

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
um simplify the company

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
they went towards a simplified

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
organization as they say it's never

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
easy to consider changes like this

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
but it's better to do them um

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
sooner rather than later

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
when we're in a good place to

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
reignite growth so

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
in other words they're not making as much money as they

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
used to they need to cut jobs in order to

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
be able to stay

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
i guess in the black

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
i'm thinking maybe like

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
angry birds just probably maybe got

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
like too big i don't know if that makes

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
sense but like you know

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
uh they have all these spin

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
off games and angry birds is on like

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
like all these different platforms and maybe

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
maybe it just became too diluted

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
like because when they talk about the whole like

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
trying to

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
bring it dark

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
sakura stop showing pictures of picto chat one time

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
time i mean they have angry

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
birds transformers they have

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
you know sorry after the conversation

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
she just had it's a funny image in my mind

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
i think wait if it

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
we're talking about rovia here right yeah

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
isn't this the same kind of um

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
effect that happened with zinga

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
where they got so big for a short

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
time then tanked like

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
because

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
new trends come out and they haven't

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
maintained their trends the big

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
difference here though is that i understand

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
why people like angry birds i never

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
understood why people like farmville that's

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
that's the big difference here to me people

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
like angry birds because scorched earth isn't on

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
fucking foam that's why they like angry

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
birds and because

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
gorillas was awesome but you know

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
uh angry birds is a fun game i

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
don't knock it it's a fun game it's a fun

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
time waster but

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
it's just i don't know

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
uh there's only

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
so much of it you can take before it gets kind of boring

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
i guess um you know eventually

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
people are gonna get tired of it and

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
it's maybe just not you know

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
rebranding it or something it's not really

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
doing anything that's

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
like saying offering different skins in

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
minecraft sells more copies of the game

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
maybe it does but i don't think

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
it's gonna make a huge difference i think that's a tough

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
thing for a lot of these mobile developers is

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
that you know you gotta have

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
i think more than one big franchise

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
to really you know

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
get out there you know and i know right now a lot

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
of the focus is on king and candy crush

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
saga but you know what that bubble that

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
bubble's gonna burst someday too maybe not today

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
but you know i think that's

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
that's a huge problem with the mobile market too

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
because at first oh angry birds is one of the

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
one of the first few games out there

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
but now that everybody's doing it

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
yeah i mean no one expected

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
flappy bird of all things to pop out

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
it just popped out at random and people are starting to play

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
the hell out of it that's true sometimes

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
the the fans especially on mobile

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
can be very fickle you know it's

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
it's almost like going viral on youtube like

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
you can't like you know these people all sit in

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
a boardroom we have to do something

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
that will go viral and it's like

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
that's very hard to do

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
like if you don't like put betty white in

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
it or something that's not gonna happen

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
just because you want it to like that has

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
to happen organically yeah because i mean

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
i understand that um like these

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
companies it is the cheapest way to

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
develop games like out there

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
it saves money rather you know how like people

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
develop games for like xbox one ps4

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and wii u and all that other consoles

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
and stuff or even pcs where

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
the production might be more expensive

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
for this one but the the problem

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
with i think the mobile market at the moment

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
like with especially with angry birds is

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
that there's too much like way

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
way too much in the market that

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
people have to decide which one's gonna be

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
the best one and it's

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
hard to get noticed like you know when flappy

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
bird was the big thing and you looked

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
at like the top 100 games like 20 of

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
them were flappy burglar like you had flappy

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
miley for fuck's sake like

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
hoop who downloaded flappy

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
miley who are you come out

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
here so i can smack you

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
who did that did

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
you do it i see you you're looking away

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
from me right now you know you do

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
flappy miley

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
no i will twerk you to death wait

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
that sounds really bad actually i maybe i won't

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
wait

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
i'll probably draw another penis on

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
peto chat

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
all right uh

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
one more story for you guys and uh

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
this is um not really good

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
news for nintendo one of their uh

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
big titles possibly being delayed

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
don't we don't have anything official

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
yet but uh

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
and breathe out it's not smash brothers

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
i'm talking about this time but it's

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
captain toad treasure tracker

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
oh and nobody is sad

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
sorry i think some

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
people are a little bit sad but

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
i don't know uh please

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
gamefly of all people which

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
you know rents the games and so forth

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
they changed their captain toad

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
treasure tracker release date from

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
2014 to march 2015

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
uh it should

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
be noted that gamefly has a pretty

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
good record of being correct about

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
these sorts of delays uh in

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
the past no they don't oh look at you

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
listen i came from the distribution

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
industry since i'm not fucking working there

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
anymore i love this now now you're gonna become unhinged

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
now you officially don't work there now it's

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
oh man loki's gonna give it all

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
here's the thing

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
here's what it comes down to nintendo

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
probably they they announced stuff by

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
quarter and so they've already

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
announced their ship for fourth quarter

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
it's not on there so they're probably assuming

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
hey we haven't heard anything about this yet we're

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
just gonna move it out of the year that's what i used to do

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
it's like i have a bunch of shit that'd be on the

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
the 31st of december it's all

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
that to be announced fucking dates stuff

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
guess where guess where uh

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
captain toad treasure tracker was yeah

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
i was right there so

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
i just moved the shit you know

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
to clear up my calendar or whatever

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
i'm like because i want my release dates to be nice and clean

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
so if i don't want all this tba shit at the end of

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
the year so i just fucking move it to

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
the next quarter so that's

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
probably what i would do yeah

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
they move shit on hunch

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
a lot of the times they don't move stuff just because

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
you know nintendo

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
told them unless it was an actual

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
release date in march or something

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
and i can see them moving it because

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
it's not that essential of a title it can be

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
put out anytime it's not like

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
oh my god a moment buy a system for treasure

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
no no one's fucking buying a system for that

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
i can also see where nintendo

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
may have a situation where it's like

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
every fucking person in

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
development is fucking making

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
smash happening on the wii u

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
by the holiday we don't give a fuck

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
what has to be pushed back smash is

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
coming out this holiday season i mean you literally

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
could have a situation like that going on right now

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
yeah so i'm just i

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
i think that it's just tba i mean

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
what date did they move into march that's what i

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
want to know no uh it doesn't say

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
okay well then

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
fucking look this up

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
yes because that game

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
it doesn't surprise why they didn't make it as a dlc

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
like add-on to like super mario

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
3d world well i think people

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
are assuming that all it's going

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
to be is what you saw in 3d world

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
and you know one thing nintendo

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
games are pretty decent at i mean especially

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
looking at again like smash brothers they

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
have depth to them so i think there'll be

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
more to expect in this game than

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
just what you saw like that's the

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
start that's the first world and then you'll have

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
these more power-ups maybe you'll have co-op

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
you know there'll be more to it we just haven't

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
really seen what all that looks like i mean i'm not

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
saying anything about nintendo like how they do things

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
because i know they started changing their policies with

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
like let's let's

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
perfect example super luigi u

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
which technically everyone thinks it's a different

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
game but it's a

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
specialized add-on where they added

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
more like an actual package it's just

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
really good dlc

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
yeah so or even mario kart

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
mario kart 8

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
where they have the two

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
two packs and it's so weird

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
to see mario kart with dlc

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
but at the same time it's kinda it's awesome at the

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
same time you know usually i don't get excited

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
about dlc but it seems like nintendo really

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
knows how to do it right that's just my question

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
with the whole totes um that toad game

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
well because if they don't release it as a separate

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
game then they can't do dlc for the toad game

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
it's

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
well hey i mean they haven't they still haven't

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
announced the release date for smash brothers

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
they haven't although

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
i would think all these signs

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
pointing to november 21st would be right but

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
i would think so too but

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
at the same time that 31st

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
march date is a fucking placeholder

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
date nintendo never releases

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
a title on tuesday it's always a fucking

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
friday or something oh so you went over to gamefly

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
and it shows 31st of march it's the 31st

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
yeah so there's that's placeholder

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
that yeah that's what i would do

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
is just move it out of the month look at that

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
loki calling the news out

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
is bull live on air look at that

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
it's a good good thought alright

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
well let's let's move to a simpler

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
time when you know i don't know about you guys

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
but like back in back in the day

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
like

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
you didn't really know when games were coming out

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
they just they would come in the magazine and it would

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
say october and you'd be like when in

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
october and it would just soon soon

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
it'll be on the shelf when it's damn

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
good and ready it's the and you'll like it

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
that's right and you'll spend 60 bucks

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
on the cartridge alright yeah here it is

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
your classic game of the week where dark soccer

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
is gonna open up the vault and find a game

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
that she thinks hey you should be

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
playing this game right now or in this case

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
she might be uh

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
going to her arcade collection

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
and uh

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
finding yet another capcom classic for you guys

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
well i'm still trying to stick with

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
the cps2 theme how long is

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
this theme gonna go well i said i was

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
gonna do it for a month and i started

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
it in november so i'm finishing

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
i'm gonna finish up the cps2 with this one

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
but i think i might do cps3 next in november

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
i was like it's been a whole year what the

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
fuck over i started it in september

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
alright i'll stop bugging you what is the classic

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
game of the week mega man the power battle

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
also known as rockman the power battle

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
and it was

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
a uh basically an arcade game

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
it was a spin off for the rockman series

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
it came out in japan in 1995

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
and had a sequel called mega

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
man 2 the power fighters

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
uh the next year um

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
the games reported to uh

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
consoles in north america in 2004 as part of

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
the mega man anniversary collection

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
came out on ps2 uh gamecube

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and xbox

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
and um was also part of the same

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
compilation in japan as rockman power

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
battle fighters for ps2

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
there was also an adaptation of both

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
games for neo geo pocket caller called

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
rockman battle and fighters

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
which was pretty pretty funny

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
neo geo pocket caller game

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
um so basically uh dr wily

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
rebuilt the robot masters and

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
he wants to take over the world so basically

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
it's a fighting game with

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
uh you can play as

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
as uh

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
mega man or rockman uh

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
proto man or base why would he

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
rebuild them why wouldn't he just build better

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
ones he got a point there

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
his

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
eyebrows way too much

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
um it's it's weighing down his brain

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
so anyway um basically

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
it's just like playing any

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
mega man game you have your jump you have your shoot

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
um you can hold it down

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
for stronger blast you can hold it down while

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
jumping makes you dash uh

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
so you have those different mechanics in there

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
um and as far as the stories that you do

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
each one has a different

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
uh series of stories

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
for what for uh depending on who they

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
fight so you've got

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
um as

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
stories for mega man one through two three through six

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
and mega man seven

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
um the level is

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
you don't really do like a whole level

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
you just have like

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
some part of the level and then

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
you fight your bad guys

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
and you actually have to go through um

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
uh sort of a rock paper

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
scissors kind of decision

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
method for choosing the weapon

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
i really like the redesign for uh

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
with man in this one by the way

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
it actually had a

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
soundtrack released on december 1st 1995

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
that was uh

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
actually had some arranged

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
uh pieces from other mega man games

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
by uh Yamamoto

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Setsuo and um Okugawa

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Hideki and they were performed by

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
so uh pretty cool stuff

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
um

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
as far as uh

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
the reception of it

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
gave it a pretty

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
decent rating

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
and uh basically

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
got a 22 out of 40

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
which is decent for

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
so there you go

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
rock man the power battle

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
very cool and uh

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
it was always awesome

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
also a good choice this week as we have mega man

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
fighting game right now it's nice to kind of go back

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
and revisit mega man's brawling

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
roots yes

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
the only thing i didn't like about this game is that like

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
mega man 7 or whatever got like its own

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
dedicated thing but like 1 and 2

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
should have had dedicated and 3 should have had dedicated

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
i don't know maybe it's just me but i thought the

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
robot masters in the earlier games were a little more memorable

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
i just liked playing base

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
yeah it was all about playing base in this one

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
for me cause base was just

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
bad ass alright there it is classic game

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
of the week mega man or rock man

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
the power battle again

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
another one of capcom's

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
arcade games

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
at this point we are about to

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
head over to our interview we did with

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
farsight studios all about

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
the pinball arcade however

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
since we are at about the halfway point of the show

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
dark soccer is actually going to be bidding us adieu a little

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
early tonight cause my ass has to be up at 5 in the

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
morning yes so uh you know real life

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
obligations come first so dark soccer

i am doing great thank you so much for taking

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
the time out to be on the show tonight

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
um so for those that might not

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
be familiar with the pinball arcade

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
i mean i know it's on just about every platform that's

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
out there but if for some reason somebody doesn't know what it is

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
tell us a little bit about the pinball arcade

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
sure the pinball arcade

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
came out um a couple years ago

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
we actually launched in february of 2012

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
and it's our goal to

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
recreate all of the greatest pinball machines

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
ever the real machines so we have

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
licenses from williams and batley and

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
and gottlieb and the start license

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
includes that how data east and

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
sega um

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
so basically we have the rights to recreate

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
pretty much every table there is

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
however those are just the pinball rights

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
and what we are looking

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
for in the adams family kickstarter

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
uh the ant employer rights to

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
the movie the adams family

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
um the adams family foundation

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
rights for the the characters

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
and then the uh specific actors

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
so um yeah

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
so it's now our goal to recreate

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
these pinball tables so that

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
pinball players from a whole new

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
generation get to play them

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
well let's since you brought up the adams family kickstarter

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
and i know that's the big big focus right now

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
and there's about a week left to go on the kickstarter

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
when people are going to be hearing this

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
um what exactly are you raising

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
that money for on the kickstarter

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
yeah so those

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
that money is specifically for all those licenses

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
i just mentioned they're for the

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
the rights for the movie

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
for the adams family and

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
for the actors to get their likeness

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
clearances um why is this

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
table so important

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
um the adams family was the best

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
selling pinball table of all time

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
uh it's it's over

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
20,000 like real machines were made

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
it's a really popular table it's really

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
it's a great table it's a fun table it's a pat lawler

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
classic um

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
it's just um a

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
table that any collection

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
is going to be the best of uh

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
pinball of all time really needs the adams family

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
so we've been pushing really hard to get these licenses

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
i seem to remember there was like

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
a limited edition gold version

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
or something of the adams family table as well

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
is that all a part of this or just

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
we're trying to just get the original classic table

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
yeah the pinball

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
of the adams family pinball

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
machine did so well they came up with a limited

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
edition um

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
um there's a special ROM

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
so some special rules were created

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
and there's gold trim around them

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
uh in the real world

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
so we have the rights to

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
recreate both so anyone who

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
kick starts contributes

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
um $100 or more will be

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
a member of the gold club and be a gold

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
backer and they'll get to

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
play the gold edition in addition to the

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
regular one oh very cool

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
um do you have a particular favorite feature

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
of the adams family table?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
um geez i like

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
the mamushka i like

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
how simple it is to understand that you're clearing

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
out the rooms uh i like

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
the flipper that's automatically you know

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
working for you but the hand's really cool

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
the thing

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
um it was one of

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
the first tables to have a DMD working

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
so it's

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
it's a really great presentation table

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
it's just a lot of fun to play i just remember

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
um really being drawn to it you know

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
because this has probably been when the movie was out

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
i was probably in about junior high or something when the movie

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
came out and i just remembered like it tied in so well

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
to the movie like i think a lot of other

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
tables sometimes you can kind of

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
like especially in gaming and video games in

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
general you really feel like the movie or the game

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
that goes with the add-on is such like a loose

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
like a loose tie-in but this really felt

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
like an extension of the movie to me

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
right that's actually one of the reasons why we needed

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
the paramount license because not only

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
was it used in the adams family characters

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
but they took actual script from the movie

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
um they took story from the movie

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
and built that into the pinball table machine

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
design uh so it's one of the

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
reasons why we had to get that license gotcha

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
now i don't know if this is true or not but there were

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
rumors circulating out there that

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
the estate of rao julia was

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
part of the holdout that the likeness

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
was uh not wanting

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
to be used has this all been resolved

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
will we see rao julia in the game

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
if if kickstarter yeah

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
we have the likeness clearance and that's one of the

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
the funds that we're trying to raise

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
um so his widow was very

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
um willing to work with us and

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
we're very appreciative that we're able to use

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
his likeness and i don't know

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
if you know but his voice is used a lot

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
in the table oh yeah the uh

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
wms has a special audio recording with

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
rao julia just for the pinball machine

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
so it's

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
it's a little over 100 wave files just

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
his voice wow which is far

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
more than any other character yeah you can't really

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
talk about the mamushka without really hearing it in

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
his voice the mamushka you know he's

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
this very grandiose way of delivering

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
lines right um

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
now going going to the the

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
pinball uh arcade collection

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
in general um you know i

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
i remember playing the

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
i think you guys had a early version of this game

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
on the we there wasn't there like a

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
a pinball collection of some sort

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
on the we as well right

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
yeah we started doing pinball um table

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
collections about 10 years ago and our

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
first franchise was called the pinball hall of fame

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
that's it yeah pinball hall of fame

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
uh and we had the gotley collection and

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
the williams collection and i think both of

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
those made it to the we eventually

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
i noticed you guys kind of

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
really make it a point to have your game on a

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
variety of systems i mean i could i could

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
list where the pinball arcade is playable

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
but it is literally everywhere from

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
the playstation 4 to the uia

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
and mobile phones many

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
developers focus on one console

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
plus steam or what have you

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
why do you guys go for such that variety

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
how how important is that for you

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
well it's always been far

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
sight bread and butter um you know

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
the pinball arcade is our first

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
published title that we've done ourselves publishing

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
wise um with digital distribution

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
as possible um but before

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
that we were basically being contracted by publishers

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
to make a game and one of the

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
key selling points we had as a developer

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
was that we could take a game and

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
develop it on as many platforms as they wanted

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
for very little incremental cost

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
uh so we've carried over

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
we have really good tools when it comes to cross platform

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
development and since

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
you know people want to play it on whatever device they have

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
let's we felt that why not do

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
it as long as there's a digital store

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
to sell it to them we've

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
created for them do you

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
find that people tend to prefer

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
like one over the other like

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
mobile versus couch play

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
on the playstation or do you

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
do you kind of find that

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
somebody who likes it one place might

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
want to have all the versions that they have a

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
something on the go and what have you

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
yeah the bulk of our users just pick one

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
um but we do have plenty of

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
users who like will pick one console

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
like one of the later consoles and our

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
xbox one version um should be coming

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
out here soon within a month or two

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
um but most people want

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
to have one mobile version and

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
one not most people but our most

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
hardcore fans will have one mobile version

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
either the android or the ios

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
and one home console

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
and home console might be pc

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
if you get to that home console of course

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
um seems like most of the fans play it

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
one one one device on the go

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
and one device at home gotcha

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
now um many pinball

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
games i've played in the past like and i'm talking

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
like pinball dreams on like

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
nineties computers to other games today

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
they're based off of new tables

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
but you guys have really made it your

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
thing to do pinball

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
classics have you guys ever wanted

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
to do an original table why do you

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
stick to classics

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
um well i can give you a whole

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
history um back when

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
we first started doing pinball machines the

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
publisher crave actually asked us to

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
create some original tables

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
but i was um at the studio

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
we had never done anything pinball related

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
and even though we had some fans of

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
pinball internally we weren't

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
comfortable designing original tables

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
so someone there at crave

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
um bob bryant had the idea

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
for us to license real tables

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
and we create them because he's

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
a huge fan of real pinball and wanted to play

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
some of the favorite tables which he

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
couldn't find anywhere right so that's really

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
how it started so

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
moving forward to today uh we

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
actually have i don't know how much i

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
can talk about this but we're

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
working currently on an original table

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
um and it should be

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
coming out really soon

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
um we're pretty excited about it

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
and moving forward we actually

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
have we're looking at some

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
other license deals um to

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
possibly uh include but these

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
tables that we're going to be making are going to be

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
powered with pinball arcade

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
um they're going to be a you know separate

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
you know standalone apps one at a time

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
might have a link to the pinball arcade

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
if you want to play some more pinball

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
some more real pinball um

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
but we're just starting to do it

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
and there's a lot of people here internally since we've been

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
making pinball for so long now

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
and we've seen so many different designs come

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
uh we've created

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
and simulated that we are

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
pretty excited here a lot of us

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
to start making our own tables

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
the first one that we're going to be doing is

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
a relatively

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
like a kind of like a stepping stone i guess

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
we're taking an existing

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
table and kind of modding it

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
um because we're trying to get it

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
out relatively fast

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
but moving forward we've got a lot of ideas

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
to do some more

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
original table design and

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
it seems like the

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
the feeling here internally in the studio

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
is to do

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
tables that could exist in real life as opposed

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
to the then approach which is

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
make video gamey um

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
pinball we're going to try to make tables

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
that actually could really exist

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
and make out our niche when it comes to original design

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
you know and there are

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
so few pinball machines

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
that are really released every year now

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
you know it's really you know ramped down in where we're at

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
now so i mean it does feel like a natural

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
progression that you know well these maybe these

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
are the tables that they would be making if

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
if you know there were uh

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
as many physical pinball tables these days

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
right right i mean

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
there's two manufacturers still working

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
um and maybe you know a couple more

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
you know trying to get off the ground

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
um but yeah zen's doing a pretty good

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
job of licensing some cool properties

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
and we hope to get in there too

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
uh well best of luck with you guys

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
uh in in that venture although i am

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
going to hold out hope personally i know this might be a

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
tricky one for you guys to get but that tron

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
pinball table they just released is so rad

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
i i really hope you

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
guys can work something out with that

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
yeah we have one really big fan

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
of it here generally so we're

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
we're working on that one it's a tough license

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
all right i'm joining the club make that two fans

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
all right uh now

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
i'm sure a lot of people out there that are

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
listening to this program they probably have downloaded

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
the the free trials of pinball arcade

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
that that come with uh

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
one table right and they they wonder

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
maybe i should go in and and buy

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
another table but there's so many to choose

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
from now i know this is a tough question

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
but is is there one table out there

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
in your collection that you think people

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
need to play and check out like because maybe

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
they don't have memories of it so you know

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
it's one thing to kind of go in there like oh i got to get

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
the star trek table because i'm a star trek fan but

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
is is there something people might be missing

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
like what is that one real

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
hidden gem that people really need to

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
check out in the collection

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
yeah someone's not a big fan of

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
real pinball they really should download the

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
table pack one which is medieval madness

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
and the pride of pinball because medieval

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
madness is such a fun table

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
so a lot of people's favorite table of all time

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
um inside it's not a huge license

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
you'll you know what's new to madness

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
you won't even have heard of it if you're not into pinball

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
right but it's it kind of has that money

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
python feel for the comedy

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
and it's really well designed

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
it's just a really fun table our co-host

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
our co-host dark soccer i believe

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
had one of those in her house for for a while

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
she had a bride of pinbot as well and that was

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
that machine's a ton i actually pinbot is

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
probably one of my i i will be honest

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
adam's family is actually my favorite table of all

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
time i have personally backed this kickstarter

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
and i i really thank you yeah

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
i really hope you guys get it uh but

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
my second favorite is probably pinbot

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
so you know i had to

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
play the original pinbot or the bride of pinbot

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
i prefer the original pinbot and part of

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
that is probably my memories of the nes

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
version as well which i know is like

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
kind of wacky different but

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
that was a little different but the physics

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
weren't exactly yeah yeah

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
as advanced as ours were they're 2d

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
but it was it was fun it was really

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
well done yeah when you're 10 years old you know

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
you're not thinking about that stuff as much so it's

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
you got a little more slack

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
um i have another question here from our facebook

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
community is the show where every gamer has

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
a voice and we invited you guys to ask some questions

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
and we had a derek over on our facebook community

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
ask you about some very specific

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
titles here so i don't even know if this is something you can

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
you can comment on but uh when will

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
raven hollywood heat and last

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
action hero be released are there

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
i and especially i look at last action hero

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
and i kind of go okay so there's there's obviously some

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
other big properties out there that people have

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
their eye on are there other properties

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
you guys are hoping to bring over that you have

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
your eye on that you might kick start next

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
um sure and actually i think

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
i've already mentioned that

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
um last action hero is

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
one that we do have our eye on

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
and we already have arnold's

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
likeness um for terminator 2

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
so that one is

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
very possible the other two are tables

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
i'm aware of um i can't say

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
that they're in any short term plans

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
but there are some good picks

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
alright well uh

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
thank you so much for joining us today bobby

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
i really appreciate it um before i let you

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
go though there's a question we always

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
ask the people who come on our show and that

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
is what types of video games have you

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
been playing this week and no fair naming

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
your own games i know you gotta do

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
a lot of plenty of those but what other video games

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
are you playing lately

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
um

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
that's kind of embarrassing

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
the only game i played this week is candy crush

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
keeping that game going

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
i'm just teasing

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
yeah i'm at the end of that game

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000

in the next

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
six days so it's looking

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
pretty good but uh you know if

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
you're hearing this you you know on

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
the podcast especially you may not have a lot of

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
time left to get in on that so check that out over at

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
kickstarter um some other comments in our chat

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
room uh bochikawa saying last action

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
hero that one i'd like to play again

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
so maybe that'll have to be their next one

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
we'll see um

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
ssga100matt saying at least

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
in some way pinball machines will continue

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
to exist the machines themselves

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
and the parts might die out but at

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
least they're archived this way

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
so yeah that that's a very

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
good way of looking at it and fifth dream

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
says uh sky donated himself that's

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
worth at least two tables yeah i

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
yes i did donate myself

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
uh and i i can't wait to

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
uh play it again it looks looking very favorable that

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
they'll make it now i just have to figure out which

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
platform i'll get it on but probably

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
playstation 4 because i have

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
uh at least one of the seasons that's where all my

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
elvira tables are on playstation 4

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
so good times um

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
commitments tomorrow but we are joined of course

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
uh by diego and jonas

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
from the uh big anime game room

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
are here so uh hope you guys

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
are doing well and diego is just making himself comfy

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
over there in dark soccer's throne

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
you like that spot?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
it's got padding and it's not

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
wood so yeah it's it's a lot more

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
comfy than the uh other chair over there and of course

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
loki's still here with us yeah

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
half partially because he's he's kind of

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
engrossed in clicker heroes

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
yeah there's no there's

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
literally no point to me playing

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
this right now and yet

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
i am yeah that's well i'm not really

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
playing it i'm just mainly saying levels

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
done next levels done next

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
that's me and diablo 3

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
i mean

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
i was just watching that game it

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
looked like just stuff was falling from the sky and landing on the

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
ground it's because my characters do so

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
much damage that it kills them instantly

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
there it is instant kill because i cheated

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
because i didn't want to play this game and i

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
thought hey if i cheated it would be

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
it would be over faster you oh my

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
god loki can't even play clicker

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
heroes the right way he's got to cheat in

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
that too i did play i hope you were

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
putting cheat codes into your game

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
or you know heaven help you when

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
everybody wants to hack and cheat in your

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
game that you're making

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
well be smarter to check for that stuff

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
yeah i bet i bet we'll see how that goes all right

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
uh hey i've gotten to the point now where

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
stuff isn't dying instantly so that's

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
that's good right before we get into

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
some rapid fire news i wanted to check in with

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
our friends over at the uh big anime game room

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
and see what what they might have going on right

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
now like uh you guys have any big

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
conventions or shows coming up you want to give a

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
plug to here on air for our california audience

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
well like we said before i think on the last

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
show when we were on here we talked about snafu

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
coming up on uh october i think

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
24 25th and 26th that's friday

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
saturday sunday that's in reno nevada

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
oh yeah we're looking forward to that but earlier

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
uh coming up this october the 10th we

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
uh i myself had started

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
up along with the group uh something called the

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
ex games series

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
uh it's something that we started a long time ago

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
it's our locals here in sacramento

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
and we really wanted to jump start that again

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
and we uh somebody uh

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
close by to uh where one of

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
one of our staffers lives including me

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
uh was a comic store that decided to

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
help us out with their venue and allow us

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
to jump start it right there and that was for

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
uh flash flashback comics

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
and collectibles nice yeah

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
it's over by uh pretty much in antelope

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
between antelope and north highlands

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
so that won't do like our british listeners

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
a lot of good probably to hear that but we do have some

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
local folks here in california

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
that might be able to stop by and check that out

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
yeah they're already getting the word and people are just

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
perking their ears up and saying what

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
antelope what's over

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
is that an animal?

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
deer caught in the headlights

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
sadly you do not find many antelope in

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
antelope that's right that's right but you can

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000

let's just let's start the round over again because there's a

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
one miss yeah right

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
back in the last decade thank you very much

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
anyway

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
speaking of

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
i think it was one of the times when i met you

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
jonas at paradise island days remember that

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
oh yeah when we when we

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
indirectly met each other and stuff

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
for a tournament that we actually hosted in sacramento

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
like after like it was a tournament

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
it was a tournament in 2005 called spit

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
sacramento paradise

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
island tournament oh it's awesome

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
right this is the i think this is the time where

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
they wanted me to run a tournament

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
so i was like cool i want to run a ddr tournament

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
for sacramento

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
smash brothers and ddr tournament in the same venue

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
and we kind of crossed streams me and him

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
not in that fashion but

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
we crossed streams

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
don't cross the streams

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
we kind of initially talked

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
we got reacquainted back in 2007 after that

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
can you believe it

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
though i mean speaking of like ddr and all that

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
tonight is episode 570

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
i can't

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
for that night to celebrate

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
knows ddr any old school

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
konami game ought to catch the reference so i'm very

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
excited about that

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
we'll let you know more details on that when we have everything

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
you know all our t's crossing our i's dotted

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
and all that good stuff so before we get into

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
rapid fire news anything else we should know about going on

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
speaking of

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
games for those

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
those who are going to pacific media expo

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
next month november

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
i think it's like november

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
i think it's 7th or 9th it's just a friday through sunday

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
they are actually hosting the united

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
states pump it up festival

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
the u.s championships

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
for pump it up

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
and that's that's still a big thing too

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
um u.s it's really hard to say if

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
it's still big but i know in countries

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
like mexico and south america that's still

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
really big people keep forgetting

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
that

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
from that that said that the country they still play

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
a lot maybe a few koreans and stuff but

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
because some koreans still play

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
because they still want to compete with um the

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
competition i heard i heard pump was like

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
still really huge in latin america so that's

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
okay that makes a lot of sense are they the ones that took it

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
away from korea um that was

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
years ago when when they had the rule of no

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
bar when they had the when

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
when they actually started allowing bar i think

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
that the competition started being a little bit

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
more even not i'm saying anything

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
bad about those who actually use the bar or not

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
but that's been that's yeah again let's

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
leave the drama from 10 years ago

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
but again that's what that was a shift

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
change of what statistics were showing

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
during who is the top players

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
but actually still mexico is still

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
on the top 10 in terms of not tournaments

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
but actual just um actually um

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
act out one of our mexican listeners

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
in chat saying yeah pump it up is still big here

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
so very cool so i think

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
the rankings are still top 10

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
for just regular players

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
for pump it up fiesta too

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
all right so yep there is

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
a united states championships coming

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
up up on and it's supposed to be three

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
times bigger than last year when they had

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
it at pmx um last year

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
for the first time at a convention

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
just again not not to

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
too much localize the show

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
be honest remains unknown

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
um because i'll

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
be honest i'm still pissed off about it because

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
we all are that

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000

it's a pretty diverse cast list so yeah

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
it's pretty awesome considering i don't know

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
them it looks neat

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
in the picture at least

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
i mean it looks like it's gonna be pretty high

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
but i i don't know i just can't see what

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
the plot's gonna be but you know what fuck i couldn't

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
imagine what a lego movie was gonna be like and that

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
ended up being pretty awesome so whatever

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
true it's all good but are we gonna see

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
like now anger birds the movie the game

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
i mean cause you know

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
is it gonna come full full circle again

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
why not street further movie

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
the game why not with the

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
fighting game so

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
i'd play that

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
i at least try it

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
once i mean cause it's something else

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
it sounds like it'd be pretty cool

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
uh this is kind of a neat little thing

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
that they're adding to the halo master chief

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
collection halo one and two

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
versions of the game and those

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
versions of the game also had exclusive

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
multiplayer maps well now those

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000

timberland death island

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
um i'm not even gonna try to

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
pronounce that it was jeff

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
hydro

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
jeff hydro phobia i don't know

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
um i have no idea

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
care uh danger canyon see why

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
ice fields and infinity from

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
halo the collector's edition

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
and halo 2 they've got

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
um they got district and uplift

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
um so that'd be pretty cool and also

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
some pc exclusive weapons

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
like i guess a flamethrower and they had a

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
fuel rod gun or it's supposed to be coming

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
um or you can filter

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
them out because they're allowing you to

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
do that kind of thing boy they're really trying to make this

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
like the definitive halo aren't

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
they that's pretty awesome i mean

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
cool and uh

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
hey you know what this was a pretty cool

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
game on uya although i didn't get it

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
at the time because i was playing like a very very

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
early version of it but one of the

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
best games i guess on uya and

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
it was at least one i had one

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
was amazing frog it was a game where

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
you just kind of hurt yourself as

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
a frog bouncing off different

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
things and stuff like that and it was only on uya but now

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
now it's going to be coming

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
to steam so you

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
can check it out and they've got all sorts of

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
fun stuff in there i guess it's actually

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
it reminds me a lot of goat simulator it

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
is like goat sim it is

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
and they're going to have you know different

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
um four player split

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
screen um and all sorts of different

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
other modes in there um

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
so you know what i

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
checked it out i'm going to have to

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
check it out when it comes out

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
alright well uh loki i think

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
this is another game that really sounds like it's up your alley

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
and it was something that was on kick

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
starter and it made its goal

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
and it's trinket games developing this

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
it's called battle chef brigade

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
just imagine like iron chef

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
or top chef like what are those like

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
iron chef the anime is pretty much

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
it's like one of those epic cooking games like this is

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
like hardcore cooking mama

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
this is like cooking mama could be an iron

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
chef in the same way like if you watch the trailer video

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
that's on their kickstarter page it even opens

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
like iron chef with the

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
chairman eating a pepper

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
that's awesome that's amazing oh actually

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
uh the kickstarter is still going

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
it already made it's 38,000 but the

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
kickstarter is still going and

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
is scheduled for release in 2016

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
for the pc mac and

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
linux yeah holy crap that's a long time

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
yeah they're at 54,000

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
uh right now of their 38,000 goal

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
with 21 days to go this did

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
very well it looks awesome

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
it's like yeah

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
one part like cookie mama and then you

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
have to hunt monsters and you get

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
like resources from those monsters

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
and uh it's

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
definitely unique

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
uh i love this their next stretch goal

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
at 56,000 which they'll make

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
is uh summons call forth

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
incredible beings with powerful

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
spells similar to final fantasy tactics

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
what this is a fucking cooking game and

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
you're gonna like summon shiva like

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
instead of sick sticking it in the freezer it's like

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
oh shiva get over here and snap i think

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
though if they want to be really kind of cool

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
with that they should like kind of

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
combine both like final fantasy

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
summons and like

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
you know peeps chefs from

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
iron chef in there like you know

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
not that i want to give the example of bobby flay

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
because i fucking hate bobby flay but

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
um you know just have like you know

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
bobby flay in there or like cat core

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
okay cat core and shiva you know together

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
or something like that they're like

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
materia it's like spices

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
recipes or something and and then like

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
it all's like you you don't summon fourth

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
you cook fourth and they get summoned and they do

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
something or i don't know like a

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
something crazy like that i need someone

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
to slice these carrots oh let me summon

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
there's a guy on there summon knights of the round

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
and then you'll afk in 30 minutes if you read

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
all the like different you know

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
um descriptions of the characters there's a

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
guy that's an undead zombie guy and he's able

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
to summon forth like

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
the undead and skeletons and stuff to

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
help him cook devil's food cake

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
it's pretty awesome i i don't know

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
it just sounds like a ridiculous

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
premise for a game but it

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
also would i could totally say this being

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
like an anime uh dart tatsumi in

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
chat says that reminds me of trauma center

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
the one on the wii where you could draw symbols

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
during the operation to do spells and shit

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
actually yeah kind of sounds like that

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
with cooking let's examine some of the

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
other stretch goals they've hit uh

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
jungle a new steamy overgrown

biome for you to hunt in oh

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
because i guess you have to hunt your food before you cook it

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
uh caverns where you catch bizarre

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
but that there will be familiar faces

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
uh and i can't reveal too

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
much but the character has covered wars

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
you know which might be a tease that frank

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
west is somehow in it he also

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
uh described the movie as

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
indiana jones with zombies

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
well now that's a i better see some

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
face melting if you're gonna use that comparison

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
there so we'll see what happens there

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
uh pretty much every person

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
i know has already emailed me saying they want

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
to be a zombie so i think we'll be fine

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
it's like shot in the dead with zombies

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
we're also planning a long one take

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
action shot with hundreds of zombies

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
which i'm very excited about online there's

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
no ratings board there's no run time

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
limit there are no rules

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
this is an experiment for legendary and they've been

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
very incredibly willing to take creative

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
risks now i know that they were against our

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
hardcore pornography

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
zombie scene but there's no rules

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
online this sounds like the type

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
of movie that i'm gonna show my mom and you know

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
i'm gonna say rob

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
that is gross that is a

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
gross movie um

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
i don't know if she'd think this is gross

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
because this seemed like it was more cartoon violence

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
in these games but uh too bad dark

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
soccer is still not here because i bet she'd be excited to know

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
that strider 2

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
that's right the uh arcade side

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
scroller strider 2 will be on the

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
playstation network uh coming out

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
i believe october 7th

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
is the big day that's available

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
uh this is the arcade game from

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
1999 and uh

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
yeah very cool this is uh the ps1

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
version of strider 2 also came

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
with 1989's

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
strider so that will be bundled then

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
with the download so you get strider 1 and

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
strider 2 originally on the playstation

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
1 did they release that

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
strider game that came out on the consoles

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
like the new one on pc

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
uh i believe

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
they did i believe it is on steam

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
i could be wrong i could be wrong

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
but uh you know what i want to

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000

who cares if his wife is his arm

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
it doesn't matter

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000

starting with our friend renee

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
who is from the podcast killer

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
a horror film podcast i guessed it on that one

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
since a while ago now uh

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000

physical table to play of all time the

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
the warlock table that game

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
had some of the best pinball physics that are just a

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
tad faster than zen's pinball physics

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
uh brad

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
our pal from pod culture

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000

doctor who i've only

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
been able to play it a small handful of times

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
man it was fun um

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
i hope that someone would bring it to one of the

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
pinball games for pc or console

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
my favorite digital table is probably

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
the star trek next generation one having two

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
of my favorite things pinball and star trek

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
combined is just

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
fantastic uh

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
febreeze a over on facebook

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
answers this question i played a fair

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
share of pinball tables but never had the

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
opportunity to spend enough time with them

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
my local had two well maintained

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
tables the adams family

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
and playboy i forgot

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
playboy had a table playboy

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
table is gone now but i play the adams

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
family every month it's the best

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
machine i've ever played it never bores me

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
on the digital side i like zen pinball the most

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
motley crew on mega drive was cool too

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
this answer reminded me we used to have an arcade

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
that had the guns and roses pinball table

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
that machine was the shit i wish that was

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
one that they could pour it over where the little

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
plunger was actually a big rose that you'd pull

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
that was awesome

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
and i played this wasn't that scandia

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
uh they they might have one

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
scandia but there used to be a little arcade in

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
roseville where i grew up and i think it was

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
supercade was what it was called and they had one

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
there and they actually had the playboy table there

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
too so i've actually played that game before i don't know why i was thinking

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
the birdcage but that could have been something else

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
it probably was back when birdcage had a

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
i wish they had more nickel arcades

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
the last nickel arcade

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
we had was in downtown

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
sacramento but that shut down like a year

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
2001

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
fyi wow that was a long

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
time ago alright moving over to emily c

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
different tables the actual table i love

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
is the adams family table i'm sensing a

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
theme here it was always very

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
entertaining and challenging to me today it would

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
suck the quarters out of my pockets as soon as i

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
enter the room with one digitally i

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
fell in love with pokemon pinball

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
that's a great answer and one i forgot about

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
the metroid pinball game

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000

that earlier thanks emily for reminding us of those

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
i play the pinball arcade almost every time i

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
no when they when they uh poured it over

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
i don't believe prop cycle will be involved

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
i don't remember

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
that i've never played that

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
where they have the prop cycle thing yeah

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
jamie knows i know they had that in california

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
extreme at one point yeah yeah that's probably where

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
she saw it yeah and i remember seeing

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
that in reno at the time like when i was like

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
it was like 15 years ago when i was playing

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
where they had some really good

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
pinball machines like um

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
i noticed they had a street fighter one which is pretty fun

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
oh yeah yeah it was a street fighter pinball

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
and yeah but i just forget the names

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
of it because all the people at first looked the same

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
but they're actually it's pretty fun just

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
forgetting the names of the problem sure sure as

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
i said earlier i i'm definitely a fan

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
of that pokemon pinball that

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
was definitely addicting for a while and

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
um at one point there was a back to the

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
future pinball uh yes there was yeah i

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
was kind of interested in that too that back to the future one

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
and uh

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
other than that i can't really recall anymore but

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
i remember some some different ones that

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
we did at like i mentioned the bird cage earlier

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
because my brother would always drag me out there and some

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
there was always like pinball machines all over the place because

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
he's twice my age and all that so

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
he'd always pull me aside and say

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
we're gonna have fun and play some real video games

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
and i'm glad i'm grateful for

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
him for doing that because otherwise i wouldn't have

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
you know touched all those fields right

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
right yeah but it was fun definitely it was very addicting

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
yeah definitely uh i see a lot of

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
uh comments in our chat room talking about sonic

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
spinball um another you know

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
pinball video game oh god

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
sonic spinball was so different though because like

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
you you could kind of move

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
sonic like if you weren't

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
doing right like you could like jump up

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
it's not real it's it's a combination

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
of yeah it's like a combo

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
it's like pinball quest or something

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
and then the faces

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
of that is kind of bs at some points

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
yeah it is remember metroid pinball

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
i do it was the

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
first game well it was yeah it came

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
with the rumble thing yeah good times

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
alright thank you guys for answering our

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
fugo question of the week we're gonna get back into

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
some other news loki

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
alright um so this is kind of

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
neat uh playstation well it's

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
not neat it kind of sucks actually uh

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
thankfully it's not

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
gonna be here uh but they're increasing the price

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
of playstation plus for certain regions

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
um not in north

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
america though but in south america ukraine

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
russia turkey and india

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
regions um they're increasing

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
the price because of various market

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
conditions and of course

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
they go on to reiterate again that this is

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
not happening in north america

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
um so

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
i don't know

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
it kind of sucks i guess for those

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
regions that it's going up in price

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
um i don't

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
know if you can buy cards elsewhere

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
in redeemum i don't think you can

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
so

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
um hmm

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
oh well

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
um i guess it is neat

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
that we're not gonna get a price increase here

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
at least yet yeah that would be something

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
they sneak in after the holiday or something

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
quote yet right

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
yeah and unfortunately it's already happened

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
uh on october

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
first um

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
so well that kind of sucks

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
oh my god if they do like a crazy black

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
friday deal again this year something like it remember

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
last year they had like an insanely good black

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
friday deal i don't know if they do black friday

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
stuff in other countries like that but you know

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
what um keep an eye out

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
uh i guess in other regions because

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
i'm sure that there's places

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
where you can buy cards like that

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
um they mark down the price

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
and maybe you can get one for your region that's

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
cheaper than what they're gonna

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
you know do for

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
it probably smart that they aren't

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
doing that for north america because i think people would pitch

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
a fit you know about it

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
um especially that or like japan or

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
something like that i think they would pitch a fit

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
um about those

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
prices going up and you know microsoft

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
i'm sure get on board and say hey

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
you know even though theirs is

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
more expensive but i

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
don't know it's still you don't want to raise

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
prices out of the fact all right well let's

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
hope they don't decide to do the same thing unless

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
you know they're throwing in

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
some features or something that makes

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
the games they give away are pretty darn good though

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
you gotta admit i mean playstation plus is

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
a really great here's what i would like is you know

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
maybe all those games that i

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
have in my library if i could

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
you know stream this that would be great

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
i would love that yeah we should

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
get that with like playstation plus or whatever

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
where the ps1 games we bought should be

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
streamable on ps4 when they get the

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
ps1 and ps2 stuff working but hopefully

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
that's sooner rather than later right or even like playstation

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
3 stuff i mean there's stuff i have in my

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
library that true that'd be nice

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
true very true all right

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
let's move on to talk about a new feature

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
coming to the 3ds

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
and uh we don't know when but it'll be sometime

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
in this next month nintendo is going to be releasing

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
a firmware update for the 3ds

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
that will allow themes you

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
know because speaking of playstation

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
this is something that is on the playstation

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
uh three at least and we know it's coming

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
to the four and they can

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
sell themes and make money off them

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
so why not on the 3ds as well

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
especially we're talking about with these new 3ds

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
you can have all these like interchangeable face plates

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
so you can have like 3ds that match your shoes

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
well now why not the why not the

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
internal theme yeah they're gonna have the themes that match

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
those the face plates exactly

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
so 50 themes gonna be

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
offered in japan at the launch including

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
a few from third parties

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
they'll be like a monster hunter theme is apparently

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
one of the things uh

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
now here's the thing they're not gonna be free but they're

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
priced at around either 100 or

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
200 yen depending on what it is

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
that's a buck or two roughly

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
so they're gonna be cheap

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
but that's still money for a theme

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
but still though they charge money for themes

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
um yeah if some were free

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
that's cool if they do they have

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
simple color set and simple

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
clear color set are free

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
oh color set

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
fancy

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
but if you want to get something

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
like i don't know uh animal crossing

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
able sisters mabel

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
that's gonna set you back why can't i do my

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
own themes like i could in you know the

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
xbox 360 because you'd put

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
a penis on it and we all know you can't

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
have that on the nintendo system wrong wouldn't put

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
a penis on it but a lot of people would put porns

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
from if it's any new

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
indication from the you know youtube

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
no it's fine

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
hashtag hashtag

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
hashtag alright

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
uh where where were

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
we i'm so sorry to interrupt but i think we went

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
from every quest to final fantasy to uh

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
topless marijuana yeah yeah that's

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
what happened

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
it was all in that order

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
amazing it all makes sense too

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
i'm just i i'm so

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
oh my god

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
anyway uh a game that consumed

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
my life besides mmos and

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
ddr how about this one y'all

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
civilization

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
civilization especially the original

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
and then it was siv net

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000

turn into siv four it's over yeah enough said

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
with that one civilization would be uh

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
would be mine right there so there it is

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
thank you ea skeezy for that uh

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
question let's go to another email here

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
from azhp

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
uh

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
hey olr crew azhp here

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
i heard you guys talk about uh the

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
online educational game galaxies

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
on the show yesterday and

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
the studio seemed very positive about it

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
as someone who lives with someone who works

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
on the game i hear firsthand every

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
single day about how the ceo has no idea

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
what he's doing has never made a game before

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
and ignores the advice criticism and

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
general sense from his entire team

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
oh boy this

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
is well we're getting some some

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
tea spill on this one aren't we trying to

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
relax these yeah it's that educational game

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
we talked about a little bit last week now i just want to say

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
i'm just going to put disclaimer out here because i just

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
want to make sure the opinion that i'm reading

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
here is the opinion of the listener and does not

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
necessarily reflect that i'm just going to make

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
because this is this sounds like some pretty

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
this is some gossip so get your coffee

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
and uh let's see see some more here

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
on the email here um

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
continuing on the email

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
he will ask for mini games to be coded

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
in a single day and then ask why

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
there are bugs in it he tells people that they

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
should work on the weekends because that's what successful

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
companies do and he once hired an incompetent

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
socially inept crybaby programmer

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
while his lead programmer was out on

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
maternity leave even though he the CEO

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
doesn't know the first thing about programming or making a game

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
he also told his team

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
when they asked for dedicated QA staff

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
so they could focus on building of the game that

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
quote there's no reason why all of us can't

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
QA our own work 100% of the time

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
then he finally caved

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
and said i think i have a 9 year old

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
nephew who can QA this game for us

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
oh boy uh finally i've played

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
the game in various stages of completion

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
and i can assure you that as an engineer

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
who grew up playing educational games

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
the game is pretty pitifully simple

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
in terms of science concepts even

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
compared to some educational games from the 90s

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
and the mini games themselves take

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
some creative liberties with how scientifically

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
accurate they are i'll be surprised

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
if the game ever ships and i'm pretty willing to

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
bet that if it does ship it'll be about as good

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
as the Duke Nukem forever of educational

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
games wow my jaw is on the floor

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
with like the fucking like reading to

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
filth going on in this mail

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
just thought you guys deserved

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
a more accurate picture of the game

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
than the PR spin the New York Science

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Foundation puts on it because

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
i think they're going to be pretty disappointed with the game

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
if and when it actually does

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
ship yours truly

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
AZHP

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
DAMN

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
well uh

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
i guess the only way to truly find

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
out is to try the game for yourself once

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
it comes out but that is um

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
you know what let me say this

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
let me try to pull

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
what i possibly can out of this

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
especially what it can apply to other stuff

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
in the industry is that you know

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
it does go to show that sometimes

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
we get the feeling and i

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
i don't know this guy and i don't know

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
this company and i don't know you know

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
the CEO or whatever but i have

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
heard stories from other places about

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
people in middle management at some of these

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
companies who really don't seem to know

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
a fucking thing about video games

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
and the impression i'm getting

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
from this email which you know again

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
is i

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
i can't endorse it officially

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
but i can take it at face value

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
i have heard from this listener before

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
and they write pretty good emails

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
i'm inclined to kind of go

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
oh shit where there's smoke there's fire

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
type of thing right so

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
i mean we've heard about where people

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
sometimes who are in the

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
middle in the management so forth

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
kind of don't seem to know what they're doing sometimes

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
like and i get worried when i read that

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
stuff about QA i think i have a

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
9 year old nephew who can QA this game

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
for us that's not QA

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
that's like test marketing

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
or you know because obviously if it's an

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
educational game then fine 9 year olds who

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
the game's targeting but that's that's not QA

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
a 9 year old is not going to explore

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
every single nook

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
and cranny of the game to intentionally

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
try to destroy it

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
a 9 year old doesn't have that type of attention

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
span that's your focus group

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
that's your test audience that's not QA

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
so

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
that right there i kind of go uh oh

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
jonas you're

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
kind of sitting back here going

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
i heard about like

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
the email dimension i think did it mention that

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
something about working like

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
weekends and all that other stuff

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
oh yeah oh yeah you can't just mimic what

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
other companies do for your own success you got to figure it out

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
yourself oh yeah yeah i thought there were

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
laws like actually against that ever since the whole

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
ea incident like not if your

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
contractor whatever i mean you can

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
i think they can make up their own

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
like rules

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
you know when i heard that i was like

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
oh shit we're going back to the what caught

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
ea into a big strangle

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
of legal situations

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
and i'm not sure if it's a repeat of

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
that a lot of

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
reaction in our chat room i mean there's just a lot

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
of people going wow wow wow

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
like it looks like we have a bunch of doge in our chat

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
room right now wow wow such wow

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
much anger wow but see we have

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
bochi kawa says

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
someone had a little bit of pent up aggression although i

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
can believe all of it which is terrible

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
dungeon buster says sadly it's a story that

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
i've read too often about a few other

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
companies it's not crunch it's over

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
time we just won't be paying you over time

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
and ssj100 matt says plenty

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
of companies pull shady shit

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
the stories i could tell you

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
that is true this isn't necessarily something

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
and i don't know if ssj100 matt

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
meant gaming companies or when

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
he says plenty of companies he means like

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
companies all over like not just

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
necessarily

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
video games and i would

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
believe it i believe there's a lot more industries

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
than just video games where this kind of fuckery goes

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
on so

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
a burnt out employee

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
is not a happy employee and a happy employee

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
is going to or an unhappy

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
employee excuse me is bound to make more

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
bugs whether they want to or not that

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
a nine year old is not going to find in the game just

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
saying so you better

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
find that right balance so

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
yikes well you know what um

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
although i hope that doesn't

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
start too much controversy if anyone

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
from that team happens to be

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
listening feels differently

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
i would love to hear from

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
you as well participate at orange launch

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
radar.com it is the show where every

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
gamer has a voice but uh

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
wow

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
hey you know what i appreciate all the perspectives

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
well what a uh what a good

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000

please send this email for a future week participate

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
at orange launch radar.com

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
that last email sure does make a good

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
transition into one of our regular segments we do here

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
on the show it is the FUs

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
of the week

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
uh Loki we'll start with you

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
uh i feel the power outages because we keep

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
having them for some reason i think

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
someone ran into a power pole or something

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
i don't know because i saw them fixing

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
it the day after but we also had one this morning

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
for no apparent reason and the thing

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
it sucks is it shuts off you know

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
the lights and the fans during the night

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
you know that my son uses

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
to keep himself asleep

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
because he likes white noise and then

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
everybody's up you know

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
instead of us being able to sleep through

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
the night so that kind of sucks

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
i wish they would just fix that shit

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
oh and and their ever helpful

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
phone call which i don't even know how the

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
hell they have my number anyways but

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
they called me like an hour

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
after the power outage was done

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
like there's been a power outage

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
i'm like no fucking shit really

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
that was all the things turning off

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
was that what that was i thought it was a ghost

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
i mean seriously thank you

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
smud for fucking calling

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
me and telling me there was a fucking

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
power outage like i couldn't fucking figure that out

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
um i want to give an FU to

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
destiny for not giving me better loot

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
because i'd really like to level up past level 21

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
so uh FU

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
you crap loot system

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
uh and uh let's see

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
i guess my other FU of the week goes to

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
just being like really busy

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
and tired i mean it's a good busy i can't

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
complain but i'm just i'm

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
probably spreading myself too thin again

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
but um yeah

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
there you go

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
real quick about destiny

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
if i played that say in the xbox 360

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
would my character level up and like

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
if i bought that on playstation 4

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
or does that only work for playstation 3 to playstation 4

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
only works i believe from 3 to 4

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
i do not believe it works the other way around

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
but check the bungee forums just to see

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
uh jonas my friend

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
how about you

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
uh big FU to the

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
whiners of people on facebook saying

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
oh they're changing the name policy where people can put

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
fake names this is by the way

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
in response to like the LGBT community

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
who's actually like drag queens

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
trying to protect themselves

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
and you're telling me that

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
and people are telling me uh

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
that they have to put

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
their real names

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
so what's gonna happen with the protection of um

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
the um the drag queens and all the

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
LGBT trying to keep themselves in the sequence

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
i'm not saying anything bad but people

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
are not understanding the situation right

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
i use a fake name on facebook and it's because

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
um i have had situations

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
where in my professional life i've had

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
people try to look me up online

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
and they have found things

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
in my past that they then

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
would bring up in the workplace

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
which is not appropriate you know what i mean

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
so i keep my life separate

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
so i have every right to do that

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
and what really pissed me off

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
in that whole thing and so FU

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
to Mark Zuckerberg because he said

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
something where people who don't use their real name

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
don't have integrity fuck

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
you for that comment

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
fuck you because you obviously

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
don't know what it's like to have a stalker

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
so be seated

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
have 50 seats

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
the funny thing is that one of the main people on facebook

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
said they're gonna change that policy so

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
expect actual people

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
i know they will they're gonna change it

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
cuz you know they got pre- don't fuck with

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
drag queens that's like one of the first rule

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
of the cosmos and i realize this effect

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
far more than just drag queens

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
but the drag queens are the ones that are gonna throw

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
the first rock

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
alright anyways back

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
on other FUs

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
fuck it whoever reported me for

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000

and castlevania 64

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000

but yeah castlevania is easy

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
all you need is the bobby bird thing

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
it's all good

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000

and someone had diarrhea and tried to keep it quiet

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
wow

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
and we could have gone without hearing about it just saying

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
talk about an explosive day

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000

speaking of diarrhea

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
uh

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
some dumbass thought it was a great idea

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
to hey let's slice this tetris

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
and make it into a sci-fi movie

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
oh it'd be the dumbass that was behind

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
moral combat moral combat annihilation

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
now to be fair the moral combat movies were good

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
but i don't know how the fuck they're gonna

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
pull out a sci-fi movie out of tetris

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
i mean that doesn't that's like ok we wanted to make

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000

you know it's gonna be something

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
i guess i agree with tiger claw

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
in the chat room the tetris movie just needs that

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
mortal combat style soundtrack

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
it's gonna be a very big epic sci-fi movie

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
this isn't a movie with a bunch of lines

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
running around the page we're not

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
giving feet to geomet

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
geometric shapes brands

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
are the new stars of hollywood

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
we have a story behind

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
tetris which makes it much more

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
an imaginative thing yes i remember battleship

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
2 that wasn't a very good movie

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
ok but if they don't

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
have like kmfdm are they

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
still around but if they if they don't have like

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
kmfdm or some type of industrial band

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
doing a remix of

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
if they don't have

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
like the industrial yes

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
we need the rom zobby version

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
of that

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
heavy metal that's what we need

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
like during a big action scene

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
imagine tetris the movie

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
i'm sorry it's it's a puzzle

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
game you can't fucking make

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
movies out of puzzle games

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
it doesn't fucking work

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
unless i do something really fucked up

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
it's gonna be and if it does work

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
oh my god can you imagine all the knockoffs we're gonna get

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
then it's gonna be like sudoku

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
the mini series on television

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
scrabble that yeah

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
right then it's like scrabble

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
the you know the sitcom

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
coming to cbs i think that

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
the farthest you can go

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
to make a movie is based off of

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
a board game maybe and

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
that's where clue was clue was good

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
cult classic right was it

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
they're doing one for well they did

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
witch port but now they have an ouija movie as well

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
what i mean come on that's just a fucking paranormal movie

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
um they had

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
jumanji which technically wasn't a board game

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
but it was you know based on a book

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
about about like ants in my

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
pants or

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
uh don't break the ice they're gonna

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
have candy land

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
could they do crossfire

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
how about i would watch a crossfire movie how about

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
cootie i would fucking watch

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
crossfire it's gotta be the retro futuristic

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
thing though like fucking rollerball i'd

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
watch a crossfire

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
exactly gotta have a remix of the fucking

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
commercial hell yes

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
maybe tetris will go like the shark

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
nato route or something where it'll be

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
end up being like super camp like if

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
terra reed is cast in the tetris movie

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
then maybe it'll turn out okay

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
like if they if they aim for camp and so

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
bad it's good that would actually be

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
i know that there's like that he was at the

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
youtube trailer or something like that that

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
someone did a funny like haha it's a trailer

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
for a tetris movie because it's so ridiculous

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
okay i mean

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
it's stupid yeah i just don't want

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
to see a real tetris movie i don't think it's

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
it it doesn't make any fucking sense

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
if you won't make a sci-fi movie make a

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
fucking sci-fi movie there's plenty of properties

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
you can license that are actually sci-fi that

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
makes sense but don't just like

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
i can't like fucking say okay

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
i'm gonna take the game of poker and i'm gonna make it into

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
a war action film

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
it doesn't fucking make any sense

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
although that would probably make more sense

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
than this see act deft in chat says

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
don't wake daddy would be a horror movie

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
um

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
the legend of zaku in chat says

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
uh hungry hungry hippos the movie

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
you know

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
obesity that could well could be kind of like

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
jurassic park what about mousetrap

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
where like there you go oh there you go

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
that would be a pretty sweet you know that

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
was just the opening five minutes of pewie's

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
big adventure it's really just you know

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
all the videos for okay go but

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
i mean i don't know mr t i like

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
my cereal or jenka the movie

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
yeah right yeah yeah

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
thank god featuring the twin towers

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
no no

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
bad bad slap that is

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
bad taste oh my goodness

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
this is exactly what i'm thinking like

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
what did they do with the tetris movie of all

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
things i thought the only thing that the tetris thing

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
worked in was that you remember that they have that

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
little concept video for pixels or whatever

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
that adam sandler's not gonna take his shit on

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
but remember where they had you know the tetris

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
blocks you know falling down stuff and knocking

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
out buildings and stuff like that that was kind of

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
cool this adam sandler

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
movie probably not so cool but whatever

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
light bright wait adam sandler's

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
in the tetris movie no he's in the pixels

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
movie oh god he's in the pixels

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
i was like

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
no no no

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
gee how could the tetris movie get

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
any worse no he's in adam

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
sandler's in it wow it got worse

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
movie the pixels movie which is

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
about all the like retro 80s like

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
you know things coming alive

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
all the arcade characters and then also

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
um he's in candyland

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
which is gonna be terrible too so

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
all right all right uh moving

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
on one more story here for you

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
guys and uh this is just

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
kind of one of those hmm isn't that interesting

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
sort of stories well a few weeks

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
ago on the show we talked about how there was

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
a former nintendo employee

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
dan adelman and he left nintendo

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
he used to be the guy that would work

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
very closely with the indies

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
to get them onto the wii u uh e-shop

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
and you know he's responsible for some of these

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
big titles coming over to the wii u and he

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
actually left uh nintendo

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
well uh he actually

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
announced this week uh a game called

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
axiom verge that uh he

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
is uh working on he's involved with

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
the development of this game it's a metroid

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
castlevania style action platformer

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
and it's being developed by tom

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
hap who's a petroglyph games employee

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
who makes independent games

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
but here's the twist the

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
game is going to be exclusive to playstation

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
oh wow

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
i've actually played the game snap girl

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
i actually played the game actually oh

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
during e3 oh i didn't know it is

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
they actually had a small demo it

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
actually looks really good yeah yeah

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
i'm all for it feels like it feels like

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
the more bloody like aliens or

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
i'm not sure about the abadox

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
sorry the one with

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
it's more like abadox and aliens

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
mixed with metroid

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
so yeah it's gonna be a playstation

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
4 and vita and there was also

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
a steam version that's in the works

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
and uh you know dan edelman does say

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
quote although i will always have a special place in my

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
heart for nintendo fuck those guys no

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
he didn't say that he said in my

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
heart for nintendo this game is solely

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
focused on playstation which

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
surely you've gotta kind of go

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
oh really

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
but gotta get a ps4 now

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
ah

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
i was hoping there'd be a price reduction this year

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
but they've been selling too well yeah they are they

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
really are you probably won't see that

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
probably just wait for some sort of bundle

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
that you want i mean the other destiny one

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
hopefully they'll have some new bundles or

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
wait for microsoft to get desperate

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
and cut the price of their console a little

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
bit assuming it doesn't do well this

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
year i mean till black friday yeah

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
right isn't the xbox sort of

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
like starting to get a little bit of the peak only

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
because they don't include the connect

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
um

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
i mean it's not like

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
you know xbox is not doing like

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
awful but i mean

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
microsoft wants to be doing better

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
than they are that's for sure and they don't

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
like this fact that they're lagging behind sony

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
right now um so

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
they're gonna probably you know

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
if if halo doesn't really move some

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
consoles and so forth they'll probably

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
make a desperation move and that could be

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
slashing the price of the console or maybe a

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
redesign that would be cheaper parts who

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
knows you know this is

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
not before christmas not before

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
christmas we're we're everything that's coming

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
for the holidays you already know about at this point

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
they're not going to do anything then but uh

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
uh next year you never know what

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
bundles they'll sell what games

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
will be you know put together and so forth

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
so all right well

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000

clicker heroes yeah except you cheated

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
i don't care i cheated

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
because i want to stop playing

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
this game and the only way to do that is to finish

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
it so i am going to finish

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
it whatever means necessary and yes

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
you know the only thing that cheating does

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
it means i don't have to spend my life playing this fucking

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
game so i am going to ruin it for myself

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
so i stop playing it that was the goal

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
goal accomplished

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
except i am still fucking playing the game

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
so apparently there's

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000

people love that song i

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
check the i check

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
videos on youtube for

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
this crazy chocobo song on

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
on teeter rhythm just to see how it

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
how it's uh how it plays

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
and people are

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
oh my god this is my favorite song and i'm like

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
what it is you know what i

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
i will say this it is a lot more tolerable in a

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
two minute chunk i will say that

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
because they do have to crop it

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
yeah it is a two minute song

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
it's not that long so yeah

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
it's pretty much the full song

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
but yeah it's i don't know

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
and i and i have said this

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
before and before and

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
and even i said it this week

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
on twitter because uh i played a lot of

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
teeter rhythm before uh smash released

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
and

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
and i really loved all the songs that

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
they put from all the

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
the final fan final fantasy

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
13 series uh

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
13 2 lightning returns especially

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
lightning returns songs are really

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
great yeah they really are yeah

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
they are it kind of makes you want to play the game

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
sorry uh i

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
i still hear crazy chocobo

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
and i'll go like uh yeah

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
i don't know what went in

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
the minds of of the composer there

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
because yeah or or whoever

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
worked on the soundtrack have you heard the

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
titan song from final fantasy 14 because

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
that's kind of a heavy metal song too

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
i think so

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
uh well at least from your streams

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
i think i i have remembered that

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
but yeah that's that's a good song because

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
uh it

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
at least i consider it a good song because it's

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
uh at least it's

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
coherent it's uh it's not

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
played as funny yeah

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
because like the crazy uh well not the

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
crazy chocobo uh in particular

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
all the the chocobo

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
the chocobo songs are are

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
funny are are simplistic

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
are funny are are pretty much

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
just to enjoy

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
and crazy chocobo takes all that through

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
the window and replace it with another thing that

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
i i i i seriously

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
seriously sorry can't

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
comprehend why they did that well you know

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
i in all fairness music is music

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
and you know i sit here and i go how does

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
one direction sell millions of

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
albums it's not very good music but

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
somebody out there likes it who's

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
probably 12 years old but you know whatever

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
so um

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
uh is that it you just want to call and read me

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
out for crazy chocobo or

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
no i also want to talk about

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
the smash brothers a bit because

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
it's a really good game i thought you might what are your

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
thoughts on it uh well you've

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
pretty much uh nailed it at the

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
beginning uh it has its flaws

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
it's not perfect

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
but it's the smash brothers

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
it's it's an affordable it's

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
something that i personally wanted since

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
ever ever since the first

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
measure probably melee

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
that that we uh

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
that that we should

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
be able to play uh a smash

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
or something on a portable yes uh whenever

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
you uh whatever you go

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
you have your if you have your 3ds in this

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
case uh well you can play it

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
and it's it's really good it's

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
not a bad game it's not terrible

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
it has again it's

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
lost like the online component

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
uh it's it's a little

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
wonky especially uh with

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
whoever you're playing

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
with friends it's not it's

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
pretty great i haven't had that

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
many problems uh

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
although i haven't played online with uh

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
with strangers so i i don't know i

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
i but the same thing i wouldn't

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
i sorry i haven't

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
been able to connect to a server or to

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
uh to an image

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
online that way so yeah

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
uh yeah you know and it kind of makes me

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
think like you know i said earlier in the show that the

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
game uh maybe just isn't really

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
for this particular console i mean it

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
doesn't necessarily make it bad or whatever just

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
you know i kind of think back like we've seen fighting

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
games and games that were from

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
um you know the the consoles

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
ported to portable you know

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
since we even had the original game boy

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
like somebody put mortal combat

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
on the original game boy

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
and it's not that it was necessarily

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
bad per se but it just

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
really wasn't a game that was meant to be played on the game boy

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
and that's kind of how i feel about

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
smash and i realized some of the hardcore fans

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
are going to be like no rob you're wrong this is a

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
great thing because now we can play this

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
whenever we want we don't have to have the tv

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
and set it all up but i'm like yeah but you

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
have to have four 3ds's and four

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
copies of the game so

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
you know maybe at conventions that'll work but

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
i don't know i just

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
i just see it as the as the

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
appetizer for the main course

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
that's coming in the wii u version oh yeah

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
definitely though it's curiously because

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
most of the people that are mostly

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
hardcore for smash brothers

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
say that the 3ds

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
it's really awful and

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
and they're waiting for the wii u

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
version especially because

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
yeah all the flaws that the

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
3ds has probably the wii u

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
will fix them let's hope oh yeah that's

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
the again it's the portable

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
component if you can

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
deal with with the bad

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
the good stuff really really shines

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
and something to

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
just to finish this call before

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
it gets too long uh something that

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
the other rhythm and the smash brothers

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
really does really great it's the music

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
player having a music player

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
there having all the songs really

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
great something that a lot of

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
games should do and uh even

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
theater of them will play the cut scenes as well

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
with little movies for the songs that it's appropriate

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
for which is a great feature

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
so oh yeah but especially the music player because

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
you can uh have the 3ds in

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
sleep mode you can close it and

uh you know just a really

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
quick question I thought I'd get you

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
take on something um

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
as you already know uh

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
we've been uh you know

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
seen a few more uh

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
games appearing on scene recently

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
I think uh what was it

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
three four

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
yeah three four seven

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
yeah three four seven eight

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
and they've announced 13 now

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
yeah and plus

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
uh what uh

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
you love it and 14 are also on there

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
well of course duh yeah

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
uh now

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
that being said what do

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
you think the odds are

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
that we'll see some of the other

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
Final Fantasy games

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
you know appearing schemes such as

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
um I know

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Final Fantasy 9 Final Fantasy

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
10 10 2

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
um well

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
the ones you're naming

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
maybe not so much but I think

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
the likely candidates uh

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
and this is probably gonna kind of strike you as kind of

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
uh well oh okay uh I would say

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
five and six are very likely candidates

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
and the reason why I say that is because they've already

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
done those android versions and

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
all they did was convert those android and

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
ios versions for three and four

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
I see no reason why they won't do them for five and six

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
however I'm gonna warn you

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
the outsourced

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
sprite work in five and six

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
is somewhat questionable

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
I'm not sure it's

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
giving you quite the same pure experience

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
but if you've never

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
played the games before and you

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
don't exactly have the means to go track

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
down like a gameboy advance or an old

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
super nintendo which at this point how do you

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
um I would say

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
at least it's better than nothing

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
so uh if those games do come out to

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
steam and you haven't experienced five or

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
especially six for gods sake

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
six is one of the best they've ever made

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
in my opinion I like it but it's my favorite one

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
but if I don't know if you've played the android one

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
it's just kinda

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
it doesn't feel right

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
oh the little reboot one

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
yeah the app games and stuff

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
yeah cause the original sprites I actually

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
enjoyed the original stuff and when they tried to

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
kind of bring it up to date it didn't feel to have the same

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
feeling as it did before yeah it's something like

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
the soul really gets kind of lost

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
six is yeah definitely in my heart

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
the best one in my opinion it's kind of like a fuck you

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
old people we're all for the new people kind of

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
thing yeah I don't know I don't know what the rationale

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
was behind that but that's

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
where it stands with those games but you know

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
for better or for worse with our opinion

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
on that I believe five and six

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
are highly likely candidates

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
as far as nine and ten and those others

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
see that's where we get tricky cause now the hardware

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
gets trickier and final fantasy

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
nine in particular never had a PC

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
release there's a big thing

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
here where seven and eight were actually released

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
on the PC in the

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
late 90s and early

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
2000s yeah

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
so those games were already out

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
on the PC so again it was about adapting

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
them they never did put nine on the PC

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
for whatever reason so

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
they would have to make

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
a conscious decision to do that now

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
I'm not sure that

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
would happen I

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
I think what's going to happen is where the

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
iOS and Android goes

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Steam's going to follow but then you know I

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
would have never guessed that thirteen was

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
going to come out thirteen coming to

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Steam is kind of a huge surprise so you know

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
what I guess anything's possible

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
in that regard Spazinator but I

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
would say five and six next if

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
they all continue to sell well and if thirteen

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
sells well maybe

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
ten HD

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
because they already clearly know how

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
to port over PS3 code to run

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
on the PC I would say ten

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
HD would be your likely candidate next

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
yeah I

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
definitely hope that's the case because I

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
love ten

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
I beat it on to play season

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
two god knows how many times

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
yeah it's a good one it's a good one

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
so great question though and

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
I believe thirteen is on Steam this

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
week right yeah

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
in fact I got pre-ordered I just

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
went in for the game to unlock so

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
that's going to be nice to have the trilogy

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
kind of all right there on the PC I think that'll be a lot

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
of fun so

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
alright well thanks for taking my calls

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
definitely appreciate it alright take care

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
of my friend alright bye-bye

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
that was a good question there from Ragenator

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
1877 game OLR our username

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
on Skype orange lounge radio

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
and some of the thoughts they

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
have Alan Alchemy reminds

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
us we got the little EMU

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
emulator for the LED Chocobo minigame

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
for eight that's right that is there

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
and Bob Coffee reminding us you can

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
buy nine on the Playstation store easy

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
and it works with the PS3, PSP

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
and Vita we do have one more

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
call coming in so this will probably be it for

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
tonight let's go to the phones hi you're on orange

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
lounge radio who's this hey what's up guys

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
this is Kaijuto hey Kaijuto what's up my friend

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
not much I'm gonna I'm gonna try

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
to keep this real quick

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
about what you said about the

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
about the

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
3DS not probably not being

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
the console for the

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
Smash Brothers sure

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
I disagree that's fine mainly

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
yeah mainly the main reason why I disagree is

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
what I noticed about myself is

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
I'm not a hardcore Smash

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
Brothers fan

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
the only other Smash Brothers

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
game that I own is Brawl and that was for

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
the Wii so I'm not

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
I'm not one of these people that have been

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
playing for years and I've really gotten used to the

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
GameCube controller you know

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
I don't you know I don't come from that

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
place so when I played on the 3DS

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
I don't know what I'm missing

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
I don't know what's changed and I'm able to adapt

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
to the controls a lot better now

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
I will agree that

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
every now and then when I'm using the

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
the circle pad I'll

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
go to like maybe throw a punch and I think that I'm

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
punching in the right direction I'll be

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
punching somewhere else and that kind of gets frustrating

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
but it's not something that happens

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
all the time and it really doesn't affect

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
my gameplay so I think that

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
I think it's

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
great to have it on the 3DS because I think that

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
there may be a lot of little kids that are maybe

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
like me which is funny to say but

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
there's probably a lot of little kids that are like me who may

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
have never played any of the other Smash Brothers

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
games and this would be like a great little

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
entry point for them you know

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
and they could probably get used to it you know the

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
controls on the 3DS really quickly

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
and learn to play the game there you know I could

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
I could remember being a little kid

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
and trying to go to the arcade and trying

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
to play Pac-Man on the

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
big huge ass joystick and not being able

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
to like reach the screen but when I got my little

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
when I got my little tabletop Pac-Man

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
I was able to kick ass on that I mean like

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
literally just playing you know for hours

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
and hours without dying and that's

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
how I was used to playing but I know

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
I'm pretty sure that there were adults who

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
played in the arcade that was like what's this little

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
tabletop shit you know like you know

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
this isn't how you play you know

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
this isn't Pac-Man

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
you know what that's a really good comparison

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
that is a really fair point I think in that

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
respect especially I love that

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
comparison with the tabletop Pac-Man

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
where like when you're a little kid you don't care

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
it's Pac-Man whereas like an adult

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
gamer probably looks at that and goes what is that cheap

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
knockoff garbage you know I don't

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
think now obviously Smash Brothers is not

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
knockoff garbage by any means it is still

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
a good game I just believe

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
it's biggest flaw is the system that it's

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
on which is why I'm like I'm really excited for the Wii U

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
version but you bring up a great point

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
there's gonna be kids out there with like a 2DS

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
even that like this is the way they're

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
gonna play the game because maybe their

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
family just doesn't have a Wii U or

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
the little kid can't exactly monopolize

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
the TV with their game console

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
so this 2DS version is what

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
they get so hook them early

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
yeah exactly and I'm also

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
about the porting issue

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
you know from what you had mentioned earlier

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
about you know how they had to take some

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
characters out and tweak a few things just so

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
that it's able to be played on the 3DS

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
I feel that it's not really a

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000
direct port you know it's more of like

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
it's more customized for the 3DS

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
which I think is also a good thing and one

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
last question I'll take this off the air

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
but how do you guys think

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
that it's gonna play on the Wii U with that

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
I know that they have the GameCube

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
controller that they're gonna

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
apply to it but how do you feel that people

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
are gonna be able to play with that big ass

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
Etch A Sketch controller

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
you know what I know a lot of people

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
I know a lot of people rag on the

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
gamepad but it honestly doesn't bother me

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
like when I'm holding it like maybe it's

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
just because I don't know maybe because I'm

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
an older guy who's got big

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
hands maybe like when I'm holding the gamepad

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
it's just not really an issue to me but I don't

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
I don't think about like

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
I don't know why but when I'm holding like I hold

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
my Xbox controller with two

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
hands so when I hold the Wii U controller

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
with two hands it really actually feels like a

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
similar configuration it's just my hands

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
are further apart but they

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
it doesn't feel weird or anything

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
cause the way the tablet's

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
weighted or whatever like it feels very natural

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
the Wii U controller is actually I

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
think it's a great feel and I know some people

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
think like what that thing is huge but

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
it works I don't know I don't know

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
and eventually I think sorry I didn't mean to cut you

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
it eventually feels like it'll

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
come down to preference just like when

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
it transferred to the Wii

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
when Brawl came out and now you have the

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
nunchuck and everything and people have their preference

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
and seeing that big controller

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
actually the way I look at it I see it as like

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
old school game gear if I think about it

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
but it's pretty much like towards that

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
it's just what they're feeling

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
bringing back the old controllers

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
the gaming controllers will bring back more

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
feel to the old school stuff but that's

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
because that was their preference too and that was just

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
the demand but I don't really see any

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
difference to people getting used to the new controllers

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
and such but at least what is great

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
about the Wii U version

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
is that you get a choice you know

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
and you can even use what we're hearing

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
your 3DS as the controller if you want

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
for the Wii U version so if you

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
totally think I'm off base

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
with what I'm saying and you enjoy the 3DS

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
as a controller then you're going to be able to use that

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
with the Wii U version so I think

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
that's great that you're at least going to have those

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
choices that you simply can't

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
have on the 3DS and that's just the

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
limitation of a portable gaming system

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
right yeah

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
I agree with that yep so

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
thanks for taking my call you are welcome and a great show

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
as always and have a good night quickly

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
quickly favorite character in Smash gotta know

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
has to be the Wii Fit Trainer

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
I mean I kicked ass today

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
with that like I haven't lost with her yet

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Rob the Robot is pretty good too but

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
I'm hearing a lot about the Wii Fit Trainer

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
the Wii Fit Trainer is one of my favorites as well

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
like the Wii Fit Trainer is an awful lot of fun

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
what about the dog from Duck Hunt? I haven't unlocked him yet

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
I unlocked him but I haven't used

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
him yet but I don't know it feels weird

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
fighting the dog as much as I hate that dog

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
it

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
just feels weird to fight he has a duck on his

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
back and it's just weird

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
it's a weird character it looks like it should have been

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
Nintendo or something

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
Nintendo there you go that would have been something

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
alright my friend thanks for the call appreciate it

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
alright goodnight and take care buddy

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
that was a great comparison

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
that's why we love to hear from the listeners

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
and take the calls live is because you know I might be

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
sitting here saying one thing about the game but

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
that comparison with the old school and I remember

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
those things vividly in my head those 80's

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000
Pac-Man table tops and you can even see these

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000
like E3 at the museum and so forth

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
they just like you look at

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
like what a shitty port but

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
again when you're younger it's like

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
it's the real thing it's awesome

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
on top of like the casual discussions I mean

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
for 3DS if people will buy

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
if they prefer more on the gun

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
that people have preference of controls

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
I do agree on him as well

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
as he said about besides the competitors

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
it's actually catering to the fans

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
of actually Smash itself

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
because as he says as a kid

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
now they can have it handheld they can take it where they want to go

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
rather than taking a humongous system which they can't

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
which definitely will apply

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
to them as well and then you know though it's a different

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000
entire game

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
they'll get used to that too and still have fun

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
it's still Smash Brothers

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
as the thing you'll always have that

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
and the developers

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
themselves said it's a fine balance

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
between the casual brawl

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
and the competitive melee

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
to the upcoming

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
Smash games and sometimes with our

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
conventions we try to separate that too that's the one thing

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
that some of our staff applied

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
is that you have these kids that go to these

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
conventions and they want to play the game but then

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
you have the competitors there at the same time they're mashed

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000
in there but then they're not having fun

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000
so what one of our staff has done

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000
is made two separate tournaments

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
a kind of a peewee division to separate

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
them where they can use items and so forth because

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
they want to play with that stuff they want to have fun

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
not to show that the parents look at

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000
this and say that I think my child just wasted

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
his money just to go here and get

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
bummed off by these kids that

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
just are not showing any

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:29.000
sportsmanship towards the game

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
especially to the little kids as well

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
but that's why we separate the two sometimes

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
just to have the fun

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
now in the online mode you have for fun and for

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
glory and that sounds almost exactly what you're talking about

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
there is how you're kind of splitting things

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
that's how it should be actually that's how it should be

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
because there's two different scenes

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
great wow

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
very cool to kind of hear how that plays into

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
the tournament stuff that you guys do there

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
let's see actdeft in chat says why didn't I

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
get asked that question about my favorite character

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
because you would have picked Kirby

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
or clearly if you know actdeft

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
you know he loves Kirby or maybe

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
I suppose maybe it could have been Meta Knight

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
or Dedede or one of the other characters in those games

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
but I kind of just have a feeling here

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
alright anyhow

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
that is about going to do it for another

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
episode of Orange on its Radio it's been a long show tonight

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
but a fantastic show

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
I want to once again thank Bobby King

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
and Farsight Studios and wish them

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
the best of luck with the Addams Family Kickstarter

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000
which as we saw in our Fugu Question of the Week tonight

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
there's a lot of love for the Addams Family out there

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
so if you don't mind

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
putting down the money now to make sure you're going to get

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
a copy of the table when they finish that

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
then they can get all that licensing they need to finish it up

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000
and it looks like, although it looks really good

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000
remember they have to hit that goal

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000
or they don't get any of it

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
so we're going to keep our fingers and toes crossed for them

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000
DarkSaraka

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000
sadly she's already left

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
but she will be back next week on the show

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
we already got her final thought earlier

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
Diego, Jonas, thanks for being back again tonight

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
Always a pleasure

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
It's been fun having you guys drop in over the past couple months

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
and it's good to hear what you guys are up to

03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000
good luck with all the tournaments

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
and having to work Smash 3DS into your rotation now

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
Looking forward to it on October the 10th

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
it's already getting pretty hyped

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000
and I'll be looking, definitely

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000
That'll be a lot of fun

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000
Final thoughts tonight, Jonas, I'll start with you

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000
your final thought

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
With October being busy and with Smash coming up

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
I want to see how this develops

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
and how it can integrate for future events

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000
so

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000
and I'll be honest

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
hopefully with the upcoming Smash comes up

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
people can stop talking about

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
too heavily

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
people can say Project M

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
don't get me wrong, it's a game for people who could cater to that

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
but I can't have that requested

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
because we don't want to be in trouble with legal issues

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
it's what it is

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
with the whole

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
hacked version

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
Diego, your final thought tonight

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
Like I said, kind of going off what he said

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
about upcoming games and such

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
we got a lot of stuff on our plate that we hopefully would present out

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
to the community as we try to do

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
throughout the years

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
and definitely looking forward to not just Smash

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000
but also November when Pokemon

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000
Omega, Ruby and Sapphire

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000
Alpha, that's definitely going to be a big thing

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000
because Pokemon is another big scene too

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000
oh yes

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000
and when that comes out, and I've never played the third version

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000
and I'm glad they brought it out in 3D

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000
and I will definitely be the first time ever

03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000
I'll play that

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000
I always try to get into Pokemon

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000
and I usually get to the first or second gym

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000
and then I just, I can't

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000
and the games won't allow me to not collect

03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000
every single Pokemon along the way

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000
even though Shane, who's very into Pokemon

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000
won't tell me, don't play it that way

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000
and I tell you, the game has changed

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
so much since it first came out

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000
because everything, as people say, was so much broken

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000
but it's definitely a deep game

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000
speaking of Pokemon

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000
I thought you had discussed

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000
of course the Pokemon Regionals

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000
coming up next week

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000
now will be the last of the Pokemon

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000
X1

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000
until they start moving on to Pokemon

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000
Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000
so that should be a fun series

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
of tournaments going on for Regionals

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000
you guys are going to be

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000
tournamented out by the time Christmas comes around

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000
but I guess I can't really

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000
so many things that get in order

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
well thank you guys again for being here

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
I'm sure next month or so

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000
thank you for having us again

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
you're welcome, anytime

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000
it's always good to have the mixed perspectives

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000
where would we be without you guys?

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000
if we have gotten to topless marijuana

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000
Rosalina, without you guys

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000
I don't know

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000
I forgot the order of how that all started

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000
Loki, my friend, your final thought tonight

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:29.000
I'm confused, I went to this Nexus

03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000
games website and they have their

03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.000
Brickblast U game which they

03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000
on the one side it says

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.000
Family Fun Entertainment

03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000
and for some reason they have a mature rating

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000
marked on that, which I don't think that

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000
even went through the ESRB and I'm pretty sure

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000
they mocked that up because it also says

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000
their website and

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000
quality stuff that you can

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.000
look forward to in a Minecraft clone

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000
coming soon

03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000
yeah, and my

03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000
final thought is I'm going to work on my games more

03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000
alright, good luck with that

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000
as I do every show, I'm just going to say

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000
please help spread the word about

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000
Orange Launch Radio, if you enjoyed the show

03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000
please tell a friend or five or fifty

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000
about the program, five star

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000
reviews on the website where you found

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000
this show goes along with iTunes

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000
Stitcher Radio, all those places

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000
go a very long way in helping people

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000
discover the show, remember we don't have a mega

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000
budget behind the show, all we have is you

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000
guys, our OL army as we say to help spread

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000
the word, definitely, definitely, we will definitely

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000
same one will be on October

03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
10th, we'll definitely spread that out, heck yes

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000
especially for our next coming streams definitely

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000
we'll give you a shout out, awesome

03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000
once again we apologize for not bringing more people

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000
but we're still working on that

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000
it's not that big of a space

03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000
I do still have

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
a final thought I want to get out here but I do

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000
want to, well let me give my final thought here

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000
this was a little bit more of a personal note

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000
and it's going to come off as a little bit random

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000
but it's something kind of important I want to make sure I mention

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000
because I've told

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000
the cast and the people of this directly

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000
impacts about it so now I can be a little more

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000
public with this, but

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000
as you guys know, I have

03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:03.000
before I got to

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000
Orange Lounge Radio

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000
I used to do another show

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000
Understation Live with Travis and Jessica

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000
I was born of the Rocky Horror

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000
Picture Show community and you know

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000
cult movies and cult cinema that's something

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000
I've done on and off since 1998

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000
and even until

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000
these past few years I've been working very closely

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000
with a local group with the Sacramento

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000
Horror Film Fest which is actually going on next weekend

03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000
which is why I can't go to

03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000
your shindig but that's going on

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000
next weekend

03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000
you know that whole thing keeps me very busy

03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000
but I kind of got to this

03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000
point where it was like alright I'm doing more

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000
and more and more broadcasting I'm doing more

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000
and more with this I've got too much on my plate

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000
something's got to give so I

03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000
actually have made a decision

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000
to end my 16 year career

03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000
with the Rocky Horror Picture Show

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000
so Halloween is going to be my

03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000
farewell show as the director and

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000
as a regular performer so if you are

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000
in the Sacramento area and you need plans for Halloween

03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000
I encourage you to come on out

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000
because that's actually going to be my final

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000
show so which

03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000
is you know it's a little bit difficult personally

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000
especially all the history and the fact that like

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000
wow would I be here where I am with OLR if it wasn't

03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000
for that and I don't know

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000
but the

03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000
good thing about that is that this will

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000
allow me to continue to focus

03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000
on broadcasting

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000
and this hobby and

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000
you know doing more things like

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000
livestream and more things like YouTube and

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000
all of that and VOG

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000
and so forth so and that doesn't mean I

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
still won't continue to support my

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000
friends over at the SAC Horror Film Fest and in the

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000
Rocky Horror Community and cult cinema in general

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000
I just have to support them in other ways

03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000
now instead of unnecessarily getting on stage

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000
so that's just why I wanted to get off my chest

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000
so thank you guys very much for indulging

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000
me there and

03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:47.000
I will say next week on the show

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000
stay tuned because

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000
we have an awesome interview with Lunar Ray

03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000
Games as I talked about earlier in the show

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.000
also coming to the studio

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000
I can't promise this because

03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:59.000
sometimes you know her schedule changes but

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:01.000
Princess Irene returning to

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:03.000
the show next week so

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.000
she's going to be here in studio we haven't had her in a long time

03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000
Jonas is just like what?

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000
Princess Irene is going to be here next week and I believe

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000
JV Mon is back from

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000
New York City here next

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000
week so I mean next week is an action packed
