{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki This week, the news comes in pairs as Twitch and Steam instate new policies involving sponsored broadcasts and video game curation. Also in pairs this week, handheld console themed Star Wars games as well as plastic Strider and Halo. We'll tell you more along with your tweets, calls, and chat comments right here on the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live here on October the 5th, 2014 with episode number 570 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts and we've got a really busy show for you guys tonight so let me get right to it and introduce our co-host. Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. How are you? You're full. I'm very full. This yummy bread that you brought to the show that tastes like Cinnabon as bread. But it's better than the Cinnabon bread. Cinnabon does make a bread, a loaf of bread, and it's not nearly as good as the stuff. Why is it that every, and you know we love to talk food here at OLR so I'm going to start with this. This is tonight's kickoff topic. Why does every airport have a Cinnabon? What is it about planes? They want you to be in a food coma for the trip. Clearly. I'm so full of Cinnabon. I can't get out of my seat. That means that fewer people are going to the bathroom. Hold on, I know Tech Master Loki over there has got to have an answer for this. Hi Tech Master Loki. It's because Cinnabon is awesome and normally it's just in the mall. I mean occasionally you'll find it in a strip mall but it's usually just in like a major shopping mall. And so it's, and every time I go to an airport it's like, ooh Cinnabon. That's it. It's like, ooh Cinnabon. I got to get a Cinnabon. I had a friend, this was about a year ago, was like, man I really want Cinnabon but I hate going to malls that go to the airport. It'll be faster. And she went. That's actually kind of true. It is true. Well she also lived closer to the airport. Alright. We do tape live of course every Sunday night, excuse me, at the voice of Geeks Network. vaughanetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwell show. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sunday nights. And Dark Tetsuya in chat says, wow a whole minute before the food talk. That has to be a record. Hey Dark Tetsuya, shut up. Look, like I said, it is a busy show tonight. So we have, you know. We need energy. So yeah, we have, we got to get through some of these segments real quick. Tonight, not only all that news that Jason mentioned in the intro there, but we have another interview this week. And this is going to be great to talk about this because Dark Sakura, I know you love your pinball. Yes. And so we have an awesome guest this week. Unfortunately the scheduling didn't work out. He couldn't be here live, but so we already actually taped this. It's already done. But I did mention you quite a few times in the interview because of your love of pinball. And you're okay. But we have tonight, if you love pinball, stay tuned because we have Farsight Studios. Bobby King from Farsight Studios is going to be joining us to talk about the pinball arcade. Which is on like every platform. Like I could start naming the platforms it's on. Like oh it's on PS3 and PS4 and Xbox 360 and the Ouya. And I mean it's on like every modern gaming console. And I actually will ask him about that in the interview a little bit later on in the program. We'll get into that in about probably about an hour and a half. We'll actually do that usually where we would have a break between parts A and B of our show. We will get to that interview and lots of good stuff in that. So stay tuned for that. Meanwhile we're going to get to our gaming weeks. But we got to get to some kickoff topics. I thought it was food. No we're done with food chat for now. You wouldn't stop burping so I had to end food chat. Alright let's get to a couple kickoff topics tonight. I thought since we do have Bobby coming on the show tonight to talk about the pinball arcade. And the Kickstarter for the Addams Family table. That they're trying to make happen. Which I think they're like super close to their goal. So maybe our listeners will be enough to push it over. Wait wait wait. Goal! Goal! The Addams Family is like one of the few tables I don't see in your house. Yes but we have the table that came as a result of Addams Family. Oh really? Twilight Zone. Oh I did not know that was a result of that. Addams Family was such a runaway success. They're like here's our list of licenses do whatever you want. And he's like I'm going to make Twilight Zone. And I'm going to make it a wide table and we're going to put MagnaRamps in it and all this stuff. So yeah but Addams Family is one. I do like Prop Addams Family. Prop Cycle Addams Family. Oh god. I didn't even think to ask about that during the interview. It's a real bummer that you couldn't be here to ask about those types of things. But I did ask about the gold edition Addams Family so we'll talk. We'll get into that later. It's too bad the Twilight Zone table didn't have the Twilight Zone song. The techno song. Yes it did. It did? No no it had the golden earring one. Oh. No no see. Loki is talking about the Twilight Zone that was in DDR. Oh. I think the table might have predated or been around the same time. But they got like an all synth version of golden earrings Twilight Zone. Twilight Zone is a rad table. Ten minutes long. How did you get into pinball, Dark Sakura? Dan. Well actually I should take a step back. Why is it seen that pinball and video games tend to go hand in hand? I mean technically they are different. A pinball is not a video game. But at the same time it's like okay I don't know many gamers who are like I hate pinball. And I don't know many pinball players who are like I hate video games. They tend to be pretty closely related. They're electronic entertainment. You stand, you press buttons and things happen. You have scores involved. It's a game. So they are technically in the same genre. Right. Just variants of it. Right. Whereas one is kind of like a physics game in a way. Pinball is kind of a physics game but that's not a bad thing at all. That's what's kind of fun about it. I think pinball went on two divergent paths. Yeah. You have, they all started with the same you know the ball goes and hits different things to what we know as pinball and then pachinko. Ooh. See I thought you were going to go towards like virtual pinball because a lot of my memories for pinball quite honestly have to do with virtual tables. I mean I love the physical, don't get me wrong, I love the physical tables. You know I remember when the roller rink, oh yeah I went there, would have pinball machines and that was a lot of fun. Hey I was only good at Frogger if I was on roller skates. But I also remember pinball on the NES but also more importantly like okay those collections they had like I remember there was a collection on the Amiga. Pinball Dreams I think and they brought it over to like early PCs like in the 90s and those collections were so flipping good. I think those actually exist on like iPhone now today. So I love that stuff. Well I'm counting virtual pinball in the same category as pinball because it's really just a, it's pinball facsimile. You know it's pinball simulation. So just like you know some video games are simulations of other things. Which is basically what the pinball arcade is. But they do a great job and I like it because you know pinball tables can be hard to find in this day and age. And you know unfortunately it is somewhat of a, I don't want to say a dying trend but it's popularity seems to not be where it was. It's just because arcades aren't that popular anymore. Yes I think it's tied to that. Not necessarily amongst the collectors. No not amongst the collectors, oh god no never. The market is actually, the value of tables is really shooting up now. But like where in town can I play a theater of magic? Not in somebody's house. See she was about to say something. Wait not in somebody's house. I could name four people's houses you could go play it at. But see that's the problem. It's you know if I want to play theater of magic well now I can, I do have a way to do that. It's like I can do the next best thing like literally. Okay maybe it's not the physical table. We could borrow somebody's again. We do table swaps all the time. You know what the problem is? It's because 7-11 doesn't have arcade games anymore. That's the problem. It's because arcades don't have arcade games anymore. 7-11 was the first place I played Mortal Kombat 2. You know what they have now? ATM machines. And that's not a fun game. That's also redundant. Well it says ATM on the machines so you know. That's what the M stands for. I understand that. That's like saying pin number. Department of Redundancy Department. How can I help you? Anyhow. Hello I'd like to have an argument. Let's quickly just to you know kind of throw this out there. Because I'm going to ask this of Bobby later when he comes on. And Jamie I know this might be, no actually I already know what you're going to answer this with. But just for those that may not know. What is your favorite pinball table of all time and why? World Cup Soccer 94. And why? Because it was the table I had at college when I went to the University of South Alabama. And I was pretty damn good at it. And I have the table practically memorized. I'm not as good as I used to be at it. But it's one of, I'd probably say it's my favorite right now. It just has a lot of memories attached to it for me. If I was going to name another one I'd probably say Last Action Hero. Because that was the table that Dan and I played a lot when I was working at GNC back in the day. They had a Last Action Hero at GNC? No. We had to take... That would probably get me into a GNC. You want to get buffed like Schwarzenegger? I had to take the deposit and the deposit was right next to a Godfather's in Natomas. I think it's in Mt. Mike's now or something. I was going to say is Godfather still around? They all went under around here. But Dan and I would go and pick up a cheap pizza and play Last Action Hero. And Snow Brothers. They had Snow Brothers. That's love. That's love right there. Cheap pizza and Snow Brothers. But then they changed out the Last Action Hero and then we started going there. Because then I got my first full-time job. Another one I'd actually have to say that I really, really, really like... Alright, last one. You can't name them all, Jamie. I actually really like Brighter Pin Bot. That's a good table. Brighter Pin Bot is a very good one. It's a classic. Some people will look over it, but it was a very interesting one in the series. It had a lot of different tricks to it, so it was very cool. Okay, so my favorite table legitimately is, of all time, my favorite table really is The Addams Family. And that's actually part of the reason I reached out to Farsight and wanted to invite them on the show. I personally am just excited of the idea that The Addams Family could get into the series alongside these other tables. Because for me, I think The Addams Family was the best table there ever was. But for me, see, I love the movie. And I was probably 12 or 13 when that movie came out, and I love the movie. And even still to this day, it's such a great movie, right? Like Raul Julia was great in it. Angelica Huston is the perfect Morticia. It's just such great. Christina Ricci is Wednesday. Just an amazing film. I will have to tell you something. Did you know the sound bite from The Addams Family made it into Twilight Zone? No, I didn't know that. Greed. Really? I never noticed that. And they had all those cool little references that actually tied into the movie. It didn't feel like it was some weirdly tacked on thing. It actually felt like an extension of the movie, but as a pinball table. You had the bookcase that was in the movie. You had the thing. You had the memushka. It was a big scene in the movie. And it's a big type of multi-ball or something in the table. I just love the way it ties in. But my second favorite table of all time would be Pinbot. And that might be partially because of the NES version. Which, granted, I understand to some people the NES version is super hokey. But to me as a kid, I loved it. Although I will say, Alan has really brought my love of the Elvira table up. Actually, there's two Elvira tables. There is. I like them both. There was some of the madness, wasn't it? Well, they're both in the pinball market. But the Elvira tables, he has really raised my love of those tables as well. I had to double check, but yeah, it was designed by Pat Lawler. Oh, there you go. For the life of me, I knew it wasn't one of Steve Ritchie's. But yeah, it's one of Pat Lawler's ones. Talk about the two best pinball designers. Pat Lawler and Steve Ritchie. And Steve Ritchie is such a nice guy. Yeah, you met him at one of those California exchanges. I've met him a couple times. I hung out with his wife for like two hours one night. So, they're both really cool people. Alright, now I'm dying to know this. Because, Loki, you don't talk a lot about pinball, but I know you've played some machines. So, what's your favorite? My favorite is Adam Stanley, actually. Because I used to play that at Qsar, where I worked and stayed a lot of the time. So, you know, they had Adam's family there. I think they had Twilight Zone also. They also had my second favorite game, which was Attack from Mars, I think. Attack from Mars is a good one. That was great. There's the classic and then there's the hologram. The hologram. The hologram was Revenge from Mars. Revenge from Mars. I'm sorry. Revenge from Mars. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. So, that one was pretty cool. And then, before that, I didn't really play a whole ton of pinball. So, I'd have to say, what was it? The default shareware table that was in Epic Pinball. Oh, the Rockstar or something? Is that the one? No, no, it wasn't Rockstar. It was like a cyborg thing. Like some cyborg chick. I don't remember. Oh, god. Epic Pinball was so good. Oh, my gosh. Did you guys ever play any, though, of the weird specialty tables? Like, there was the, what was the giant one? The Titan pinball? Not, like, physical? No. I remember, like, Rollerball on the NES. There was three screens. Have you ever been to the pinball museum in Las Vegas? No, but I'm going to Las Vegas. There's a pinball museum in Las Vegas? I think that they moved it from the location I saw it at, but they have a pinball circus there. Well, there's a pinball museum now in Alameda. I need to go. But, like, you remember Hyperball? Or, uh, what was the one that I really liked? Black Hole. Where the ball goes and then you're playing it upside down. Oh, yeah, I played that at California Street. Good times. It was like Theater of Magic. That was pretty cool. Theater of Magic is a great one. It was very solid. The Genie. The one with the spinning lamp. What the hell is that one, Jamie? It's like Aladdin's Tales from the Lamp. Oh, my god. It wasn't like an Arabian Nights. Oh, my god. I can't remember the name of that table. I think it was Arabian Nights. Yeah, I think it was Arabian Nights. Or Black Rose. The one where you shoot a cannon. Okay, so quickly before we get to our gaming week, I want to kind of talk about this up front because I know this is on a lot of your minds out there and that is the release of Smash Bros. on the 3DS. Got it. Smash Bros. for 3DS. Have you had a chance to play it yet, though? No, because I was sick yesterday and it was also Yom Kippur. Which I hope my fellow Jews out there had a good fast. Um, but I've actually been doing a lot of catch up today. And, Loki, you still don't even own a 3DS, right? I don't really have an opinion on this. Dan's been playing the crap out of it. Yeah, I know some of you guys, and I've played a little bit of it, too, so I'm curious of your thoughts on the new Smash Bros. in our chat room over at live.volgnetwork.com. And I've played a little bit of it and I'm always impressed at how much they cram into a Smash Bros. game. Because you know it's not just, like, clusterfuck rumble, free-for-all mode. They also have, like, solo mode and hit the punching bag as far as you can. And bombs, and get the trophies. And adventure mode's really cool. Like, I'm always impressed at, like, how many freaking modes they cram into the game. Like, it's so much. Is the adventure- do they have, like, the adventure mode in this one? Is that, like- It's not like it is, like, in the Wii one. See, the Wii one is really awesome. I do like what they did here, though. They basically- you have a maze that you go through and you get five minutes or something in the maze and you try to collect as many items as you can and the items will increase your attack, your roll, your jump, you know, all these various things. And the more you get of all that, then you, at the end of the five minutes, you do an epic battle with all the players that were in the maze. So it's actually- it's a cool little minigame, you know, for the 3DS. Keep in mind. And here's the one drawback to Smash on the 3DS, is that- and I'm gonna get shit for this comment from my Nintendo-loving friends, but I'm sorry, guys. This is opinion. Take it or leave it. If you wanna, you know, throw in your two cents, you can in our chat room. Or our email bag, participate at orangeontrated.com, but here it is. The 3DS is just the wrong system for this game. And I kinda said this, you know, when I played the demo, I thought I was worried a little bit that this might be the case. I know Bobby Blackwolf on his show, he talked about, you know, his issues with it, especially being on an older 3DS, but like- I can't stand the circle pad, for one, as a controller. Like, um, I love to use NES, and I find that, like, I do the wrong PK thing, because, like, my up flick should've been a right- you know, like, I flicked the thing the wrong way, and it goes weird. And like, jumping feels so weird in this to me, and I- again, I think it's that stinking circle pad. And I don't like that you can't flip that and the D-pad, because the D-pad is meant for taunts. Um, so, I don't know. Um, so that part of it is, uh, uh, a little bit annoying. But, for me, here's the thing. This acts as a great teaser, and a great build-up for the Wii U version, which will be the, like, piece de resistance, for- for, you know, for me. Like, that's- that's the one I really wanna get. I understand why Nintendo kinda had to do the 3DS version, because, you know, with the Wii U not being in as many homes as- as maybe they'd want, they can probably sell a lot more by putting it on the 3DS. And there's gonna be people- a lot of people that end up buying it on both. Um, but, you know, I- I- again, there's a lot of good in this game as well. Like, the character customization is fun. And I- I actually liked designing the Miis an awful lot, and I liked being able to make your own character and all this stuff. Again, it's just, like, playing all this makes me really excited to play it on the system I think it was really meant for, which is the Wii U. That's my opinion. Take it or leave it. Uh, let's see, uh, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Codeman says, I'm waiting for Wii U, I don't own a 3DS. Uh, Codeman says, are Ness and Lucas back in the game? Um, Ness only, Lucas was cut out, and I was really surprised they didn't do a palette swap for Lucas on Ness, which, I understand they had their differences in the last game, but they could've done a little bit of fan service having Lucas as a palette swap, but yeah, only Ness is in it. Um, Kaijuto in chat suggests, if you have a problem with the circle pad jump, use wire X. That's true, I could do that, it's still, I don't know why, it just doesn't feel right to me, because again, I think, because of the way the circle pad is designed, sometimes I end up jumping when I don't mean to jump. Like, I don't know. It's just bleh. Uh, S2100Matt says, apparently some people broke their circle pads. Yeah, I saw some of that from Japan. Uh, S2100Matt says, Smash Run has some cool fan service moments when fighting old school and lesser known enemies. Yeah, man, the trophies. There's some really excellent trophies that really dig deep into the Nintendo universe, and for that matter, uh, the Mega Man universe, the Pac-Man universe, you know, and all that with all the people that are assisting, you know, cause Sega's involved, Capcom's involved, Namco's involved, it's pretty impressive. Um, I wanna say this as well, speaking of the other companies involved, I gotta say, one of the most impressive things for me, like being able to play it in the game that makes me so happy and so frustrated at the same time, playing Mega Man on that Dr. Wily stage. Like, oh my god, it's so good, like, like, but it makes me so upset that they are not doing another Mega Man game. Like, they could just make a Mega Man game like that, and I would be so happy, but I just feel like it's never gonna happen, and it makes me so sad. Have you played your Mii yet? I have played as the Mii. My Mii's a little sword fighter. Dan, I think, went with the default set for his. Uh-huh. I'm planning on doing like a Sheik style, so. Uh, Kossan in chat says, stands outside of NOA headquarters with a sign that says, no Ice Climbers and no Lucas equals no sale. Well, here's the thing. Um, Ice Climbers, and we talked about this on a previous week's show, Ice Climbers apparently were cut from the 3DS version because it's a hardware issue, a hardware limitation, or a hardware limitation, excuse me. If all four people in the match were playing Ice Climbers, the system couldn't handle it. Maybe the new 3DS can handle it, but the old 3DS's can't. And I think we're seeing some things where the 3DS version of the game changed a few things. In fact, there were some stories that came out this week about, like, what's going on with some of the hardware limitations. Did you know the 3DS is the reason that Sheik and Zelda were split into separate characters? Uh, yeah, that is in a translation from Sakurai's Famitsu column. Of course, Masahiro Sakurai, who's behind Super Smash Brothers, said, quote, It's basically due to the 3DS limitations. It was impossible to have both characters exist together as one on 3DS. However, reaching that limit can sometimes lead in good directions. Transforming characters had the drawback of ambiguous tactics and such, and I believe they've become more fresh now. So, 3DS, the reason why Sheik and Zelda were split into separate characters. Kind of interesting. Not available on the 3DS, by the way, the Circle Pad Pro. Again, Masahiro Sakurai explained, Supporting the Circle Pad Pro requires the use of some of the CPU's processing load. From the information received during the development of Kid Icarus Uprising, this is quite a large load at around 5%. Kid Icarus Uprising and Smash both use the maximum capability of the device, so we had to abandon the idea of the Circle Pad support. I don't understand why that would be. I mean, aside from just, you know, the infrared communication with it or something, but... Is it battery drain, maybe? It's not battery drain, because it's got an external battery, but it's just... I think it's because they're using infrared to send signals back and forth with it. Instead of having to actually plug into a port or something. Which is dumb. It's really stupid, because it should be absolutely no extra load since it's just buttons. It's not doing any sort of processing other than reading the inputs coming from those buttons. But the fact that it has to translate that data into something it can send over IR and then re-translate that back into something that the machine can understand is that's where your overhead comes through. And why is it 5%? That's retarded. That should be 5% for something so stupid and simple. I honestly think it's a power. It comes down to the power source and the fact that the new one, since it's built in, it's not going to drain from the same power source. I really think that's what it comes down to. Alright, one other thing I want to say on Smash for the 3DS. If for whatever reason you haven't bought it yet, I know some of you are holding off for Pay Day or whatever the case may be, keep in mind you will have to grab an update before you can actually play the game. There is a patch out there. You have to patch to 1.0.2. That will allow you to play online, I should say, because technically if your 3DS never goes online, the game will never know it needs a patch. But you will have to get this patch to play online. So you can do that by, you can actually go into the eShop on the 3DS and grab the patch now. You don't need the game to get the patch and that will get some of you guys ahead of the game. So check that out if you think you will be picking up Smash Bros. in the coming days. So, there you go. I hope you guys are having fun with Smash Bros., those of you that do have the game. So even though I said I'm not so sure about the system and so forth, I still think it's, I mean, you can't say you don't get your money's worth out of this game. That's for sure. So there's a lot there. Alright, let's move on to our gaming weeks and what type of video games we've been playing this week, I suppose besides Smash Bros., to sort of establish our frame of reference on what we're up to in the gaming world. DarkSakura, how about you? Well, I did get Smash Bros. I haven't played it yet. I played Final Fantasy 14. I played some Mass Effect. I tried playing this puzzle game on Steam. I forgot what it was called but it sucked, so I stopped playing it. And I played some Fractal because I miss playing Fractal, make Blooms not war. Fractal's really good. And then I've also been playing a lot of Moonlight Mahjong at work during lunch. It's actually ridiculously fun because it makes my brain do things. Is it actual Mahjong or is it like that old, like the Solitaire Mahjong, like that game Shanghai? Remember like in the early, late 90's like every computer had Shanghai. It's single player Mahjong puzzles. It's the whole like moving the tiles? Okay, yeah. Well, you don't move them around, you just pick the matches. Yeah, but it has to be like certain rules, right? Like you can only move the tiles left or right to get them off the board. You can't move them up and down. Something like that. You just click on them. I know, but you can't click on any tile. No, some of them you can only move the ones off the sides or at the top. You can only click tiles that are fully exposed, I believe. That's it, something like that. Like one or two times playing Mahjong. Yeah, I mean, it's got the rules in it but you just click them and they go. And it makes my brain not hurt anymore. And things. Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week? I only really played a little bit of Call of Duty multiplayer 2 because we finally did our game night again. And then just worked on my game. That was pretty much it. I'm probably going to play some more stuff. I want to get a next gen system. It's just you know, having enough extra money and having a job to do that. Well, by the way, thank you for bringing that up because I wanted to at some point in the show congratulate you. You got a job. Yeah. Already. So, I mean, that's amazing. Congratulations. I just don't start yet. So, you know. You have a little gap before you start. You have a little gap. Hey, you know what? Like a month gap, not nearly as bad. Dude, Alan was out of work for like a year and a half before he found something. And a lot of people faced hard times like that. So, you know what? Enjoy the time off to work on your game. Yeah. Hopefully. I'm still going to be applying for stuff. I still have interviews and stuff. In fact, I'm doing a couple phone interviews tomorrow. Make them fight over you. Yeah. Whoever's going to offer me the most money. So, that's really what it comes down to. There you go. It's almost something I want to do. So, I'm going to be doing that. But, yeah. I worked on my game a little bit more. Still working on the editor. I'm almost done with it because I was just trying to get a few tools too. Because the editor's done as far as what I needed for building like ships and the smaller things. But, if I were to use that same editor for building like a whole level, it would take forever. So, I needed to build like basically tools that we would see since it's voxel based. Similar tools you would see like in World Build or something like that in Minecraft. Where it's really fast. Where you can just design stuff really fast with brushes and all sorts of things. So, that's what I was coming up with for my game right now. So, I'm working on that so I can finish actually start building some of the assets for the game. And that's pretty much it. I'm almost done with that one. I finally start working on it some more. Hopefully get something that I can actually show. Once the editor's done. Alright. Can't wait to see it. Let's see. My gaming week. I played a lot of the same stuff that you've heard me talk about before. Theatrythm. Because Smash didn't come out until Friday. So, early in the week I was like, must play more Theatrythm. And I played a whole lot more. I even did some DLC. They released the Mooglemog song from Final Fantasy XIV in Theatrythm. And I love that song. And then I had to get Crazy Chocobo. And I dedicate that to you Acteft. Crazy Chocobo from Final Fantasy XIII-2 which is the heavy metal version of the Chocobo theme that is very divisive in people's opinions. And let's see. What else did I play this week? I played more Diablo 3. I'm working on a hardcore seasonal character. And I beat story mode. And I'm all the way to level 52. And last night I got very daring. Because it's a hardcore character, right? So, I play it very conservative. Because in hardcore, once you die, you die. Like it's done. Your character is done. You have to start over from the very beginning. So, I've been playing on normal. Like easy, normal, not amping it up difficulty. But last night I said you know what? I'm feeling a little risky. Now that I've beaten the story mode at least once, I'm gonna play a little risky. So I amped up the difficulty one notch to hard. And it was definitely harder and kept me on my toes. I had an oh shit moment. But luckily my character is still alive. Junior Mintz, my hunter. Demon Hunter is still alive. I named him after a box of candy that was sitting on my desk when I made him. So there you go. Junior Mintz is now level 52. And let's see. Other games I played this week. I played Final Fantasy 14 of course. Because I play a lot of that. And Destiny. That's the other one. I played more Destiny. I hit level 20 in Destiny. And that ridiculous where you have to get gear that has light on it to level up. I really think that's the most redonkulous thing I've heard. Level up a character past level cap. But whatever. I'm up to level 21 now. I'm like three quarters of the way through level 21 just praying I can get a good loot drop to level up my stupid character. I don't understand why it's called a level cap if you can level up past it. Because without the gear you'll never level past it. It's all gear based. Yeah I know. I can't stand it. I think it's ridiculous design flaw. But that's my opinion. Not everybody is going to agree with me. Hey Rob. I finally got around to naming my chocobo. Did you? Hot Wings. Hot Wings is the name in Final Fantasy 14 right? My chocobo's name is Hot Wings. Good times. Good times. So yeah. Then I was playing Destiny. And I've done like some random online stuff with that. Including like doing some strikes with like Shane and Extifer. Or my friend Ian from Koopa Club. You know. Whoever is on and can do stuff. We will do that. Dungeon Buster in chat says 20 is the soft cap and the hard cap is 30. And then Alan letting everybody know about this. That I did a live stream of Final Fantasy 14 this week and I got him to agree to do hunts. And he got so mad he was real real mad. That is accurate. Alan was like let's do a hunt. And I hate hunts in Final Fantasy 14. I think they're ridiculous. I think they're way too much of a necessity for people to do to hit the cap if that's what they want. And I think they made they made them way too powerful. And they're just a joke. Because everybody just cluster fucks the mob and the thing is dead in like 5 seconds. You got like 60 people attacking this one thing. And yeah. So they called it out like oh here's where the mob is. I ran to the wrong coordinates. On accident. And so I was like 10 10 squares away on the map or whatever. So as I'm running to the right location the mob's already dead. Like literally I walk into the screen to see that the mob just died. And I'm just like you know what? Fuck hunts. And I logged out. And that was the end of my livestream. But I don't have anger issues or anything. I actually get to make a hunt tomorrow. For what? For treasure hunting. Sorry. Oh. Oh that. Oh that's different. Yeah. Treasure hunts are different. I'm okay with the treasure hunts. Alright. Let us take care of a few housekeeping things. I have a couple things to mention. We will not be here live on October 19th. That's two weeks from tonight. The reason why I will be at speaking of all this Final Fantasy talk. I will be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest. And if I get to talk to Yoshida-san I'm gonna say hunts suck. So. But I love your game. I love your game so much. That one part. Since I'm not playing Final Fantasy 14 do they do any of like the cool like holiday stuff that they did in 11? I got a bikini. Yeah they do. Cause my favorite was that tree. The very first one that they did with the tree that you couldn't kill because there was a bug in it. And so you just keep wailing on it and it's like it just wouldn't die. They don't have like a killer tree but they'll do like quests and you get rewards like usually their costumes. Some of the end game. I've noticed that some of the end game holidays tend to be referencing back to some Japanese holidays as well as Western holidays. Yeah. So we're getting sort of the best of both. Like didn't they do something for Golden Week? Or they did the Midsummer thing didn't they? They did the Midsummer thing for sure. Yeah. So. Yeah. Um. But uh. You should you should come play with us. One of us. Alright. Do the thing. So we will not be here in two weeks live although we're hoping to have something on the feet. Yes. Bodies. That might be a busy week for a lot of us. So we will not be here October 19th. Um. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Follow us on YouTube. We're also on YouTube. Orange Lounge Radio. And also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. And Google Plus. Google.com slash Plus. Orange Lounge Radio. Before I get into news. Before I get to our interview with Farsight Studio. I also want to talk about some stuff that our pal Bobby Blackwolf is up to. Speaking of interviews. It's raining interviews here at VOG and we love it. And Bobby has some of his own going on. In fact next week on his show. That's October 12th. He's going to have Kyle Pittman who's the creator of the recently released Super Win the Game. Kyle used to be with Gearbox Software. He worked on Borderlands 2 and now he's Indie. Also this is interesting because Bobby has some ties in with Kyle Pittman. He's never actually spoken to him. However he's one half of the brothers that made the game that Bobby did a soundtrack for in 99. So this is an interesting reunion of sorts. Even though they've never actually met. So that will be a fun interview. So check that out next week on Bobby's show. He is of course live before us here at the Voice of the Geese Network. VOGnetwork.com Now tonight he wasn't live. He had an interview from Siege with Snarfquest Tales and this is based on the comic series by Larry Elmore who I know Dar Sockra is a big fan of. Oh hell yeah. Dragon Lance. I thought for a second there that it might have something to do with the character from Thundercats. Wasn't it? No not in this case. Not in this case. But yeah you can check out the interview on Bobby's show. You can also check out the game itself if you want. Snarfquesttales.com So check that out. And oh my gosh the interviews don't stop and we are so excited because here at Orange Lounge Radio we actually have another interview planned for next week and this is pretty cool because this is some Indie stuff going on. But we will have Bodhi from Lunar Ray Games on the show next week live. They're making a game called Time Spinner and it's a Metroidvania type of game with some really cool like retro looks to it. This game was on Kickstarter and did very well on Kickstarter. So we're going to check in and see how the game's coming along and see what folks can look forward to with that. And we will have him on live next week. So the 12th is going to be a very busy night Sunday nights here at VOG. Alright let's get into tonight however with some gaming news. Loke you want to start us off with some news. Yes. When I'm not eating waffle fries I read the news. Waffle fries are pretty damn good. They're pretty good. So thanks to I guess a lot of pressure from consumers gamers everywhere. There's been some policy changes now with Twitch including that they now want broadcasters that are broadcasting stuff with you know sponsorship from you know a company basically to be transparent about that. So if you're getting paid to play something on Twitch by that publisher that you say hey this is going to be this is a sponsored broadcast so that people know that it's not just like you know it may not be entirely unbiased I guess if you will. You know they do that like sponsored content I see that sometimes on well you see that on Twitter actually quite a bit. It's sort of like similar like here at VOG when we and we don't get to do a lot of reviews because you know we don't most of our staff makes podcasts so we don't have a whole lot of dedicated writers but like when we do have the chance to review things we always kind of put at the end of it like you know either this was something we bought this was something that was you know we were given a key to you know it's like the acquisition method just to just to make sure everybody understands you know throwing it out there because honestly I think for a lot of people like if it's free versus if it's $60 could sway your opinion one way or the other. Now when you review a game and it was giving you free you're really supposed to ask yourself you know treat it like you paid the $60 for it and is it that value but we still put that out there just to make sure everything you know full disclosure. Well this I think is a little bit more like you know say you follow someone and even I think they were talking about something and this may have even come from YouTube where there's a lot of content streamers out there that oh yeah we have deals with some of these guys where you know we will be in like some sort of you know partnership with this company to do you know they're going to pay us to do let's plays for this game or something and a lot of times they don't disclose that. So this you know is kind of along the lines where you know they want to make sure that it's completely clear that you know you're getting paid to do that. Same goes with Steam. Steam now also thanks to their new curator you know feature on there. Now they also are requiring you to disclose if you're a sponsored curator so like you know if it's a company that's you know putting out a certain game and they have a Steam curation thing that you know hey let you guys know that if you're paying somebody that feature that on their curator I guess curator page so if you basically you know it boils down to if you've accepted money or other compensation for making a product review or posting a recommendation you must disclose this fact for in your recommendation. And also this should not link or link to or promote any stores other than Steam of course you know because they want the sales from their websites list yeah of course so I haven't explored setting that all up like is that something I thought if I set up a curator page would people care? Like I kind of I kind of think you all know my opinions on a lot of games anyway you know. And then honestly I think a lot of well I thought the page was for groups only so like you had to I don't know if like if I could make my own curator page oh it would have to be like a vog yeah I think it has to be a group I thought I don't know I haven't really looked too much into it but I don't know I mean it's good I guess that there's this transparency because that's what a lot of people have been complaining about so you know more power to them I guess. Now before we move on since you brought up YouTube and that too you know one of the stories that I don't think is on our show or otherwise tonight but there was these stories going around a lot of the gaming blogs about how there's people out there that are impersonating celebrity or professional YouTubers for lack of a better term to get free keys for games that they then flip and sell on eBay. Did you read about this? Well they're not even selling them yeah not even just on eBay but like on like other key reseller sites you know some of which have in the past bought the cheap bundle stuff and flip it for you know more money. Yeah I mean it's just unfortunately something you're going to run into I think even not even necessarily just you know just this type of thing but in people impersonating other people but even just like no name people just kind of asking hey can I have a key you know that type of thing and they've kind of in the different stories I read that their advice was you know either A handle it through like a PR firm or something like that B you know handle it through like if it's you're getting requests from different YouTube guys that you follow up or have them make that request via like a message through YouTube you know send them like a you know a private message or whatever through YouTube that way you can you know say OK this is actually from this person not just someone impersonating them. So I mean that makes sense. Unfortunately you know when you're you know sending out emails or letting people know PR and stuff that hey you know if you want to review this game I can get you a key for it and stuff and unfortunately people want handouts you know they want free stuff so they're going to do whatever they can to manipulate the system. Well it's not even the it's not even the free stuff it's the people that turn them around and resell them on these on these code sites and so forth like it's more than that it's stolen goods basically. Yeah crazy. Yeah because I read it was I forget what game it was but it was he'd actually saw it was available on this one site he's like well that's weird because I haven't even released it you know other than you know these reviewers so houses on it. Yeah the code. Yeah. Yeah. So wow. Yeah. That's that's pretty pretty bad that people are you know singing that low to do that. But you know it's I'm not completely surprised by it. And now just quickly to answer the curator question in our chatroom. Actf says a friend of mine set up his own curator page so yeah you can make your own. Groups have curator pages made by default so that might be. So VOG has its own curator page now but nobody has done recommendations since it's only for group admins. Oh I didn't know that that was a thing. But again like I don't know like what we would do because we're really about like a variety of games like should we do a list of these are games that got a B or better review on VOG or yeah I don't know I don't know what we do so I think for now it'll stay blank. I don't know. I kind of feel like if you want to know our thoughts on games check out the podcast. But maybe we can think of a use for it. Well hey hey I know we can do we can just wait for you know Aaron to port over you know bungee ferret tossing. There you go. So once bungee ferret tossing makes us esteem it'll just be our list of one game you need to check out. Oh there you go. Absolutely I'm all for that. Alright well here's a game a lot of people want to check out but some people are very frustrated by the number of systems that it's on. Jamie you want to jump in here? I just remember the other game I played. Oh my gosh why? Hot to Full Boyfriend which I would totally give recommendations for since it's on Steam. Speaking of streaming and all that right? Yeah. Alright. I don't know why I didn't think about it. Well I have a feeling you're going to dig this game to Dark Sakura if you ever get a chance to play it. You might have to come over here. Does it include dating pigeons? Actually it might. And it would be here at my house for sure because I actually have the Wii U so you could play Bayonetta 2 which yeah see a lot of folks looking forward to that and I know I'm looking forward to this too. Hideki Kamiya who's with Platinum Games one of the producers there has reiterated to fans this week that you know other publishers turned down Bayonetta 2 only Nintendo stepped in to help. That's bullshit. I'm sorry. I haven't even read the damn quote yet. I'm sorry. Sit down. I think I've discussed this many times before but here goes. First of all, we, Platinum Games are developers and receive support from publishers by making games that they request or suggest. As for Bayonetta we developed the game after signing a deal with Sega. Later it was decided to also develop the sequel so we started working on Bayonetta 2. When development had progressed to a certain degree and Sega's situation had turned into this isn't a good plan so development halted temporarily. Without funding we didn't have the possibility to continue development but we wanted to get this partially developed Bayonetta 2 available to public one way or another so we offered it to various publishers but as it is a big title we couldn't find a partner company. Finally Bayonetta 2 is about to get terminated completely when Nintendo came in and lent a hand we were able to restart the development we so desired. Finally the game was released last week in Japan so five years we were able to make Bayonetta 2 available to the public. Knowing those circumstances if someone is still angry for heading towards Nintendo I wonder what's the reason for that? Wouldn't you tell me in a way that's easy to understand? As I have said earlier if you want Bayonetta 2 on PS4 or Xbox One how about trying to ask Nintendo? If Nintendo doesn't say yes it's not going to happen. While you're at it try asking for Mario and Zelda 2. Ooh! Somebody's somebody had carried a little whip with that comment but he's right in a way. But Loki you claim shenanigans. I claim shenanigans because there's companies like Axes Games that will fucking pay to have almost anything localized. I mean just ridiculous niche games. This isn't a matter of localization though. Localization is way cheaper than development. There's a big difference. I don't think Axes Games has quite the pockets. Now maybe Atlas but maybe that's somebody that was approached we don't know. Or here's another thing. Fucking self-publish on PS4 or Xbox One. You can do that you know. You don't need a publisher. But who pays for the development? You can't say oh I'll pay you when we're done. Like you can't do that. You have to pay these people as the game is development. Who's going to pay for that? Kickstarter it. Well okay. Now that could be an option. Now we could Kickstarter it. But I think when this game was being developed that really hadn't gone through yet. So I don't know Loki. Hold out hope for Bayonetta 3. I hope they make their money back on you know. I hope they do too. On this game cause it's not looking good so far. Let me put it that way. It's going to really suck if they invested so much into this game and it doesn't end up making that money back. I just hope the Wii U audience doesn't limit them. I hope Bayonetta and Smash can kinda exist together. I just think they develop on PC and it gets ported to the Wii U. I mean they don't develop on a Wii U. It's just something they test on. It's developed on PC. It's fucking apparently really easy to port over to the PlayStation. I would imagine it's gotta be pretty easy to port on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One being that they're more powerful systems. But he's right. Nintendo paid for it. It's Nintendo's game. Nintendo will have to be the one to put it on the PC. Will Nintendo do that? I mean they could. I mean I just don't think Nintendo will cause they're kinda stubborn like that. It's like you'd have better luck getting a Mario game on the PC. They're not a company like Microsoft where oh Halo 2 had a PC version. You know. Well I guess it's just gonna just sell like you know Mad World did where you know it's a great game and you know both Platinum games and you know more power to them but unfortunately it's just not something that's gonna sell a lot of copies. Or let's do crazy internet forum speak. Let's do crazy wank theories that people come up with like oh oh this is what's gonna happen. Oh oh you guys you guys this is what's gonna happen. This is what's gonna happen. Okay okay you guys. Apple's gonna buy Nintendo and then Bayonetta 2 will be on the Mac. That's cause Apple and Nintendo they have to be in bed together. That's right. Apple and Nintendo they're like the same. Like Nintendo is like Apple in Japan. That's what's gonna happen. Loki that's what's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. Well first off you know first off there's not a lot of games on them you know you know the Mac anyways but I mean I don't know. I could see them maybe putting out something for like you know another you know iPad or something like that. I mean cause they're really pushing you know gaming. Is there a Bayonetta on the fucking iPad? Like it's just it doesn't. Why they've got like what is it Infinity Blade on the fucking iPad? I just don't see it. You know it's an action game I mean I don't know. I don't know. I'm I'm looking forward very much to checking out Bayonetta 2. I have a Wii U. This isn't a problem for me. It's the Xbox One exclusives that are bugging me right now like Forza Horizon 2. Oh yeah. I wanted to play that shit. No yeah exactly. Forza Horizon 2 I totally want that. Alright. Uh Moving on. Dark Soccer. What do you have for us? Uh we do have uh something a new game coming out but not new new new new. It's uh Star Wars Arcade Machine is gonna be coming out. Yes. They uh it's gonna be uh uh premiered at New York Comic Con and Namco Bandai will be bringing out the new Star Wars Arcade. It's uh totally coin op so very surprising but I guess if they say it can be done it can be done. Prequels aren't in it right? I don't think so. But they said um there is a press unveiling on October 8th so we're not gonna see it until it's actually out so who knows. What kind of game is it though? What does it say? Is it gonna be like well I mean they seem to do these Star Wars arcade games pretty regularly like you know there's the old school Atari vector one right and then they had that one not that long ago well actually probably yeah it was a long time ago like 10 years at this point which was like the right when the prequels were probably like big where you like you had the big lightsaber thing the pod racer game was kind of okay. Stick in the middle that you would like fight lightsaber battles with. It was kind of neat. I think the only good thing that ever came out of the prequels was the pod racer game. Yeah. That was kind of fun. Other than that. And the new Star Tours. Like believe it or not when you go to Jar Jar Binks' planet that's like the best one. I know I know bite my tongue but seriously that's the best. That was the one that made me jump. Yeah. That ending. Yeah. I finally got Hoth did I tell you. Did you? Yeah. It took me forever to get Hoth. Hoth is cool. Hoth was the best. Literally. It is. It's literally cool. It's cold. Anyway. You know who else is cool. These guys who like to drop into OLR occasionally and they're back with us tonight. They snuck into the studio through the door and came back to say hi for another week but I'm glad they're here. Welcome back you guys from the big yes the big anime game room. Did I give that out of order? Anyway. Jonas and Diego are back tonight. Did I say that right? Hello. I think it's the big ass game anime room. The big ass game room? No it's the big anime game room. Is it the big ass game room? Some people in this room like ass an awful lot. Sounds like room for future development. We got another A in there I guess. Big ass ass. That's right. Big ass anime. So how you guys doing? We're doing good. How are you doing? How are things? Good. You missed us talking about Smash. Have you guys checked out the new Smash on 3DS yet? I've been trying to keep up on it right now and people are figuring out stuff left and right. Even when the demo was out people were just figuring out things but as they unlock more characters they're just figuring out that some of these characters are somewhat broken from what I heard. Uh oh. They're breaking the game as we speak right now. It's only been out for a couple of days now and people had just a few tournaments locally around here and people were saying things. I'm seeing people who are appearing that I've never seen in my life that play games that are winning. Wait they're already having tournaments and this game came out on Friday? Yes they are. What the hell? Yeah I had a couple of locals in some of the comic stores around here and uh yeah it's been pulling crowds. Oh my gosh. Just on Saturday there was a big one in San Jose in the GameStop and it pulled enough. You literally would have like 30 hours to prepare for this. Oh my god. You know somebody was like Red Bull Red Bull just in my veins. They just want to get Did Loki just get up to go get a Red Bull? Oh my god. Product placement. They're just trying to unlock everything and figure out the game as fast as they can. It's still relatively new so like it's anyways game right now. Okay I'm struggling to unlock characters because I'm just really bad at Smash okay? And what the hell did they do to Meta Knight? Oh my god. Meta Knight used to be my go to. Like I understand he was like so unbalanced like he was banned in tournaments and shit but like now he does this like torpedo shit. That just means he's bad ass and you need to buff up everybody else. Right? You know what Dan said yesterday? Huh. You know I miss Jigglypuff. Uh Jigglypuff's an unlock. Spoiler alerts. Okay. So you'll get Jigglypuff eventually. Keep playing. But Dan was just like I can't believe he said that. I miss Jigglypuff. Really? What about Snake? Does anyone miss Solid Snake being a little bit cause I thought Snake was cool as a character but I understand I understand like why. He's also on the game too. He's an unlock. Snake is in the new game as well. No. I thought he was like a DLC or something like supposedly. No. He's either one of the two. They said he was gonna be in this game. I think he was on a list for supposed DLC so but I do not believe he's an unlock in the base roster. Yeah I'm pretty sure cause you wouldn't you wouldn't have a third party character. They already have the whole game unlocked in Japan I thought already. Yeah no I don't think Snake is in there. Sonic is though. Which you know that was cool to have him back. Are his legs normal sized? Or is that like you know a pallet swap where you can adjust the size of his legs. No his legs are not. Act F says the last unlock is Jigglypuff. There you go. Kaijuto in chat says Wii Fit Trainer kicks ass and Little Mac. I like all the different skins you can do because like with Little Mac you can like have the wire frame with Little Mac from the old school punch out. Like did anybody play punch out in the arcades like back in the day before it was an NES game? Like it was a big wire frame character he used to play as. So I thought that was really cool. Yeah that was a nice feature they did there. Yeah I love that. And Bowser Jr. I didn't know this until Shane was telling me about it. You can cycle through and Bowser Jr. all the pallet swaps are all of the Koopa kids with Bowser Jr.'s moves. So you can play every single one of them. That's amazing. And spoiler I'm totally glad that Rob the Robot is back. Yes. That was a fun character to play as. It is, it is. So I just found a fun screenshot that I will link in the chat room of everyone who made the cast of King of the Hill as Mies. Oh as Mies. What the hell does that have to do with what we're talking about? Oh it's in Smash Bros. It's Mies. I saw one with RuPaul's Drag Race characters as Mies. And I thought that was great. Someone had a Neil deGrasse Tyson. Nice. I saw a doctor. Doctor Who. So I thought that was pretty cool. Jonas how about you? Have you been playing Smash at all? I haven't gotten Smash yet because I'm just waiting for the Wii U version. I know everyone says get the 3DS version. But again the 3DS I have is actually my fianc\u00e9's. And it's mainly for her Pokemon plays. Because she's been playing more Pokemon competitively because of the upcoming regionals. I actually think that's an okay perspective. Not everybody's going to agree with me but I also kind of put it out there during my little review of it. As I said the biggest problem with Smash Bros. is the platform that it's on. Honestly. It's too much for the 3DS. And I think it'll be great on the Wii U. For me this is like a demo for the Wii U version. Don't get me wrong. Yes it's in the 3DS version. But I think this is just an opinion based. I think in terms of processing power it was designed mainly for the new Nintendo 3DS. Yeah. I mean this thing pushes the limits of the 3DS and kind of then some. Honestly it pushes it beyond because you can't even do Miiverse with it. So. That's sad that we're already at the limits of this system what? A couple years from its release? It's been longer than you think. I think 3DS has been out like what? 5 years now I want to say? No. 4. Maybe 4. 2010, 2011 I think. Maybe 2010. About 4 years. So. It was after well because I bought my 3DS after I was living at the house so it would have been 2009 or after 2009 so it would have been 2010 or later. Yeah. But yeah. I mean technology is a rapidly evolving industry. I mean look at a lot of phones. Like you know a lot of people talk about like the Apple like the iOS doesn't run on you know certain older phones and the same thing happens on Android you can't run the new Kit Kat or whatever they call them. Little candy bar platforms on certain older Android devices like they just they have to be refreshed every few years. I'm really looking forward to the 3DX XL that's coming out on October 10th that's the old school NES controller. I have mixed feelings on that because I so like what bogs me about is that they didn't change the inside at all like they did with the advanced SP that looked like the NES so the outside just kind of looks like somebody put a sticker on it you know. That's the only but I love my retro NES too don't get me wrong but it's just I wish they'd done a little more with it. The only thing else that just kind of applies to is that the box that comes with it looks like the regular NES that's about all they just kind of add it to that so you have the controller which is the actual console itself and the box that's the NES. That's kind of cool. That part's cool. Alright well we're going to move on with some news but by all means guys chime in as you hear things in the news you want to comment on so let's move on with some more news. Loki. Sorry I was checking my progress on Clicker Heroes because I haven't played it in a week. I saw at least two people on Twitter like say God damn it Loki why did you have to bring up that game? So I have was it uh yeah I can't even I don't even know where was it 2.56 tillion it's earned in gold. You made that word up. Let's go. There's a key on the side because like I'm like I don't even know so yeah whatever. Okay so this is kind of related to what we were just talking about with Star Wars. Yeah I know we went kind of on the Smash Brothers route there but apparently Disney has pulled a few Star Wars games off of the iOS and Google Play stores and Windows Store can't forget Windows. Yeah you can. Yeah that's like I was talking about my phone sucking the other day and my wife's like well she's like well I have a new phone. I'm like you have a Windows phone. It doesn't do anything. Okay like have you used your phone to use Facebook. No it makes calls. I'm like yeah that's about all this. Alright so anyways so Star Wars assault team has been removed. It was a free to play game and was it I guess they're focusing now on Star Wars Commander but the one I was kind of disappointed with is Nimblebits Tiny Death Star was removed and the best part about it is they didn't even fucking tell Nimblebit oh hey we removed your game. That was nice. That's that's so crazy. I actually have Tiny Death Star. I downloaded that because you know Tiny Tower was kind of cool. Um you know I got a little I kind of was over it after a couple days of play but for a free game you know it entertained me for a while but I'm very surprised especially with such a tie in like that with Tiny Tower they got rid of it. Why would you remove that? They want to focus on this Star Wars Commander what the new one is called. That's the one they want to focus on. But it's not even the same type of game. I know it's weird isn't it? Like you know casual like you know moms and stuff are probably not going to play Star Wars Commander I mean well well I don't know because Star Wars Commander apparently is doing insanely well. Like and a lot of good feedback on the game you know and so forth so I Is it like you know Smurf Village or I haven't played it myself so I can't really comment on it but I've just I see a lot about it on Facebook so anyways um yeah so they basically basically said hey we're very disappointed to see Tiny Earth Star shuttered in less than a year after launch. We had no prior knowledge that the game was going to be removed and no longer even have a contract with Disney after recent layoffs. Suffice to say I guess if you're looking to partner with Disney this might not be the partnership you're looking for. Wow shady shade. So uh well you know what. Well earned advice. Well uh no Tiny Disneyland coming to your phones anytime soon I'm sure. Dude see that would have been awesome. Right. That would have been awesome. That would have been so awesome. Maybe like um I don't know Jurassic Park's coming out pretty soon you know Tiny Jurassic Park I don't know. Tiny Velociraptor It's like you bred Tiny Raptors Oh my god Tiny Dinos that would be funny Dungeon Buster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I should check on my Tiny Death Star and see how it's doing. Well someone might have blown it up apparently and that might have been Disney. Just flew an X-Winger. Just blew the damn thing up. Alright anyhow uh moving on. A follow up to something we were talking about in a previous week. The Wii U is going to be getting a Minecraft clone or two and the developer yeah the developer behind the Minecraft clone on the Wii U which is apparently called Ucraft is Nexus Games that is. You guys laughing over there at that name? Yeah yeah What's that Jonas? That company sounds familiar. Nexus No no not that Nexus Games Nexus with an I Nexus with an I Games No not the good Nexus Games Hold on. Hold on. Jonas may be a fan of Brick Blast U which is on the Nintendo eShop Ok wrong game. That's fine. Wrong company But they are working on Ucraft for the Wii U and uh yeah saying it could arrive for the Nintendo eShop before Christmas. Don't have that set in stone however so uh that is in development however that's not the only one being made. Stone Shire is also in development by the two man team over at Finger Gun Games which if you think about it though I mean you know one guy kind of made the original Minecraft so two people making a clone I guess would make sense. Uh so there it is. Apparently this game will have dwarves elves, hobbits and goblins roaming the land. So just because we call it a Minecraft clone doesn't mean it is actually like a clone it might have its own stuff and this sounds like it may have some extra kind of stuff in it so you know don't write off these games just because we're calling the Minecraft clones. They might end up being actually kind of cool but we won't really know until we see more about them. Well we can call it Minecraft-like like we do roguelikes Sure I like that. Minecraft-like Craft-like. Craft-like. Now it sounds like we're talking about cheese like they're craft singles or anyways. It's not real cheese. That's like cheese food. That's what cheese eats. Let me put it this way okay and I not to throw shade because you know indie developers and stuff but if you look at the other games that this guy that Nexus has made that like that game that's on there it looks really uh low production quality. I mean don't get me wrong I understand it's a unity game and stuff but it looks like they like kicked that out in maybe a week like spent no time on it and seeing how many tutorials there are out there that make voxel like games. Hell I'm making a voxel like game but it's not necessarily going to be a voxel game just I use it to build my models because I can't fucking I can't 3D model for shit but I can build with Legos so hey let's do that. So uh it's pretty easy to you know to build one of these things and there's a lot of tutorials out there so all you would have to do is build something for the Wii U get a dev kit and port it over. Unity does the porting for you. All you really got to do is sign up for Nintendo and get fucking dev kit to test it on that's it and just looking at this I mean it's got well the the other one had the default you know standard asset you know skybox and default shaders it really looks like it was thrown together in a few days so but hey you know what though um there will be better games out there I mean look at the xbox indie games there was how many minecraft clones a ton of fucking minecraft clones and you know what it's not a bad idea to do that because they made a ton of money they weren't great but people want to play minecraft so badly if that's their only option they're going to fucking buy it so they're going to make tons of money even if it's absolute shit well let's hope it's not though I hope I hope it's good turn out pretty decent we'll kind of want to make a minecraft clone but not right now uh act deaf in chat says the trailer for you craft is hilariously awful the game looks okay but oh god the trailer they have a trailer apparently and kaijuto and chat says survival craft on the tablet is awesome so you know there's some clones that people people dig I mean uh the one I was playing you see what I did there dig because it's minecraft I think it was a castle maker her and that was like a buck on indie games and it was it was fun it was a minecraft game with guns I mean the graphics weren't great but it was just kind of something to mess around with cool guns all right uh one more story and then we'll get to some release dates star sakura well you know I never remembered if it was west one or west stone I always thought was west one but the company that created wonder boy is filing for bankruptcy uh after 30 years of being in business since 1986 which is hard to think of the 80s as being 30 years ago um but basically they have uh filed for bankruptcy um they actually uh the the wonder boy series was actually adapted into uh the nes adventure island so if you don't remember too much about and don't forget about you know wonder boy in monster world um you could actually play in the sega vintage collection monster world so it's a sad day we're sorry to see them go I I actually used to love adventure island when I was younger and like I was actually good at those type of games and uh I'll give a shout out to my pal uh jeremy over at uh the koopa club podcast was doing some uh youtubes and and uh livestreams of adventure island he was talking about that wonder boy connection I was like oh yeah that's right the games were related and I never like you don't really realize that as a kid but like it's kind of cool to hear those connections now but very sad to hear about um them shutting down I think I've covered two of the wonder boy games for a classic game you probably have but that would imply that I have some type of memory or you know the sequels were on the master system sega genesis turbo graphics 16 or as it was in japan the pc engine uh there was uh in japan only there was a monster world complete collection of the ps2 and then like I said there was a sega vintage collection monster world uh dark tetsuya and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says man I loved wonder boy 3 the dragons trap or dragons curse on pc engine turbo graphics so yeah I'm legit sad frowny well I mean there's always what virtual console and so forth for those right I think uh wonder boy 3 had come out for those at some point I thought I saw that I could be wrong so alright well uh let's travel around the world and check out some releases and some games that are coming out very soon on a store shelf near you as we start to ramp up towards the busiest season of the year yes uh october is definitely one of the biggest months of the year um so starting this week we've got actually hey it finally came out drive club on uh playstation 4 will be coming out and of course to go along with that they've got that with its I don't know if you'd call it free version but the playstation plus version has some of the tracks uh nbh the bear the starter edition let's say cause like a starter in a car the starter edition possibly you could do piecemeal edition because they're gonna have like you know where you can buy content for it and then or if you want buy the full game um so they've got that coming out this week and then also um alien isolation on playstation 4 xbox 360 playstation 3 and xbox one uh tenkai knights brave battle on 3ds uh nba 2k15 on playstation 3 xbox 360 playstation 4 xbox one and pc uh oh and also I guess uh alien isolation was also on pc um the disc version I'm not sure if this is the only way you can get this cause I thought this was free to play but project spark on xbox one is coming out um I guess that's a disc version of the game although I thought it was free to play so I thought so too I don't know maybe it's extra content or something uh minecraft playstation 4 editions getting its disc based version coming out this week uh they're doing a re-release of dead rising 3 the apocalypse edition on xbox one and also the rise son of rome legendary edition on xbox one sorry to butt in but with minecraft releasing on playstation 4 you have microsoft releasing a game on ps4 so hey hey bayonetta fans anything's possible never lose hope well technically that was already in the works so yeah uh let's see and uh finally forza motorsports 5 racing or is it the game of the year edition on xbox one so a lot of re-releases there and that would be it I thought there was more games this week but I guess that's it well let's travel over to japan and check out what's coming out there on the playstation 4 drive club releases for them as well and fifa 15 this week in japan as well also that white playstation 4 makes its way to japan this week all on october 9th the xbox one will also see the release of fifa 15 and the project spark starter pack so maybe I'm thinking it's like what you said like a disc version with maybe some uh things included with it that you would buy otherwise uh over on the playstation 3 this week in japan also fifa 15 can you tell that it's gonna be out for everything and uh some major price reductions on the tales of series so you want graces f or vesperia or even zilia 2 which has been out in japan a little longer than it has been here those are all going into playstation 3 the best series so uh now's a good time to cap on that if you'd like uh on the xbox 360 this week yes there is a release and guess what it's fifa 15 because you know soccer uh on the wii u this week yep uh over on the vita this week in japan we have uh fifa 15 flowers uh and senju no nb excuse me nbu kyoku comes out this week what is it because that's in regular and limited edition uh and that is i have no idea what game this is this looks like it's based off a manga maybe maybe it's some type of like a little adventure game or we'll just say it's a dating sim i know you do i said i don't know and then now on the 3ds this week uh choco ken no chocoto fushigi na monogatari shokora hime no mahouto recipe gazoon type thank you this is um what is this like cooking with my little animal friends what is oh no they look like little pikachus but they're food they're like like it's a carrot chew and a mushroom chew and and and a little is that a vile plume or a radish i guess it's a radish chew and they all do cute things you cook them up in the yes yeah i just want to i just want to eat them it's the whole pikmin thing in a blender well there you go somehow i don't think that's a game that's coming over here but if it does delicious uh dark sakura how about uh for you is cannibalism delicious rob where you eat the flesh of living things so on the 7th of october we have alien isolation on everything just about on the 8th we have drive club on ps4 9th is final fantasy 13 for pc and on the 10th is uh ocubus trip undead and undressed and nba 2k15 undead and undressed undead and undressed in order to find the witches and i think it's witches or vampires you have to fight them and undress them so that they're it's vampires that's right because they have to expose their their body parts to the sun in order to um stop the vampires ps3 and ps vita brilliant brilliant it came out already over here at the beginning of august oh my god that's awesome we also have project spark which i misread as project spank hahaha that'd be a better game uh rise son of rome on pc and skylanders trap team on a bunch of stuff sleeping dogs definitive edition on ps4x bone and pc so with project spark you know i don't know if it's officially out already or if it's coming out this um tuesday time to penis what do you think you know how long before we get like how long to unlock all the the stuff needed to well i'm telling you there's a very good chance that the time to penis is actually going to be very short being that conquer is in the game so this is going to be a very short one do you guys know uh from from the uh big anime game room do you know about our time to penis estimations i don't know if you know this but any game that allows you any type of creativity we always ask the question how long till somebody puts a penis in it so that's probably around the time when picto chat came out and people were drawing penises all over the place literally they should have just called it penis chat right it wasn't a well obviously it was just part of the system but it wasn't a game but yeah that was just being thrown all over the place especially going to conventions people were just passing around pictures and sending them to each other that looked like penises the closest uh private part yeah or you know they they had that game ping pals it was just ping pals that's all it was you know do you ever remember reading vg cats yes i've heard of them and they had the optimus prime versus megatron picto chat that was pretty funny did they show penis yes i think i don't remember but it was basically them just going back that's what picto chat was for at least you know picked it or was it uh was it ping pals it's better than like tinder pals or something like that tinder pals just a bunch of like little picto chat penises come up on the screen swipe left swipe left ooh swipe right a lot of other common things i saw with like a bell spout and they tried to put the penis in the mouth it was pretty bad i don't know what they were doing with pokemon at the time that's what they're doing that's what they're doing in smash brothers picture mode right now is like you know let's see how many sexual positions we can put these characters in anyway a couple more gaming stories for you guys than the classic game of the week back to a simpler time in gaming before you all filthied it up with your dicks alright hey hey hey we had custers revenge that's true alright uh loki alright um so this is a little disappointing but unfortunately there has been some layoffs at rovio they're cutting 130 jobs to as they put um simplify the company they went towards a simplified organization as they say it's never easy to consider changes like this but it's better to do them um sooner rather than later when we're in a good place to reignite growth so in other words they're not making as much money as they used to they need to cut jobs in order to be able to stay i guess in the black i'm thinking maybe like angry birds just probably maybe got like too big i don't know if that makes sense but like you know uh they have all these spin off games and angry birds is on like like all these different platforms and maybe maybe it just became too diluted like because when they talk about the whole like trying to bring it dark sakura stop showing pictures of picto chat one time time i mean they have angry birds transformers they have you know sorry after the conversation she just had it's a funny image in my mind i think wait if it we're talking about rovia here right yeah isn't this the same kind of um effect that happened with zinga where they got so big for a short time then tanked like because new trends come out and they haven't maintained their trends the big difference here though is that i understand why people like angry birds i never understood why people like farmville that's that's the big difference here to me people like angry birds because scorched earth isn't on fucking foam that's why they like angry birds and because gorillas was awesome but you know uh angry birds is a fun game i don't knock it it's a fun game it's a fun time waster but it's just i don't know uh there's only so much of it you can take before it gets kind of boring i guess um you know eventually people are gonna get tired of it and it's maybe just not you know rebranding it or something it's not really doing anything that's like saying offering different skins in minecraft sells more copies of the game maybe it does but i don't think it's gonna make a huge difference i think that's a tough thing for a lot of these mobile developers is that you know you gotta have i think more than one big franchise to really you know get out there you know and i know right now a lot of the focus is on king and candy crush saga but you know what that bubble that bubble's gonna burst someday too maybe not today but you know i think that's that's a huge problem with the mobile market too because at first oh angry birds is one of the one of the first few games out there but now that everybody's doing it yeah i mean no one expected flappy bird of all things to pop out it just popped out at random and people are starting to play the hell out of it that's true sometimes the the fans especially on mobile can be very fickle you know it's it's almost like going viral on youtube like you can't like you know these people all sit in a boardroom we have to do something that will go viral and it's like that's very hard to do like if you don't like put betty white in it or something that's not gonna happen just because you want it to like that has to happen organically yeah because i mean i understand that um like these companies it is the cheapest way to develop games like out there it saves money rather you know how like people develop games for like xbox one ps4 and wii u and all that other consoles and stuff or even pcs where the production might be more expensive for this one but the the problem with i think the mobile market at the moment like with especially with angry birds is that there's too much like way way too much in the market that people have to decide which one's gonna be the best one and it's hard to get noticed like you know when flappy bird was the big thing and you looked at like the top 100 games like 20 of them were flappy burglar like you had flappy miley for fuck's sake like hoop who downloaded flappy miley who are you come out here so i can smack you who did that did you do it i see you you're looking away from me right now you know you do flappy miley no i will twerk you to death wait that sounds really bad actually i maybe i won't wait i'll probably draw another penis on peto chat all right uh one more story for you guys and uh this is um not really good news for nintendo one of their uh big titles possibly being delayed don't we don't have anything official yet but uh and breathe out it's not smash brothers i'm talking about this time but it's captain toad treasure tracker oh and nobody is sad sorry i think some people are a little bit sad but i don't know uh please gamefly of all people which you know rents the games and so forth they changed their captain toad treasure tracker release date from 2014 to march 2015 uh it should be noted that gamefly has a pretty good record of being correct about these sorts of delays uh in the past no they don't oh look at you listen i came from the distribution industry since i'm not fucking working there anymore i love this now now you're gonna become unhinged now you officially don't work there now it's oh man loki's gonna give it all here's the thing here's what it comes down to nintendo probably they they announced stuff by quarter and so they've already announced their ship for fourth quarter it's not on there so they're probably assuming hey we haven't heard anything about this yet we're just gonna move it out of the year that's what i used to do it's like i have a bunch of shit that'd be on the the 31st of december it's all that to be announced fucking dates stuff guess where guess where uh captain toad treasure tracker was yeah i was right there so i just moved the shit you know to clear up my calendar or whatever i'm like because i want my release dates to be nice and clean so if i don't want all this tba shit at the end of the year so i just fucking move it to the next quarter so that's probably what i would do yeah they move shit on hunch a lot of the times they don't move stuff just because you know nintendo told them unless it was an actual release date in march or something and i can see them moving it because it's not that essential of a title it can be put out anytime it's not like oh my god a moment buy a system for treasure no no one's fucking buying a system for that i can also see where nintendo may have a situation where it's like every fucking person in development is fucking making smash happening on the wii u by the holiday we don't give a fuck what has to be pushed back smash is coming out this holiday season i mean you literally could have a situation like that going on right now yeah so i'm just i i think that it's just tba i mean what date did they move into march that's what i want to know no uh it doesn't say okay well then fucking look this up yes because that game it doesn't surprise why they didn't make it as a dlc like add-on to like super mario 3d world well i think people are assuming that all it's going to be is what you saw in 3d world and you know one thing nintendo games are pretty decent at i mean especially looking at again like smash brothers they have depth to them so i think there'll be more to expect in this game than just what you saw like that's the start that's the first world and then you'll have these more power-ups maybe you'll have co-op you know there'll be more to it we just haven't really seen what all that looks like i mean i'm not saying anything about nintendo like how they do things because i know they started changing their policies with like let's let's perfect example super luigi u which technically everyone thinks it's a different game but it's a specialized add-on where they added more like an actual package it's just really good dlc yeah so or even mario kart mario kart 8 where they have the two two packs and it's so weird to see mario kart with dlc but at the same time it's kinda it's awesome at the same time you know usually i don't get excited about dlc but it seems like nintendo really knows how to do it right that's just my question with the whole totes um that toad game well because if they don't release it as a separate game then they can't do dlc for the toad game it's well hey i mean they haven't they still haven't announced the release date for smash brothers they haven't although i would think all these signs pointing to november 21st would be right but i would think so too but at the same time that 31st march date is a fucking placeholder date nintendo never releases a title on tuesday it's always a fucking friday or something oh so you went over to gamefly and it shows 31st of march it's the 31st yeah so there's that's placeholder that yeah that's what i would do is just move it out of the month look at that loki calling the news out is bull live on air look at that it's a good good thought alright well let's let's move to a simpler time when you know i don't know about you guys but like back in back in the day like you didn't really know when games were coming out they just they would come in the magazine and it would say october and you'd be like when in october and it would just soon soon it'll be on the shelf when it's damn good and ready it's the and you'll like it that's right and you'll spend 60 bucks on the cartridge alright yeah here it is your classic game of the week where dark soccer is gonna open up the vault and find a game that she thinks hey you should be playing this game right now or in this case she might be uh going to her arcade collection and uh finding yet another capcom classic for you guys well i'm still trying to stick with the cps2 theme how long is this theme gonna go well i said i was gonna do it for a month and i started it in november so i'm finishing i'm gonna finish up the cps2 with this one but i think i might do cps3 next in november i was like it's been a whole year what the fuck over i started it in september alright i'll stop bugging you what is the classic game of the week mega man the power battle also known as rockman the power battle and it was a uh basically an arcade game it was a spin off for the rockman series it came out in japan in 1995 and had a sequel called mega man 2 the power fighters uh the next year um the games reported to uh consoles in north america in 2004 as part of the mega man anniversary collection came out on ps2 uh gamecube and xbox and um was also part of the same compilation in japan as rockman power battle fighters for ps2 there was also an adaptation of both games for neo geo pocket caller called rockman battle and fighters which was pretty pretty funny neo geo pocket caller game um so basically uh dr wily rebuilt the robot masters and he wants to take over the world so basically it's a fighting game with uh you can play as as uh mega man or rockman uh proto man or base why would he rebuild them why wouldn't he just build better ones he got a point there his eyebrows way too much um it's it's weighing down his brain so anyway um basically it's just like playing any mega man game you have your jump you have your shoot um you can hold it down for stronger blast you can hold it down while jumping makes you dash uh so you have those different mechanics in there um and as far as the stories that you do each one has a different uh series of stories for what for uh depending on who they fight so you've got um as stories for mega man one through two three through six and mega man seven um the level is you don't really do like a whole level you just have like some part of the level and then you fight your bad guys and you actually have to go through um uh sort of a rock paper scissors kind of decision method for choosing the weapon i really like the redesign for uh with man in this one by the way it actually had a soundtrack released on december 1st 1995 that was uh actually had some arranged uh pieces from other mega man games by uh Yamamoto Setsuo and um Okugawa Hideki and they were performed by so uh pretty cool stuff um as far as uh the reception of it gave it a pretty decent rating and uh basically got a 22 out of 40 which is decent for so there you go rock man the power battle very cool and uh it was always awesome also a good choice this week as we have mega man fighting game right now it's nice to kind of go back and revisit mega man's brawling roots yes the only thing i didn't like about this game is that like mega man 7 or whatever got like its own dedicated thing but like 1 and 2 should have had dedicated and 3 should have had dedicated i don't know maybe it's just me but i thought the robot masters in the earlier games were a little more memorable i just liked playing base yeah it was all about playing base in this one for me cause base was just bad ass alright there it is classic game of the week mega man or rock man the power battle again another one of capcom's arcade games at this point we are about to head over to our interview we did with farsight studios all about the pinball arcade however since we are at about the halfway point of the show dark soccer is actually going to be bidding us adieu a little early tonight cause my ass has to be up at 5 in the morning yes so uh you know real life obligations come first so dark soccer before you go i always ask at the end of the show do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight i kind of want to take the cinnamon bread but i bought it for you you can take it we don't need it keep it keep it we can split it in half or something there you go alright yay cinnamon bread alright there we go so dark soccer we'll see you next week we will of course still be here though loki and diego and jonas through the news however i want to take an opportunity to go now to earlier this week when i had an opportunity to sit down with farsight studios to talk about pinball arcade and their kickstarter for the adams family lets go to it right now hi everyone well you know we love pinball here at orange lounge radio from the machines we've talked about at dark soccer's house to my fond memories of pinbot on the nes somehow pinball and video games compliment each other very well enter the pinball arcade a pinball simulation video game comprised of real pinball arcade tables available for just about every modern gaming platform the developer behind the pinball arcade farsight studios recently took to kickstarter to bring one of the greatest pinball tables of all time the adams family to their collection tonight we welcome to the program vice president of product development from farsight studios bobby king to talk to us about the pinball arcade and the possibility of gomez and morticia coming to the collection next bobby you there yeah i'm here hey how you doing bobby welcome to the program bobby how are you i'm doing good rob how are you awesome i am doing great thank you so much for taking the time out to be on the show tonight um so for those that might not be familiar with the pinball arcade i mean i know it's on just about every platform that's out there but if for some reason somebody doesn't know what it is tell us a little bit about the pinball arcade sure the pinball arcade came out um a couple years ago we actually launched in february of 2012 and it's our goal to recreate all of the greatest pinball machines ever the real machines so we have licenses from williams and batley and and gottlieb and the start license includes that how data east and sega um so basically we have the rights to recreate pretty much every table there is however those are just the pinball rights and what we are looking for in the adams family kickstarter uh the ant employer rights to the movie the adams family um the adams family foundation rights for the the characters and then the uh specific actors so um yeah so it's now our goal to recreate these pinball tables so that pinball players from a whole new generation get to play them well let's since you brought up the adams family kickstarter and i know that's the big big focus right now and there's about a week left to go on the kickstarter when people are going to be hearing this um what exactly are you raising that money for on the kickstarter yeah so those that money is specifically for all those licenses i just mentioned they're for the the rights for the movie for the adams family and for the actors to get their likeness clearances um why is this table so important um the adams family was the best selling pinball table of all time uh it's it's over 20,000 like real machines were made it's a really popular table it's really it's a great table it's a fun table it's a pat lawler classic um it's just um a table that any collection is going to be the best of uh pinball of all time really needs the adams family so we've been pushing really hard to get these licenses i seem to remember there was like a limited edition gold version or something of the adams family table as well is that all a part of this or just we're trying to just get the original classic table yeah the pinball of the adams family pinball machine did so well they came up with a limited edition um um there's a special ROM so some special rules were created and there's gold trim around them uh in the real world so we have the rights to recreate both so anyone who kick starts contributes um $100 or more will be a member of the gold club and be a gold backer and they'll get to play the gold edition in addition to the regular one oh very cool um do you have a particular favorite feature of the adams family table? um geez i like the mamushka i like how simple it is to understand that you're clearing out the rooms uh i like the flipper that's automatically you know working for you but the hand's really cool the thing um it was one of the first tables to have a DMD working so it's it's a really great presentation table it's just a lot of fun to play i just remember um really being drawn to it you know because this has probably been when the movie was out i was probably in about junior high or something when the movie came out and i just remembered like it tied in so well to the movie like i think a lot of other tables sometimes you can kind of like especially in gaming and video games in general you really feel like the movie or the game that goes with the add-on is such like a loose like a loose tie-in but this really felt like an extension of the movie to me right that's actually one of the reasons why we needed the paramount license because not only was it used in the adams family characters but they took actual script from the movie um they took story from the movie and built that into the pinball table machine design uh so it's one of the reasons why we had to get that license gotcha now i don't know if this is true or not but there were rumors circulating out there that the estate of rao julia was part of the holdout that the likeness was uh not wanting to be used has this all been resolved will we see rao julia in the game if if kickstarter yeah we have the likeness clearance and that's one of the the funds that we're trying to raise um so his widow was very um willing to work with us and we're very appreciative that we're able to use his likeness and i don't know if you know but his voice is used a lot in the table oh yeah the uh wms has a special audio recording with rao julia just for the pinball machine so it's it's a little over 100 wave files just his voice wow which is far more than any other character yeah you can't really talk about the mamushka without really hearing it in his voice the mamushka you know he's this very grandiose way of delivering lines right um now going going to the the pinball uh arcade collection in general um you know i i remember playing the i think you guys had a early version of this game on the we there wasn't there like a a pinball collection of some sort on the we as well right yeah we started doing pinball um table collections about 10 years ago and our first franchise was called the pinball hall of fame that's it yeah pinball hall of fame uh and we had the gotley collection and the williams collection and i think both of those made it to the we eventually i noticed you guys kind of really make it a point to have your game on a variety of systems i mean i could i could list where the pinball arcade is playable but it is literally everywhere from the playstation 4 to the uia and mobile phones many developers focus on one console plus steam or what have you why do you guys go for such that variety how how important is that for you well it's always been far sight bread and butter um you know the pinball arcade is our first published title that we've done ourselves publishing wise um with digital distribution as possible um but before that we were basically being contracted by publishers to make a game and one of the key selling points we had as a developer was that we could take a game and develop it on as many platforms as they wanted for very little incremental cost uh so we've carried over we have really good tools when it comes to cross platform development and since you know people want to play it on whatever device they have let's we felt that why not do it as long as there's a digital store to sell it to them we've created for them do you find that people tend to prefer like one over the other like mobile versus couch play on the playstation or do you do you kind of find that somebody who likes it one place might want to have all the versions that they have a something on the go and what have you yeah the bulk of our users just pick one um but we do have plenty of users who like will pick one console like one of the later consoles and our xbox one version um should be coming out here soon within a month or two um but most people want to have one mobile version and one not most people but our most hardcore fans will have one mobile version either the android or the ios and one home console and home console might be pc if you get to that home console of course um seems like most of the fans play it one one one device on the go and one device at home gotcha now um many pinball games i've played in the past like and i'm talking like pinball dreams on like nineties computers to other games today they're based off of new tables but you guys have really made it your thing to do pinball classics have you guys ever wanted to do an original table why do you stick to classics um well i can give you a whole history um back when we first started doing pinball machines the publisher crave actually asked us to create some original tables but i was um at the studio we had never done anything pinball related and even though we had some fans of pinball internally we weren't comfortable designing original tables so someone there at crave um bob bryant had the idea for us to license real tables and we create them because he's a huge fan of real pinball and wanted to play some of the favorite tables which he couldn't find anywhere right so that's really how it started so moving forward to today uh we actually have i don't know how much i can talk about this but we're working currently on an original table um and it should be coming out really soon um we're pretty excited about it and moving forward we actually have we're looking at some other license deals um to possibly uh include but these tables that we're going to be making are going to be powered with pinball arcade um they're going to be a you know separate you know standalone apps one at a time might have a link to the pinball arcade if you want to play some more pinball some more real pinball um but we're just starting to do it and there's a lot of people here internally since we've been making pinball for so long now and we've seen so many different designs come uh we've created and simulated that we are pretty excited here a lot of us to start making our own tables the first one that we're going to be doing is a relatively like a kind of like a stepping stone i guess we're taking an existing table and kind of modding it um because we're trying to get it out relatively fast but moving forward we've got a lot of ideas to do some more original table design and it seems like the the feeling here internally in the studio is to do tables that could exist in real life as opposed to the then approach which is make video gamey um pinball we're going to try to make tables that actually could really exist and make out our niche when it comes to original design you know and there are so few pinball machines that are really released every year now you know it's really you know ramped down in where we're at now so i mean it does feel like a natural progression that you know well these maybe these are the tables that they would be making if if you know there were uh as many physical pinball tables these days right right i mean there's two manufacturers still working um and maybe you know a couple more you know trying to get off the ground um but yeah zen's doing a pretty good job of licensing some cool properties and we hope to get in there too uh well best of luck with you guys uh in in that venture although i am going to hold out hope personally i know this might be a tricky one for you guys to get but that tron pinball table they just released is so rad i i really hope you guys can work something out with that yeah we have one really big fan of it here generally so we're we're working on that one it's a tough license all right i'm joining the club make that two fans all right uh now i'm sure a lot of people out there that are listening to this program they probably have downloaded the the free trials of pinball arcade that that come with uh one table right and they they wonder maybe i should go in and and buy another table but there's so many to choose from now i know this is a tough question but is is there one table out there in your collection that you think people need to play and check out like because maybe they don't have memories of it so you know it's one thing to kind of go in there like oh i got to get the star trek table because i'm a star trek fan but is is there something people might be missing like what is that one real hidden gem that people really need to check out in the collection yeah someone's not a big fan of real pinball they really should download the table pack one which is medieval madness and the pride of pinball because medieval madness is such a fun table so a lot of people's favorite table of all time um inside it's not a huge license you'll you know what's new to madness you won't even have heard of it if you're not into pinball right but it's it kind of has that money python feel for the comedy and it's really well designed it's just a really fun table our co-host our co-host dark soccer i believe had one of those in her house for for a while she had a bride of pinbot as well and that was that machine's a ton i actually pinbot is probably one of my i i will be honest adam's family is actually my favorite table of all time i have personally backed this kickstarter and i i really thank you yeah i really hope you guys get it uh but my second favorite is probably pinbot so you know i had to play the original pinbot or the bride of pinbot i prefer the original pinbot and part of that is probably my memories of the nes version as well which i know is like kind of wacky different but that was a little different but the physics weren't exactly yeah yeah as advanced as ours were they're 2d but it was it was fun it was really well done yeah when you're 10 years old you know you're not thinking about that stuff as much so it's you got a little more slack um i have another question here from our facebook community is the show where every gamer has a voice and we invited you guys to ask some questions and we had a derek over on our facebook community ask you about some very specific titles here so i don't even know if this is something you can you can comment on but uh when will raven hollywood heat and last action hero be released are there i and especially i look at last action hero and i kind of go okay so there's there's obviously some other big properties out there that people have their eye on are there other properties you guys are hoping to bring over that you have your eye on that you might kick start next um sure and actually i think i've already mentioned that um last action hero is one that we do have our eye on and we already have arnold's likeness um for terminator 2 so that one is very possible the other two are tables i'm aware of um i can't say that they're in any short term plans but there are some good picks alright well uh thank you so much for joining us today bobby i really appreciate it um before i let you go though there's a question we always ask the people who come on our show and that is what types of video games have you been playing this week and no fair naming your own games i know you gotta do a lot of plenty of those but what other video games are you playing lately um that's kind of embarrassing the only game i played this week is candy crush so you're the one keeping that game going i'm just teasing yeah i'm at the end of that game so like when i release more levels i like to crank them out i understand just one more hit just one more hit alright well um best of luck to you with the kickstarter uh for the adams family for the pinball arcade you can check that out over at kickstarter.com the url is very very long um but just search for pinball arcade the adams family and you'll find it it'll come right up uh any websites or twitter accounts people should follow if they want to see more on the progress of this yeah absolutely um on facebook follow uh or join up to pinball arcade and same with our twitter handle um and that's probably the best way to follow it or uh join the kickstarter and i think you get updates and uh yeah again best of luck to you guys i personally i love the table this is one i want to see happen myself so uh i'll be uh i'll be looking forward to it when it's released thanks uh thanks for the interview and uh thanks for your time alright you're welcome thanks bobby for joining us here on orange lounge radio today to register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network.com use the passphrase salt and we do want to thank uh bobby and uh farsight studios for joining us on the program and uh yeah i'm looking at our chat room over at live.vog network.com and uh ssga100matt giving us an update on the kickstarter there and uh dungeon buster linking to the kickstarter if you uh want to go visit that i actually did and i i mentioned during the interview i did donate myself uh because i love that adams family table and i want to see it happen and ssga100matt saying as of right now uh 90,352 dollars and they need to get to 97,640 in the next six days so it's looking pretty good but uh you know if you're hearing this you you know on the podcast especially you may not have a lot of time left to get in on that so check that out over at kickstarter um some other comments in our chat room uh bochikawa saying last action hero that one i'd like to play again so maybe that'll have to be their next one we'll see um ssga100matt saying at least in some way pinball machines will continue to exist the machines themselves and the parts might die out but at least they're archived this way so yeah that that's a very good way of looking at it and fifth dream says uh sky donated himself that's worth at least two tables yeah i yes i did donate myself uh and i i can't wait to uh play it again it looks looking very favorable that they'll make it now i just have to figure out which platform i'll get it on but probably playstation 4 because i have uh at least one of the seasons that's where all my elvira tables are on playstation 4 so good times um anyway uh if you're just joining us here at orange launch radio so we move on with our 570th episode for october the 5th of 2014 uh dark soccer has left the building uh she had to say goodbye before we went to our interview there um as she has some other commitments tomorrow but we are joined of course uh by diego and jonas from the uh big anime game room are here so uh hope you guys are doing well and diego is just making himself comfy over there in dark soccer's throne you like that spot? it's got padding and it's not wood so yeah it's it's a lot more comfy than the uh other chair over there and of course loki's still here with us yeah half partially because he's he's kind of engrossed in clicker heroes yeah there's no there's literally no point to me playing this right now and yet i am yeah that's well i'm not really playing it i'm just mainly saying levels done next levels done next that's me and diablo 3 i mean i was just watching that game it looked like just stuff was falling from the sky and landing on the ground it's because my characters do so much damage that it kills them instantly there it is instant kill because i cheated because i didn't want to play this game and i thought hey if i cheated it would be it would be over faster you oh my god loki can't even play clicker heroes the right way he's got to cheat in that too i did play i hope you were putting cheat codes into your game or you know heaven help you when everybody wants to hack and cheat in your game that you're making well be smarter to check for that stuff yeah i bet i bet we'll see how that goes all right uh hey i've gotten to the point now where stuff isn't dying instantly so that's that's good right before we get into some rapid fire news i wanted to check in with our friends over at the uh big anime game room and see what what they might have going on right now like uh you guys have any big conventions or shows coming up you want to give a plug to here on air for our california audience well like we said before i think on the last show when we were on here we talked about snafu coming up on uh october i think 24 25th and 26th that's friday saturday sunday that's in reno nevada oh yeah we're looking forward to that but earlier uh coming up this october the 10th we uh i myself had started up along with the group uh something called the ex games series uh it's something that we started a long time ago it's our locals here in sacramento and we really wanted to jump start that again and we uh somebody uh close by to uh where one of one of our staffers lives including me uh was a comic store that decided to help us out with their venue and allow us to jump start it right there and that was for uh flash flashback comics and collectibles nice yeah it's over by uh pretty much in antelope between antelope and north highlands so that won't do like our british listeners a lot of good probably to hear that but we do have some local folks here in california that might be able to stop by and check that out yeah they're already getting the word and people are just perking their ears up and saying what antelope what's over there and uh is that an animal? deer caught in the headlights sadly you do not find many antelope in antelope that's right that's right but you can cantaloupe an antelope if you oh oh boy so we're gonna showcase uh melee and uh smash burst 3ds awesome and it'll be live streamed so uh we'll be doing it there well there you go that's how the people overseas can check it out too you're gonna live stream it as well what's your uh you guys have a twitch i assume twitch.tv uh slash um tbhgr underscore tv alright awesome um let's see now we were talking during the uh during the uh uh earlier in the show and uh you had mentioned that you have a friend because this is very topical right we've been talking a lot about smash brothers you're doing the smash brothers tournament there's actually a smash brothers apparently dedicated podcast that you know some people behind yeah i believe it's from the bay area and uh one of our uh one of our staffers from another convention and also a good friend of ours and the smash brothers community uh is christopher solace and uh he takes part in a uh podcast that takes part in a monday and wednesdays uh so shoutouts to them and their crew of uh norcal sm4sh is their uh podcast and they just kinda monday and wednesdays about smash that's right wow that's a lot oh my gosh yeah they um there's a couple people who really got embedded in the community and chris has been embedded in the community for a while so they just got together to uh share their experiences and they're networking with other people along the community and show that the ever since uh smash brothers melee got into evo they just really wanted to get on the ball and show that the community itself is wonderful and full of great people that are still interested in this game that's about how long jen is about 14 years old now almost uh we're running since 99 so well the series yeah since the game series and then melee in 2001 when it came out wow yeah still still still strong people love that game so much absolutely that is simple to play but has but the in depth part is what got people into the game competitively very competitive very competitive very fun and and then the all the communities is very nice and that's what they try to showcase is that good because nobody likes jerks i hate and then some especially sometimes in fighting but really in any even when back in the days when we did ddr tournaments we'd run into our share of jerks you know and it's like you just pad error please let's start again let's just let's start the round over again because there's a one miss yeah right i could i could get into stories but i'm gonna leave the 10 year old drama back in the last decade thank you very much anyway speaking of i think it was one of the times when i met you jonas at paradise island days remember that oh yeah when we when we indirectly met each other and stuff for a tournament that we actually hosted in sacramento like after like it was a tournament it was a tournament in 2005 called spit sacramento paradise island tournament oh it's awesome right this is the i think this is the time where they wanted me to run a tournament so i was like cool i want to run a ddr tournament for sacramento smash brothers and ddr tournament in the same venue and we kind of crossed streams me and him not in that fashion but we crossed streams don't cross the streams we kind of initially talked we got reacquainted back in 2007 after that can you believe it though i mean speaking of like ddr and all that tonight is episode 570 so guess what's in 3 more episodes i can't i can't i can't officially unveil anything yet but we have a lead on a really great interview for that night to celebrate 573 which anybody who like knows ddr any old school konami game ought to catch the reference so i'm very excited about that we'll let you know more details on that when we have everything you know all our t's crossing our i's dotted and all that good stuff so before we get into rapid fire news anything else we should know about going on speaking of games for those those who are going to pacific media expo next month november i think it's like november i think it's 7th or 9th it's just a friday through sunday they are actually hosting the united states pump it up festival the u.s championships for pump it up and that's that's still a big thing too um u.s it's really hard to say if it's still big but i know in countries like mexico and south america that's still really big people keep forgetting that from that that said that the country they still play a lot maybe a few koreans and stuff but because some koreans still play because they still want to compete with um the competition i heard i heard pump was like still really huge in latin america so that's okay that makes a lot of sense are they the ones that took it away from korea um that was years ago when when they had the rule of no bar when they had the when when they actually started allowing bar i think that the competition started being a little bit more even not i'm saying anything bad about those who actually use the bar or not but that's been that's yeah again let's leave the drama from 10 years ago but again that's what that was a shift change of what statistics were showing during who is the top players but actually still mexico is still on the top 10 in terms of not tournaments but actual just um actually um act out one of our mexican listeners in chat saying yeah pump it up is still big here so very cool so i think the rankings are still top 10 for just regular players for pump it up fiesta too all right so yep there is a united states championships coming up up on and it's supposed to be three times bigger than last year when they had it at pmx um last year for the first time at a convention just again not not to too much localize the show but i have a personal question a personal vendetta i need to get the the answers these questions so all all you guys in other states and so forth bear with me for a minute but did we ever get that scandia situation resolved are we ever gonna get those awesome machines back at scandia or is that that i'll be honest remains unknown um because i'll be honest i'm still pissed off about it because we all are that i was trying to figure out where the hell am i gonna practice for the championships yeah but and of course we were actually planning on hosting a tournament this month had it not been for that incident yeah so unfortunately i can't really answer scandia other than the whole audit incident which remains unknown i think i have pump it up exceed on the xbox as in the original xbox i just don't think i have the dance mat anymore so good luck playing it it's all good uh anyhow we're gonna get back into some rapid fire news here but of course guys uh if you have any comments on uh what we're talking about with the news please by all means jump in but uh let's do some rapid fire news now loki hey see uh rovio still got it with angry birds and well i guess hollywood still doesn't have any ideas of what to license into movies but guess what they're gonna be making angry birds movie in case you forgot and it's actually uh i'm gonna have quite a few um stars doing the voice acting for the movie including um jason sedacus from and actually uh mya rudolph from saturday night live of course i don't know i know sedacus i think is still on there but i don't think no neither one oh neither are okay well yeah they move on uh peter dinglage who is now apparently uh because he's famous with uh game of thrones and stuff and now he's just like fuck it i'm gonna be in whatever terrible movie you guys are gonna pay me for and we know he's an amazing voice actor we all loved his performance in destiny and loved it um other people which i'm surprised didn't get higher um listings on here bill hater which is absolutely my favorite like cast member right now uh actually he's not on the show you fuck but he is hosting next week's show we're gonna watch they had sarah silverman hosting this week yeah yeah i know they did a um they did a joan rivers comedy tribute in heaven cause you know sarah silverman's always gotta be the too soon yeah comic uh kate mckinnon was also on snl uh josh gadd which i guess did voice work in frozen um what was it uh ike bernholtz which uh was part of the mini product uh tom hale and uh was it um danielle brooks from oranges of the new black oh yeah she uh she's tasty if i'm not mistaken okay cool uh keegan michael kay from uh was it keegan peale uh jillian bell from workaholics and hannibal burris from broad cities it's a pretty diverse cast list so yeah it's pretty awesome considering i don't know them it looks neat in the picture at least i mean it looks like it's gonna be pretty high but i i don't know i just can't see what the plot's gonna be but you know what fuck i couldn't imagine what a lego movie was gonna be like and that ended up being pretty awesome so whatever true it's all good but are we gonna see like now anger birds the movie the game i mean cause you know is it gonna come full full circle again why not street further movie the game why not with the fighting game so i'd play that i at least try it once i mean cause it's something else it sounds like it'd be pretty cool uh this is kind of a neat little thing that they're adding to the halo master chief collection halo one and two also of course had pc versions of the game and those versions of the game also had exclusive multiplayer maps well now those are actually gonna be coming over as part of the master chief collection so you'll be able to play those maps including timberland death island um i'm not even gonna try to pronounce that it was jeff hydro jeff hydro phobia i don't know um i have no idea that's like a fucking made up name and i don't even care uh danger canyon see why can't they be just like danger canyon um ice fields and infinity from halo the collector's edition and halo 2 they've got um they got district and uplift um so that'd be pretty cool and also some pc exclusive weapons like i guess a flamethrower and they had a fuel rod gun or it's supposed to be coming um or you can filter them out because they're allowing you to do that kind of thing boy they're really trying to make this like the definitive halo aren't they that's pretty awesome i mean cool and uh hey you know what this was a pretty cool game on uya although i didn't get it at the time because i was playing like a very very early version of it but one of the best games i guess on uya and it was at least one i had one was amazing frog it was a game where you just kind of hurt yourself as a frog bouncing off different things and stuff like that and it was only on uya but now now it's going to be coming to steam so you can check it out and they've got all sorts of fun stuff in there i guess it's actually it reminds me a lot of goat simulator it is like goat sim it is and they're going to have you know different um four player split screen um and all sorts of different other modes in there um so you know what i checked it out i'm going to have to check it out when it comes out alright well uh loki i think this is another game that really sounds like it's up your alley and it was something that was on kick starter and it made its goal and it's trinket games developing this it's called battle chef brigade just imagine like iron chef or top chef like what are those like iron chef the anime is pretty much it's like one of those epic cooking games like this is like hardcore cooking mama this is like cooking mama could be an iron chef in the same way like if you watch the trailer video that's on their kickstarter page it even opens like iron chef with the chairman eating a pepper that's awesome that's amazing oh actually uh the kickstarter is still going it already made it's 38,000 but the kickstarter is still going and is scheduled for release in 2016 for the pc mac and linux yeah holy crap that's a long time yeah they're at 54,000 uh right now of their 38,000 goal with 21 days to go this did very well it looks awesome it's like yeah one part like cookie mama and then you have to hunt monsters and you get like resources from those monsters and uh it's definitely unique uh i love this their next stretch goal at 56,000 which they'll make is uh summons call forth incredible beings with powerful spells similar to final fantasy tactics what this is a fucking cooking game and you're gonna like summon shiva like instead of sick sticking it in the freezer it's like oh shiva get over here and snap i think though if they want to be really kind of cool with that they should like kind of combine both like final fantasy summons and like you know peeps chefs from iron chef in there like you know not that i want to give the example of bobby flay because i fucking hate bobby flay but um you know just have like you know bobby flay in there or like cat core okay cat core and shiva you know together or something like that they're like materia it's like spices recipes or something and and then like it all's like you you don't summon fourth you cook fourth and they get summoned and they do something or i don't know like a something crazy like that i need someone to slice these carrots oh let me summon there's a guy on there summon knights of the round and then you'll afk in 30 minutes if you read all the like different you know um descriptions of the characters there's a guy that's an undead zombie guy and he's able to summon forth like the undead and skeletons and stuff to help him cook devil's food cake it's pretty awesome i i don't know it just sounds like a ridiculous premise for a game but it also would i could totally say this being like an anime uh dart tatsumi in chat says that reminds me of trauma center the one on the wii where you could draw symbols during the operation to do spells and shit actually yeah kind of sounds like that with cooking let's examine some of the other stretch goals they've hit uh jungle a new steamy overgrown biome for you to hunt in oh because i guess you have to hunt your food before you cook it uh caverns where you catch bizarre monsters deep undergrounds and announcer vo every cooking competition needs an awesome announcer oh my god i volunteer as tribute i'll be your voice over just get the guy that does like the um translating on um iron chef like whoever i don't know who it is that does the voiceovers but that guy's awesome get that guy alright dude fucking cut you know they need to hook up alton brown with this you know get him in on the action because i bet you do it how about barefoot Contessa i would like to see alright Paula Deem no she's controversial remember she's a little too controversial alright anyway uh also controversial could be video game movies that don't turn out so great so we're hoping dead rising turns out alright there's a dead rising digital film of course in production we've talked about it before but we have uh some more updates on what's going on and this is according to director zach libofsky sorry if i'm saying that wrong but that there will be familiar faces uh and i can't reveal too much but the character has covered wars you know which might be a tease that frank west is somehow in it he also uh described the movie as indiana jones with zombies well now that's a i better see some face melting if you're gonna use that comparison there so we'll see what happens there uh pretty much every person i know has already emailed me saying they want to be a zombie so i think we'll be fine it's like shot in the dead with zombies we're also planning a long one take action shot with hundreds of zombies which i'm very excited about online there's no ratings board there's no run time limit there are no rules this is an experiment for legendary and they've been very incredibly willing to take creative risks now i know that they were against our hardcore pornography zombie scene but there's no rules online this sounds like the type of movie that i'm gonna show my mom and you know i'm gonna say rob that is gross that is a gross movie um i don't know if she'd think this is gross because this seemed like it was more cartoon violence in these games but uh too bad dark soccer is still not here because i bet she'd be excited to know that strider 2 that's right the uh arcade side scroller strider 2 will be on the playstation network uh coming out i believe october 7th is the big day that's available uh this is the arcade game from 1999 and uh yeah very cool this is uh the ps1 version of strider 2 also came with 1989's strider so that will be bundled then with the download so you get strider 1 and strider 2 originally on the playstation 1 did they release that strider game that came out on the consoles like the new one on pc uh i believe they did i believe it is on steam i could be wrong i could be wrong but uh you know what i want to you know what i just got the urge to play now that i have in my steam library what's that bionic commando and i have i have rearmed and a new one i like the new one i thought it wasn't bad who cares if his wife is his arm it doesn't matter oh my god spoilers that's in the intro i mean whatever alright let us go to our social media communities you know every week here on the show we ask a question of our facebook or google plus communities you take facebook and google and you slam those words together and you get foogle and by the way the chatters are saying it's on steam loki so it's the foogle question of the week this week uh in honor of our guests that we had just a moment ago we wanted to ask about pinball so we asked what's your favorite table do you have a different favorite table when it comes to playing a gaming system or a pc so let's get to our answers so we got some answers over on facebook starting with our friend renee who is from the podcast killer queens from outer space which is a horror film podcast i guessed it on that one since a while ago now uh anyhow renee says uh first pinball very excited about a pinball topic second my favorite physical table to play of all time the adams family my favorite digital table to play from the sega saturn's last gladiators the warlock table that game had some of the best pinball physics that are just a tad faster than zen's pinball physics uh brad our pal from pod culture says my favorite table has to be of course doctor who i've only been able to play it a small handful of times man it was fun um i hope that someone would bring it to one of the pinball games for pc or console my favorite digital table is probably the star trek next generation one having two of my favorite things pinball and star trek combined is just fantastic uh febreeze a over on facebook answers this question i played a fair share of pinball tables but never had the opportunity to spend enough time with them my local had two well maintained tables the adams family and playboy i forgot playboy had a table playboy table is gone now but i play the adams family every month it's the best machine i've ever played it never bores me on the digital side i like zen pinball the most motley crew on mega drive was cool too this answer reminded me we used to have an arcade that had the guns and roses pinball table that machine was the shit i wish that was one that they could pour it over where the little plunger was actually a big rose that you'd pull that was awesome and i played this wasn't that scandia uh they they might have one scandia but there used to be a little arcade in roseville where i grew up and i think it was supercade was what it was called and they had one there and they actually had the playboy table there too so i've actually played that game before i don't know why i was thinking the birdcage but that could have been something else it probably was back when birdcage had a i wish they had more nickel arcades the last nickel arcade we had was in downtown sacramento but that shut down like a year 2001 fyi wow that was a long time ago alright moving over to emily c who says i fell in love with two very different tables the actual table i love is the adams family table i'm sensing a theme here it was always very entertaining and challenging to me today it would suck the quarters out of my pockets as soon as i enter the room with one digitally i fell in love with pokemon pinball that's a great answer and one i forgot about the metroid pinball game was really good too those are some great handheld ones yeah those are really good i remember those now yeah yeah totally forgot about that earlier thanks emily for reminding us of those uh i was never a real gamer until my boyfriend at the time let me as gameboy advance with pokemon pinball a couple days later i bought my own advance and a copy of that game a couple years later i married that guy there you go congratulations alright uh chiggers replies and says star trek the next generation table is one of my favorites and farsight studios does a really good job recreating it i play the pinball arcade almost every time i turn on my playstation 3 well they'll be happy to hear that uh and hitstun says oh man pinbot that one's my favorite i haven't gotten to play that table since arcade legacy had one a couple years ago that's a local arcade apparently i put a ton of time in on that machine and on the nes it really is natural for video game conversions uh now they have a ripley's believe it or not which is probably my second favorite there's plenty of good pinball here in ohio ohio just sayin uh oh he must not have been happy with last weeks show alright going over to google plus and uh one answer on google plus tonight from act deft who says i used to play the terminator 2 table at the arcade when i was a kid it was such an awesome one so there you guys go thank you very much for the answers to the questions um since you guys uh weren't able to make it to the show right at six to six o'clock tonight we were talking about this kickoff topic do you guys play any pinball at all do you have a favorite table uh in your memory uh question yeah sorry does that like a quote nuke on the pinball side but i played a couple people i keep forgetting names um is it the adams family the one where you have to like cycle cycle and charge the ball okay the here's the crazy thing they had an adams family thing that was like prop cycle meets adams family so somebody actually made that but that isn't officially the game oh okay i was like wait i've seen that before i was like wait is it what i thought it was yeah no when they when they uh poured it over i don't believe prop cycle will be involved i don't remember that i've never played that where they have the prop cycle thing yeah jamie knows i know they had that in california extreme at one point yeah yeah that's probably where she saw it yeah and i remember seeing that in reno at the time like when i was like it was like 15 years ago when i was playing where they had some really good pinball machines like um i noticed they had a street fighter one which is pretty fun oh yeah yeah it was a street fighter pinball and yeah but i just forget the names of it because all the people at first looked the same but they're actually it's pretty fun just forgetting the names of the problem sure sure as i said earlier i i'm definitely a fan of that pokemon pinball that was definitely addicting for a while and um at one point there was a back to the future pinball uh yes there was yeah i was kind of interested in that too that back to the future one and uh other than that i can't really recall anymore but i remember some some different ones that we did at like i mentioned the bird cage earlier because my brother would always drag me out there and some there was always like pinball machines all over the place because he's twice my age and all that so he'd always pull me aside and say we're gonna have fun and play some real video games and i'm glad i'm grateful for him for doing that because otherwise i wouldn't have you know touched all those fields right right yeah but it was fun definitely it was very addicting yeah definitely uh i see a lot of uh comments in our chat room talking about sonic spinball um another you know pinball video game oh god sonic spinball was so different though because like you you could kind of move sonic like if you weren't doing right like you could like jump up it's not real it's it's a combination of yeah it's like a combo it's like pinball quest or something and then the faces of that is kind of bs at some points yeah it is remember metroid pinball i do it was the first game well it was yeah it came with the rumble thing yeah good times alright thank you guys for answering our fugo question of the week we're gonna get back into some other news loki alright um so this is kind of neat uh playstation well it's not neat it kind of sucks actually uh thankfully it's not gonna be here uh but they're increasing the price of playstation plus for certain regions um not in north america though but in south america ukraine russia turkey and india regions um they're increasing the price because of various market conditions and of course they go on to reiterate again that this is not happening in north america um so i don't know it kind of sucks i guess for those regions that it's going up in price um i don't know if you can buy cards elsewhere in redeemum i don't think you can so um hmm oh well um i guess it is neat that we're not gonna get a price increase here at least yet yeah that would be something they sneak in after the holiday or something quote yet right yeah and unfortunately it's already happened uh on october first um so well that kind of sucks oh my god if they do like a crazy black friday deal again this year something like it remember last year they had like an insanely good black friday deal i don't know if they do black friday stuff in other countries like that but you know what um keep an eye out uh i guess in other regions because i'm sure that there's places where you can buy cards like that um they mark down the price and maybe you can get one for your region that's cheaper than what they're gonna you know do for it probably smart that they aren't doing that for north america because i think people would pitch a fit you know about it um especially that or like japan or something like that i think they would pitch a fit um about those prices going up and you know microsoft i'm sure get on board and say hey you know even though theirs is more expensive but i don't know it's still you don't want to raise prices out of the fact all right well let's hope they don't decide to do the same thing unless you know they're throwing in some features or something that makes the games they give away are pretty darn good though you gotta admit i mean playstation plus is a really great here's what i would like is you know maybe all those games that i have in my library if i could you know stream this that would be great i would love that yeah we should get that with like playstation plus or whatever where the ps1 games we bought should be streamable on ps4 when they get the ps1 and ps2 stuff working but hopefully that's sooner rather than later right or even like playstation 3 stuff i mean there's stuff i have in my library that true that'd be nice true very true all right let's move on to talk about a new feature coming to the 3ds and uh we don't know when but it'll be sometime in this next month nintendo is going to be releasing a firmware update for the 3ds that will allow themes you know because speaking of playstation this is something that is on the playstation uh three at least and we know it's coming to the four and they can sell themes and make money off them so why not on the 3ds as well especially we're talking about with these new 3ds you can have all these like interchangeable face plates so you can have like 3ds that match your shoes well now why not the why not the internal theme yeah they're gonna have the themes that match those the face plates exactly so 50 themes gonna be offered in japan at the launch including a few from third parties they'll be like a monster hunter theme is apparently one of the things uh now here's the thing they're not gonna be free but they're priced at around either 100 or 200 yen depending on what it is that's a buck or two roughly so they're gonna be cheap but that's still money for a theme but still though they charge money for themes um yeah if some were free that's cool if they do they have simple color set and simple clear color set are free oh color set fancy but if you want to get something like i don't know uh animal crossing able sisters mabel that's gonna set you back why can't i do my own themes like i could in you know the xbox 360 because you'd put a penis on it and we all know you can't have that on the nintendo system wrong wouldn't put a penis on it but a lot of people would put porns from if it's any new indication from the you know youtube videos i've seen it's gonna be big breasted women and you know pot leaves because that's what people put on there right topless marijuana women exactly topless marijuana women uh i'm not seeing that here on the list but i do see rosalina round and round so maybe like if you know you know out there that there is a topless a topless marijuana women you know image with peach and daisy that you know that that's a fucking thing it's out there i'm sure i'm you know that exists it has to exist i mean you know is that rule 37 or whatever this 34 34 sorry oh boy all right rule 34 dash 2 it's uh you know porn and pot related and combine you it's only 34 cents alright act deaf in chat says okay i'm done are you can you not even anymore in the chat room are you unable to even do i need to get you a pumpkin spice latte to calm you down alright anyway just saying okay well not to be outdone by the 3ds i know some of these women over here that have some other things that can calm you down alright um the vita is also they just received the 3.3 uh system update which also enabled themes so yes you can get themes and they're gonna um fall anywhere between a dollar to three dollars but um yeah so third party stuff first party stuff right now they've got stuff for tearaway freedom wars and uncharted golden abyss um so cool i want to know does that mean i can actually add themes to the playstation tv as well i mean is that gonna work oh that'd be kind of cool i would assume so but i'll see alright so cool alright themes everywhere you look this week well we're gonna take a look right now into our mailbag because every week we invite your emails at participate at orange lounge radio.com is where you can send us some emails again that's participate at orange lounge radio sorry i'm laughing because i'm reading chat the rage nator in chat says calm your marijuana tits hahaha i'm gonna say that to jamie just out of the blue at some point on next week's show and she's gonna be like what just wait for it alright calm your if we titled these episodes like we did horn house that would be the name of tonight's show calm your marijuana tits alright uh let's get to the emails participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send your emails we're gonna start off tonight i'm reading them of course because dark soccer is not here and i usually take them to the mailbag when she's not here uh our pal ea skeezy likes to send us emails uh here and there with his question of the week so let's get to it hey orange lounge sorry i haven't emailed in a while work has been crazy busy and i've been hooked on this game you may have heard of it's pretty popular lots of demons and undead endless waves of any mobs any guesses it's called diablo 3 you had no idea did you i just started playing and my life has been consumed i have to guess some of you rob feel the same way i do i don't know what you're talking about uh i swear i just got home and sat down on my pc and now it's 8 hours later and way past bedtime lol um if i wasn't like getting really old to the point where i get really tired at a certain hour like even on the weekends uh i would be doing that same thing like i will sit down and play diablo 3 and then all of a sudden it's like when did the sun go down when did that happen i don't remember that uh what are some of the best games you invested so many hours into that it has made you think damn this game has consumed my life and i need to take a break your best friend and lover ea skeezy from milwaukee wisconsin well that's awfully presumptuous but uh yes alright anyway uh what is uh a game that you've invested so many hours into it's made you think damn this game has consumed my life and i need a break loki skyrim oh and grand theft auto 4 okay and earth defense force 2017 all good answers like literally i think there was an entire year of this show where we go how was your gaming week grand theft auto how was your gaming week grand theft auto i'd still be playing grand theft auto if those fuckers would stop quitting before i beat the crap out of them there's grand theft auto 5 now and it's not quite the same uh jonas what what uh video game has consumed your life and you need to take a break um there's so many games i can list from like advanced wars the series because i've been playing it competitively back then even with the latest one obviously um ddr i'm pumping up obviously at one point i was gonna say ddr as well but see here's the thing about ddr i was never skinnier than when that game consumed my life so you know what there are pros and cons there's pros and cons it consumed the calories of your life it did it did it build the metabolism i eat like three plates of food and i burn it out like it's not a video game but cues are absorbed seriously i'd go play ddr and then it'd be like oh my god olive garden never-ending pasta bowls oh god that $100 possible for i'm not even talking about what they're doing now i'm talking about 10 years ago you know it was like hey the pasta bowl and breadsticks they were the same thing 10 years ago and it's like carbs ddr ddr ddr ddr carbs oh yeah um let's see luminous which is like a tetris like game that consumed us so much time only because i got so i got so addicted and consumed with the game that i pointed to play competitively and oopsie and of course monster hunter let me ask you a quick question does does the does the following song give you PTSD remember from luminous remember from luminous is the first stage oh my god you're a liar you didn't play the game you just looked up and thought it'd be a cool one to mention hey i mean i first got the game the psp when it first came out and stuff you just played the version with holla back girl that's that's what happened oh god and you were like this game is bananas uh diego how about you what game consumed your life actually sadly to admit at one point it was every quest ain't no shame in that this happens final fantasy 11 yeah right out of the mmo gotta bring up the mmo world of warcraft it happened look it happens i never touched that because i knew if i did it'd be over i knew it was gonna be over and you know they have free trials now i know the same thing my best friend was telling me you must play the free trials must touch you i said i said i don't want world of warcraft to touch me in any way shape or form but also uh definitely pokemon when it got to generation four because uh friend introduced me to it and it got really technical and very competitive and i said i don't want to i don't want to touch pokemon oh my goodness i'm sorry to interrupt i'm sorry to interrupt this is so important this was just linked in our chat room and i'm so sorry because this makes for terrible radio but it exists alan linked a picture it's rosalina topless smoking weed told you how did you fucking find that wow and of course of course it's on deviantart of course told you this is what's wrong with all of you oh my god it's like and just to describe it i can't believe i'm about to describe this picture is that really rosa it's only rosalina cause she's got a little star man buddy something and there's also a princess peach one if you saw she no i don't want to see i don't want to see it's not topless but oh my god well that fits the theme right there i mean uh and no i'm not linking it in the show notes you can do it alan did and google it yourself hashtag no it's fine hashtag hashtag hashtag alright uh where where were we i'm so sorry to interrupt but i think we went from every quest to final fantasy to uh topless marijuana yeah yeah that's what happened it was all in that order amazing it all makes sense too i'm just i i'm so i apologize to farsight studios it's probably gonna go back and listen to this show and they're gonna be like i was on a show with that it it's amazing well what can we lead up to oh my god anyway uh a game that consumed my life besides mmos and ddr how about this one y'all civilization civilization especially the original and then it was siv net oh my just one more turn right turn into siv four it's over yeah enough said with that one civilization would be uh would be mine right there so there it is thank you ea skeezy for that uh question let's go to another email here from azhp uh hey olr crew azhp here i heard you guys talk about uh the online educational game galaxies on the show yesterday and the studio seemed very positive about it as someone who lives with someone who works on the game i hear firsthand every single day about how the ceo has no idea what he's doing has never made a game before and ignores the advice criticism and general sense from his entire team oh boy this is well we're getting some some tea spill on this one aren't we trying to relax these yeah it's that educational game we talked about a little bit last week now i just want to say i'm just going to put disclaimer out here because i just want to make sure the opinion that i'm reading here is the opinion of the listener and does not necessarily reflect that i'm just going to make because this is this sounds like some pretty this is some gossip so get your coffee and uh let's see see some more here on the email here um continuing on the email he will ask for mini games to be coded in a single day and then ask why there are bugs in it he tells people that they should work on the weekends because that's what successful companies do and he once hired an incompetent socially inept crybaby programmer while his lead programmer was out on maternity leave even though he the CEO doesn't know the first thing about programming or making a game he also told his team when they asked for dedicated QA staff so they could focus on building of the game that quote there's no reason why all of us can't QA our own work 100% of the time then he finally caved and said i think i have a 9 year old nephew who can QA this game for us oh boy uh finally i've played the game in various stages of completion and i can assure you that as an engineer who grew up playing educational games the game is pretty pitifully simple in terms of science concepts even compared to some educational games from the 90s and the mini games themselves take some creative liberties with how scientifically accurate they are i'll be surprised if the game ever ships and i'm pretty willing to bet that if it does ship it'll be about as good as the Duke Nukem forever of educational games wow my jaw is on the floor with like the fucking like reading to filth going on in this mail just thought you guys deserved a more accurate picture of the game than the PR spin the New York Science Foundation puts on it because i think they're going to be pretty disappointed with the game if and when it actually does ship yours truly AZHP DAMN well uh i guess the only way to truly find out is to try the game for yourself once it comes out but that is um you know what let me say this let me try to pull what i possibly can out of this especially what it can apply to other stuff in the industry is that you know it does go to show that sometimes we get the feeling and i i don't know this guy and i don't know this company and i don't know you know the CEO or whatever but i have heard stories from other places about people in middle management at some of these companies who really don't seem to know a fucking thing about video games and the impression i'm getting from this email which you know again is i i can't endorse it officially but i can take it at face value i have heard from this listener before and they write pretty good emails i'm inclined to kind of go oh shit where there's smoke there's fire type of thing right so i mean we've heard about where people sometimes who are in the middle in the management so forth kind of don't seem to know what they're doing sometimes like and i get worried when i read that stuff about QA i think i have a 9 year old nephew who can QA this game for us that's not QA that's like test marketing or you know because obviously if it's an educational game then fine 9 year olds who the game's targeting but that's that's not QA a 9 year old is not going to explore every single nook and cranny of the game to intentionally try to destroy it a 9 year old doesn't have that type of attention span that's your focus group that's your test audience that's not QA so that right there i kind of go uh oh jonas you're kind of sitting back here going i heard about like the email dimension i think did it mention that something about working like weekends and all that other stuff oh yeah oh yeah you can't just mimic what other companies do for your own success you got to figure it out yourself oh yeah yeah i thought there were laws like actually against that ever since the whole ea incident like not if your contractor whatever i mean you can i think they can make up their own like rules you know when i heard that i was like oh shit we're going back to the what caught ea into a big strangle of legal situations and i'm not sure if it's a repeat of that a lot of reaction in our chat room i mean there's just a lot of people going wow wow wow like it looks like we have a bunch of doge in our chat room right now wow wow such wow much anger wow but see we have bochi kawa says someone had a little bit of pent up aggression although i can believe all of it which is terrible dungeon buster says sadly it's a story that i've read too often about a few other companies it's not crunch it's over time we just won't be paying you over time and ssj100 matt says plenty of companies pull shady shit the stories i could tell you that is true this isn't necessarily something and i don't know if ssj100 matt meant gaming companies or when he says plenty of companies he means like companies all over like not just necessarily video games and i would believe it i believe there's a lot more industries than just video games where this kind of fuckery goes on so a burnt out employee is not a happy employee and a happy employee is going to or an unhappy employee excuse me is bound to make more bugs whether they want to or not that a nine year old is not going to find in the game just saying so you better find that right balance so yikes well you know what um although i hope that doesn't start too much controversy if anyone from that team happens to be listening feels differently i would love to hear from you as well participate at orange launch radar.com it is the show where every gamer has a voice but uh wow hey you know what i appreciate all the perspectives well what a uh what a good that was our last of our email by the way so please send this email for a future week participate at orange launch radar.com that last email sure does make a good transition into one of our regular segments we do here on the show it is the FUs of the week uh Loki we'll start with you uh i feel the power outages because we keep having them for some reason i think someone ran into a power pole or something i don't know because i saw them fixing it the day after but we also had one this morning for no apparent reason and the thing it sucks is it shuts off you know the lights and the fans during the night you know that my son uses to keep himself asleep because he likes white noise and then everybody's up you know instead of us being able to sleep through the night so that kind of sucks i wish they would just fix that shit oh and and their ever helpful phone call which i don't even know how the hell they have my number anyways but they called me like an hour after the power outage was done like there's been a power outage i'm like no fucking shit really that was all the things turning off was that what that was i thought it was a ghost i mean seriously thank you smud for fucking calling me and telling me there was a fucking power outage like i couldn't fucking figure that out um i want to give an FU to destiny for not giving me better loot because i'd really like to level up past level 21 so uh FU you crap loot system uh and uh let's see i guess my other FU of the week goes to just being like really busy and tired i mean it's a good busy i can't complain but i'm just i'm probably spreading myself too thin again but um yeah there you go real quick about destiny if i played that say in the xbox 360 would my character level up and like if i bought that on playstation 4 or does that only work for playstation 3 to playstation 4 only works i believe from 3 to 4 i do not believe it works the other way around but check the bungee forums just to see uh jonas my friend how about you uh big FU to the whiners of people on facebook saying oh they're changing the name policy where people can put fake names this is by the way in response to like the LGBT community who's actually like drag queens trying to protect themselves and you're telling me that and people are telling me uh that they have to put their real names so what's gonna happen with the protection of um the um the drag queens and all the LGBT trying to keep themselves in the sequence i'm not saying anything bad but people are not understanding the situation right i use a fake name on facebook and it's because um i have had situations where in my professional life i've had people try to look me up online and they have found things in my past that they then would bring up in the workplace which is not appropriate you know what i mean so i keep my life separate so i have every right to do that and what really pissed me off in that whole thing and so FU to Mark Zuckerberg because he said something where people who don't use their real name don't have integrity fuck you for that comment fuck you because you obviously don't know what it's like to have a stalker so be seated have 50 seats the funny thing is that one of the main people on facebook said they're gonna change that policy so expect actual people i know they will they're gonna change it cuz you know they got pre- don't fuck with drag queens that's like one of the first rule of the cosmos and i realize this effect far more than just drag queens but the drag queens are the ones that are gonna throw the first rock alright anyways back on other FUs fuck it whoever reported me for reposting a video of oni chimbara for ps4 yeah because it was a not safe for work video aka a banana on the crotch and the whipped cream on the tits um fuck on chimbara gotta love oni chimbara it's a terrible game but did the person not know what they were gonna see when they clicked when they saw the word oni chimbara no comment fuck you back to the power outage big fuck you did that and to the whole how windows 8 requires always online only to update to windows 8.1 i had to update a computer that had to be updated from windows 8 to 8.1 99% complete power outage router's done oh fuck so yeah fuck i couldn't repair the computer it revert back to windows 8 and i told them look gotta do what i do and then i can't do it now because it's gonna take another 3 hours alright jonas 3 hours show one more ok one more is um my childhood who the fuck f you to whoever the fucking idea of putting a tetris movie we're gonna get to that later i love that though i think in the years this shows been on what for going on its 13th year next year right and i don't think we've ever had somebody come on and go f you to my childhood that's kinda sad it's because of that damn tetris movie which i guess will be explained later we'll talk more about that in a minute i promise alright diego do you wanna give some f you's to your childhood as well i'm still thinking about the childhood thing i could say a lot about my childhood but recently a friend f you to my friend who gave me a nintendo 64 challenge and i said sure i'll take it and he chose the games for me he chose superman 64 and castlevania 64 oh what a so i heard they sucked so easy though you gotta do like south park but yeah castlevania is easy all you need is the bobby bird thing it's all good yeah those games really suck they're horrible castlevania 64 that didn't exist to me that still didn't exist to me and also another f you to f you to the person when i well ok this is kinda weird but when i only went to the mall went to a public restroom and someone had diarrhea and tried to keep it quiet i could have gone without that wow and we could have gone without hearing about it just saying talk about an explosive day alright alright we're done we're done we're done that's it the f you's of the week segment has been cancelled no more alright alright let's move on we have some more news golly gee loki what could you possibly be talking about here next speaking of diarrhea uh some dumbass thought it was a great idea to hey let's slice this tetris and make it into a sci-fi movie oh it'd be the dumbass that was behind moral combat moral combat annihilation now to be fair the moral combat movies were good but i don't know how the fuck they're gonna pull out a sci-fi movie out of tetris i mean that doesn't that's like ok we wanted to make a sci-fi movie but fuck it we like some setris as well let's just throw it together but hey it's gonna you know it's gonna be something i guess i agree with tiger claw in the chat room the tetris movie just needs that mortal combat style soundtrack it's gonna be a very big epic sci-fi movie this isn't a movie with a bunch of lines running around the page we're not giving feet to geomet geometric shapes brands are the new stars of hollywood we have a story behind tetris which makes it much more an imaginative thing yes i remember battleship 2 that wasn't a very good movie ok but if they don't have like kmfdm are they still around but if they if they don't have like kmfdm or some type of industrial band doing a remix of if they don't have like the industrial yes we need the rom zobby version of that heavy metal that's what we need like during a big action scene imagine tetris the movie i'm sorry it's it's a puzzle game you can't fucking make movies out of puzzle games it doesn't fucking work unless i do something really fucked up it's gonna be and if it does work oh my god can you imagine all the knockoffs we're gonna get then it's gonna be like sudoku the mini series on television scrabble that yeah right then it's like scrabble the you know the sitcom coming to cbs i think that the farthest you can go to make a movie is based off of a board game maybe and that's where clue was clue was good cult classic right was it they're doing one for well they did witch port but now they have an ouija movie as well what i mean come on that's just a fucking paranormal movie um they had jumanji which technically wasn't a board game but it was you know based on a book about about like ants in my pants or uh don't break the ice they're gonna have candy land could they do crossfire how about i would watch a crossfire movie how about cootie i would fucking watch crossfire it's gotta be the retro futuristic thing though like fucking rollerball i'd watch a crossfire exactly gotta have a remix of the fucking commercial hell yes maybe tetris will go like the shark nato route or something where it'll be end up being like super camp like if terra reed is cast in the tetris movie then maybe it'll turn out okay like if they if they aim for camp and so bad it's good that would actually be i know that there's like that he was at the youtube trailer or something like that that someone did a funny like haha it's a trailer for a tetris movie because it's so ridiculous okay i mean it's stupid yeah i just don't want to see a real tetris movie i don't think it's it it doesn't make any fucking sense if you won't make a sci-fi movie make a fucking sci-fi movie there's plenty of properties you can license that are actually sci-fi that makes sense but don't just like i can't like fucking say okay i'm gonna take the game of poker and i'm gonna make it into a war action film it doesn't fucking make any sense although that would probably make more sense than this see act deft in chat says don't wake daddy would be a horror movie um the legend of zaku in chat says uh hungry hungry hippos the movie you know obesity that could well could be kind of like jurassic park what about mousetrap where like there you go oh there you go that would be a pretty sweet you know that was just the opening five minutes of pewie's big adventure it's really just you know all the videos for okay go but i mean i don't know mr t i like my cereal or jenka the movie yeah right yeah yeah thank god featuring the twin towers no no bad bad slap that is bad taste oh my goodness this is exactly what i'm thinking like what did they do with the tetris movie of all things i thought the only thing that the tetris thing worked in was that you remember that they have that little concept video for pixels or whatever that adam sandler's not gonna take his shit on but remember where they had you know the tetris blocks you know falling down stuff and knocking out buildings and stuff like that that was kind of cool this adam sandler movie probably not so cool but whatever light bright wait adam sandler's in the tetris movie no he's in the pixels movie oh god he's in the pixels i was like no no no gee how could the tetris movie get any worse no he's in adam sandler's in it wow it got worse movie the pixels movie which is about all the like retro 80s like you know things coming alive all the arcade characters and then also um he's in candyland which is gonna be terrible too so all right all right uh moving on one more story here for you guys and uh this is just kind of one of those hmm isn't that interesting sort of stories well a few weeks ago on the show we talked about how there was a former nintendo employee dan adelman and he left nintendo he used to be the guy that would work very closely with the indies to get them onto the wii u uh e-shop and you know he's responsible for some of these big titles coming over to the wii u and he actually left uh nintendo well uh he actually announced this week uh a game called axiom verge that uh he is uh working on he's involved with the development of this game it's a metroid castlevania style action platformer and it's being developed by tom hap who's a petroglyph games employee who makes independent games but here's the twist the game is going to be exclusive to playstation oh wow i've actually played the game snap girl i actually played the game actually oh during e3 oh i didn't know it is they actually had a small demo it actually looks really good yeah yeah i'm all for it feels like it feels like the more bloody like aliens or i'm not sure about the abadox sorry the one with it's more like abadox and aliens mixed with metroid so yeah it's gonna be a playstation 4 and vita and there was also a steam version that's in the works and uh you know dan edelman does say quote although i will always have a special place in my heart for nintendo fuck those guys no he didn't say that he said in my heart for nintendo this game is solely focused on playstation which surely you've gotta kind of go oh really but gotta get a ps4 now ah i was hoping there'd be a price reduction this year but they've been selling too well yeah they are they really are you probably won't see that probably just wait for some sort of bundle that you want i mean the other destiny one hopefully they'll have some new bundles or wait for microsoft to get desperate and cut the price of their console a little bit assuming it doesn't do well this year i mean till black friday yeah right isn't the xbox sort of like starting to get a little bit of the peak only because they don't include the connect um i mean it's not like you know xbox is not doing like awful but i mean microsoft wants to be doing better than they are that's for sure and they don't like this fact that they're lagging behind sony right now um so they're gonna probably you know if if halo doesn't really move some consoles and so forth they'll probably make a desperation move and that could be slashing the price of the console or maybe a redesign that would be cheaper parts who knows you know this is not before christmas not before christmas we're we're everything that's coming for the holidays you already know about at this point they're not going to do anything then but uh uh next year you never know what bundles they'll sell what games will be you know put together and so forth so all right well that does it for the news that we had on deck for tonight i don't even have skype open i better get that open because we do want to invite your phone calls at eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio except i am not logged into skype so let me check with loki real quick while i get onto skype and see if you have any last minute stories no don't the only story is i'm on almost a level thousand on clicker heroes yeah except you cheated i don't care i cheated because i want to stop playing this game and the only way to do that is to finish it so i am going to finish it whatever means necessary and yes you know the only thing that cheating does it means i don't have to spend my life playing this fucking game so i am going to ruin it for myself so i stop playing it that was the goal goal accomplished except i am still fucking playing the game so apparently there's still a problem there somewhere achievement unlocked indoor playing the game so much even though you wanted it's like i got to get all these stupid achievements that really mean nothing all right we got calls coming in so we got to get to it and take some calls here on orange launch radio hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is act deaf hey act deaf buddy how you doing well i got some beef from well of you from the beginning of the show uh oh what i do now i have a feeling i know what i did but what is it no you tell me what what did you do i bought crazy chocobo and you're probably not very happy that i did that but i'm just going to tell you deal with it and then sunglasses are going to fall from the sky and rest on my face that's what's going to happen uh yeah crazy chocobo that song oh my god i don't know how people love that song i check the i check videos on youtube for this crazy chocobo song on on teeter rhythm just to see how it how it's uh how it plays and people are oh my god this is my favorite song and i'm like what it is you know what i i will say this it is a lot more tolerable in a two minute chunk i will say that because they do have to crop it yeah it is a two minute song it's not that long so yeah it's pretty much the full song but yeah it's i don't know and i and i have said this before and before and and even i said it this week on twitter because uh i played a lot of teeter rhythm before uh smash released and and i really loved all the songs that they put from all the the final fan final fantasy 13 series uh 13 2 lightning returns especially lightning returns songs are really great yeah they really are yeah they are it kind of makes you want to play the game sorry uh i i still hear crazy chocobo and i'll go like uh yeah i don't know what went in the minds of of the composer there because yeah or or whoever worked on the soundtrack have you heard the titan song from final fantasy 14 because that's kind of a heavy metal song too i think so uh well at least from your streams i think i i have remembered that but yeah that's that's a good song because uh it at least i consider it a good song because it's uh at least it's coherent it's uh it's not played as funny yeah because like the crazy uh well not the crazy chocobo uh in particular all the the chocobo the chocobo songs are are funny are are simplistic are funny are are pretty much just to enjoy and crazy chocobo takes all that through the window and replace it with another thing that i i i i seriously seriously sorry can't comprehend why they did that well you know i in all fairness music is music and you know i sit here and i go how does one direction sell millions of albums it's not very good music but somebody out there likes it who's probably 12 years old but you know whatever so um uh is that it you just want to call and read me out for crazy chocobo or no i also want to talk about the smash brothers a bit because it's a really good game i thought you might what are your thoughts on it uh well you've pretty much uh nailed it at the beginning uh it has its flaws it's not perfect but it's the smash brothers it's it's an affordable it's something that i personally wanted since ever ever since the first measure probably melee that that we uh that that we should be able to play uh a smash or something on a portable yes uh whenever you uh whatever you go you have your if you have your 3ds in this case uh well you can play it and it's it's really good it's not a bad game it's not terrible it has again it's lost like the online component uh it's it's a little wonky especially uh with whoever you're playing with friends it's not it's pretty great i haven't had that many problems uh although i haven't played online with uh with strangers so i i don't know i i but the same thing i wouldn't i sorry i haven't been able to connect to a server or to uh to an image online that way so yeah uh yeah you know and it kind of makes me think like you know i said earlier in the show that the game uh maybe just isn't really for this particular console i mean it doesn't necessarily make it bad or whatever just you know i kind of think back like we've seen fighting games and games that were from um you know the the consoles ported to portable you know since we even had the original game boy like somebody put mortal combat on the original game boy and it's not that it was necessarily bad per se but it just really wasn't a game that was meant to be played on the game boy and that's kind of how i feel about smash and i realized some of the hardcore fans are going to be like no rob you're wrong this is a great thing because now we can play this whenever we want we don't have to have the tv and set it all up but i'm like yeah but you have to have four 3ds's and four copies of the game so you know maybe at conventions that'll work but i don't know i just i just see it as the as the appetizer for the main course that's coming in the wii u version oh yeah definitely though it's curiously because most of the people that are mostly hardcore for smash brothers say that the 3ds it's really awful and and they're waiting for the wii u version especially because yeah all the flaws that the 3ds has probably the wii u will fix them let's hope oh yeah that's the again it's the portable component if you can deal with with the bad the good stuff really really shines and something to just to finish this call before it gets too long uh something that the other rhythm and the smash brothers really does really great it's the music player having a music player there having all the songs really great something that a lot of games should do and uh even theater of them will play the cut scenes as well with little movies for the songs that it's appropriate for which is a great feature so oh yeah but especially the music player because you can uh have the 3ds in sleep mode you can close it and and just hear the songs on your headphones so yeah that's awesome that's awesome alright well act deft I'm gonna go ahead and let you go but uh thanks for the call I appreciate it hey thanks for having me no problem take care my friend alright let's see if we get another call in uh 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call uh so we start to wind down for tonight's program I'm heading over to twitter to see if we have any twitter topics that might have come in I'm not sure we have uh anything though what's that oh we have another call coming in thank you look at that diego's on it telling me when to uh check the skype hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hi this is regen here hey buddy how you doing oh pretty good how are you good what's on your mind um uh you know just a really quick question I thought I'd get you take on something um as you already know uh we've been uh you know seen a few more uh games appearing on scene recently I think uh what was it three four yeah three four seven yeah three four seven eight and they've announced 13 now yeah and plus uh what uh you love it and 14 are also on there well of course duh yeah uh now that being said what do you think the odds are that we'll see some of the other Final Fantasy games you know appearing schemes such as um I know Final Fantasy 9 Final Fantasy 10 10 2 um well the ones you're naming maybe not so much but I think the likely candidates uh and this is probably gonna kind of strike you as kind of uh well oh okay uh I would say five and six are very likely candidates and the reason why I say that is because they've already done those android versions and all they did was convert those android and ios versions for three and four I see no reason why they won't do them for five and six however I'm gonna warn you the outsourced sprite work in five and six is somewhat questionable I'm not sure it's giving you quite the same pure experience but if you've never played the games before and you don't exactly have the means to go track down like a gameboy advance or an old super nintendo which at this point how do you um I would say at least it's better than nothing so uh if those games do come out to steam and you haven't experienced five or especially six for gods sake six is one of the best they've ever made in my opinion I like it but it's my favorite one but if I don't know if you've played the android one it's just kinda it doesn't feel right oh the little reboot one yeah the app games and stuff yeah cause the original sprites I actually enjoyed the original stuff and when they tried to kind of bring it up to date it didn't feel to have the same feeling as it did before yeah it's something like the soul really gets kind of lost six is yeah definitely in my heart the best one in my opinion it's kind of like a fuck you old people we're all for the new people kind of thing yeah I don't know I don't know what the rationale was behind that but that's where it stands with those games but you know for better or for worse with our opinion on that I believe five and six are highly likely candidates as far as nine and ten and those others see that's where we get tricky cause now the hardware gets trickier and final fantasy nine in particular never had a PC release there's a big thing here where seven and eight were actually released on the PC in the late 90s and early 2000s yeah so those games were already out on the PC so again it was about adapting them they never did put nine on the PC for whatever reason so they would have to make a conscious decision to do that now I'm not sure that would happen I I think what's going to happen is where the iOS and Android goes Steam's going to follow but then you know I would have never guessed that thirteen was going to come out thirteen coming to Steam is kind of a huge surprise so you know what I guess anything's possible in that regard Spazinator but I would say five and six next if they all continue to sell well and if thirteen sells well maybe ten HD because they already clearly know how to port over PS3 code to run on the PC I would say ten HD would be your likely candidate next yeah I definitely hope that's the case because I love ten I beat it on to play season two god knows how many times yeah it's a good one it's a good one so great question though and I believe thirteen is on Steam this week right yeah in fact I got pre-ordered I just went in for the game to unlock so that's going to be nice to have the trilogy kind of all right there on the PC I think that'll be a lot of fun so alright well thanks for taking my calls definitely appreciate it alright take care of my friend alright bye-bye that was a good question there from Ragenator 1877 game OLR our username on Skype orange lounge radio looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and some of the thoughts they have Alan Alchemy reminds us we got the little EMU emulator for the LED Chocobo minigame for eight that's right that is there and Bob Coffee reminding us you can buy nine on the Playstation store easy and it works with the PS3, PSP and Vita we do have one more call coming in so this will probably be it for tonight let's go to the phones hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey what's up guys this is Kaijuto hey Kaijuto what's up my friend not much I'm gonna I'm gonna try to keep this real quick about what you said about the about the 3DS not probably not being the console for the Smash Brothers sure I disagree that's fine mainly yeah mainly the main reason why I disagree is what I noticed about myself is I'm not a hardcore Smash Brothers fan the only other Smash Brothers game that I own is Brawl and that was for the Wii so I'm not I'm not one of these people that have been playing for years and I've really gotten used to the GameCube controller you know I don't you know I don't come from that place so when I played on the 3DS I don't know what I'm missing I don't know what's changed and I'm able to adapt to the controls a lot better now I will agree that every now and then when I'm using the the circle pad I'll go to like maybe throw a punch and I think that I'm punching in the right direction I'll be punching somewhere else and that kind of gets frustrating but it's not something that happens all the time and it really doesn't affect my gameplay so I think that I think it's great to have it on the 3DS because I think that there may be a lot of little kids that are maybe like me which is funny to say but there's probably a lot of little kids that are like me who may have never played any of the other Smash Brothers games and this would be like a great little entry point for them you know and they could probably get used to it you know the controls on the 3DS really quickly and learn to play the game there you know I could I could remember being a little kid and trying to go to the arcade and trying to play Pac-Man on the big huge ass joystick and not being able to like reach the screen but when I got my little when I got my little tabletop Pac-Man I was able to kick ass on that I mean like literally just playing you know for hours and hours without dying and that's how I was used to playing but I know I'm pretty sure that there were adults who played in the arcade that was like what's this little tabletop shit you know like you know this isn't how you play you know this isn't Pac-Man you know what that's a really good comparison that is a really fair point I think in that respect especially I love that comparison with the tabletop Pac-Man where like when you're a little kid you don't care it's Pac-Man whereas like an adult gamer probably looks at that and goes what is that cheap knockoff garbage you know I don't think now obviously Smash Brothers is not knockoff garbage by any means it is still a good game I just believe it's biggest flaw is the system that it's on which is why I'm like I'm really excited for the Wii U version but you bring up a great point there's gonna be kids out there with like a 2DS even that like this is the way they're gonna play the game because maybe their family just doesn't have a Wii U or the little kid can't exactly monopolize the TV with their game console so this 2DS version is what they get so hook them early yeah exactly and I'm also about the porting issue you know from what you had mentioned earlier about you know how they had to take some characters out and tweak a few things just so that it's able to be played on the 3DS I feel that it's not really a direct port you know it's more of like it's more customized for the 3DS which I think is also a good thing and one last question I'll take this off the air but how do you guys think that it's gonna play on the Wii U with that I know that they have the GameCube controller that they're gonna apply to it but how do you feel that people are gonna be able to play with that big ass Etch A Sketch controller you know what I know a lot of people I know a lot of people rag on the gamepad but it honestly doesn't bother me like when I'm holding it like maybe it's just because I don't know maybe because I'm an older guy who's got big hands maybe like when I'm holding the gamepad it's just not really an issue to me but I don't I don't think about like I don't know why but when I'm holding like I hold my Xbox controller with two hands so when I hold the Wii U controller with two hands it really actually feels like a similar configuration it's just my hands are further apart but they it doesn't feel weird or anything cause the way the tablet's weighted or whatever like it feels very natural the Wii U controller is actually I think it's a great feel and I know some people think like what that thing is huge but it works I don't know I don't know and eventually I think sorry I didn't mean to cut you it eventually feels like it'll come down to preference just like when it transferred to the Wii when Brawl came out and now you have the nunchuck and everything and people have their preference and seeing that big controller actually the way I look at it I see it as like old school game gear if I think about it but it's pretty much like towards that it's just what they're feeling bringing back the old controllers the gaming controllers will bring back more feel to the old school stuff but that's because that was their preference too and that was just the demand but I don't really see any difference to people getting used to the new controllers and such but at least what is great about the Wii U version is that you get a choice you know and you can even use what we're hearing your 3DS as the controller if you want for the Wii U version so if you totally think I'm off base with what I'm saying and you enjoy the 3DS as a controller then you're going to be able to use that with the Wii U version so I think that's great that you're at least going to have those choices that you simply can't have on the 3DS and that's just the limitation of a portable gaming system right yeah I agree with that yep so thanks for taking my call you are welcome and a great show as always and have a good night quickly quickly favorite character in Smash gotta know has to be the Wii Fit Trainer I mean I kicked ass today with that like I haven't lost with her yet Rob the Robot is pretty good too but I'm hearing a lot about the Wii Fit Trainer the Wii Fit Trainer is one of my favorites as well like the Wii Fit Trainer is an awful lot of fun what about the dog from Duck Hunt? I haven't unlocked him yet I unlocked him but I haven't used him yet but I don't know it feels weird fighting the dog as much as I hate that dog it just feels weird to fight he has a duck on his back and it's just weird it's a weird character it looks like it should have been Nintendo or something Nintendo there you go that would have been something alright my friend thanks for the call appreciate it alright goodnight and take care buddy that was a great comparison that's why we love to hear from the listeners and take the calls live is because you know I might be sitting here saying one thing about the game but that comparison with the old school and I remember those things vividly in my head those 80's Pac-Man table tops and you can even see these like E3 at the museum and so forth they just like you look at like what a shitty port but again when you're younger it's like it's the real thing it's awesome on top of like the casual discussions I mean for 3DS if people will buy if they prefer more on the gun that people have preference of controls I do agree on him as well as he said about besides the competitors it's actually catering to the fans of actually Smash itself because as he says as a kid now they can have it handheld they can take it where they want to go rather than taking a humongous system which they can't which definitely will apply to them as well and then you know though it's a different entire game they'll get used to that too and still have fun it's still Smash Brothers as the thing you'll always have that and the developers themselves said it's a fine balance between the casual brawl and the competitive melee to the upcoming Smash games and sometimes with our conventions we try to separate that too that's the one thing that some of our staff applied is that you have these kids that go to these conventions and they want to play the game but then you have the competitors there at the same time they're mashed in there but then they're not having fun so what one of our staff has done is made two separate tournaments a kind of a peewee division to separate them where they can use items and so forth because they want to play with that stuff they want to have fun not to show that the parents look at this and say that I think my child just wasted his money just to go here and get bummed off by these kids that just are not showing any sportsmanship towards the game especially to the little kids as well but that's why we separate the two sometimes just to have the fun now in the online mode you have for fun and for glory and that sounds almost exactly what you're talking about there is how you're kind of splitting things that's how it should be actually that's how it should be because there's two different scenes great wow very cool to kind of hear how that plays into the tournament stuff that you guys do there let's see actdeft in chat says why didn't I get asked that question about my favorite character because you would have picked Kirby or clearly if you know actdeft you know he loves Kirby or maybe I suppose maybe it could have been Meta Knight or Dedede or one of the other characters in those games but I kind of just have a feeling here alright anyhow that is about going to do it for another episode of Orange on its Radio it's been a long show tonight but a fantastic show I want to once again thank Bobby King and Farsight Studios and wish them the best of luck with the Addams Family Kickstarter which as we saw in our Fugu Question of the Week tonight there's a lot of love for the Addams Family out there so if you don't mind putting down the money now to make sure you're going to get a copy of the table when they finish that then they can get all that licensing they need to finish it up and it looks like, although it looks really good remember they have to hit that goal or they don't get any of it so we're going to keep our fingers and toes crossed for them DarkSaraka sadly she's already left but she will be back next week on the show we already got her final thought earlier Diego, Jonas, thanks for being back again tonight Always a pleasure It's been fun having you guys drop in over the past couple months and it's good to hear what you guys are up to good luck with all the tournaments and having to work Smash 3DS into your rotation now Looking forward to it on October the 10th it's already getting pretty hyped and I'll be looking, definitely That'll be a lot of fun Final thoughts tonight, Jonas, I'll start with you your final thought With October being busy and with Smash coming up I want to see how this develops and how it can integrate for future events so and I'll be honest hopefully with the upcoming Smash comes up people can stop talking about too heavily people can say Project M don't get me wrong, it's a game for people who could cater to that but I can't have that requested because we don't want to be in trouble with legal issues it's what it is with the whole hacked version Diego, your final thought tonight Like I said, kind of going off what he said about upcoming games and such we got a lot of stuff on our plate that we hopefully would present out to the community as we try to do throughout the years and definitely looking forward to not just Smash but also November when Pokemon Omega, Ruby and Sapphire Alpha, that's definitely going to be a big thing because Pokemon is another big scene too oh yes and when that comes out, and I've never played the third version and I'm glad they brought it out in 3D and I will definitely be the first time ever I'll play that I always try to get into Pokemon and I usually get to the first or second gym and then I just, I can't and the games won't allow me to not collect every single Pokemon along the way even though Shane, who's very into Pokemon won't tell me, don't play it that way and I tell you, the game has changed so much since it first came out because everything, as people say, was so much broken but it's definitely a deep game speaking of Pokemon I thought you had discussed of course the Pokemon Regionals coming up next week now will be the last of the Pokemon X1 until they start moving on to Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire so that should be a fun series of tournaments going on for Regionals you guys are going to be tournamented out by the time Christmas comes around but I guess I can't really so many things that get in order well thank you guys again for being here I'm sure next month or so thank you for having us again you're welcome, anytime it's always good to have the mixed perspectives where would we be without you guys? if we have gotten to topless marijuana Rosalina, without you guys I don't know I forgot the order of how that all started Loki, my friend, your final thought tonight I'm confused, I went to this Nexus games website and they have their Brickblast U game which they on the one side it says Family Fun Entertainment and for some reason they have a mature rating marked on that, which I don't think that even went through the ESRB and I'm pretty sure they mocked that up because it also says their website and quality stuff that you can look forward to in a Minecraft clone coming soon yeah, and my final thought is I'm going to work on my games more alright, good luck with that as I do every show, I'm just going to say please help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio, if you enjoyed the show please tell a friend or five or fifty about the program, five star reviews on the website where you found this show goes along with iTunes Stitcher Radio, all those places go a very long way in helping people discover the show, remember we don't have a mega budget behind the show, all we have is you guys, our OL army as we say to help spread the word, definitely, definitely, we will definitely same one will be on October 10th, we'll definitely spread that out, heck yes especially for our next coming streams definitely we'll give you a shout out, awesome once again we apologize for not bringing more people but we're still working on that it's not that big of a space I do still have a final thought I want to get out here but I do want to, well let me give my final thought here this was a little bit more of a personal note and it's going to come off as a little bit random but it's something kind of important I want to make sure I mention because I've told the cast and the people of this directly impacts about it so now I can be a little more public with this, but as you guys know, I have before I got to Orange Lounge Radio I used to do another show Understation Live with Travis and Jessica I was born of the Rocky Horror Picture Show community and you know cult movies and cult cinema that's something I've done on and off since 1998 and even until these past few years I've been working very closely with a local group with the Sacramento Horror Film Fest which is actually going on next weekend which is why I can't go to your shindig but that's going on next weekend you know that whole thing keeps me very busy but I kind of got to this point where it was like alright I'm doing more and more and more broadcasting I'm doing more and more with this I've got too much on my plate something's got to give so I actually have made a decision to end my 16 year career with the Rocky Horror Picture Show so Halloween is going to be my farewell show as the director and as a regular performer so if you are in the Sacramento area and you need plans for Halloween I encourage you to come on out because that's actually going to be my final show so which is you know it's a little bit difficult personally especially all the history and the fact that like wow would I be here where I am with OLR if it wasn't for that and I don't know but the good thing about that is that this will allow me to continue to focus on broadcasting and this hobby and you know doing more things like livestream and more things like YouTube and all of that and VOG and so forth so and that doesn't mean I still won't continue to support my friends over at the SAC Horror Film Fest and in the Rocky Horror Community and cult cinema in general I just have to support them in other ways now instead of unnecessarily getting on stage so that's just why I wanted to get off my chest so thank you guys very much for indulging
