0	17400	This week we bid farewell to the Attack of the Clones as Google and Apple decide that
17400	20920	their stores have too many flapping things. Rumors on the future of gaming are increasing
20920	24640	and we may be hearing much more at GDC next month. Pour another one out for Flappy and
24640	27200	join us for all this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27200	38040	Oh my god, don't pour the liquor out. That's alcohol abuse. Don't do that. Hi everybody.
38040	41120	Out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer
41120	48320	has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live tonight with episode number 541 for
48320	54240	this February the 23rd of 2014. And let me just start off by saying, happy birthday,
54240	58960	mom. Her birthday is February 23rd. I know she's not listening because Rob, your show
58960	65200	is weird, Rob. People on the internet tune in to hear you talk about games, Rob. But
65200	70360	anyway, yes it is my mother's 73rd birthday today. So happy, happy birthday. Anyhow, yes,
70360	75680	my name is Rob Robertson joining me as always in the studio. Happy un-birthday, DarkSakura
75680	80300	or Jamie Summers. Yeah, but I brought you presents. You did. We are having an un-birthday
80300	86780	celebration today. You're worth $7. That's right. Oh no, more like $10. DarkSakura sent
86780	89820	me a text a little bit before the show and she says, do you want anything from the dollar
89820	94380	store? And I was like, what, what does a person need from the dollar store? Well, it wasn't
94380	98100	at the dollar store, it was at the Dollar General, which is a little different. The
98100	103100	Dollar General basically, it sells just stuff cheaper, but it's not like a dollar store.
103100	107140	Oh, I just thought it was the, yeah, they're all the same. They have their own off-brand
107140	113140	stuff, but the Dollar General is special to me because I'm from Alabama and I didn't
113140	117700	see one like at all in this state until like a year ago. And I was like, I'm buying everything
117700	121780	there. Is it like that in the rest of the US? Because it really feels like here in California,
121780	125340	like those dollar stores and those 99 cent stores, like they're a dime a dozen. They're
125340	129500	like every strip mall has one. It seems like there's 99 cent stores, but the Dollar General
129500	134700	has been like, we used to go there when I was a little kid and it was just like the,
134700	138900	the cheap goods, you know, they had their own knockoff brands. They were basically Walmart
138900	142820	before Walmart was big. I remember when those stores, you know, since it is a video gaming
142820	147300	show, I will say, I remember when those stores used to sell like dirt, cheap, crapple of
147300	151500	video games. Like I'm not even talking about like overstock. I'm talking about like, like
151500	157460	real crapple of crappy Blu-rays. Every so often they'll have something good. But I mean,
157460	163860	it's mostly like shit and Bible books. Um, and the, the stuff that made, made on T or
163860	169540	as seen on TV, lifetime movies. No, no, no. I mean the products like the pet, the pet
169540	174860	egg, which I like those things, but, and I almost bought an aluminum wallet except it
174860	179680	was blue and ridged and I need a new wallet, but I don't want another aluminum. I will
179680	183320	say this. So, you know, duct tape to make wallet before I introduce our third host here
183320	188160	on the show. I will say, um, one great thing I do love to get at 99 cent store is candy.
188160	191660	That's, it's a great place to load up on junk food. Decent candy. And they also have a good
191660	195200	selection of ice cream, but I don't really, and they have wine and it's actually where
195200	202840	I buy my Menneshevitz for when they make blackberry sangria. Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
202840	207240	We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right
207240	212160	after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Uh, going to our chat room, uh, I see Gio Videa is there
212200	217080	saying, I love Dollar General. Their chocolate fudge cookies rock. I would've never thought
217080	223040	to get cookies at the dollar store. It's not a dollar store. It's just a cheapo store.
223040	227480	If they put dollar in the name, it's a dollar store. Well, but keep in mind the Dollar Generals
227480	231520	existed before they were like the big chain of dollar stores. Okay. You remember going
231520	238520	to Daiso with me? It's sort of the, the redneck kick equivalent of Daiso without all the neat
239280	243960	Japanese stuff. Is it like Wise Buys? Isn't that the $5 store? Not really. Wise Buys is
243960	250160	gone anyway, but like, like I bought you candles there and they're, they smell good. Yes. So
250160	253340	thank you for the gift. And I bought makeup there. I bought makeup today. I buy my, my
253340	257760	hair conditioner. That was the one thing I did tell dark soccer. I wanted, I said, you
257760	260760	know, if they have dollar candles, I like things that smell like dessert. And she brought
260760	264280	me a vanilla candle. And I also brought you a tropical something or the other. It just
264320	270320	smelled sort of like, like Hawaiian pizza. So fine, but I love Hawaiian pizza. Why not?
270320	275160	All right, look, uh, let's introducing to the show via the Skype line again tonight
275160	278760	because he is on a, you know, baby leave for a little bit from the show. But say hello
278760	284020	everybody to tech master. Loki. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Loki. I'm doing good now. So
284020	287600	for the people that were concerned about your headset and things like that last week, we're
287600	290880	here in a, you're in the kitchen now. You're in a little bit of a better place, right?
290880	295160	Well, also I was trying to juggle, like getting Josh ready for bed and stuff like that. And
295160	300720	so I kept, I, my headset has a mute on it too. Yeah. And so that's probably the sound
300720	305160	people were hearing is because I, I didn't want to hit mute, walk away from my computer
305160	309760	and then you guys are trying to talk to me and I can't talk back. So I tried muting myself
309760	313340	on my headset, but it makes a lot of noise when you do that. So, well, how dare you have
313340	319240	the priority of being a father first? How, how very dare you? I'm trying to get better
319240	325320	at juggling it. Hopefully I'll be back soon. Cause God, I need to get out of here. Well,
325320	328680	well we miss you buddy. And we know you'll be back soon. And uh, you know, when you come
328680	335060	back, dark Sakura has her Hanukkah winter festival, Jumis gift here waiting for you.
335060	338860	So you have that to look forward to. Awesome. Which might be moving to the new place, which
338860	343640	I'll talk about. And yes, there's going to be a new place. I kind of forgot what I got
343640	349080	you. We're going to have to open it and then repackage it. I think I know what I got. No,
349120	352560	I know. I remember, but I just don't remember what exactly was on it. Hopefully it's not
352560	358520	perishable. No, unless I stab it. I will say this though, Loki, you know, because uh, Jason
358520	362320	was, was kind of taking your seat for a while here on the show over the winter when, uh,
362320	366000	you know, he was here, but he's back in Colorado now. So we don't have anybody in studio tonight.
366000	369800	I do have somebody that's going to be coming in early March. So I'm excited about that.
369800	377480	Um, but until then, my copy of bravely default is sitting in your chair. So bravely default,
377480	381800	do you have any comments on, uh, tonight's topic bravely default? Do you go to the, the
381800	384480	dollar store?
384480	395480	All right. What are you? What was that? I'm sorry, Jamie. I'm afraid I can't answer that.
395480	402440	That's Loki now. All right. Uh, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, uh, for you
402440	407160	guys. And I don't have a whole whole lot tonight, but I know one thing that's been capturing
407840	412920	America's attention, nay, the world's attention. This has been capturing everybody's attention
412920	420040	throughout the world is not the Olympics, but the phenomenon, no, no, no, no, no, no.
420040	425120	For me, it's totally been that lady that did all of those triple jumps in figure skating.
425120	431120	Um, mal something for me, it's the old lady that was taking the picture of herself and,
431120	435000	and took a picture of her eyeball. It's out there on tumblr somewhere. Anyway, what I
435000	441120	really wanted to talk about was twitch plays Pokemon. Everybody's talking about this. I,
441120	443800	in fact, I know we brought it up a little bit on the show last week. You were talking
443800	447720	about this last week on the show because it was still kind of like a new concept. And
447720	452200	uh, now, you know, twitch plays Pokemon. It's still going. Um, I just checked in before
452200	456040	the show. Now, if you guys don't know what twitch plays, Pokemon is, I mean, I don't
456040	460040	know how you've escaped it this whole time, but let me tell you, uh, the popular game
460080	464840	streaming network twitch.tv has a channel on there that's called twitch plays Pokemon.
464840	469800	And, uh, what's happening is that they're playing through Pokemon red, but nobody's
469800	473600	actually sitting there playing the game on their webcam. Like you usually see on,
473600	479600	on twitch channels. Instead, all the controls are dictated by the input of the chat room,
479600	484520	which is pretty hilarious when you consider the twitch TV has that 42nd buffer. So nobody's
484520	491520	really playing it in life. So in, in a sense, Twitch is playing with this, this giant ball
491520	496280	of nonsense. Now I know they added into it not that long ago, this whole thing where
496280	501520	you can go democracy or anarchy, and if it gets into democracy, then, then the rules
501520	506240	change a little bit. But I, every time I've checked in with it, it's never been in democracy,
506240	508880	although maybe they, maybe they finally got it there and some of the worlds they were
508880	514360	stuck in. But, um, it's so interesting to me how this has become such a phenomenon.
514360	519000	Why I, and I'm going to ask this of our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
519000	525000	Why are we fascinated with watching Twitch plays Pokemon when it's essentially randomness?
525000	530680	It, I mean, it ends up being randomness in a way, isn't it? Loki, why is America and
530680	533880	the world obsessed with Twitch plays Pokemon?
533880	540120	Um, well, I don't know. People like Pokemon. They think it's kind of funny that, you know,
540120	547720	the hilarity of crowdsourcing actual, um, you know, gameplay is kind of hilarious.
547720	551280	But what's interesting, and I see a lot of folks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
551280	557560	Tiger Kala says, did you hear about Twitch plays Pokemon, plays Tetris, and VX Jason
557560	561240	is there saying, where is Twitch plays Super Mario now and so forth. Now there's all these
561240	565560	knockoffs. You know, we have Twitch plays everything else. You know, like the dude that
565560	572520	did Twitch plays Pokemon there, that channel consistently has like 60, 70,000 people watching
572520	576280	that channel. I think everybody wants a little slice of it. If you even look in the chat
576280	582160	room amongst all the up, down, anarchy, you know, chat commands that are going in there,
582160	586160	I do see people that are spamming for their own channels.
586760	591920	Hell, I was doing a Twitch channel, uh, earlier this week of the Final Fantasy 14 beta on
591920	596080	PlayStation 4, cause you know, it's got the built in streaming and somehow I was able
596080	600040	to get into the Final Fantasy 14 beta when a lot of people weren't like, I think I just
600040	604520	got in there so quick that the servers went down after I got in. So I had quite a few
604520	608840	people watching my channel at one point and I guess it was to the level where somebody
608840	613560	came in and spammed my channel, putting a link to their own channel. And I was kind
613600	619240	of like, Oh, I guess I wear that as a badge. Yeah, I'm famous. Somebody found my channel
619240	623000	worthy enough to come spam their own channel. And I guess, you know, as much as I want to
623000	627000	be pissed off about that, I was like, Ooh, that's kind of, kind of neat there. Well,
627000	630840	really, you know, if we want to figure out what Twitch plays, Pokemon's about, we really
630840	637840	should consider, um, asking the helix fossil. What is this? You don't know what the helix
638840	645440	fossil is? Uh, I feel like I should and I don't. Can you explain it? Apparently they
645440	652440	keep bringing up the helix fossil in inventory, uh, during Pokemon. Oh, yeah. I got, I thought
654720	658440	I'd like for some reason my mind was going to like another game. Yes. God, that was even
658440	663960	happening while I was watching the channel just a minute ago. Yes. God, I do feel stupid.
664520	669040	Well, in full disclosure, I never really got into, I didn't get into the Pokemon series
669040	673640	until a little later. I never really played red and blue that much. I did have yellow,
673640	678640	but we still have our red and blue. Do you really? Yeah, we do. Wow. And yellow. So,
678640	685640	uh, uh, hit son. Now is not the time to use that. Yes, exactly. Um, let's see. Raginator
689080	693520	in chat says even Adam Sessler parodied the Twitch Pokemon thing. Well again, it's, you
693560	698040	know, when you've got 60, 70,000 people, everybody wants a little piece of that, right? So I
698040	703040	mean even Adam Sessler ain't above trying to get a little piece of the whole, you know,
703040	709040	Twitch Pokemon thing, which is, you know, it's fine. So, um, but yeah. Do you guys think
709040	712720	that this is a trend that we're going to see continue in gaming, this whole crowdsource
712720	717620	gaming, or has this, is this shit already old? Because for me, like the Twitch plays
717620	722020	Pokemon thing, like, okay, it's funny. It's, it's cute to check in on once in a while.
722020	725820	It's, it's, it's neat to see that they like, that the whole thing just hasn't collapsed
725820	731020	on itself that, you know, the guy hasn't died that, that they have progressed in the game
731020	734620	and they have made progress in the game in spite of, um, you know, all the randomness
734620	739420	or whatever. But like, I don't, I don't want to watch Twitch plays Mario brothers and Twitch
739420	744500	plays Tedros. Like they're trying to do, I think Twitch plays Zelda. I thought I saw
744500	748780	happening and I don't think that's actually going to work out. But, but the joke is getting
748780	752540	old. It's getting really old. Do you know what I mean? Well, I think you'll see more
752540	758660	like, um, you know, more interactive stuff with Twitch, you know, not necessarily Twitch
758660	764100	plays Pokemon, but another good example would be Salty Bet, where it's just a Twitch screen,
764100	768260	Twitch stream, but there's other elements in there. Like you're, you're betting on two
768260	773820	computer players playing, you know, a fighting game. And I think that's kind of cool, that
773820	777980	kind of stuff. Yeah, that's, that's a lot different. And I do think that's pretty neat.
777980	781940	And there is also, was it the other survival horror game that allows, you know, Twitch
781940	787140	integration where like if you type stuff in chat, which I think this is going to be abused
787140	792260	like crazy, but if you type certain things in, you know, to the chat, um, it'll actually
792260	798060	spawn sounds in the game. So like maybe like, you know, Outlast or whatever, you know, creepy
798060	802180	guy jumps from the wall, you know, or something like that and have some sort of interaction
802180	806820	that way. You know, now that you bring it up, um, I'm, I'm glad I thought of this because
806820	810820	I think we are seeing this a little more in the modern consoles because I do recall
810820	816700	while playing Tomb Raider on PlayStation 4, the Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on PlayStation
816700	820720	4, I was doing some live streaming the first day I had that and people were coming into
820720	825420	my Twitch channel and there were all these people saying, revive, revive, and then someone
825420	829860	come in and say, die, die. And I was like, what the shit is this? Why do people keep
829860	835140	coming in? Well, A, it's not nice to tell somebody to die, but B, they're, they're saying
835140	838300	revive, so I couldn't figure out what the hell it was. Well, apparently there's some
838300	841340	type of feature and, and the chat might have to help me out here cause I don't remember
841340	844660	exactly the specifics of what the future was, but there's some type of feature that's either
844660	848740	built into the game or coming to the game where people can like, I think it's more for
848740	853980	the multiplayer modes, but they can like actually help give your character health or hurt you
853980	858300	as you're playing, like cause more monsters to spawn or something like that through your
858300	861340	Twitch stream. And so when you were talking about the survival horror, it almost made
861340	866020	me think of that, like that, that's kind of here in a triple A title already. I'm being
866020	870620	hilarious with like a shmup. Bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet. Yeah,
870620	875340	right. So it's very interesting at kind of what we're getting to now where, uh, you know,
875340	879180	you do have that kind of interaction, but that's, that's a little different to me than
879180	883940	the just total randomness of Twitch plays Pokemon. I mean, it's pretty cool the phenomenon
883940	887540	that they've gotten as far as they have. I didn't, I didn't recognize the area they were
887540	890740	in when I checked in on the feed last, but I know they've got at least like four or five
890740	895900	badges at this point. You know, they're doing pretty well, all things considered. So, um,
895900	899180	but yeah, as far as like Twitch plays Super Mario Brothers and all, somebody in chat was
899180	907060	talking about, uh, Team Meat was talking about Twitch plays Super Meat Boy. No, no, no. Until
907060	911220	they fix the whole latency problem, that's not going to work. Yeah. Right. That's, that's
911220	916020	another issue. Um, Hey, speaking of jokes that are beaten into the ground, I need to
916020	920340	give a plug for this. This is going to be a great transition. Uh, have you guys heard
920340	927180	about Flappy VOG? I sure hope so. Right. It's vognetworks.com. Oh, our own parody,
927180	932500	our own piece of the pie. Hey, we're not, we're not above all that. Just saying. It's
932500	938100	our own, uh, uh, Flappy Bird knockoff game, but you know, what's notable about it is,
938100	942320	and I didn't really realize this until the man said it earlier tonight on his own show,
942320	947760	but it's Bobby Black Wolf's first published game. Apparently I always thought he had done
947760	951640	stuff a while ago when he was making the music for games and all that, but apparently,
951640	955840	apparently not. He would start things, then not finish them. And in his words, anything
955840	961600	about that. Yeah. Right. Loki. Hey, I don't know anything about starting projects and
961600	965480	not finishing them. Hey, I'm just as guilty. Right. But I think, you know what, what Bobby
965480	971960	said about the process of game making is true about a lot of things in life. The first 90%
971960	979040	easy last 10% hard, the hardest part, if you can get through that last 10%, then that's
979040	982800	how you know, you're going to get there. So, um, you know, again, that credit for that,
982800	988720	uh, thought to, um, Bobby Black Wolf and his program, but yes, Bobby Black Wolf has created
988720	992440	flappy vog. And I know we talked about this on the show last week, but it's important
992440	998880	to note that tonight character pack one was unleashed upon the world. So now you've gone
998920	1007920	from four playable bouncing heads to 11, 11 there. Uh, and, uh, dark Sakura is now in flappy vog,
1007920	1012560	right? Yes. And, uh, what, what do you, do you remember some of your catchphrases that are in
1012560	1019200	flappy vog? How does it feel to suck? Yep. Yes. She says that as one of the death noises. Yarp.
1019200	1022880	So you'll hear, welcome to the fantasy zone. There you go. Don't give them all away. Give
1022880	1026880	them a reason to go play. That's the first one. So I said they're trying to do it like the space
1026880	1031760	Harrier guy. So it's a welcome to the fantasy zone. There you go. Get ready. A little over the
1031760	1037200	top. Uh, and then, uh, let's see, I know the gals from electric sisterhood are in there and, uh, I
1037200	1044400	think it was a pandalicious crack me up. Uh, I was playing with her and, and, uh, her character and
1044400	1049920	I hit a wall and she said something like, and I just died. It was just the delivery of it was
1049920	1055680	great. And, uh, I know the three folks from anime jam session are over there. Rama, Mika Chan and
1055680	1060880	Ari Rockefeller. They are all in the game now. And, uh, I feel like I'm leaving somebody out.
1060880	1064640	I am grandpa. Oh shit. Oh shit. I left out grandpa from courthouse. Oh,
1064640	1068560	I'm going to get a nasty email on that. I said, fuck. I said, flap yourself.
1070160	1075360	Well, grandpa straight up got censored in one of his lines. And I'm curious if it was something
1075360	1081360	grandpa did or if Bobby was like, uh, I had to put the bleep down. I really actually forgot the
1081360	1087200	rest of the stuff I did. So it's all good. It was great. So, um, anyhow, I know everybody has
1087200	1091040	been asking, well, when's Loki going to be in the game? When's Loki coming to the game? And all,
1091040	1096800	all I'm going to say about that is that, um, this is not the last character pack that's going to
1096800	1102160	happen. And, um, you never know what to expect. That's all I can say. You never know what to
1102160	1107680	expect. Uh, but I will say that we're not going to drag this joke on forever. Probably the next,
1107680	1111360	I mean, this is really up to Bobby Black Wolf, but probably character pack two is probably going
1111360	1115600	to be the last one because Bobby might want to move on to another project there in the future.
1115600	1123280	So we'll see. All right. Um, Bobby's clarifying with me. He sent it to me bleeped. All right.
1123280	1128240	Good to know. Good to know. Grandpa was showing such great restraint, even if it sounds like he
1128240	1137360	taped his lines at 2 AM. I like vodka. You know, grandpa's trademark line, right? I like vodka.
1137360	1142320	Well, when you're playing a flappy vlog, it's like, I like vodka. Speaking of which Rob,
1142320	1149760	yes. Did you ever try the vanilla vodka I made? No, I keep forgetting. I have half a shot. I'll
1149760	1153360	have half a shot because I got to go pick up. I've made a whole bottle worth of it now.
1153920	1160560	Nice. And I'm making another one that's vanilla bean with, um, uh, vanilla cream and dark
1160560	1164240	chocolate. You're quite the little distiller now, aren't you? I'm not distilling it. I'm just
1164240	1170000	infusing it cause, um, cause I keep forgetting that I can't actually eat the sweets. So I just
1170000	1177440	throw them in vodka now. All right. Vodka. Grandpa has to come have my vodka. Maybe I'll take him
1177440	1182240	some next time I go visit. Cause I'm going to pay him a visit, I think twice in March. So, uh,
1182240	1187360	I'll, uh, help him out. All right. Uh, anyhow, so we've talked about a variety of things there
1187360	1191840	at the top of the show. Let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games
1191840	1195760	that you have been playing this week. Dark soccer. I know you told me before the show,
1195760	1199680	you didn't get to play a lot this week, but did you get to touch anything at all? I did. I'm
1199680	1203440	actually trying to play through a bit more in mass effect three now that I've been able to
1203440	1207520	play with hairs and play dress up with my shepherd because you've never beaten mass
1207520	1215680	effect three before I'm on my 17th playthrough. Something like that. Um, I also, um, I've been
1215680	1221040	playing animal crossing, of course. Um, I'm getting back into playing Zelda and I bought
1221040	1224880	some games, but I haven't played them yet. I bought far cry three since it's on sale.
1225760	1232400	And, um, I also, uh, downloaded league of legends because there's a couple of guys on my team who
1232400	1238400	are at, uh, at the land of cubicles and tech who are completely into it, who have, uh, made it
1238400	1244240	interesting enough for me to give it a try. Also, Brad, I would send you some vodka, but I don't
1244240	1248480	know how I'll probably have to get a flask to set it to you in. So off to the dollar store,
1248480	1256480	I go to buy a flask. Um, I, I'm dying to play more league of legends, but I am terrible at it.
1256480	1261600	So if we can get like a league of sucky people together to play, that would be great. Team suck.
1261600	1268240	Yes. Team suck it. That's it. By the way, I also downloaded a game that's, it's a visual novel
1268240	1273120	called go, go, go Nippon, which is basically like you're a tourist in Japan, just looking at
1273120	1278880	touristy stuff. It was three bucks. I was like, well, why not? You know, so I'm playing, um,
1279520	1287040	I didn't start it, but I, uh, I have it. And I know you told me, huh? You might probably
1287040	1293440	about to say, I think so. I did buy Strider. Dan's already been playing it. Um, it, for some reason,
1293440	1298560	it doesn't run very well on his computer, but he also had it hooked up to the rig and it was in
1298560	1305760	three screen mode. So, um, I'm going to be hopefully playing that tomorrow night and, uh,
1305760	1309600	yeah, cause it's fucking Strider and Strider is awesome. And for people, I know I've said it
1309600	1316480	before, but if anyone remembers back in the day, Neo Strider's Strider zone, that was Dan's website
1316480	1323200	and he had like one of the only Strider websites on the internet in the mid to late nineties.
1324000	1331200	Um, so yeah, it was pretty cool. Um, I know I played something else, but for the life of me,
1331200	1337760	I can't remember what it was. Um, I'm trying to think because I did, um,
1338960	1342400	I guess I don't remember anymore cause my week has just been sort of,
1343360	1348880	I think I'm going to play this game. Oh wait, no, I'm not. And I bought some other game too,
1348880	1354080	and I don't remember what it was, but yeah, I, I buy a lot of games and I forget what they are.
1354080	1359520	So thank you steam. Thank you for taking $10 of my hard earned cash,
1359520	1366960	which I can actually say now it's hard earned. Yeah. All right. Oh, Oh, wait. I did. I bought
1366960	1372800	Gullvilleous on my phone from last week. Yeah. Since I mean, I could just bust out the master
1372800	1378160	system and play it, but it's kind of cool having it on my phone. So yeah, I bought Gullvilleous
1378160	1381760	nice. Now I'm done. All right. Let's go over to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1381760	1388080	Um, well actually tend to fate still and played, um, some more, well, the last little bit of the
1388080	1394320	Titan fall, um, beta on my new laptop. And thankfully it, it ran a lot better on my new
1394320	1401680	laptop and the fact that it didn't melt down. Um, I played, let's see what else was there.
1401760	1408400	Played some flappy vog. I'm just, I don't know why. Um, and then I played, uh, earth
1408400	1415600	defense force 2025 because it's awesome. That's why, but yeah, earth defense force 2025. It's
1415600	1420160	fantastic game. I really wish I had got to play a little bit more of that, but I've been just so
1420160	1427440	busy with stuff. Um, but it's everything I loved about the, you know, 2017 and better. I don't
1427440	1432720	know. It's just, it's going to be fun and definitely a big time sink. So, uh, looking
1432720	1440560	forward to play more of that. And, um, uh, what else this week? Uh, more call duty, um,
1440560	1448960	call duty four. And I think that was a, I bought games. I bought, I bought the new humble bundle,
1448960	1454400	even though I have some of the games already. Um, yeah, that's pretty much it.
1454880	1459600	Well, I kind of have to echo my co-host this week. I know. Um, it's kind of like one of those,
1459600	1463600	we were well intentioned type of weeks, but, um, yeah, I haven't really been playing a lot
1463600	1468000	of new stuff myself. It's just been continuing to play the games I talked about last week. Um,
1469280	1473520	I might've given a negative perception of Diablo three on PlayStation three last week. Cause I know
1473520	1477520	I was critical about a few things like the controls, but I will say this. I can't seem to
1477520	1482400	put it down. Like I'm still playing it. I finally got into act two. Yes. It took me that long to
1483040	1487120	get there, but I only play like a little piece meals at a time. Um, but I'm having a good time
1487120	1491040	with it. And I actually think I'm going to play it at least, at least the one play through. I
1491040	1494240	don't think I'm going to do all the repetitive playthroughs, you know, that Diablo set up to do,
1494240	1498560	but I really want to try multiplayer at some point. That'd be great. So yeah,
1498560	1502400	Diablo three, even though the controls are weird, like because of the way it's tuned,
1502400	1506640	like it works and I'm having a good time with it. So yeah, Diablo three, I'm still playing
1506640	1510640	and, uh, still continuing through final fantasy 14. I play way too much of that
1510640	1515280	and, um, bravely default. I've been trying and I've been getting asked by a lot of people,
1515280	1520400	how far are you in it? And the answer is not far enough. Cause I haven't been playing my 3DS enough
1520400	1525760	hanging my head in shame, getting judged by all my friends, but I'm just, I'm making it a slow
1525760	1530080	burn. I want to judge you for that. I want it to last a long time. I'm judging you for other
1530080	1537920	reasons. What, what reasons? Reasons and things. All right. Uh, I will say this one game I did
1537920	1544000	play, um, that was somewhat new final fantasy 14 is being baited on the PlayStation four right now.
1544000	1548000	So I did jump into that. I was live streaming for a little bit late, late Saturday night,
1548000	1553040	like midnight to 3 AM. Yes. I was up until then. Uh, that would actually be early Saturday morning.
1553040	1559600	Um, but yeah, I was playing the beta game looks gorgeous on PlayStation four. Gorgeous. I, I am
1559600	1563760	seriously considering, thankfully it supports keyboard and mouse. I'm probably going to switch
1563760	1567840	from playing on my PC. The only thing I have to figure out is, um, what am I going to use for
1567840	1572320	rating? Like, cause we use mumble. So I have to figure out if I can get that as an app or something
1572320	1577920	that I like I'm ready to switch to PlayStation four. It's gorgeous. So, um, yeah. Uh, if you're
1577920	1583760	a PlayStation four owner, uh, I believe the beta is going on all week. I hear there are some Q issues
1583760	1588720	and character creation, but you know, it is a beta and it's free, but definitely take the opportunity
1588720	1594640	to check out the game while you can. So I forgot to mention, I actually got in a beta this week as
1594640	1600880	well. Um, I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet. Project spark. Oh yeah. You remember that?
1600880	1605280	I do. That was the Microsoft game they showed. It's kind of like they're answered a little
1605280	1610800	big planet, but with a different twist. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah. That's cool.
1610800	1617600	Cause now that I have a windows eight one PC, um, so I was like, eh, I might as well download that.
1617600	1623280	So yeah. Uh, some questions from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Akuma JP says,
1623280	1628240	did you try it on the Vita? And the answer is no, I still need to do that. Uh, black Wolf says,
1628240	1633200	my problem with the PlayStation four version is the text size and the pop-up boxes. Yes. Uh,
1633200	1637360	that is why the game would be impossible to play on the Vita as it is right now.
1637360	1642080	I imagine square and the development team there has gotta be fixing those issues. You can,
1642080	1645840	you can change the font size and your text box. So you can make that a lot easier, but yeah,
1645840	1651920	they've got to allow you to change those pop-up boxes that yeah, it's, it doesn't look good. It's,
1651920	1656400	it's really hard to read and there's not enough voice acting to make the game playable. So, uh,
1656400	1660080	hopefully they're going to be looking into that. Um, but yeah, so that was, uh,
1660080	1667520	Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation four. Woo. So that does it for our gaming weeks and, uh, moving into
1667520	1671840	housekeeping real quick before we get into gaming news tonight. Um, I mentioned this just briefly a
1671840	1677920	little earlier in the show. Um, we are going to be moving actually, or I should say, I am going to
1677920	1682560	be moving. Uh, Alan and I, um, are going to be moving in from our little dinky apartment that
1682560	1687520	we have now into a house. Very excited about that. And the good news for you and Loki is that it's
1687520	1692000	only like a mile from here. So it's not really going to change the drives of the show. Cause we
1692000	1695520	were looking at downtown and we did think about like, Oh, our friends are going to hate us. We
1695520	1699120	do that. But anyway, it's going to be about a mile from here where we're at now. And, uh, yeah,
1699200	1704000	it'll be a house. And the good news is a much larger dedicated space for the show.
1704000	1708240	Very excited about that. So who knows what we can do with that space? The only bad news is because
1708240	1712880	I am going through that move personally, um, there's going to be no show March 16th, which
1712880	1717440	I know is a very odd period, March 16th. We're still going to try to put something on the podcast
1717440	1721520	feed for you guys, like a best of, or some type of compilation or who knows what I have. I'm
1721520	1726960	kicking around some ideas, something we can do quick. Uh, but yeah, no live show on March 16th
1726960	1731760	due to the move into what studio number would this be? Let's see if we think way back to when
1731760	1735920	the show first started, I was living with my friend from high school in the one house,
1735920	1739360	right? That was the first studio. Then I lived with Loki. I was the second studio. That was a
1739360	1744080	fun time when Loki and I lived together and have that space. Um, then I lived with Exeter, right?
1744080	1748240	That was the third studio. Then I lived in the house with my friend, John, where we had the
1748240	1752240	garage. That was the fourth studio. Then there was Jamie's house. That was the fifth studio.
1752240	1756400	Then there's this when Shermie was there. That's right. That's right. And then there's this,
1756400	1762480	which is the sixth studio. So next studio is going to be lucky number seven, seven studios
1762480	1768640	we've done this show from twelve years, seven studios. That's pretty good. That's pretty good.
1769440	1776320	All right. Awesome. Awesome. Um, so yeah, March 16th will be the big day there that, um, we are
1776320	1780400	moving. So there'll be no show. Um, and we're actually hoping that's around the time that
1780400	1784960	Loki will be coming back too. So keeping our fingers and toes crossed and all that, uh,
1784960	1790400	also as usual for housekeeping, you can find us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. You can also
1790400	1794800	find us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio. And we're also on Google plus with
1794800	1801440	google.com slash plus orange lounge radio. Um, one more bit of housekeeping and dark soccer.
1801440	1805840	You're going to get a kick out of this. So I went to go get my half shot of vodka flask is empty.
1806640	1814240	So I just, I just messaged Alan in all caps. You drank all the vodka, didn't you? And he said,
1814960	1816880	Oh, sorry. I didn't think there was much left.
1818320	1824240	See, I was expecting responsive bitch. I might've. So I can take my flask home. Don't worry. I have
1824240	1829280	a whole big bottle of it now. And I am making that special batch just for you and Alan to share.
1829280	1836800	Amazing. I love it. And let's see, dungeon buster in chat. I love this says studio N seven. Yes.
1836800	1842880	Yes, sir. As the official name studio N seven. And I'm not commander shepherd. This is my favorite
1842880	1848800	studio in the show. Uh, sag is in our chat room saying, don't worry with GDC that following week.
1848800	1854160	You'll have a lot to talk about. Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. Uh, Rama says live from studio city,
1854160	1860000	California, it's orange lounge radio. It was almost live three blocks from the Capitol,
1860000	1866880	but decided not to do that. So there you go. To register participation for this week's episode
1866880	1871760	of orange launch radio at vog network.com. Use the passphrase yard. Uh, all right,
1871760	1874960	let's get into video game news. That's what you guys are here for to hear us
1874960	1879120	and our commentary on the week's news. And we're here to hear your guys's commentary on the news,
1879120	1884400	um, via our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and our email bag, which we have a brand new email
1884400	1887600	address. That's also something I should bring up during housekeeping. We have a brand new email
1887600	1893120	address. We're going to be unveiling later in the show. So, all right, let's, uh, go to Loki
1893120	1898640	and the news. All right. So unfortunately I got a little bit of bad news with, uh, rational games
1898640	1907120	shutting down. Um, Ken Levine basically moving on to other things and, um, with a taking only
1907120	1912960	15 people, the rest have been laid off. Um, of course, you know, kind of a shock to everybody
1912960	1916960	considering that, you know, bio shock infinite and the whole series has done really well.
1916960	1921600	I don't think it's necessarily that anything did poorly. It's just that he wants to move on
1921600	1927040	to his own projects, I guess, instead of stuff for, you know, two K or whatever. Um,
1928160	1932400	so no idea really what his new projects are going to be, but you know, everybody's,
1932400	1936400	you know, the community has been kind of helping out with, you know, trying to direct these,
1936400	1944240	you know, now orphaned employees to other jobs. And, um, I think they will have no trouble finding
1944240	1948640	work considering how talented of a bunch of those guys are. I do want to jump in real quick with a
1948640	1952560	small correction of what you're saying before our chatters kind of light up here. And before, uh,
1952560	1958080	we, we hear about an emails, irrational games, didn't shut down. They downsize significantly.
1958080	1964240	Okay. So just say, cause, uh, in Ken Levine's letter, he talks about that, you know,
1964240	1970480	basically it's going from hundreds of employees to he's going to have 15. So irrational guys will
1970480	1974640	still be around, but it's, it's not what it was. My mistake. I was assuming, you know,
1974640	1979520	the majority of the staff leaves that they're shutting down. So, well, it is a significant
1979520	1985760	change. Let's put it that way. Yeah. Um, surprising to hear, right? Because Bioshock, I mean,
1985760	1990160	I think a lot of us sit here and go, wait a minute. Bioshock was like, great. People loved
1990160	1997600	it. They won awards. What the heck? This is the thanks that that team gets. Well, they made money
1997600	2004000	off of it. I mean, I just don't know. I, I don't know what his intentions are, but I guess it's
2004000	2010720	sort of like cliffy, leaving Epic and stuff. Um, I don't know if it's necessarily a, a big deal.
2011280	2016800	Well, I mean, anytime you lose employees, it's kind of, you know, it's, it's sad, but you know,
2016800	2021680	I don't know what's going to change. I have been thinking about it a little bit and here's,
2021680	2027360	here's some of the things I want to say on this is that, you know, I, on one hand, I understand
2027360	2032480	that, you know, making a video game takes years and years and years, and we have a tendency in
2032480	2040960	this industry to really cram video game franchises into the ground, right? Um, we, we do this a lot
2040960	2045360	and, um, you know, I, I can understand where maybe Ken Levine's like, you know what? I don't want to
2045360	2051200	do another Bioshock game. I'm, I'm, uh, creatively, I did what I wanted to do a Bioshock. I don't want
2051200	2056400	that to be my entire life. I want to move on to something else. So I, I can actually kind of
2056400	2063520	respect that. The part that gets me is, okay, well, wait a minute, 2K is going to be taking on Bioshock.
2063520	2068640	They pretty much already announced that. 2, it's not like, you know, Bioshock 2 was done without
2068640	2073200	Ken Levine. Am I correct in saying that? He was, he might, he might've been like, and the same company
2073200	2078400	is supposed to be taking it over. Right. Right. So, you know, there's that. So, so part of me goes,
2078400	2084160	okay, well then why didn't, why wasn't there like a resource shift? And I suppose, you know, to,
2084160	2088720	to their credit, they are doing this internal job fair where they're recruiting for positions within
2088720	2093120	the company. And maybe some of them will be with this new Bioshock team. That's, that's, you know,
2093120	2097520	it's going to be created for the people that will continue to create Bioshock games because
2097520	2101520	the internet demands it. So I think in that regard, you're seeing a shift or whatever,
2101520	2106800	but it's just, it's kind of weird to me that, you know, okay, well, couldn't Ken Levine
2106800	2111520	have brought on somebody else into Irrational Games to just oversee it? Or couldn't he have
2111600	2118240	shifted his role or whatever, but maybe, maybe I don't understand how that all really works.
2118240	2123200	And I know that there's been some interesting press that has been run about that things may
2123200	2129840	have been very, um, difficult on the inside that, uh, Ken Levine possibly is not the easiest person
2129840	2133920	in the world to work with. I don't know how much credit I want to give to those types of things
2133920	2138960	that starts to get into the tabloid journalism, which I'm not like a huge, huge fan of, but okay,
2139040	2144640	I'm just going to acknowledge it. Sure that exists. And maybe, you know, if you have somebody
2144640	2149200	who is an ineffective manager of a project, maybe Bioshock Infinite was done and it was great,
2149200	2154560	but maybe for some people it wasn't done fast enough. I don't know. Um, so sometimes when
2154560	2159760	you're unhappy with an executive, you kind of shift them over here and have a lot less people
2159760	2164480	under them. And in a way that's kind of sounds like what's going on is that Ken Levine didn't
2164480	2168880	exactly make it sound like in his letter, again, assumption going off of what I'm reading in the
2168880	2173920	letter. I didn't exactly get the sense it was all his idea. I think this is one of those,
2173920	2180400	this is what I'm doing to save face. That's my honest impression I got from it. So part of me
2180400	2188480	is wondering maybe Ken Levine was strongly urged to do this and have a smaller team of people
2188480	2195520	because maybe he's not the best at managing a large, large team. I don't know, tinfoil hat time,
2195520	2199520	not making accusations. I'm just saying these are the types, this is what we're all wondering.
2199520	2204480	We're all kicking around these weird theories because how could a studio that made such a great
2204480	2210080	game suddenly go like this? It's very hard for us to explain.
2213680	2217920	Any other thoughts with this? I also go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2218480	2222560	BobbyBlackWolf says, taking a game makes many, many years unless it's a flappy bird
2222560	2228080	clone, then it takes four hours. Yes, correct. Correct. Rama says, well, Irrational Games isn't
2228080	2234400	working on anything big, so why would they need such a big staff? Well, maybe Ken Levine wanted
2234400	2239520	to do a big project or maybe he didn't. I don't know, but I would be hard pressed to believe that
2239520	2246160	there's not going to be another Bioshock game. Bioshock 2 didn't flop and Ken Levine was not
2246160	2249600	as heavily involved with that one. Like Loki said, it was a different branch of 2K. Which
2249600	2258560	part of 2K did? I think it was Marin. Marin did it? Yeah. So, that's probably the team that's
2258560	2264400	going to end up taking on Bioshock 3 or Bioshock Infinite 2 or, you know, whatever they end up
2264400	2271760	doing with that. Infinite plus one. It was 2K Marin Australia, 2K China, Digital Extremes,
2271760	2277680	Arcane Studios, Dark Side Game Studios, and Feral Interactive. Holy cow, the wonder that
2278320	2283760	didn't do as well. Way too many people working on that. To be fair, Digital Extremes did Steam
2283760	2289680	with multiplayer, Arcane Studios did level design, Feral Interactive did work with some of the Mac
2289680	2293440	versions of the game, so it's not like they were, you know, they all had their very specific roles.
2293680	2298240	It looks like it was mostly 2K Marin in Australia. So, there you go.
2301680	2308480	Reporting on layoffs is never fun. Our thoughts go to those affected employees, but it sounds
2308480	2314880	like you guys are in demand. Everybody wants you on their teams, so, you know, best of luck to
2314880	2320480	finding a job that's going to be a good fit for those people. I'm really glad that everybody
2320480	2326400	wants you guys. It's a good place to be in. Alright, let's move on to some more news,
2326400	2332960	and somewhat happier news, because we've been getting some odd news out of this company lately,
2332960	2336960	too, that there might be some shifts going on there, and nobody seems to have an idea what
2336960	2342160	this developer is doing, so they decided to come out this week and say, hey, we usually don't
2342160	2347280	announce things this early, but this is what's going on, and the developer is Harmonix. Harmonix,
2347280	2353600	of course, probably most famous for Rock Band and Dance Central. Both those franchises have kind of
2353600	2359200	lost a lot of their steam. Harmonix near and dear to my heart for frequency and amplitude, and,
2359200	2363520	you know, any music game fans really loves Harmonix. So, what the heck is Harmonix doing
2363520	2371520	now? Well, Harmonix unveiled a free-to-play first-person shooter called Chroma. Chroma is
2371520	2376000	going to be a music-based first-person shooter, and if you actually watch the little announcement
2376000	2381520	trailer for it, sounds like it's going to be some dubstep, wub wub wub wub, at least that's what was
2381520	2385440	in the trailer. It wasn't, here's the thing. I think it's everything that's going to be in there.
2385440	2391280	Yeah, some dubstep is offensive, and I wasn't offended by the dubstep I heard in the trailer.
2391280	2395040	Right, Jamie? Some dubstep is offensive, but some is acceptable. Plenty of it is offensive.
2395680	2400800	Some is acceptable. Well, anyhow, if you want to check out Chroma in advance, the alpha is going
2400800	2407200	to be beginning this month, apparently. You can sign up at PlayChroma.com. That's C-H-R-O-M-A
2407200	2412640	dot com. Development will be through Valve's Steam Early Access, and it's supposed to be publicly
2412640	2416400	playable in the fall. Again, it's supposed to be free-to-play, so I don't exactly know, you know,
2416400	2420240	I'm assuming the songs will cost money or, you know, who knows what they'll do with that. They
2420240	2424960	said it was all going to be, um, the customization is going to cost money. Really? They're not going
2424960	2430400	to put licensed songs in it? I don't know. I would think they would, but we'll see. So, yeah,
2431200	2436080	bullets will be on a beat, and you find the flow in the music to activate jump pads to get around
2436080	2442160	the arena. Some folks out there, some of the big game blogs did get a chance to try an alpha,
2442160	2449120	but most people are saying, you know, it's early. It's an alpha. But, yeah, a lot of folks seem
2449120	2455200	intrigued, and I know I am by Chroma. Just as a fan of music games. I'm not always a fan of
2455200	2459280	first-person shooters, but I don't dislike them. There have been some I've really enjoyed, like
2459280	2463840	Halo 2, you know, I really enjoyed, and there's other first-person. Titanfall was fun for the
2463840	2468240	little bit I played that, so I'm curious about Chroma. Or Minecraft. Huh? Or Minecraft.
2468240	2472080	Minecraft's not a first-person shooter. It's first-person, and you can shoot arrows
2472080	2477200	in a first-person shooter. Fine, fine. Are you excited about Chroma, Loki? Surely you are.
2477200	2484320	Yeah, it looks fantastic. I signed up immediately, so, yeah, and I want to know why the next Tron
2484320	2491120	movie can't look like that, because, you know, the trailer is awesome. I just like the design
2491120	2494960	there. Too bad, though, that from what I hear is the game doesn't look like the trailer, so,
2495840	2500480	a little disappointing. Well, it isn't an alpha, though. I mean, what games do look like their
2500480	2507120	trailers? A lot of them don't. True. So, sg100matt in chat says, I was really, really expecting that
2507120	2512000	Harmonix was going to announce this at PAX East. PAX East is in their backyard, and their CEO is
2512000	2516720	going to be the keynote speaker. sg100matt, I would think that a lot of this could be, like,
2516720	2520640	pressure from a financial perspective, because a lot of us are kind of going,
2520640	2523840	what is Harmonix doing right now? Like, we really just don't even know, and, you know.
2523840	2529680	Where's Fantasia? Yeah, where is Fantasia? And we're hearing troubling things out of the company,
2529680	2533840	but I think on the on the bright side, sg100matt, I would expect that Harmonix will be there at
2533840	2541280	PAX East with Fantasia and Chroma on full display. So, you'll get that, at least. I don't see why
2541280	2547440	that would not be something that happens at PAX East. So, there you go. I'm excited about Chroma.
2547440	2551360	I want to check it out, and I'll just hope there's not as much dubstep in the game, but
2551360	2557440	I'll deal. DarkSakura, what do you have for us? I have something that's very old school and new
2557440	2563920	at the same time. So, it's, one of the greatest games ever is The Legend of Zelda, of course.
2564880	2573440	And there is something now called The Legend of Zelda VR that's in beta right now, and it's
2573440	2580800	basically a first person Legend of Zelda with sort of sprighty weird textures over very rudimentary
2580800	2586640	polygons, and it's to be played on the Oculus Rift. And it made me very motion sick just watching it.
2587440	2595840	It is pretty, it looks pretty fun. I mean, and my whole thing is that my brain was just sort of,
2596800	2604240	excuse me, trying to reorient where on the map the people were. And so, I started
2604240	2610080	actually figuring out certain landscapes and realizing where on the map this person was,
2610720	2615360	but it's weird seeing it approached. And on top of that, it's not even, you know,
2615360	2619920	screen where you have enemies, you know, how the way each of the screens work, you scroll to the
2619920	2624800	next screen and you have enemies. And here, it's just a continuous stream of enemies, but it would
2624800	2629840	be the ones that would have been on their respective screens. So, it was very weird. It was
2629840	2636560	interesting, but just odd, and I felt kind of vomitous afterwards. Well, you know, the resident
2636560	2642000	Oculus expert over at vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf, he had a few words to say about this.
2642000	2646160	He actually just posted an article earlier today that's a great read because he talks about,
2646160	2650960	I must be a VR hipster because I kind of think this Zelda thing, people are talking about it
2650960	2657200	way too much. And we ought to be talking about the VR demos that are actually made for VR. You know,
2657200	2663440	Zelda was not designed to be a Rift game. But we have this tendency in the industry to get our
2663440	2670640	nostalgia. Funny bones tickled, hee hee, nostalgia, hee hee. And print it, run with it. Kotaku headline.
2670640	2675600	Well, see what I want to see done with something like that is I actually more want to see,
2676720	2681920	I don't want to play it with the Rift. I just want to play it, you know, as an actual game in front
2681920	2687280	of me with my keyboard and mouse. So, so you actually want the 2D experience a little more
2687280	2693200	like it was designed. No, no, no. I want, I want the VR version. I just want it as a first person
2693200	2698000	game that I can play with my keyboard and mouse. I have to admit, just in watching it, I was like,
2698000	2702160	you know, I don't want to, obviously this is some guy's hard work. It's done out of fandom.
2702160	2707760	It's indie. I don't want to dog on it too much. But I was kind of watching it going, this looks
2707760	2714320	kind of like not really a lot of fun because it's just like, I don't know, maybe having played the
2714320	2720000	Rift before, I just kind of, some of these 2D experiences that are crammed into 3D aren't so
2720000	2726640	awesome. Like I think a game like, I don't know, Twilight Princess or even Ocarina of Time,
2726640	2732720	something that at least was a little more 3D designed might be a little better on the Rift.
2732720	2738160	But again, you know, these games weren't really designed with VR in mind, but at least it's a 3D
2738160	2744160	environment. I like anything that takes a classic and sort of gives you a new way to play it.
2744720	2750240	It, it revives the game almost. But I mean, more what I would like to see is actually,
2750240	2756240	I would like to literally see the first game redone in the style of the later games.
2756720	2761200	Well, I, and I'm with you to that extent, our Sakura. And I think a great example of what you
2761200	2765920	just said, this game and kind of the new thing would be, uh, the Legend of Zelda,
2765920	2771120	a link between two worlds on 3DS does this marvelously. It's an old school Zelda game,
2771120	2778240	but new school paint because you know, the 3DS that's a much closer environment, but VR whole
2778240	2782320	different type of world. You know what I mean? I don't know. It just, and Bobby's in our chat room
2782320	2787600	saying it's not fun. It's frustrating. But he does say someone else made an Ocarina of Time
2787600	2791840	demo where you walk around the first village. So I'm not incredibly surprised to hear that.
2791840	2797840	I, I just would like to, you know, I like to reserve judgment on a lot of things until I
2797840	2802720	get a chance to do it for myself. And I mean, which is why I'm completely reserving judgment
2802720	2806960	on the Rift thing in particular, even though I'm pretty sure it's going to make me, you know,
2806960	2812720	make my stomach into a nightmare of nausea and my brain into a, uh, apocalypse of pain.
2813600	2818720	But, um, I like to, I like things like that. I like giving him a try. I like doing something
2818720	2824400	different. Well, and at the end of the day, you know, and to be fair again, we love getting our
2824400	2832000	nostalgia funny bones tickled. Nostalgia. I love Zelda. You know? Well, it's not even just that
2832000	2835760	the impression that I got of watching it was like, this could be done in Minecraft.
2836960	2842160	Was the impression I got. Interesting. Which technically I bet you could go into
2842160	2846400	Minecraft and make all the dungeons. Somebody had to have, somebody's had to have done that,
2846400	2850080	right? Somebody put the Legend of Zelda in Minecraft, right? Cause actually that,
2850080	2854160	that would really work. What you're saying, like putting the dungeons underground and everything
2854160	2857120	that would actually like really re I don't know if you'd be able to have the monsters,
2857120	2861280	but you could definitely create the world. You could do the monsters. Okay. You do the
2861280	2865920	mom. Loki, you're the Minecraft expert. Has somebody done this? Not that I'm aware of,
2865920	2872880	but they have recreated the entire layout of, um, uh, Ocarina,
2874000	2878080	which I still would like to see somewhere installed, maybe next door to my house.
2878080	2881200	I would love to see that installed in our little universe.
2883520	2890960	Hit stun in our chat room says all of link to the past has been done in Minecraft. That's cool.
2890960	2894880	I want to check that out. I got to find that world. I want that installed next door to my
2894880	2898720	house and I'll move into Link's house. But here's, here's something very important to
2898720	2903680	keep in mind when I say I want to check that out. I want to spend 30 minutes in there going,
2903680	2908720	Ooh, this is neat. And then I never want to play it again because that's the way some of
2908720	2916320	these nostalgia things go. If you asked me to pay 60 bucks for that, no, no, no. It's like my shirt.
2916320	2922080	Yeah. No period. I'm wearing a black shirt. This is no period. And I like how the no is positioned
2922080	2928000	right on the boobies. It's my lack of consent shirt. The answer is no all the time. No.
2928800	2935360	Nice. So, um, Robert M and our chat says also, as I mentioned, a hit stun in Minecraft,
2935360	2940320	how long before someone makes a flappy bird clone in Minecraft? I assume someone, someone like Seth
2940320	2944480	bling or something would have it within a month. Um, I already saw it on a blog somewhere. It's
2944480	2950560	already been done. Um, I think it was on joystick that had an article on it. It's already, uh, been
2950560	2956960	done. So it's hard to take a picture of myself without my boobs. Scrunching up rule of the
2956960	2962160	internet rule of the internet. It's probably been done. All right. Uh, let's move on Loki.
2963040	2970800	All right. So, um, this is kind of cool. Sony it's rumored to be unveiling their own VR
2970800	2977360	technology at a gaming developers conference, which is only a few weeks away on the March 17th
2977360	2983200	in San Francisco. And, uh, this is coming from, uh, tech radar. They say they have a,
2983200	2987840	their confidential tipster said that they were impressed with the quality of Sony's Oculus Rift
2987840	2992480	competitor. The quality and resolution are great. Really good. They said, um, people will
2992480	2997840	definitely be impressed with Sony's build. Uh, it says also that Sony has deliberately taken
2997840	3005920	this time to tweak and polish the headset before revealing it. Um, so I don't know. I, I, I'm
3005920	3008960	assuming that they're going to have something like this just because they've already kind of
3008960	3014800	done other things with, you know, VR, you know, they've experimented with VR stuff before for
3014800	3021040	not necessarily gaming, but for just like video. So it makes sense, I guess, that they would
3021040	3025760	come out with something like this and it would be good to differentiate themselves.
3027920	3033280	Well, here's what I worry about though is, is fragmentation is that, you know,
3033280	3037760	if you're going to have Sony's got their VR headset and their big dollars and all that,
3037760	3040960	you know, it's going to cause a little fragmentation because Oculus has more
3040960	3045680	of the indie community route, um, you know, around it. And we're going to have this whole split.
3046240	3049360	No, I don't think so at all. I mean, it's just like, you know, you're having
3049360	3057120	the Sony VR would be for Sony consoles and Oculus is for PC and whoever else wants to use it.
3057920	3062720	Yeah, but it's just like, I don't know, but as a gamer who wants to play all the cool stuff,
3062880	3066080	I'll end up having to own both and that'll kind of suck, you know,
3067120	3071200	can't they work together? I suppose that's not how capitalism works though.
3072240	3075440	But then, then Microsoft will have their thing as well.
3075440	3079760	So, I mean, that's just like saying, you know, can't, can't the console manufacturers work
3079760	3082320	together and just make one console that all the games can be on.
3082320	3084960	Can't they put Mario on the Xbox? Yeah, I know.
3084960	3091360	Hey, I listened to a podcast today about that very thing. Um, it was, it was a hip hop gamer
3091360	3094880	and Michael Patrick, which I should have just turned it off right there because I mean,
3094880	3098640	why am I listening to a podcast with Michael Patrick and hip hop gamer at the same time?
3099760	3105040	And they were posing the idea of, uh, what if, you know,
3105040	3110560	Nintendo went third party just temporarily, like, you know, putting their games on, you know,
3110560	3114480	the PlayStation four, Xbox one, that kind of stuff for a couple of years.
3115520	3118080	And it's kind of a good idea if you think about it because,
3118960	3123840	um, that way they're hitting that audience that they can't hit right now with the Wii U,
3123840	3127120	you get people hooked on the great games and then you go exclusive and then people
3127120	3129200	have to buy your system to play those wonderful games.
3129200	3132480	Oh God, you drank the juice. You drank the juice.
3132480	3137440	Hey, I already, hey, I already said a few weeks ago about the whole, you know, third party thing.
3137440	3140000	I can't help it if Michael Patrick gets great ideas from me. Okay.
3140000	3144160	No, it's, well, the, the, the reality is it's not going to happen. Like you all,
3144880	3149280	all of you need to get it. I mean, and I mean, no disrespect to other fine indie shows,
3149280	3152160	but all of you need to understand it's not going to happen.
3152160	3157040	You all can wishlist wank all you want. It's not going to make it a reality.
3157040	3161200	A very stubborn Japanese company is not going to just suddenly do that because
3161200	3165840	y'all think it's a good idea. That's the reality.
3165840	3169680	If they change who's in charge, they may come up with some other ideas because right now,
3169680	3171040	Wanda is not doing very much.
3171040	3175040	Well, and he's also said, I'm not leaving and no one's exactly forcing him out.
3176160	3178560	It's a, well, eventually they're going to run out of their money.
3178560	3182720	It's a traded company in Japan, not in the U S it's very different.
3184400	3188240	So you guys are all applying us logic to a Japanese company. I'm just saying,
3188240	3192880	I'm not, I'm like, I'm going to get painted. Here comes the email. Rob's the fan boy and
3192880	3200720	I'm just the realist y'all. So anyway, uh, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. So we're moving on to
3201360	3205680	talking about Sony making their own VR headset and, uh, they're special. Yeah.
3206320	3210480	The way Loki phrases it, where you have one for your console and one for your PC,
3210480	3214720	makes it sound less offensive. Um, so I kind of hope that's the direction they're going with it,
3214720	3220880	but you know, um, I just, who's to say you couldn't support both. I mean, cause
3221520	3225840	you know, look at like, uh, 3d technology that's out there, you know, they have, you know,
3225920	3232640	the Nvidia stuff, they have, you know, other monitors that are non that have like, you know,
3233200	3237040	3d without glasses or all the different 3d technologies across, you know,
3237040	3241920	like Blu-ray and stuff with the, with that. And they all kind of work together. So if they come
3241920	3248400	up with a, you know, a way to, you know, if they come out with the API's for it and stuff,
3248400	3254080	then people can put that into their game and support both. Well, we'll see,
3254320	3258720	just like you can do a game for the 360 and the PlayStation three or the one in the PlayStation
3258720	3265760	four. Who knows? Yeah, exactly. All right. Uh, moving on, uh, talking about Sega and, uh, some,
3265760	3272000	some business moves with Sega. Um, Sega is going to be splitting a subsidiary of Sega. That is
3272000	3279760	index corporation index corporation will be split into two companies. That's Atlas and index, uh,
3279760	3283680	Sega Sammy, as they are, you know, it's technically the company name. They actually
3283680	3289680	acquired index corporation, which is the parent of Atlas. Are you still with me? Y'all? Uh,
3289680	3293440	that happened last year. I think you all saw the story. Sega bought Atlas, right? Y'all saw that.
3293440	3298160	And now the little K they're splitting the Atlas and the parent corporation. So that's,
3298160	3302720	what's happening there. And that is a business move to strengthen division and developments and
3302720	3308000	so forth. Atlas will have 121 employees. That's their game development office. They're going to
3308000	3314160	be keeping that index is going to focus solely on advertisement, advertisement, marketing,
3314160	3318720	content distribution and so forth. And they have 166 people working for them.
3318720	3323040	I guess it takes more to market the game than it does to make the game. That's very interesting.
3323040	3330160	So, uh, yeah. Also, uh, Yukio Sugino, who is the, um, current Sega managing director,
3330160	3335840	he's going to be the acting head for Atlas. All this is expected to take effect by April 1st.
3335840	3340240	So there you go. All your business happenings with Sega, but there's something else to note
3340240	3346720	here that has a lot of people going, what? And this is, this is weird. I don't, I don't know,
3346720	3353600	but anyway, apparently some blogs are running that Sega has lost the Shenmue trademark because of
3353600	3360480	years of inactivity. And, uh, apparently you can actually go to the site, the USPTO.gov. And it
3360480	3365120	actually talks about that registration was canceled because registrant did not file an
3365120	3369760	acceptable declaration under section eight to view all documents on file, dah, dah, dah, dah,
3369760	3374480	look at all the, uh, extended stuff. So apparently because there hasn't been any followup
3374480	3382080	Sega lost the trademark to Shenmue in the U S yes. In the U S that doesn't mean they can't get
3382080	3385920	it back, but, uh, I think we should change the name of the show to Shenmue. What do you guys
3385920	3392160	think? We should, we should drive a forklift. Can we invite our listeners to play the lucky hit
3393040	3397440	and spend the rest of the time playing our new theme song will be space Harrier music
3399120	3401520	orange Shenmue radio debuting next week.
3404400	3411680	Uh, that's, that's unfortunate about, um, the, uh, loss of the trademark. I hope that doesn't
3411680	3417360	mean they're just leaving this whole franchise aside, but I seem to recall, didn't they actually
3417360	3425120	put a Shenmue reference in, uh, the Sega all stars racing game just recently. So maybe,
3425120	3430720	yeah, maybe, uh, dungeon buster makes it very clear in our chat loss of trademark does not mean
3430720	3435840	loss of IP does not equal this. So for the record, it's funny that you mentioned the
3435840	3444240	Sega racing thing. Dan was watching the Daytona 500 today. And I saw just how short Danica
3444240	3450560	Patrick really is. She's actually kind of adorable. All right. Uh, yeah, actually I
3450560	3456880	love playing as Danica Patrick in the Sega game. It's so random. It's great. Anyhow. All right.
3456880	3463440	Uh, moving on with more news, dark soccer. Well, there is a, um, college, uh, it's called
3463440	3470720	Abertay university in Dundee that's in Scotland. Um, that has a lab that is the largest in Europe
3470720	3478000	and has, uh, 30 new PlayStation Vita development kits and PS3 and PS4 dev kits so that students
3478000	3483920	who go to the lab will be able to use the hardware for different parts of, uh, developmental learning
3483920	3491280	as far as like actual, uh, game and application development. Um, they're basically saying that
3491280	3497120	they're trying to do their best to bring young and talented new developers onto, uh, Sony's
3497120	3504240	various platforms. And there's a quote here from professor Lewis Natanson, um, who is the head of
3504240	3508880	the arts, media and computer games at Abertay university saying that having access to professional
3508880	3513920	Sony development kits is increase, is incredibly exciting for students learning how to design and
3513920	3518720	build games. And we've seen a real jump in the enthusiasm of our students since we created this
3518720	3524320	lab. So, I mean, basically saying it's encouraging the students to learn on their own. And he even
3524320	3529920	goes on to say that there are, um, students who are just spending their free time in the lab
3529920	3534240	working on their own projects. So I think it's pretty neat. We're probably going to see a lot more,
3534240	3544080	um, unique content coming out for the Sega platforms. This kind of reminds me in a way of when
3544080	3548720	I was in junior high and high school and we used to go to the science room that had the computers
3548720	3554720	on lunch and we would play tank wars. And, um, what was the other, we always talk about this
3554720	3559760	game. I can't remember the name of it anymore. No, not that the other kicks. It was another tank
3559760	3564480	shooting game that has like scorched earth, scorched earth. Thank you. We used to play the
3564480	3569120	shit out of that game on, on breaks and so forth. And I think we tried to install doom, but it
3569120	3573120	didn't work and so forth. But like, I always just chalk that up to the fact that we were hardcore
3573120	3578000	nerds, which is fine. I'll own that we were hardcore nerds, but, um, this kind of sounds
3578000	3582000	like that to me is that like, Hey, if we have this open room with these development kits and,
3582000	3587920	and let people kind of play, then people are going to play and create and share. And I just
3587920	3593440	became a PlayStation tagline, but that's what they're going to do. Right? Well, yeah, pretty
3593440	3599360	much. I think it's cool. Um, let's see more of this happen in other countries, namely America,
3599360	3606080	but no, we suck. You never know. You never know. All right. Let's travel around the world and check
3606080	3610400	out some release dates of what the PlayStation labs around the world and that Microsoft labs
3610400	3617120	are bringing to you very soon. Okay. Um, so in, uh, North America, we've got a few things come
3617120	3622880	out of this week, plants versus zombies, garden warfare on Xbox one and Xbox three 60, uh, tales
3622880	3631280	of symphonia Chronicles on PlayStation three, uh, Castlevania Lords of shadows two on PlayStation
3631280	3639920	three and Xbox three 60, uh, Magus on PlayStation three thief on a PlayStation three PlayStation
3639920	3647920	four, Xbox one, Xbox three 60. And I believe PC, uh, professor Leighton, uh, finally on Friday,
3647920	3651600	uh, professor Leighton and the Azran legacy would be the last game coming up that week.
3653520	3659760	All right. That's it. I, I, um, I, there's actually quite a few titles in there,
3659840	3663360	like a thief and so forth that are like, Oh, Hey, that's finally coming.
3663360	3666560	Well, that's the thing too about thief is like, it looks like a good game,
3666560	3672480	but they're doing zero advertising on it. Yeah. Well, I saw some people live streaming
3672480	3676240	it on a PlayStation four the other night. So some copies are already out there. So,
3676240	3682000	yeah. All right. Uh, moving on to, uh, Japanese release dates. Hey, uh, just in case you missed
3682000	3687440	it, Japan got their PlayStation four. It was released over the weekend. Um, I, I haven't
3687440	3692000	seen a lot of reports on how it did. I'm hearing that there weren't really the people lining up
3692000	3696800	and all that stuff. So I don't know. Like it's, I don't know. Again, this is just from one news
3696800	3701040	source, so I'm not trying to say like, Oh, it flopped. I don't know, but I'm be curious to see
3701040	3704640	what the numbers are going to look like. Um, for PlayStation four out of Japan, there's really no
3704640	3709520	competition cause you know, Xbox one still not even dated for Japan. So, uh, it'll be, I'd be
3709520	3714000	curious to see how it sells over there. So, uh, we will start talking about PlayStation four releases,
3714000	3718880	except because the system just launched there, pretty much everything came out. We're not going
3718880	3724240	to really see any more releases on PlayStation four in Japan until mid March, March 19th is the
3724240	3728880	next game called natural doctrine is the next game that they're going to be getting in Japan outside
3728880	3733920	of the released games they already got. However, on the PlayStation three, things are a little
3733920	3738960	different. You have infinite Stratos to ignition hearts in regular limited and Famitsu packs all
3738960	3744800	coming out this February 27th as well as Kagero dark side princess in a regular and premium
3744800	3750720	edition. I'm also coming out on PlayStation three this week. Sengoku Hime for Soya. Hi,
3750720	3758080	Kay. Uh, Hana, Mamoru, Chi Chi comes out this week and I want to say what is Sengoku Hime? I've
3758080	3763520	heard of this series before. I was trying to see if I could read it actually. Well, sorry. Cause
3763520	3767920	I'm trying to see if, uh, there's a screenshot cause I want to know what game this is. Earth.
3768560	3771440	I feel like this is something we have here and I don't know what the translation,
3771440	3778320	somebody in shadow will get me. Um, something protect earth.
3780000	3782880	I think, I don't know. I can read a little bit of it.
3785040	3787680	All right. Protecting the flowers of the earth. There we go.
3788880	3792400	Uh, is it based? It's based on like an anime or something, right?
3793360	3798560	I think so. I don't know. Ikuma JP tell us what it is. It's it's a, it's a strategy game
3798560	3802960	series featuring historical Japanese warriors re-imagined as cute anime girls.
3807520	3811040	That's what it says. I Googled it. I'm sure none of you can hear me blink.
3813680	3817600	Akuma is that like a real popular game over there? I've got to know. That's actually kind
3817600	3824240	of awesome. Oh my God. Can you imagine if they made a game like with Abraham Lincoln
3824880	3828080	and like George Washington as Muppets?
3831040	3834960	That would actually be kind of awesome. Technically we have that at Disneyland,
3834960	3839200	except he's an animatronic. I guess that's true, huh? Which actually going in and watching that
3839200	3844880	was pretty cool. Well, they have, it's not Muppets, but they have the Lego movie game
3844880	3849920	has Abraham Lincoln in it. Oh, does it? Yeah. Oh, I got to, I got to check out the Lego movie
3849920	3855040	at some point. I still haven't seen it. Uh, Xbox 360 has a game out this week called she,
3855040	3860880	she, hey, no, so not Neil refrain. What a beautiful memories. That is the name of the game
3860880	3868400	from lyre soft. What a beautiful memories. And on the PlayStation Vita, infinite Stratos too,
3868400	3873360	and Kagero dark side princess are both on their way to the Vita as well. And Phantom
3873360	3879440	breaker battlegrounds gets a limited edition on the Vita this week and checking out the Wii U.
3880720	3883760	Unfortunately it doesn't look like anything's going on in the Wii U. They already got Donkey
3883760	3891840	Kong over there, which was our big news. We knew, uh, over on the Nintendo 3DS, uh,
3891840	3899120	Bokuju Monogatari Sunaguru Shintenshi comes out this week as well as Kasuke.
3899360	3904960	Wait, wait, wait, wait. Tenchi? Yeah. Oh, nevermind. That's not what I think it is.
3905920	3913760	Kasuke Houder Mugen Gear comes out, uh, from Nintendo. So I'm trying to figure out what game
3913760	3920000	this is. Cause this is a first party game. That's coming out over there. Um, it looks like dinosaurs
3920000	3924880	that are fighting each other. That's kind of cool. And then you get in a Jeep and you hunt dinosaurs
3925760	3930560	Dinosaur Hunter, I guess is what that game is. That's kind of interesting. There you go. Japanese
3930560	3937200	releases. How about the UK Dark Sakura? Um, a few things we have as soon as it decides to load back
3937200	3942320	up for me. Um, let me just jump in here. Akuma JP in response to, uh, the, uh, game we were talking
3942320	3948640	about earlier saying never heard of it. Looks like it plays like Nobunaga. Okay. Well, we have,
3949200	3957120	let's see, starting on the 26th, we have Pac-Man Museum, uh, for, uh, PS3, PC, and Xbox 360.
3957680	3962880	On the 27th, we have Plants vs Zombies, uh, Garden Warfare, Shadowrun Dragonfall,
3963440	3968000	on various variouses. And there is a Mac release, which is good. On the 28th,
3968000	3975120	Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2, um, for PC, Xbox 360, PS3. There's also Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD,
3975200	3982400	Thief 4, um, and then just, yeah, it looks like also there's going to be all of the Thief 4
3982400	3986080	releases on that date. And that's all that's listed.
3987200	3991920	All right. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
3995040	3999200	Sorry about that. Um, I heard, I heard the kids in the background, so I figured there must be some
3999200	4004000	activity going on there. So, yeah, good stuff. Anyways, um, so Microsoft, they're testing the
4004000	4007760	lower pricing for some of the digital games on Xbox One. They've been doing this, like,
4007760	4014080	kind of sale, if you will, I guess, the last few days. And one of those is going to be for, uh,
4014080	4019440	Rise Son of Rome. They're actually marking it down to $39.99. And, um, I guess that's running
4019440	4026480	through February 24th. So, um, it's kind of interesting to see them mark their titles down
4026480	4031280	that much. Um, but, you know, basically they're saying, you know, a lot of people are asking for
4031280	4036240	better deals on our digital marketplace, so we're testing some. Um, noting, I guess, that the
4036960	4041040	$39.99 is lower than the used price that you can find at retail right now.
4043360	4047600	So it'd be interesting to see them do that. Right now I know a lot of new releases,
4047600	4053040	they just come out about $5 cheaper. So this is a very interesting move,
4053040	4058400	uh, by Microsoft, in my opinion, because, you know, back when we were first talking about all
4058400	4063200	this digital rights and what's the advantage of buying digitally and all this. And I said,
4063200	4067840	you know, you can't turn around and sell these games. So these games don't have as much equity.
4067840	4072320	So you would really be able to make it worth my while if you would charge 20 bucks for these
4072320	4078160	games. Now, all right, so maybe they didn't drop all the way down to $20, but they cut $20 off the
4078160	4082880	price with this. So now they've sweetened the pot a little bit because as far as I know, the physical
4082880	4087760	copy of Rise, they're still selling those for $59.99, right? That hasn't changed.
4087760	4092080	I believe so. Yeah. And the price of a used copy is still way up there,
4092080	4096800	right? Like only $5 less, right? Probably depends on how many they have.
4096800	4105120	So Microsoft is giving a lot of incentive to go digital, but with the cheaper price.
4105120	4109200	But the question is, you know, is it going to work? And is, is a game like Rise
4109920	4115680	the best game to demonstrate that with? I don't know. So, um, Dark Soccer,
4115680	4119760	let me ask you this as a, you know, you, you like to collect games and so forth,
4119760	4123440	but you've also done digital games with Steam and so forth. A lot of them.
4123440	4129840	Do you think that charging $20 less for a digital copy of the game makes that more attractive for
4129840	4133840	consoles? Let's cut PC out of the picture. Do you think $20 less for a console game makes
4133840	4137280	it more attractive to go digital? No, I really prefer having a physical
4137280	4142480	copy if I'm going to have a console game. And I mean, a lot of my, there's been PC games that
4142480	4148000	have gone out and also bought physical copies, bought, bought, bought physical copies versus
4148000	4157200	the digital ones. And it wasn't for anything like paying less for a convenience. It was me paying
4157200	4161840	so that I have something to hold in my hands and look at, you know, it's, it's part of the
4161840	4170000	experience. So I, I don't, there's people who will find it attractive. But me, it's not fair to ask
4170000	4175200	somebody who loves print media, if they would rather have a physical copy. So.
4176240	4181120	Fair enough. Um, Loki, if, if you're able to answer, um, what about for you,
4181120	4185520	does this make it more attractive for you? Um, honestly, it's still too high. I mean,
4185520	4190320	you know, with even their digital games marketing down 20 bucks, like, I mean, it's a good start,
4190320	4196560	but I've just been kind of spoiled with Steam. I'm just not going to buy anything if it's, you know,
4197440	4202800	unless it's significantly less, I guess, you know, if I was getting the console now and that was the
4202800	4207840	game I was looking to buy, then yeah, I might consider digital, but I don't know, considering
4207840	4212320	that the hard drive's not replaceable and how long it's going to take for me to download it.
4212320	4216720	I may just wait, you know, until it becomes a price that I want to pay for.
4217520	4220560	All right. Sounds like somebody else in the background is spoiled.
4221520	4226880	All right. A little upset at something. All right. Uh, I'll move on to the next story
4226880	4230320	while you go show them a little attention. Uh, I will say this though, as far as like,
4230320	4234000	you know, I'm, I'm looking, I'm looking over at the empty host chair tonight and my copy of
4234000	4238240	bravely default. And, you know, I was really tempted to get the digital release of bravely
4238240	4242560	default so I could have it right at midnight. Um, but I was thinking like, you know, if,
4242560	4247920	if Nintendo had charged $10 less for me to get it digitally, the night it comes out,
4248000	4252000	I would have done it. I would have never bought the physical copy. So I don't know,
4252000	4255600	just food for thought. Like that's kind of my perspective on it is that, yeah, if they can kind
4255600	4260000	of have this competition when it's the day of release and get the price of the games cheaper,
4260000	4265520	it does make it more attractive. That's definitely the reality of it. Anyhow, moving on to, uh, one
4265520	4268880	more story here before we get to the classic game of the week, there was a little bit of back and
4268880	4273520	forth on Reddit this week. And yeah, this is important because it has to do with steam and
4273520	4279840	could steam be actually spying on you. Well, one Reddit user actually posted to the counter
4279840	4286400	strike community that, Hey, uh, I decompiled the VAC, which is, um, a VAC is like the anti-cheat
4286400	4290800	methodology that goes into a lot of games online. Just kind of, I'm oversimplifying things, but
4290800	4296400	that's basically what it is. And apparently the module will go through your DNS, DNS cache
4296400	4302720	entries. It'll hash each one with MD5 report it back to the servers. So in other words,
4302720	4308080	and he goes on to say that, you know, reddit.com would become this and so on. And, uh, you know,
4308080	4312880	if you hash with MD5, that's not foolproof. You can actually kind of see what this is. So
4312880	4318560	long story short, uh, steam was essentially reading like what URLs are you looking at?
4319120	4323120	What, what websites are you looking at? What are you viewing? And of course the first thought,
4323120	4329440	the first reaction everybody has is OMG, my porn. Okay. Maybe not really, but come on. I'm sure a
4329440	4334720	lot of you thought it. Well, this caused, and I had no idea he posted on Reddit, but he does
4334720	4340880	Gabe Newell under a confirmed account actually posted in the general gaming community on Reddit.
4340880	4346960	And I actually super loved his response because he actually talked about, okay, we're not spying
4346960	4351520	on what websites you did. We you're looking at, we don't always talk about VAC, which is the
4351520	4355120	counter hacking system and so forth, because we don't want cheaters to know kind of how we're
4355120	4361440	doing it. But what's happening, basically, the reason why this is happening is that we're looking
4361440	4368640	for certain cheat servers in your cache. And if it finds it, then it's going to do this further
4368640	4373760	check to see if you're doing this, this cheat. And they, he actually said 570 cheaters got banned as
4373760	4378880	a result, but he went on to clarify, if you just visit the website, that's not going to get you
4378880	4382560	banned because some people were concerned that, Oh, well that means if I've ever visited the
4382560	4386640	website, I'm going to be banned. He said, no, this is just kind of, you know, what it's looking for.
4386640	4391920	And he said, the Q and A at the very end was my favorite part because he gave some very
4391920	4398640	plain answers. He said, number one, do we send your browsing history to Valve? No. Number two,
4398640	4405680	do we care what porn sites you visit? This is Gabe Newell. Oh dear God, no, my brain just melted.
4407520	4410720	I might want to know what porn sites you visit. What's hot, y'all? What's hot? No, I'm just
4410720	4417520	kidding. Uh, and number three is Valve using its market success to go evil? I don't think so,
4417520	4422080	but you have to make the call if we are trustworthy, we try really hard to earn
4422080	4427120	and keep your trust. Very interesting comment, you know, and I think it's that kind of openness
4427120	4432000	that people do kind of dig about Valve. I mean, when they are open, I mean, it's not like you can
4432000	4435520	just go say, Hey, how about Half-Life 3 already? I mean, some things are never going to be open
4435520	4440240	about, but that's, that's pretty cool that he did go and make a very, uh, very night and day comment
4440240	4449600	like that. I love that. Dear God, no, my brain just melted. Love it. So there you go. If you
4449600	4453680	want to trust Steam, Steam is telling you they don't care if you're looking at porn or not.
4453680	4459360	That's not what they're looking to get. So, all right. Anyhow, let's travel to a simpler time.
4459360	4464000	Let's travel to a time where, you know, you didn't, you didn't get porn on the internet
4464000	4468800	and it wasn't reported back to companies. If you wanted porn, you went to raid the closet
4469200	4477200	and the hiding place under your bed. It's the classic game of the week. Every week Dark
4477200	4482480	Sakura dives into the fault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey, you little brats, you should be
4482480	4487760	playing this game. And yet again, this week, Dark Sakura, we have one of those games where I go,
4488400	4495200	how in the hell, how in the actual hell have we never had this game before? Because I've done
4495200	4499440	other games in the series that never did this one. And I double check to be sure of that.
4500400	4504480	All right. Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4504480	4512320	It's the Legend of Zelda. The first one early on, and it came out in Japan as the Hyrule
4512320	4518880	Fantasy Zelda no Densetsu. And it came out in 1986 and was released in North America in 1987
4519760	4527840	designed by Miyamoto and Tezuka Takahashi. And it's, well, I know I shouldn't have to
4527840	4531360	tell everybody what it's about, but I'm going to anyway. So basically you have to get the
4531360	4536400	eight fragments of Triforce of Wisdom to rescue Zelda and kick pig face Ganon in the butt.
4539520	4543040	It's top-down perspective. You walk through the world, you shoot stuff with your sword.
4543040	4547840	If you have full hearts or you just go step, step, step, step, step, please die, please die,
4547920	4550720	get rid of that damn shield, just die already when you're playing.
4551280	4554800	And it has different little puzzles thrown in it. Like they go up and up and up and up in the
4554800	4562160	Northwest Southwest, I believe it was. It first came out as a launch title for the
4562160	4566960	Family Computer Disk System, which actually it's got really good music on the disk system.
4569600	4576080	Yeah, the disk system had that different like a different sound processor. Sorry,
4576320	4580720	I'm very impressed. This little video that we're watching. It's a speedrun. Yeah, it's actually
4580720	4584720	a speedrun. You can see this too over the OLR episodes that are posted on YouTube every week.
4584720	4589120	Just want to plug the YouTube channel again because Jason splices all this in. I hate those
4589120	4593840	guys. The little night guys, right? That you have to get them in the back or with a bomb like the
4593840	4598560	speedrunners doing. But you are watching a speedrun here and this guy is starting in level three and
4598560	4603120	it's kind of warping my mind because I'm like, wait a minute, don't you go to you go up, up,
4603120	4607600	up and then to the left. Why are you starting with level three? You're doing it wrong,
4607600	4613200	but I guess not really. Well, all you need for level three is because you have to have,
4613200	4617920	he's basically going for the raft first because you need to have that to get to one of the later
4617920	4622720	areas to get the items you need. I think you have to get the silver arrows before you can kill
4622720	4626000	Ganon. Right. Yeah. I know you have to have the silver arrows, but I always thought you had to
4626000	4630800	have each Triforce fragments. Not really. You can beat the game. Really? I thought that you still
4630800	4633840	had to collect each Triforce fragment. I didn't realize you could just because yeah, level one
4633840	4639360	and two give you what the boomerang or, um, no, I'm wrong in that the bow, the bow is in one
4640000	4646240	and then. Well, there's also, even if you go through it, there's faster ways. Yeah. I mean,
4646240	4651120	if this is a speed run, then it makes sense to do the levels in a faster method so that you're not
4651760	4662640	going back and forth. Um, I'm just impressed. So anyway, um, as I was saying, um, it was the
4662640	4669360	best seller for the Nintendo. It has, uh, sold over 6.5 million copies and it's listed as one
4669360	4677760	of the greatest ever role-playing games. Um, it has a sequel, several prequels, different spinoffs,
4678320	4685200	and it is among Nintendo's most popular series. Um, there also now was, in 1994,
4686000	4691200	there was a version that was released in Japan called the Hyrule Fantasy Zelda no Densetsu 1.
4691920	4694320	Um, that was, uh,
4697680	4705360	it was basically the re-release, um, as well as it was also, uh, one of the first home console games
4705360	4713120	that had an internal battery. So, I mean, the game was awesome. It's, there's hardly anything
4713120	4718480	that I need to say about it. Um, especially in America, we got the gold cartridge, which,
4719200	4725920	if anyone still has the gold cartridge, then consider yourself to be fortunate. We still have
4725920	4729440	a gold cartridge. If you have a gold cartridge with its original battery working and haven't
4729440	4735360	had to replace it, oh my god. But one thing is that, um, Miyamoto said he designed Link,
4735360	4742400	um, as sort of a coming-of-age type of thing with, uh, just a regular guy who strengthens himself up
4742400	4751680	to overcome evil. And Zelda was, um, named after Zelda Fitzgerald, who was, uh, the wife of F. Scott
4751680	4760400	Fitzgerald. You know, who wrote The Great Gatsby. Um, I did not know that. Yep, you didn't know.
4760400	4766080	Oh, I thought you meant Zelda, uh, meant F. Scott Fitzgerald. No, no, no. Yes, I know what that is.
4766080	4769760	I didn't realize that that's where, that's where the naming came from. There were other different
4769760	4774640	neat things that were involved in the Japanese version. Like, you remember, um, the little whole
4774640	4783040	thing where, uh, it said, what was the name of this stupid, um, things with the big pulse voice?
4783040	4788720	Was it pulse voice? Oh yeah, where they dislike noise, so everybody thought you had to use the whistle.
4789440	4795840	Yeah, but what you did is you actually, um, you had to own a Famicom. Well, because the Famicom on the,
4795840	4803280	um, on one of the controllers actually had a, um, a microphone on it that you could blow or shout into
4803280	4812640	and it would kill the, um, pulse voice. Um, so you have to, you, you have to use, um, weapons, of course, in
4812640	4818080	the US one. Um, the cartridge, um, version that came out in Japan also used the memory management
4818080	4825280	controller chip, the MMC1 model. So you could, uh, do bank switching, allowing, um, larger games, uh,
4826960	4832960	to, uh, be possible. And, you know, another thing too that I was reading about this too is that, um,
4834240	4843360	the game itself for the disc cartridge, it was about 128 kilobytes. So, um, it ended up being at
4843360	4851760	the time a little too expensive for them to originally do on a, uh, cartridge. So, um, and like
4851760	4859280	all of the, uh, all of the, uh, dialogue was written in katakana and, um, the passwords were used on,
4859440	4864240	uh, instead of the passwords, they used the rewritable data on the disc. So that's how they led to it
4864240	4869920	being a battery control, a battery save on the American version. And then, you know, the gold, we
4869920	4876960	had the gold copy and lots of, lots of neat stuff. And, of course, they sort of learned from the gaming
4876960	4884480	magazines in Japan that people love gaming tips. So they did a lot of stuff in Nintendo Power. They
4884480	4889840	had different tips in the book, you know, the strategy stuff. And it's really one of the single
4889840	4896320	best games there ever were. We've had all kinds of, I'm not even going to go into the sequel,
4896320	4903760	sequel, sequels and prequels and stuff, but we've had other RPGs that, you know, kind of bit off of
4903760	4909040	the Zelda formula. Like we mentioned, um, Golvelius had some of the same elements, um, that, you know,
4909120	4914240	we talked about last week. There's Crystalis. There's a Seiken Densetsu series. Alindra. You
4914240	4922160	know, all of these RPGs really can owe their, uh, their success to Zelda, you know, for introducing
4922160	4927360	people to that kind of genre. And, you know, as far as the clones were going, like I was saying,
4927360	4934640	you know, we had, um, I think I did Neutopia before as a classic game. I do seem to remember
4934640	4941680	that, yeah. Neutopia was a HuCard game for the PC Engine, and, um, it's very much like a Zelda
4941680	4947760	clone. It plays very similarly. Um, even if you want to go in Ys, except for, you know, the bumping
4947760	4953360	into people to kill them, because Adol apparently can't swing a sword, he has to bone them to death.
4953360	4958080	Um, well, I'll do Ys another day. But, you know, we've got all of these, you know, classic characters
4958080	4965440	too, like we have Link, we have Zelda, Ganon, Impa, you know, and I named my cat Midna after, uh, Twilight
4965440	4974960	Princess, which was a good game too. Um, so yeah, like I said, there were re-releases. Um, there was the, um,
4974960	4983920	the cartridge got re-released for the Famicom in 1994, and then, um, there was, uh, they get, you
4983920	4987600	could play it in Animal Crossing, remember? Although the only way you could get it was through an
4987600	4994800	action replay. You had to do hacks, or, um, hacks or it. You had to have Link from Hyrule, as your, like,
4994800	4999040	your town name was Hyrule, and, because there was that internet resource that had, like, a code for
4999040	5006640	everything. If your character was Link from Hyrule, you could, like, get everything. Yeah. And then, um,
5008080	5014320	there was also, uh, the Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition for GameCube, and then a Game Boy Advance
5014320	5020160	version that, you know, was that, and you also had the Adventure of Link as part of the, uh, Famicom
5020160	5026320	Mini, or as we got it in America, the Plastic Nest series. Um, there's a Virtual Console release in 2006.
5026880	5030960	There was a demo of the game that came out in 2008 for Super Smash Bros. Brawl that was in the
5030960	5036320	vault section. Um, we've just got so many different versions, and then don't forget, one of my favorite
5036320	5043520	versions, which I don't even see it listed in here, was the, uh, Satellaview one. The BS, uh,
5044080	5050880	you, when you see the ROM, it's also just listed as BS, um, Zelda. Actually, it is. Um, that was 1995 through
5050880	5057760	1996. There was BS Zelda No Densetsu Map 2. That was a Satellaview game that was an equivalent of
5057760	5063760	Zelda Second Quest. So, there we go. We did have something, and it was pretty difficult, but very
5063840	5068800	pretty in general. It was just really nice. So, that's it. It's, um, The Legend of Zelda,
5068800	5075200	classic game. Enjoy. All right. There it is, your classic game of the week, The Legend of Zelda, and
5075200	5078960	again, it's one of those games where you go, how the hell has that never been a classic game before?
5078960	5083600	But, you know what? I did other Zelda games. Yeah, you did, I think you did Link to the Past, you did
5083600	5087520	the Game Boy ones, and I'm pretty sure you did Ocarina at some point. You just never did the, the
5087600	5094080	very first. You know what? One of my favorite memes actually was from, uh, Ocarina of Time.
5094080	5098960	Yeah. And it was how the Lake Hylia looks like the Forever Alone guy.
5100720	5106480	That made me laugh. Wow. And by laughing, I mean, just sort of go, huh. Yeah, isn't that neat? All
5106480	5112560	right. What a damn thing. Well, uh, isn't, isn't, uh, isn't Part A of our show pretty neat, but, uh,
5112560	5119120	more show is to come. Look at this show, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you say this episode is complete?
5119840	5123440	No. I didn't know we'd get Dark Sakura singing tonight, everybody. Take a shot,
5123440	5126720	that's going to be in the drinking game, right? She never sings. I never sing. All right. Except
5126720	5130400	when I end on a high note. Are you going to sing Let It Go for us? I know that's your song right
5130400	5135120	now. You know what? Just wait till the cookie, cause it's a different version. All right. And
5135120	5138880	that, and I'm not a soprano, so no. All right. Uh, we're going to take a break, guys. When we
5138880	5143360	come back, uh, we're going to get to the football question of the week, rapid fire news. Um, some
5143360	5148880	interesting news about Duke Nukem, uh, exploits on the Wii U and plenty more when we come back.
5148880	5155280	Maybe, maybe more Jamie singing. Raginator? CDI Zeldas don't count. Yeah. CDI Zeldas are,
5156080	5163040	are not good. It's a blemish. Excuse me, princess. That's not even, that wasn't even in there. It
5163040	5167840	was just, it was awful. It was, but it was, I still had to watch it. Nintendo, never,
5167840	5172480	ever after that licensed anything out of pity ever again. What is Everything is Awesome?
5173280	5177920	Uh, from the Lego movie. I, fuck that movie. I haven't watched it yet. You're just Maggie
5177920	5181200	Dempsey. We should go. We should go on a date. You want to go on a date? Let's go on a date.
5182480	5186240	Dan won't mind. We're going to have a play date like we're five. All right. Uh, anyhow,
5186240	5189760	we're going to take a break, guys. We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

5229760	5235120	dining here. I'm having a little bit of it. Yes. And, uh, good stuff. Popcorn's good and coffee's
5235120	5239600	good too. You're on two cups of coffee tonight. Yeah. I mean, it's still decaf. It's just,
5239600	5244480	you know, it feels good. It makes my throat feel good. Orange Lounge Radio. It's powered by coffee.
5244480	5248080	Although I do not know if tech master Loki is powered by coffee. I seem to recall. He's not
5248080	5252720	a coffee fan. I'm not a huge fan of coffee now. What drink does power you? I guess maybe Mountain
5252720	5257040	Dew. Although didn't you come back on that too? I don't like Mountain Dew. What is it? What drink
5257040	5262960	powers you? Red bull. Oh yeah. God, you can drink. Oh, you can drink lots of that stuff. I can't. Oh,
5262960	5267840	no, no, no. That's the stuff that, well, the rock stars anyway, that's what put Dan in the hospital.
5267840	5274080	Red bull is what got me to 4 AM on the, you know, once a month when I would go do Rocky Horror
5274080	5278480	in San Francisco at midnight. And then the show was over and I drive 90 minutes back home. That's,
5278480	5283840	that was red bull nights for me, but, uh, you know, I can't do that anymore. It's doing 10
5283840	5289280	o'clock locally is bad enough, but no more midnight far away. Anyway. Uh, let's get back
5289280	5295280	into some video game news. Loki starting us off rapid fire news. All right. So, uh, apparently
5295280	5299520	there's going to be another mortal combat game. Cause uh, keeper, someone said, yeah, I'm doing
5299520	5306560	a voice in it. So he didn't say, so I did mortal combat and that's such a huge game, but it's not
5306560	5312800	like Mel yourself five. Well, I mean, of course there's going to be a new mortal combat game.
5312800	5317840	That reboot game did so fricking well. And uh, you know, they, they did their thing last year
5317840	5322400	with injustice and you know, now they can come back to a new mortal combat game. Here's my fan
5322400	5328480	wank though. What if Kiefer Sutherland is doing Jack Bauer? He's sweet. Think about it. Why not?
5328480	5333920	Freddy Krueger was in the last world combat game, right? They got a new 24 series to promote. Why
5333920	5339920	not? Let him be Jack Bauer in mortal combat. That would be bad. Of course, probably end up looking
5339920	5345040	more like striker who is one of the lamest mortal combat characters ever. In my opinion,
5345040	5352400	I'm going to hate that he was all right. Uh, um, so then here's the other cool thing. They
5352400	5357280	had a new trailer for a Wolfenstein, the new order come up and they also announced, you know,
5357280	5363200	that's going to be coming out in may now. But with that though, on the box of, um, the game,
5363200	5369920	it says also you get access to the doom beta. So, Hey, guess what? There's going to be a new doom
5369920	5376880	game now. I heard rumblings. They were working on doom four, but it's kind of like, Oh my God,
5376880	5381600	it's really here type of thing. Yeah. Like it's probably going to be coming out later this year,
5381600	5386720	you know, by the sounds of it, that's going to be crazy. A Wolfenstein in a doom game in one year,
5386720	5395040	man was it the nineties? Yes, it's the nineties. Um, and then last but not least, uh, humble bundle
5395040	5400160	11 started last week and it's got a bunch of great stuff in there. In fact, a lot of games,
5400160	5405440	I think we've played, uh, Guacamelee, uh, dust and the lesion tale, Gianna sisters,
5405440	5411680	twisted dreams, the swapper anti-chamber, uh, and Monaco, of course, you know, anti-chamber
5411680	5416640	Monica or those ones that you get, if you pay over the average, um, and then they still haven't
5416640	5420880	even, you know, said what the other couple of games are. Cause they always add stuff towards
5420880	5426000	the end. Usually it's stuff from prior bundles though. So if you buy them all like me, he already
5426000	5433520	have it, but great cause. And those games, I mean, are so good. Like, you know, I just,
5434240	5440000	please buy this bundle. I really don't know how else to say it. Yeah. Donate all the money to
5440000	5448000	charity if you want. Let's move on some more stories for you guys. Um, a really cool mod for
5448000	5452160	Spelunky. I was talking about that game a lot at the end of last year. Well, somebody has actually
5452160	5457280	done a mod here. I'm actually going to see if I can play this video in studio. Um, of course
5457280	5463040	there's some stupid ad attached to it, but let me see if I can skip ahead from this and get into the
5463040	5470960	mod itself. But apparently somebody has combined Spelunky with Metroid. Somebody's got to do some
5470960	5474320	stupid narration on this. All right, fine. I'm going to play it muted there, but yes,
5474320	5478080	there's little, uh, Metroid. They were only seeing what we were thinking. Yeah, I know. Right. When
5478080	5483120	I first saw this, I said hot diggity dang too. So, um, apparently what he did, he actually went
5483120	5488560	through and reskinned the original sprites and then he swapped out the music to actually recreate
5488560	5492080	the look of Metroid. Well, all I see right now is a title screen. So I'm going to fast forward
5492080	5498960	to the five minute mark in the video here. It's the five minute mark and, um, you can, I can see,
5498960	5502720	okay. Yeah, it's got, they've actually changed the little guy to a little Samus is running around
5502720	5507040	and everything's like purpley. There's a little, oh, it's the Chozo statues that shoot things and
5507040	5511760	okay. That's really cute. That's kind of cool. I like that. That's really neat what they did to
5511760	5518080	that there. So, uh, this is Joey for track who did this reskin these, uh, sprites and actually
5518080	5522640	swapped out the music too, to kind of make it look a little more like Metroid, but, um, you know,
5522640	5529520	obviously Spelunky Metroid, very different games, but, um, that's pretty awesome. Very cool. I like
5529520	5535600	that. All right. Anyhow, moving on a story about Gran Turismo five, uh, Gran Turismo five will
5535600	5542400	have its DLC go bye-bye on April 30th. Very strange. Why would you end DLC? I would think
5542400	5546960	you would keep it out there forever, but I guess due to maybe licensing issues, because these are
5546960	5551840	cars that they license or whatever, um, Gran Turismo five, not only will the online play end up,
5551840	5558880	uh, expiring in may, but, uh, April 30th will be the end of the DLC. So, uh, the racing car pack
5558880	5564400	and the course pack, uh, that is, that's it. You, um, can download and install a free supplemental
5564400	5568400	piece of DLC though, called family upgrade. Um, that's the only way you're going to be able to
5568400	5574160	access those after April 30th. Um, some DLC can still be reloaded through PSN, even if the local
5574160	5580720	data gets, uh, erased, but, uh, yeah. Um, Gran Turismo TV also shutting down March 14th. So a lot
5580720	5585440	of this stuff in Gran Turismoville going bye-bye, but that's because Gran Turismo six is where they
5585440	5590480	want you to be right now. And that's, that's what they do. Uh, lastly, but not leastly,
5590480	5594640	we mentioned this last week on the show, but I just want to bring it up again. Ikaruga is now
5594640	5600800	out on steam. And, uh, the reason why I bring this up again is that, uh, it's based on the 2008 Xbox
5600800	5607840	live arcade port, Xbox 360 controller port, uh, support screen rotating and horizontal play. And
5607840	5614320	the price $10 in North America is, uh, what this is going to cost there. So pretty cool. Ikaruga
5614320	5618560	now available on steam. Dark soccer owns this game about four times. Is there going to be a fifth?
5618560	5620320	Why can't they just give us a radiant silver gun?
5622080	5626800	Uh, also just want to say the steam version also features the double play mode that lets you beat
5626800	5633760	the two player game with just one controller. Have fun. Good luck. Moving on dark soccer.
5634640	5641760	Well, it's about time. The year of Luigi is going to conclude on March 18th and the Mi
5641760	5648080	versus communities that are attached to it will be closing. You know who says so? Miyamoto says so,
5648080	5653440	that's who. It'll always be the year of Luigi in our hearts. It'll always be the year of Luigi
5653440	5659200	at DJ run the S's house. It'll always be the year of black Luigi during the Skype segment
5659200	5665920	here on OLR. Yes. Also in other news, um, super smash brothers has a new character
5665920	5672400	and that's for the 3DS and Wii U. It will be Diddy Kong. Yay. Why should you just give us
5672400	5677520	new characters? I mean, it gets a little Mac was new, right? That was actually really funny trailer.
5677520	5682640	Yes, he is brand new and in high demand, but like I'd rather have brand new characters in it. Oh,
5682640	5687360	Hey, like this character's back and this character's back. What brand new Nintendo
5687360	5693360	characters they haven't really had. There is a lot that hasn't been smashed for a submarine
5693360	5702000	from steel driver. How about Gino? There's a good start. Fair enough. Can I continue?
5702800	5710080	Yes. After Loki and I are done arguing and we're done men. Um, and also there will be, um,
5710080	5717520	Hatsune Miku Project Diva F. It's going to have, um, we've got an update in the release
5717520	5722800	date. It's going to be out March 4th in North America and March 12th in Europe. And it's going
5722800	5728480	to be 30 bucks on the PS store. And on top of that, even though it's not cross buys,
5728480	5733760	Sega has said that any DLC purchase for the PS3 version will automatically unlock on the Vita.
5733760	5740480	Yeah. And that's including the snow Miku 2013 set, the extra songs and extra character modules.
5742400	5748080	And that's it. Get your Miku on. By the way, you know what I found today? What? When I was
5748080	5753440	looking for parodies of, let it go. And then I found the Japanese version. I found, um,
5753440	5760320	someone who had done it for, um, uh, Vocaloid. Oh, it was pretty cool. It was funny. All right.
5761120	5765440	And to go back to characters that have not been in Smash Brothers that could easily be in Smash
5765440	5771760	Brothers. How about, um, there's Geno, the Unicycle from Uniracers, the car from Stunt
5771760	5776720	Race FX, um, or hell we could even have the car from RC Pro-Am. I don't know if that was
5776720	5782240	a Nintendo game though. We need Slippy. That was a rare game though. Slippy. I'd go with Slippy,
5782240	5788080	that's fine. Uh, Awesome Unicorn in chat suggests Monita for Super Smash Brothers. Did people liked
5788080	5796000	Monita? She was kind of annoying. Captain Rainbow. How about Tingle? Loki. How about Tingle? Come
5796000	5802000	on. He's in the cyst. He's in the cyst. All right. Fair enough. All right. Let's get to the Fugu
5802000	5815040	question of the week. You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam it together, you get Fugu.
5815040	5821280	And, uh, our question, excuse me, I have a cough. Radio guy's worst nightmare.
5823840	5829200	Help. Uh, Rob, don't die. Please don't die. And by the way, Rama, I can't link you the
5829200	5832720	Vocaloid version because I have the same from my computer at home. Okay. This is why I should not
5832720	5838000	eat popcorn during the show. Shame on me. Anyhow, uh, let's get to the Fugu question of the week.
5838000	5844320	Every week, uh, we ask you guys a question on our Fugu, uh, communities and you guys answer it.
5844320	5849200	So this week we decided to go off the, uh, success of the, uh, Chroma announcement and
5849200	5854560	how everybody's talking about that. So this week, Harmonix announced that they were working on
5854560	5860560	Chroma, which is a game that combines two genres, music games and first person shooters. What kind
5860560	5866400	of odd couple marriage of genres would you like to see in a video game? So here we have music games
5866400	5872560	and shooters. What do you want to see when genres collide in your game? Uh, I'm going to go to Google
5872560	5876400	Plus tonight because I'm very impressed. Six answers on Google Plus. Who knew there were six
5876400	5882160	people using Google Plus? So six whole people, six whole people. All right. Starting off with
5882160	5888880	Rhetortainment who says an RPG complete with a leveling system, quests and unlocking abilities
5888880	5893920	with a combat style that is similar to a fighting game. For example, Street Fighter or Mortal Combat.
5894480	5901840	I thought there was something like this out there. Maybe I'm just crazy. Uh, Noel G says,
5901840	5907600	uh, data track, Katamari and portal. Oh, data track must be the name. I'm sorry. Katamari and
5907600	5915360	portal. Dark soccer. Would that work for you? A Katamari plus portal? Possibly. It could be fun.
5915360	5919840	All right. Uh, going to act deaf to says, are there any combinations who haven't been done
5919840	5927440	already? I mean, Chroma does break the mold, but, um, outside of that, I don't know of any
5927440	5931600	combinations that haven't been done already. Maybe a fighting rhythm game, but that's probably
5931600	5937280	been done too. I feel like there was one of those many times. Def Jam icon, for example.
5941760	5945920	All right. Um, sorry guys. I'm trying to troubleshoot another issue here.
5947440	5951760	That's okay. You're forgiven, Rob. I have absolved you of all dead airspace.
5951760	5957440	Thank you. Appreciate it guys. Live radio. It's a lot of fun. So, all right. Anyhow,
5957520	5963200	um, moving on to the next question on, or excuse me, the next answer on Google plus,
5963200	5966640	our friend Renee. Oh, I miss her face so much. If you're out there listening,
5966640	5970160	Renee, I miss your face. We need to hang out soon. But Renee replied and said,
5970160	5976160	survival horror and puzzle. Think candy crush saga on rails. Okay. When you hear,
5976160	5978720	when I hear candy crush saga, I'm going to admit I get a little like,
5980000	5986000	but what about like bejeweled in hell? That's kind of cool. That might be interesting. You
5986000	5992560	play with soul gems, but isn't that sort of like a puzzle quest? A puzzle quest is more like RPG
5992560	5998640	and puzzle, but survival horror and puzzle, like, I guess there is a part of me that kind of thinks
5998640	6002960	of maybe like phantasmagoria. If you want to get old school, cause that was like an old, like that
6002960	6008320	type of puzzle game was like a nineties, you know, Sierra, but anyhow, I still have trivia and
6008320	6017120	survivor horror answer the question or die. You don't know Jack just got real.
6019520	6025360	This sounds like the type of game that dark soccer would create. It's like correct grammar or death.
6027120	6032640	He will learn to speak proper English. I really think you should make this game dark soccer,
6032640	6036240	correct? Damn grammar or death. The only way to win is not to play.
6038720	6044000	This could be your last visit. Y O U apostrophe R E death.
6048160	6051680	It would be like, what's that earthworm adventures, except it would be like death worm.
6052960	6058080	That'll be my game. Deathworm adventures. All right. Travis H says, how about a modern day
6058080	6064080	builder like SIM city meeting a real time tactical like CNC or red alert. Uh, once you've
6064080	6069440	built your proper city, you log into a multiplayer server and defend or attack other cities as well
6069440	6073920	and preserve and protect humanity and your own kind of like Eve on a much smaller or personal
6073920	6080720	scale. I like that idea. That's really cool. Um, um, there's people have got some really
6080720	6084800	unique ideas. It sounds like it kind of also sounds like sieve to me a little bit. I mean,
6084800	6087840	maybe not as action oriented as what you're thinking, Travis, but I don't know. That's
6087840	6093840	where my mind went. Uh, our, our buddy Jason is over on Google and saying, uh, typing trainer
6093840	6099200	and rails shooter. Oh, typing at the dead. Yep. Typing trainer and platformer. Oh,
6099200	6103600	Mario teaches typing, typing trainer and parkour, I guess.
6103600	6118080	Uh, let's see. Moving on to, uh, some of our Facebook answers here. We have a gamer girl who
6118080	6123360	says puzzle and RPG. It just seems like a good idea unless it's already been done. Puzzle quest
6123360	6127440	would be my answer there, which is, which is a fabulous little game gamer girl. If you haven't
6127440	6131920	checked that out, it's, it's on like every fricking it's on PC. I'm sure it's on steam.
6131920	6138400	Uh, every console, mobile, everywhere. KJ submits a haiku. Well done KJ. KJ says,
6138400	6145280	I want to play a horror music rhythm game. My name is made up. I think that's because
6145280	6149120	I always mispronounce his name when I read it there. You get KJ now. How's that? There you
6149120	6155520	have it. What is a horror music rhythm game? Rock of the dead. Oh, good thought. Good thought.
6155520	6159760	All right. It was terrible, but it's basically house of the dead or even type into the dead,
6159760	6167120	but with, um, rock band instruments or guitar instruments. Um, Andy R says a strategy, RPG,
6167120	6171600	and a third person shooter. Basically I want Sega to stop making hedgehog stuff and make
6171600	6178000	Valkyria Chronicles 4. Understood. That is a worthy response. Understood. Understood.
6178000	6181520	There should be another Valkyria Chronicles. Degenerate Johnny says, I'm fairly certain
6181520	6186160	that this has been done before, but I'd like to see more RTS shooters. A game in which you command
6186160	6190160	armies overhead, but you also have the ability to take control of the year units from their
6190160	6194720	perspective. A nice balance between macro management and micro management. Does that
6194720	6200720	game exist that you know of Loki? Which one? An RTS combined with a shooter. You command the
6200720	6205600	armies when they go to battle. What about like, yes, that is, I actually already have a few of
6205600	6210960	those. There is, um, there's an indie game that's like that. I know I can't remember the name and
6210960	6217680	there was one on 360 that was released by Sega. I'm thinking super old school, but, um, Arkon
6217680	6220880	kind of makes me think of that. Although it's not really a first person shooter, but there was,
6220880	6226160	I think a command and conquer game is like command and conquer generals, I think was like that.
6226160	6232080	Yeah. All right. Uh, moving on, uh, Unfolded Raptor says, Starhawk was like that.
6233280	6237920	Um, Unfolded Raptor says, I want to see a Cabela's big game RPG. You go around the world
6237920	6242240	hunting down beasts and you have to level up hunting rats at first, then hunting skeletons
6242240	6247440	and goblins. Guns can be upgraded and there would be stats and skill trees galore. You can outfit
6247440	6252320	your Hunter with different armor, shoot magic out of certain guns with lighting, fire, ice,
6252320	6257120	et cetera. Your main goal of the game is to kill an evil family of dragons that have captured all
6257120	6262480	the deer in the world and to set them free. So Cabela's big game Hunter 2015 can exist.
6262480	6267760	If you fail, the series ends forever. Well, I know Dark Sakura would play that and purposely
6268160	6277360	fail. Uh, Trihexan, maybe it's kind of close. Only thing I can think of, uh, Raginator says,
6277360	6280640	I can't think of a serious answer. So I'll go with the strangest, most whacked out answer I
6280640	6284800	can come up with. How about a zombie game like left for dead combined with a music rhythm game,
6284800	6290560	like space channel five, part two, and a Japanese dating gate dating SIM. You play the role of a
6290560	6295840	zombie and in between eating human brains, you try to win the decaying heart of another zombie with a
6295840	6302800	dance off. Was that lollipop chainsaw? Maybe it just didn't really have the music part. All
6302800	6309680	right. Anyway, uh, Renee, uh, answers, uh, saying I don't remember it being in existence, but I'd
6309680	6318240	love to see a fighter rhythm game. Um, Def Jam icon. There you go. Fifth dream says I'd love
6318240	6326240	to see a virtual pet slash puzzle game. Imagine raising a tetromino from birth, teaching it,
6326240	6330640	playing with it, feeding it, and depending on the kind of food you give it, whether you train it to
6330640	6335440	behave well and its intelligence level, it might involve into an L shape or a T shape, or if you're
6335440	6339760	lucky, the coveted straight piece. Then when it reaches maturity, you send it off to fulfill its
6339760	6344960	destiny, falling from the sky and completing lines with other tetrominoes. Best game ever. Um, fifth
6344960	6348960	dream. There is a virtual pet puzzle game and it's huge in Japan. And I think it's pretty huge
6348960	6354640	here. It's called puzzle and dragons. It's on mobile. I thought it was stupid as hell. I tried
6354640	6359200	playing it. I thought it was dumb as hell. I don't know why this is so popular, but it is. Maybe
6359200	6363200	you'll see something in it. I didn't, but I kind of ranked it right up there with candy crush to be
6363200	6368400	honest. But that is all the, not as cool as what you're describing fifth dream. It is a virtual
6368400	6375600	pet meets puzzle game. And lastly, um, Austin S replies and says dating sim slash survival horror
6375600	6380320	slash FPS. It's very similar to, uh, radiators either. Be careful who you date because they may
6380320	6385280	be out to get you. Alternatively, your waifu could help you progress throughout the game.
6386080	6390720	Well, they do have dating sim and shooter. Remember Galgun?
6391280	6396560	Yeah. Oh God. Yes. Yes. All right. Good answers. I actually read them all tonight,
6396560	6400320	but if you want to go support the listeners and see them, see the full answers for yourself,
6400320	6404560	you can check it out over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, or you can check it out at
6404560	6411440	Google plus over at, uh, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio Akuma JP in the chat says,
6411440	6416720	I love it. Puzzle and dragon. Is it, is it just the version here we have sucks or something? Like
6416720	6421440	I would believe that that the Japanese version is better than what we have, but yeah, I think it's,
6421440	6426880	I think it's kind of bad, but again, I just, you know, everybody's welcome to their opinion.
6428080	6434960	All right. Back to some more gaming news. Loki. So gearbox has sued 3d realms and interceptor
6434960	6439360	over their brand new Duke Nukem title that they're, they were teasing. I don't remember
6439360	6443120	the full title for the new game, but it's supposed to be like a arts. He asked, I think,
6443120	6449920	or something like that. Um, anyways, apparently gearbox, um, yeah. Isometric action role-playing
6449920	6456960	game was new Duke Nukem, which sounds kind of terrible, but okay. Um, apparently it's because
6456960	6465680	gearbox actually purchased the rights to Duke Nukem back in 2010. And, um, I guess they're
6465680	6472320	saying that, you know, 3d realms is attempting to re-license the IEP that it already sold. And in
6472320	6479600	the process has infringed, um, gearbox's copyright and gearbox, of course, honestly shouldn't have
6479600	6483440	the copyright after the terrible game that they made with Duke Nukem forever, but you know,
6483440	6491120	that's another story. Um, I guess they're saying that, uh, because of this, they're trying to stop
6491120	6501600	the, uh, creation of that new game. So yeah. I don't know. I think, I mean, if that's true,
6501600	6505120	that they did actually sell the rights to Duke Nukem, then I guess there's not really much they
6505120	6511520	can do, but I mean, if they licensed it maybe just for that game, maybe that's something
6511520	6517360	different. I'm kind of surprised that 3d realms and interceptor would have gone as far as they
6517360	6522320	did without thinking that they have the legal ground to do it. I gotta think that they have,
6522320	6527200	they must have licensed it just for that. You know, I have a feeling it's just for that game
6527200	6533840	because, you know, we had since then, we've had the Duke Nukem 3d, you know, being re-released,
6534800	6542800	and that was done by Devolver Digital and they obviously had licensed that. So there's been
6542800	6548560	licensees since then, unless that was a whole separate thing. I don't know. I just, what's
6548560	6552160	gearbox really going to do with it other than poopoo on the whole franchise again? I mean,
6552160	6556480	I don't know. Well, Bobby Blackwolf is in chat wanting to stick up for gearbox a little bit
6556480	6561360	saying, you know, 3d realms made most of the Duke Nukem forever game. Gearbox just finished it.
6562320	6566320	Oh, there's that. Dungeon Buster says the filed lawsuit for this has quite a bit of legal
6566320	6572240	snarkiness in it. And nemesis 47 says, I actually enjoy Duke Nukem forever, despite the reviews.
6572240	6577200	So I tried, it just kept crashing up. Yeah. All right. Those comments from our chat room
6577200	6584240	over at live.vognetwork.com. Well, I'm all, this will end as it always does. Settlement,
6584240	6591120	right? Somebody will get paid, then it'll be a settlement. All right. Moving on to another
6591120	6595600	story. And this was mentioned in tonight's intro and we're finally getting around to discussing
6595600	6602640	this, but, uh, it is, uh, it's, it's more of the impact of this. Fucking little mobile phone game
6602640	6606880	that we would have never given a second thought to had it not just caught on like crazy. And of
6606880	6613840	course it is flappy bird still going, but here's the thing. And here is why flappy VOG will never
6613840	6620320	come to the app store because apparently Apple is starting to crack down on the use of flappy
6620320	6625360	in the app store. Uh, some developers are saying that they are submitting apps that have the word
6625360	6631120	flappy and they will get rejected by Apple. Uh, one of the folks speaking up, John Carpenter,
6631120	6637680	who tried to do flappy dragon and, uh, Apple replied and said, this isn't happening because,
6637680	6641360	uh, and they cited different reasons. We found that your app and or its metadata
6641360	6644240	contains content that could be misleading to users, which is not in compliance with
6644240	6648480	the app store guidelines. We found your app name attempts to leverage a popular app.
6648480	6654000	So even though flappy bird is gone, they're still trying to, you know, shoot down that name.
6654000	6658880	Can we call it flappy? He could call it flappy dragon. And, and I like that they, they, they
6658880	6665120	say that now, meanwhile, like how many years has the app store been around and how many games we
6665120	6672960	had based on angry birds or, you know, uh, doodle jump or cut the rope or any of those other popular
6672960	6677920	apps. It should be noted that there's, uh, there's already a crap ton of these on the store, but
6677920	6683040	some are changing their name. There's a very popular one called flappy bee that changed its
6683040	6687760	name to jumpy bee. I, and I don't know, we don't know if this was due to Apple pressure or just
6687760	6693600	some, a lot of times people proactively change something out of fear. Uh, by the way, don't just
6693600	6698480	blame this on Apple because Google reportedly doing the same thing apps being submitted to
6698480	6705040	Google play that say flappy and the title are being denied saying spam. So interesting. So
6705040	6709440	time to come up with a new word. What would we have to call? Here's a question for the folks
6709440	6714800	here at OLR. Let's say Bobby decided to make flappy vog for mobile. He's not gonna, don't get
6714800	6721520	your hopes up, but let's just, let's do a little, let's do some flappy vog fanfic. Let's say that
6721520	6728160	flappy vog goes to mobile since he can't use the word flappy. What will the game be called?
6728160	6735920	Vog splat. I like vog splat. Loki. What would, uh, what would this, this almost begs for a list
6735920	6739840	list. I don't know. I should have planned one for tonight. Loki. What would flappy vog be called?
6744080	6752240	Vappy vog. I don't know. That's it. Crappy vog. Hold on. I haven't done one of these in a while.
6752240	6754800	Hold on. I did think of something we could do this here. I'm going to do,
6754800	6757280	I'm going to do a live poll. So wait, we have crappy vog.
6759760	6763520	Okay. That's a good idea. What was the other one that you said? Um, vog splat.
6766080	6768960	My sub, my submission will be don't flap it up.
6770000	6774400	Ha ha ha. And what else did, what did you have, Loki?
6777280	6779200	Vappy. Vappy.
6779200	6787600	I think that was vappy vog. Do we have, do we have one more for this? All right. I guess we'll,
6787600	6792400	we'll run with four. So, uh, there you go. So we're going to go to it. Um,
6793440	6796080	let's see if I can get it to it. We're going to ask the audience
6799280	6807200	right now over at live.vognetwork.com. We want your answer. What would flappy vog be called
6807200	6817200	on mobile? Would it be crappy vog, vog splat, don't flap it up or vappy vog? Answer now over
6817200	6822640	at live.vognetwork.com. I have a 50% chance.
6826800	6829200	I don't think the game's crappy. I just think it's funny.
6829200	6831200	Yeah. I think it's just funny to call it crappy vog.
6831200	6839120	A rage nator in chat says, try saying vappy vog fanfic five times fast.
6841440	6846800	All right. Um, we'll get those answers and, uh, read the, read the winner here in just a minute.
6846800	6851280	Uh, meanwhile, let's go to our next story, which is dark Sakura.
6851280	6855120	That is me, isn't it? Well, how about, um,
6855120	6861280	and you know, we, we did talk about apps just a moment ago, and this does play into the whole
6861280	6867440	Google play thing is that they're actually have stated that the number of play apps,
6867440	6874800	Google play apps, um, has quadrupled in two years for the ones that, uh, contain malware.
6875680	6881600	Um, the number of apps that, uh, had malicious code in them in 2011 was 11,000.
6882560	6890720	2013 is 42,000. And of course, um, the, the number of apps on Google play, um,
6890720	6896240	grew from a 250,000 to a million apps, um, within the two years. So that's, uh,
6896240	6901360	basically about 4% of the apps on Google play have some sort of malicious code.
6902560	6905520	So just, uh, make sure it's reputable, read, reuse.
6906240	6908160	And by malicious code, they mean cat pictures.
6909120	6914320	No. Well, I'm sure there's a lot of cat picture apps that would then inject malicious code.
6914320	6917280	It's really sad to me how much this crap is out there. And you know,
6917280	6920720	I really wish Google would do more to crack down on it. I realized
6920720	6926880	some people do not like how cramped down Apple store is, you know, but, um, the,
6926880	6931680	on the bright side, very few, I, nothing is foolproof, but very few of the malware gets
6931680	6936080	through on Apple comparatively. So it's just, it's unfortunate because it makes people just
6936160	6942480	not want to install anything and that hurts the indie developers. Right. So, all right,
6942480	6945280	we'll do one more story. Then we'll go to the results of our poll. Loki.
6945280	6945920	I'm curious.
6946880	6953760	Okay. So the first ever Wii U exploit, and this is actually getting, I mean,
6953760	6957440	there's been stuff that actually works on the Wii U. I think you can actually install the
6957440	6962800	home brew channel on the Wii part of the Wii U, but this is actually something that's accessing
6962800	6969120	parts of the Wii U, um, operating system itself. And so there's an exploit that actually uses the
6969120	6976640	Wii channel, um, that they've been able to dump the boot ROM, uh, bin file, which is part of the
6976640	6983280	Wii U system. And they're saying it's similar to the, I guess, the same way that, um, that they
6983280	6990000	access boot zero on the Wii. Um, and basically what that's going to allow them to do at some
6990000	6996640	point is to have stuff hook into that to where, you know, you can run your own home brew that
6996640	7001920	has access to the Wii U, you know, processing power instead of just being locked down within
7001920	7010080	the confines of, um, the Wii itself. How interesting and ironic that there's so many
7010080	7014160	similarities to how it was done on the Wii. And here's the, here's the interesting part
7014160	7020320	about that too. The way that the exploit's done, it cannot be patched. It says it's basically,
7020320	7025120	it's hard-coded and in order to patch it out, they would have to issue new hardware.
7027760	7033120	So wait a minute, hold new hardware to block the thing?
7033120	7039360	Yeah, because it's hard-coded. So there's no way that they can, um, patch it out with like
7039360	7043680	a software patch or something. Well, that's gotta suck for Nintendo, but be good for the
7043680	7051360	developers. Yeah. Well, I'm just saying if piracy comes to the Wii, that's not going to really
7051360	7057040	attract more third parties. They're already hurting in that department as it is. Um, Bobby
7057040	7061200	Blackwolf in our chat room says, well now Nintendo will remove the Wii channel the same way Sony
7061200	7071520	removed other OS. I don't know if they'll do that. I don't know. They do seem kind of remove
7071520	7076400	happy these days with, you know, just removing functions from things and shutting down whole
7076400	7084400	communities. Yeah, but you're Luigi's one thing. So, all right. Anyhow, let's move on. We're going
7084400	7088800	to get to the results of our poll. I'm going to shut it down. If you haven't voted by now,
7088800	7096960	it is too late. The poll is closed. So again, the question, what would flappy vog be called
7096960	7101120	on mobile? Cause they can't, we can't use flappy anymore cause they've put the end of that.
7101200	7104480	And I'm not saying that Bobby's ever going to actually do this, but let's just,
7104480	7109440	this is our fanfic. If it was done on mobile, what would it be called? The overwhelming majority,
7109440	7117840	58.82%. So over half of the listeners voted for vog splat would be the name of the game. Vog splat
7118400	7125200	coming in second place, vappy vog and a crappy vog and don't flap it up tying for last place.
7125200	7130400	Good job. So vog splat. All right. Thank you for, uh, thank you for indulging us there with
7130400	7135520	the votes. Appreciate it. All right. Let's move on to another story here before we get to the mail
7135520	7140960	bag, our last week of a mailbag at Orange. We're not ending the mailbag. It's just a new address.
7140960	7146800	So here's the deal. Uh, Square Enix is commenting on a new game that they made called NOS Goth. It
7146800	7151440	is a free to play multiplayer game. It's set in the legacy of Kane universe, which we've talked
7151440	7156960	about this game before. So NOS Goth is the game that's being created, but they are saying this
7156960	7165120	is not a pay to win game. Square Enix is coming out. Here's the quote. NOS Goth is a free to play
7165120	7170240	game, but it's not pay to win. One of the key goals has been to create a fair experience that
7170240	7176000	doesn't penalize players who don't spend money in the game. As such, NOS Goth does not include items,
7176000	7181280	weapons, or abilities that are inherently better. So what do you do? You use what's called,
7181280	7187840	here's a new term everybody, side grades. Oh, they're not upgrades. They're side grades.
7187840	7191600	These paid items will be better in some respects, but there'll be worse than others.
7191600	7195760	For instance, something called a full board cannon. It's stronger than the hand cannon,
7195760	7202400	but it will carry fewer rounds. So you can enhance areas that you're stronger in, but you know,
7202400	7207840	at whatever cost. So, uh, two different currency systems in NOS Goth. You get gold and doing
7207840	7212640	battles, more gold if you do better performance. And of course you can pay real money for rune
7212640	7218080	stones and the rune stones will give access to items before you've earned gold or experience
7218080	7222080	to unlock them. And it's the only way you get chess keys and all this crap you're used to in
7222080	7227760	these free to play games. But side grades y'all that's, that's the new way of making you pay for
7227760	7235440	side grades. They're not better. They're just different. I don't know. It takes a lot to make
7235440	7240800	me look at a mobile game these days and I'm not sure this is, uh, I'm not sure this is going to
7240800	7247600	win me over. So, all right. Is anybody going to check out this free to play game with side grades?
7247600	7252720	Loki? No, no, no way. I had a feeling, I had a feeling. All right guys, let's get to the mail
7252720	7261360	bag every week. You guys mail us at mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com. But no more after this
7261360	7266720	week. Um, we are going to be closing our mail just, we have a really bad spam problem that's
7266720	7271600	just gotten worse over the past few years. So you know what? We want, you know what? We want our
7271600	7275760	most loyal listeners to still be able to contact us. We know you guys are listening. So we do have
7275760	7280560	a new email address and I'll tell you what that email address is in just a minute, but let's get
7280560	7286800	to the emails tonight. Dark Sakura. This comes from Robert M. Just for a last email to this
7286800	7290960	address. I have quite a few fighting games on PSN from the disappointing ragdoll kung fu to
7290960	7297760	Marvel versus Capcom two to acceleration of sugary X. I was wondering, is that X or 10? I don't know.
7298480	7303840	I was wondering which fighter would be the better $15 purchase dive kick or skull girls encore.
7303840	7307840	And what do you think either would get a discount on PS plus I'd give her skull girls just because
7307840	7313360	I've played it and skull girls is pretty fun. And I also don't know about PS plus. I've played dive
7313360	7318000	kick and I think it will go free on PlayStation plus. It seems like a really good candidate
7318000	7321680	and I'm going to be honest. I think the game is a little bit over-hyped. I don't,
7321680	7327040	I don't think it's as great as everybody thinks it is. Sorry. I know that's the unpopular opinion,
7327040	7332400	but I would also say go with skull girls. Also my chiropractor uninstalled steam on his windows PC
7332400	7337520	because he was getting too much spam email. Could this actually possibly be related to his account?
7338400	7343360	I don't think so. You can tell it not to email you stuff. The only stuff I ever get on my,
7343360	7347360	from my email that's attached to my steam is just, uh, my purchase receipts.
7347920	7354320	And when I changed my password. So no, I don't think so. It got quiet.
7355920	7361520	I got nothing else to say. I'm eating popcorn. Okay. Hello LR. Well the theme music finished.
7361520	7365280	Yeah. Okay. You guys kept me company in Friday night traffic. So thank you for that.
7365840	7369280	You covered the recent Nintendo direct, but didn't even mention that a part of it that I
7369280	7372880	was personally most excited about the announcement of Rusty's real deal baseball.
7372880	7377360	This is the localization of Danameshi sports shop. A game I've really been enjoying on my
7377360	7382560	Japanese 3DS that I was really hoping for. In a nutshell, a former baseball player now broke
7382560	7388240	with 10 kids to feed runs a store that sells baseball themed Nintendo 4DS mini games. These
7388240	7393200	mini games are bought with real money and appear to be $4 each, but using items obtained in game
7393200	7397360	and some hackling skills, you can basically cut the price of each to between a buck 50 and $2.
7398080	7401680	You know what I just will say real quick. I totally did slip through the
7401680	7404720	cracks and didn't mention it last week. There was just a lot of info that came out of that
7404720	7408880	Nintendo direct, but thank you for bringing it up because that was a pretty big deal where the
7409680	7414560	real life price of items could be negotiated within the game. That is kind of a new little
7414560	7418800	twist. So thank you for bringing it up. It is worth mentioning cause it's, it's a little bit
7418800	7424560	new for DLC. The mini games themselves. Oh, where was I either were or feel like they were made by
7424560	7428960	WarioWare developers. Each mini game has 50 different challenges to complete and they're
7428960	7433600	insanely fun to play. Some are traditional like pressing A to hit a ball and others aren't like
7433600	7439680	the, uh, like tilting the 3DS upwards to catch a fly ball hit high into the air or stepping into
7439680	7444320	the shoes of an umpire calling ball strikes and more. You can buy everything there is for under
7444320	7449200	$20 and if this sort of game sounds fun to you, you absolutely will get your money's worth. I
7449200	7455280	definitely recommend it. Unlook is dismal Wii U outlook. I personally believe that there is one
7455280	7459040	thing that could turn, um, that could totally turn Wii U around. A brand new character driven
7459040	7463600	Nintendo developed IP that has such gorgeous graphics and great gameplay that everyone says
7463600	7468560	I need to have that. I don't think that this will be very likely to happen but I do want to believe
7468560	7472240	that Nintendo is still capable of creating compelling new characters in a brand new world
7472240	7477360	even if it's been years since they last did so. A Master System game that definitely didn't get
7477360	7481840	enough love over the years, Zillion, which I have covered Zillion by the way. I do believe I have
7481920	7488880	because, um, I talked about the anime too and that the Master System gun was actually the Zillion gun.
7489840	7494480	So I remember that. And this one's to me. Oh, to a guy friendzoning can be a bummer if the guy
7494480	7498240	actually wanted a deeper relationship with the girl. A deeper relationship doesn't always have
7498240	7503600	to mean sex and I've said it on the show tonight. Some of us think about other things too like who
7503600	7513680	we want to spend our futures with and my, my rebuttal with that is that I don't believe that
7514240	7522000	it's right to go after, to have, you know, what's the way to say this? A lot, a lot of the times you
7522000	7526000	run into the friendzone thing complaining about a girl that won't put out but at the same time
7527680	7531120	when you're looking for the person to spend the rest of your life with,
7531360	7538560	I don't always think that going into something with the expectation of long-term is healthy
7538560	7541040	to start a relationship off of from the very beginning.
7542240	7545520	Would it be fair to say just as a piece of general advice, and I'm not directing this at
7545520	7549920	the emailer, I'm just saying in general, a good piece of advice would be don't be creepy.
7549920	7555040	Yeah, don't be creepy. Because I'll be perfectly honest, you know, what, what attracted me to Dan,
7555040	7559840	we went into our relationship with no sort of long-term thing in mind. I mean, we were pretty
7560720	7565200	sure that we were going to stay together but we went into it without, you know,
7565840	7573040	we were friends first. That's what made us great and we are still friends but we also have a very,
7573040	7577520	very deep loving relationship but we were friends first.
7577520	7583920	Alan and I were friends on a website that's now archaic to many of you. We were friends on a site
7583920	7588240	called LiveJournal for four years and we were just LiveJournal pals because of the nature of
7588240	7592240	LiveJournal which is a very popular blogging site back in the day. Because the nature of
7592240	7596000	that site, we knew a lot of things about each other's lives but we just, we never met.
7596000	7599840	And then when we, we met at video games live of all things, it was kind of like,
7599840	7603920	oh, hey, we should like go out on a date sometime. All right, cool.
7603920	7610160	Yeah. Well, see, and that, that I think is ideal. You know, how many truly successful
7610160	7616000	relationships do you see coming out of people just getting together for the sake of romanticism?
7616560	7624000	If you're going to spend time with somebody who is going to become your, you know, your long-term
7624000	7632160	partner, it makes sense I think to have, what's the word I'm thinking of? To have a connection
7632160	7638560	to them on a personal level before you go any deeper. You know, you have to, you have to hit
7638560	7643440	the surface before you can, you know, go further. But you know what? There's also, there's also
7643520	7646880	something very important we have to bring up is different strokes for different folks. And
7646880	7653280	don't take that the wrong way, but some people hook up and spend the rest of their lives together
7653280	7659600	as a result. It happens. I mean, it just, I mean, so what dark soccer says that works for a lot of
7659600	7663680	people, but for some people, you know what? They, they do it. And then it's like, hey,
7663680	7669760	we should get married. It's just my point is don't go, this is, this is how I feel.
7669760	7674880	This is how I feel. And this is the advice that I would give based on how I feel. So don't take it
7674880	7684160	as me laying this down as absolute psychological doctrine, okay? But I think that going, that
7684160	7689280	meeting a person with the expectation, and this is a problem I actually have with a good friend
7689280	7695840	of mine who you know. Don't go into being friends with somebody with the expectation that you are
7695840	7701440	looking at your life partner. Don't go into meeting somebody with the expectation that
7701440	7705360	this is somebody that you're going to want to date, that that's your first thought. Value them
7705360	7713040	as a human being first. That was some good advice and gossip. Well, I'll tell you more about that
7713040	7718320	later. All right. Cause yeah, I, it made me really pissed off when I found out that that was going
7718320	7724240	on. I was, I'm still pissed off actually today. I really am. It really does anger me. Breathe in,
7724240	7728720	breathe out and get back to the emails if you could. Um, Rob, were you, were you trying out
7728720	7733360	Taiko no Tatsujin at Playland Japan? When you were trying out Taiko no Tatsujin at Playland Japan,
7733360	7738960	did you also try Bishibashi? I've played Bishibashi. No, I didn't cause we, we weren't
7738960	7742480	going to spend too much time there cause we were going to dinner before they closed. We got there
7742480	7746400	kind of late. If not, you need to go back. Maybe have someone show you. I nominate myself. Hit me
7746400	7750400	up as this can be arranged. All right. Well, let me know when you're in San Francisco next, buddy.
7750400	7753840	FlappyVog is hard and I think I need some game genie codes or something.
7754640	7761040	Please don't friendzone me at YYR. Talk to ActDeft. ActDeft is streaming the game on
7761040	7765680	Twitch and giving tips. And Bobby said, you have to hear Bobby's comments on it. He's like,
7765680	7770720	it's the most surreal thing I've experienced. And yeah, that's, that's awesome though. It's great.
7771520	7775520	Yeah. And for the record, I wasn't trying to go too much on the, the friendzone thing. It's
7775520	7782960	just that hits a bajillion bad, raw nerves for me. And it's being friends with somebody
7782960	7787840	should never be a bad thing. It should never be put in a negative light. I like being friends with
7787840	7793600	all of my friends and I like hating the people I really hate. I don't hate anybody really.
7793600	7797040	I'm friends with dark soccer and it's great. And I, and we're going to have a friend date.
7797040	7800400	Yes. We're going to, we're going to go on a date and there will not, no sex, no pressure.
7800720	7805520	No, because that now would be weird. That'd be beyond weird. That's like,
7806640	7812320	no, no, it's not in the dictionary. We're going to have a play date and play with Legos.
7812320	7815840	It would be like dividing by zero. Sex with you is dividing by zero.
7817760	7820240	I'm all creeped out now. You have to read the rest of the emails.
7822560	7826240	All right. Okay. I am the same person that got freaked out when I saw you playing spin the
7826240	7831680	bottle and kiss a girl. I was drinking. All right. Weren't you getting back to the emails
7831680	7836800	over there? It was, but, and you know, it's kind of funny because nevermind. Hey gang.
7836800	7840880	Oh, sorry. I have to say this. Black Wolf is in chat saying the guy who made bungee
7840880	7846880	ferret tossing said my game was hard. Has he not played his game? Oh, little, little shade there,
7846880	7853680	but I like it. Hey gang. I'm the type that loves a good story in a game. And if it has that I'm
7853680	7857760	hooked. I'm not the sappiest of guys, but I can tell you that after completing to the moon,
7857760	7861680	it was hard for me to tell my fiance about it without getting choked up. If you haven't played
7861680	7866560	it, do so. I know it's been out for a while yet. It was a game in my backlog that I've been
7867120	7873040	craving to complete. It's four hours long of 16 bit style graphics that has one of the most
7873040	7878080	amazing stories and soundtracks I've ever played through. This small little dev Freebird Games
7878080	7882640	keeps up the great work because this game was simply fantastic. Apparently they're doing a
7882640	7886480	kind of sequel called A Bird Story. Get your tissues and popcorn ready. That's from Travis.
7886480	7891040	And for the record, I am about halfway through to the moon, but I think I lost my save. So I'm
7891040	7895680	starting, I have to start over. And it really, I did, I did actually have to stop playing for
7895680	7900000	a little while and have a sob fit. I am like right where you are buddy, where it's like,
7900000	7903920	that game has been sitting in my backlog and I really need to play it. And I just haven't yet.
7904880	7909600	I will. That was a very good endorsement. It's such a good game. It really is such a good game.
7910560	7914800	Um, although I really put it more like in the realm of the visual novel, because there's not
7914800	7920720	really, you just walk around and explore. It's just the RPG part of it. Um, hi O.L.R. it's your
7920720	7929600	favorite email or raginator. That's what he said. It was a equal P. I mean a colon P. A raspberry.
7929600	7935280	Yeah. I just thought I'd send you a quick random question. If you were to stick, uh, Paul WS
7935280	7940800	Anderson, Uwe Boll and Jack Thompson into Gitmo for crimes against gaming and do some geek-centric
7940800	7946320	torture to them, what would that entail? Playing Yaris for 96 hours nonstop, play Superman 64.
7946320	7952400	Please give a reason for your answer. Thanks. Wait, what are my options again? Well, I think,
7952400	7956800	I think those are just suggestions. Oh, I thought that was a multiple choice question. Playing Yaris
7956800	7963600	for 96 hours nonstop, play Superman 64. What geek-centric answer version of torture? I would
7963600	7970400	make them listen to every episode of this program. So would I. I would make them listen to our drunk
7970400	7977040	show on repeat. While playing flappy vog. With, um, N.W.A. playing in the background, since it's
7977040	7983520	Thompson. Fair enough. Loki, do you have any idea for, for geek, uh, geek punishments? Geek
7983520	7988560	punishments? Yes, for these folks that have committed crimes against gay-manity.
7994320	8002720	I have no idea. And make them play, uh, dungeon. Was it, uh, what's that dungeon game that we
8002720	8007360	really hate now that EA just re-released again? Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know what you're talking
8007360	8011280	about. Dungeon Master or something like that? Yeah, yeah. Have them play that in real time.
8012000	8017120	I do agree with SSJ100Matt, however. How about just ignoring them and not talking about them
8017120	8022160	ever again? That is the ultimate torture. Lock them in a house with Ed. Make them dress as Tingle.
8022160	8026640	Lock in a house, lock them in a house with Ed. That's a good answer. Ed and his jackhammer.
8026640	8030000	All right, fair enough. They have to go live with Ed. There was one last bit to the email. Oh,
8030000	8034080	this is, is this the official last email? Yes, there was one last bit to the same email. Oh,
8034080	8038640	one last bit to the same email. This email was brought to you by Yummy Delicious Bacon. Bacon,
8038640	8045360	all the things. Farmers of America are standing behind you. So that was it. Rageinator got the
8045360	8050000	last email. There it is. Yep, last email. And he ended it with a thought on bacon.
8050640	8054560	Very appropriate. Very appropriate. You know what? I finally had bacon jerky, Rob. Yeah,
8054560	8060320	how was it? Oh my God, it was good. All right. Uh, well, anyhow, after a long, uh, I don't know
8060320	8065360	what it's been like 12 years running, we are going to close a mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
8065360	8070320	But you know, what is this show all about? What is the thing we ask you guys to do every week?
8070320	8074720	What do we like to think kind of makes our show unique amongst all the podcasts out there?
8074720	8080400	That keyword is participation. So the new email address to reach our show is
8080400	8085120	participate at orangelaungeradio.com. But not precipitate.
8085120	8087760	Yes. Not to be confused. Because we don't want you to rain.
8087760	8092320	So the new email address to reach us and you can email us so we can read the comments next week.
8092320	8097360	Email us at participate at orangelaungeradio.com. There you go.
8098480	8102480	All right. So, uh, let's get to the FUs of the week because, uh,
8102480	8110160	not only do we invite your participation, but we also invite our anger.
8122880	8129440	So, um, my FU goes to dermatitis, which, um, I normally get dermatitis on my hands.
8129440	8133920	Um, usually if I've been using car soap or things, you know, but I've gotten into something else I'm
8133920	8139680	allergic to because now I've broken out like basically from the nose down to, um, the bottom
8139680	8144080	of my neck. And I don't know what I had, but it had to have been something I've eaten because I
8144080	8148400	only break out like that when I've eaten something I'm not supposed to have. And I can't remember
8148400	8152720	what it is. Although I did actually eat a piece of cheese that had sneaky red bell pepper in it.
8152720	8160480	And that made me sick too. So I know it's not kosher, but it's delicious. Uh, low key.
8161040	8166640	Uh, if he was really tall and really low bars and flappy bugs, I can't get past them.
8167680	8171840	That's when they're right. Um, here's a, here's a tip. Right. Click will dive.
8172560	8176480	Yeah. Dive usually ends up being die. Yeah, that's true. It's it's tough,
8176480	8180720	but that's, that's the only way you can do it. All right. Um, let's see my, a few of the week,
8180720	8184720	I don't have a lot of anxious cause you know, I'm going to be moving into a place that's twice
8184720	8189440	as big and that makes me so flipping happy. You guys don't even know, but F you to moving.
8190400	8195760	What a pain in the ass that's going to be, but we'll get through it. So that's my, a few of the
8195760	8201840	week. Uh, Lisa, what was I going to say? Flaco Jones is closer now. Yeah, I know. Flaco. Flaco
8201840	8205280	Jones was supposed to be here a couple of weeks ago, but he got sick. So he wasn't able to be
8205280	8210800	here. And I think, uh, seg is going to be with us live and in person. I think he's here next week.
8210800	8215120	It might've been two weeks, but I know he's here before the move. He'll probably be our last guest
8215680	8219760	in this studio and then we're going to move, but I expect that Flaco will be meeting us in the new
8219760	8225680	place. Uh, pretty early on had a great suggestion. What's that virtual boy gaming session for geek
8225680	8230000	torture. Oh, he'll have to play the Oculus rift legend of Zelda and beat it. That could be the
8230000	8234480	torture. All right. Anyway. Um, let's get into a couple more news stories for you guys and we'll
8234480	8240080	get to, uh, phone calls, uh, orange lounge radio on Skype, all one word or one eight seven seven
8240080	8245600	game OLR. But first we do have a couple quick stories for you guys. So there is a possibility
8245600	8254160	that final fantasy 15 will be out on PC as well as next gen platforms, which makes kind of sense
8254160	8259280	because they're going to be probably building it on PC anyways. And those two systems are very
8260240	8265440	PC friendly. It's very easy to port to it. So as they're saying, you know, um, you know,
8265440	8270240	let's not forget when we developed the final fantasy 13 series, all three titles at early
8270240	8275280	development were working on PC and then we had to port it to consoles as far as technology is
8275280	8280160	concerned, it would have been possible for us to make a PC version, but we decided against it for
8280160	8284800	two reasons. We looked at the market situation and we didn't think it would be a good idea. Also,
8284800	8289760	also, um, it would have involved a lot of complex issues like security. So we decided
8289760	8294800	not to do it this time around, but you know, they see the potential and, you know,
8296160	8299920	there's countries where that would be very, um, very popular. Plus they just
8299920	8304400	released final fantasy seven and eight and they've been doing pretty well. So maybe
8305680	8310400	well, I am following fantasy 14, I believe is doing all right for him on PC. Although
8310400	8313840	certainly it's very well received on consoles as well. So, uh, yeah,
8314800	8319440	I think final fantasy 15 on PC would make sense. Um, I would see it as like a version that comes
8319440	8324560	out a year or two later, maybe with DLC bundled in or something, but I could see it as something
8324560	8330080	that's going to happen. Oh God, DLC and final fantasy 15. Like I'm saying it cause y'all know,
8330080	8337520	it's going to happen. They've been dipping their toe in with 13, two and lightning returns. So
8340000	8342400	by the way, our chatters say hi to your cat Loki.
8343040	8347280	She's being an asshole because she wants to go out in the garage and I'm not gonna let her.
8348720	8352960	Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. One more story I've got for you guys. And it's about
8352960	8358880	NES remix. You know, um, the first game was, was okay. It was kind of one of those things where
8358880	8362880	it was a great concept, but some of the games that were included with it were kind of suck,
8362880	8366640	but, uh, it looks like the games that are going to be in NES remix too, are going to be a whole
8366640	8373360	lot better. Um, let's see here if I can get to the notes there. Uh, some of the games are talking
8373360	8379360	about there that are going to be in NES remix too are Kirby, um, Metroid, Super Mario brothers,
8379360	8385840	two Zelda, two punch out and so on. So there's a lot. Um, what they're also talking about in
8385840	8392240	the game is that there's going to be, um, a mode that actually does three rapid fire levels in
8392240	8398320	different NES games using the scoring system from the 1990 Nintendo world championships.
8398320	8403600	Now, if I remember right, that cartridge had Tetris and rad racer in it, which I won't expect
8403600	8408240	to see in this because of the Tetris licensing and the fact that rad racer was a square game.
8408240	8413520	But, um, they're going to set up competitions like that from these other NES games. That's
8413520	8419200	going to be really cool. Um, also there's a mode called championship mode. I think this is that
8419200	8423600	same mode. I I'm assuming because it is modeled off the world championships, but the mode will
8423600	8431040	require the first NES remix game. So we are going to see modes that integrate the two versions.
8431040	8435040	That's going to be very interesting. Did you see the one though that it combined like different
8435040	8440640	games together? Like they had one that was like, um, I think it was like adventure of link and they
8440640	8447680	had, um, the booze chasing after him. Uh, they did kind of some things like this in NES remix one
8447680	8452720	though, like you would play as link in donkey Kong, which was very annoying because link can't
8452720	8458400	jump. Um, but it was kind of like, I think it was more of like, uh, they tried it a little bit and
8458400	8462880	now they're taking it a step further. So it sounds like any S remix two will be a whole lot better.
8462880	8467360	So, uh, we'll see. It's going to be very interesting. So, um, that is going to be out soon
8467360	8473920	of note in Japan. They're actually going to get this as one bundle. Uh, Famicom remix one plus
8473920	8479920	two is going to come out as a game on store shelves on April 24th is when that's going to
8479920	8486640	come out. So, uh, that's pretty cool. Famicom remix one plus two in Japan on store shelves,
8486640	8497760	uh, April 24th for it looks like a 28 58 yen. Neat. All right. Uh, let's get to the calls.
8497760	8501760	That's it. We're going to open up the Skype line over. Oh shit. No, we're not because I don't even
8501760	8506560	have the Loki. You need to buy me time with the last minute story. I forgot to turn on the
8506560	8512640	Skype line. I'm so embarrassed. So there's a new mod that they're working on for Arma three. That's
8512640	8520000	um, basically adding dinosaurs in there. So they have some, uh, Arma three test animation for a
8520000	8526480	T-Rex running around and I guess it was to be like Jurassic park or something. Um, but Hey dinosaur,
8526480	8531920	I would love to see like a, a daisy type thing, but with dinosaurs instead of zombies,
8531920	8539440	that'd be a pretty creepy. Um, let's see what else here.
8542480	8548480	I have no idea. You know what, speaking of that, uh, retro, um, the Nintendo remix thing,
8548480	8554640	I can totally see them doing that and releasing that over here as well to pad the first party
8554640	8558880	content that they're releasing. So they can use that as an excuse to eat their stuff coming out
8558880	8566080	on, you know, with a Wii U. It's not just nothing. Um, Skype lines open. Sorry guys. I totally
8566080	8570320	screwed that up. Uh, but yes, Skype lines should be open. Am I actually signed in? Oh no, it says
8570320	8574560	we're offline. Let me fix that. I don't like using the iPad for this sometimes. All right,
8574560	8579600	now we're good to go. One eight seven seven game of LR or username on Skype, orange lounge radio.
8580160	8583840	Thank you chat room for razzing me over that. I'm not used to the iPad thing.
8584720	8591280	Loki, I miss you. Max's studio. No, it's fine. All right. Uh, was there any other
8591280	8597120	last minute stories that you had? Uh, that's it. Let me go to some Twitter topics while we wait
8597120	8602320	for some calls over at orange lounge radio on Skype. I know there were just a couple
8602320	8612000	Twitter topics for me to get to. Um, twitter.com slash O L R is the place where you can follow us.
8612960	8620240	And let's see. Um, sir, sort, I always mispronounce this name and I'm so sorry buddy,
8620240	8627440	but it's Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Sends us a tweet
8627440	8632960	that says, is Loki O L R ever going to get a decent microphone headset? Well, I think we talked
8632960	8636800	about that a little bit earlier in the show. You sound a lot better tonight. There's, there's not
8636800	8640320	like the fidgetiness that we had last week. I don't hear that tonight. So that's good.
8640320	8646480	So we will get Loki back in studio soon, but you guys, he just had a baby. You guys, you guys.
8646480	8655440	It's a Sony, uh, was it a PlayStation 3 stereo headset? Oh, is it? I didn't know that. Yeah.
8656240	8661760	That's great. All right. Um, we have another tweet here from SSG100 Matt who, uh, sends us,
8661760	8668000	I've seen a lot about this, uh, the past couple of days. Netflix agrees to pay Comcast for direct,
8668000	8673040	in other words, non throttled connection. This doesn't set a good precedence. Yeah.
8673040	8677120	Apparently Netflix and Comcast reached an agreement where Netflix is going to get,
8677760	8681360	you know, their bandwidth won't be, you know, a lot of people were worried that, uh, with the
8681360	8686240	whole net neutrality falling through that Comcast would start blocking Netflix. But I think something
8686240	8691200	even worse has happened where now Netflix is paying up to get the preferential treatment.
8691200	8697840	This sucks. I, I, I, this is not good news. I'm sorry. I mean, I like my Netflix too. And,
8697840	8701600	you know, they shouldn't have to be paying for it. There should not be an agreement reached.
8702160	8707360	Where's net neutrality? Well, something actually came out from, um, you know, cause the whole, uh,
8708560	8712720	uh, I actually have the email somewhere in here, but they, uh, the white house actually did release
8712720	8720480	a response. Um, to invest, uh, about investigating. I just have to, uh, stop a moment and actually
8720480	8724720	look through it cause I didn't read the email all the way through. Well, but that's that good.
8724720	8730480	They do need to get involved and maybe, maybe com I think there's, I think Comcast is agreeing to do
8730480	8735840	this because somebody is going to bring up antitrust on Comcast because Comcast is trying
8735840	8741360	to buy time Warner and somebody was going to use Netflix as leverage that will Comcast prefers
8741360	8745680	their own movie services. So this is why they cock block Netflix. Well, now that they have
8745680	8748960	this agreement in place, no, they're not going to be able to say that when the antitrust lawsuit
8748960	8755200	comes down. Yeah. So I just, this makes me very nervous. I don't like this whatsoever. Um,
8755200	8759680	SSJ100 Matt says, who's to say that your favorite site or app won't attempt to cut back features
8759680	8765680	to avoid bandwidth overages and being throttled. You guys, they might come for your flappy vog and
8765680	8769600	then what are you going to do? What are you going to do when they come for flappy vog people?
8770560	8774320	What are you going to do? This is why we need net neutrality. I would still think that they would
8774320	8779440	see that as preferential since they have to pay to get past that, you know, blockage.
8779440	8783040	So I don't think it's really changed anything. If they all of a sudden said, Hey, yeah, we're not
8783040	8788080	going to, you know, throttle you guys then yeah, that could be a little bit more, you know, ammo
8788080	8792960	for the whole defense that, Oh, we're preferring one service over another and the antitrust and
8792960	8798000	stuff like that. SSJ100 Matt says Twitch is in trouble. Oh, you know, it Twitch is in big
8798000	8805120	trouble. I just, Oh, I hate, I hate it. It's so irritating to tell me, tell me where I've got to
8805120	8810320	go pick it at and I'm there. All right. Uh, Obiwan jabroni sends us a tweet twitter.com slash OLR
8810320	8815920	saying a Georgia teen holding a Nintendo Wii controller was shot by police. Good Lord. Did
8815920	8820560	you guys hear about this? Where I guess the teen was, let me see if I can get to the actual story,
8820560	8825440	but the teen was holding like a Nintendo Wii controller and it was, uh, you know,
8825440	8829920	in a threatening manner, I suppose. And he was shot by police because they thought it was a gun,
8829920	8835680	I guess. Was that the zapper? I don't believe it was the zapper and I'm sure it wasn't the zapper
8835680	8841280	cause no one owns that. According to his attorney, he did nothing more than answer the door while
8841280	8846560	holding a controller of a Nintendo Wii. The kid lived? Uh, that's coming from the guy's attorney.
8846560	8854080	Let's see. Um, I'm trying to know, uh, officer Faily shot the teen. I, I'm sorry. That's hitting
8854080	8862400	way too many plan to join the Marines after he finished school. No, no witnesses. Sorry. No
8862400	8866560	witnesses reported seeing the boy holding any weapons. Authorities won't say whether a weapon
8866560	8874240	was found on the scene. So that's just, I mean, again, this really doesn't have anything to do
8874240	8879360	with games though. I mean, yeah, it was a wiimote, but that is kind of inconsequential. It just has
8879360	8888240	to do more with, uh, abuse of power and basically living in a military state these days. Again,
8888240	8894000	uh, Orange Launch Radio on Skype, all one word or 1-877-GAME-OLR. I thought I saw a call come
8894000	8898960	through, but I was in the middle of my rant and I missed it. Sorry. Uh, act-dev tweets us and says,
8898960	8904640	uh, a dev promises steam keys if his game got greenlit, but he doesn't deliver on promise and
8904640	8910160	links us to a NeoGaf thread. So there's your disclaimer right there, but, uh, I don't see why
8910160	8916080	this would be, uh, illegitimate. Uh, what was the game for greenlit? Uh, the game was called Zombies,
8916080	8925440	which was getting a name change to corporate lifestyle simulator. Sorry. That is pretty funny.
8925440	8931520	Um, he made a greenlight promise apparently is that, um, you promise steam keys for all those
8931600	8935680	who have previously purchased the game. It's a great way to boost votes and ultimately get
8935680	8942000	your game on steam. Um, and apparently the game was greenlit and now the dev is backtracking.
8942000	8948560	There was a tweet that said, um, no site has ever agreed to provide me that list and I'm unwilling
8948560	8954000	to randomly give them thousands of keys because of new content and changes from the original game.
8954000	8958880	Steam keys will not be given out for anyone who bought zombies. And then there was an update,
8959520	8967840	more tweets. Um, wow. It sounds like he had a Twitter meltdown. We all love these. Uh,
8967840	8971520	there are a lot of scumbags out there and basically they win zombies will be released
8971520	8975840	on steam. You'll get your keys. That pretty much does it for my career in making games.
8975840	8980640	I promise keys to no one. The bundles did my contract state. Absolutely nothing about keys.
8980640	8984000	I wouldn't assign them if they did. Of course, this is a business and I want sales,
8984000	8988240	but understand that I'm now giving away free copies of the game, having never agreed to do so.
8989200	8995760	So anyways, now my iPad locked and I can see people are trying to call and I can't get to them.
8995760	9003120	Yeah. Technology. There we go. Finally, finally I can hit the button and take a call. Hi, you're
9003120	9009360	on orange launch radio. Who's this? It's Ron. And seriously, nobody's called in. I know. Well,
9009360	9014160	I missed one other call, but, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's a little slower tonight. Who knows?
9015120	9018400	Who knows? Uh, by the way, just some quick comments from the chat. Um, uh,
9018400	9022720	Wade in the chat says that's the best name, corporate lifestyle simulator. I agree.
9022720	9027120	You know, for no other purpose, I got to give the developer props for that. Um,
9027120	9032400	nemesis 47 talking about the police and the Wiimote nemesis 47 says, I do normally support
9032400	9037120	the police. I do normally support the police. This case, the cop was in the wrong and if proven,
9037120	9040960	he'll serve his life in prison. Awesome unicorn says, I believe the cop was a female.
9040960	9045440	She was serving some sort of warrant against the father and immediately realized her mistake and
9045440	9049840	broke down. Not that that really changes what happened. So it's just still a,
9052240	9057360	I think a horrible precedent that the first instinct is no matter. I mean,
9057360	9061200	the gender is inconsequential. It doesn't matter. Like none of that matters. The fact that matters
9061200	9066960	is an innocent kid got shot and what allowed that to happen anyway? Sorry. Don't mean to take up
9066960	9071840	your time Rama, but appreciate the call. You're like wearing a robe or something. You're well,
9071840	9077280	it is later over there on the East coast. Well, yeah, cause I do have to get up at six
9077280	9082080	30 in the morning for work. So it could be a smoking jacket. Okay. Is that your smoking jacket?
9083920	9091840	Depends on what smoking is, you know, you stay up till four 20. All right. I always do.
9091840	9099120	Um, what else was going to ask you? Oh, the year of Luigi ending on March 18th. Are you,
9099120	9103520	are you, are you okay? Do you, do you. I'm fine with it. Here,
9103520	9108640	Luigi is going to go out with a blast for me because that's one of the reasons why I called in.
9110400	9114480	Please tell us, uh, please explain what, what, uh, what's the reason for your call tonight?
9115280	9120240	Well, ever since the whole black Luigi thing went up and running, I decided to work it for
9120240	9127600	what it's worth. So at cats con, I decided to debut a brand new cosplay. I can't think I have
9127600	9135520	any pictures of it, but I will put it together for photos. I decided to do Dr. Luigi. It's very
9135520	9139760	topical too, because Dr. Luigi of course was released on Wii U not that long ago. So I mean,
9139760	9145120	it makes sense. Yes. I thought I saw a picture of you as that somewhere. It was, it was awesome.
9146000	9151600	Might be, but this is what I did. I did these a little bit differently. What I did was I walked
9151600	9159040	around with my clipboard and a big box full of chocolates and gummy bears and this and that.
9159040	9165440	So every time I ran to any female cosplayers or whatever, I handed them chocolates and candies.
9165440	9169600	I said, here is a chocolate prescription Valentine from the good doctor.
9169600	9174480	Look at you trying to get some phone numbers. Look at you.
9176000	9177840	He could have been just being a gentleman.
9178800	9181920	Okay. Rob, have you been spying on my phone lately?
9186800	9187760	Bitch, I already know.
9193760	9198480	Also that night, you know, the big thing now with conventions is they're having
9198560	9202160	formals on Friday night. So I'm like, you know what? I'll throw something together.
9202160	9208240	I did a classic vintage Luigi. Yeah. We're talking the overalls and everything.
9209120	9213040	No more 20 seconds. Hold on for one second. Actually, let me see if I can grab it real quick.
9213040	9218480	Oh God. I love that I can get the visual here. Thanks to Skype. Apologies to the, uh, uh, you
9218480	9222480	know, everybody else basically, cause it is a radio show, but I'll try to describe it for you guys.
9222480	9227360	So, Oh, like a little, that's like a little pimp hat with the little Luigi mark.
9229440	9234400	Stripes suit and everything. And on the lapel of my, of my jacket,
9234400	9237200	instead of a normal flower had a nice little orange fire flower.
9237200	9240160	Wait, hold that hat up again. Nice.
9241040	9243920	Yeah. Dark soccer. I wanted to see it and I wanted to snap a picture of it. Thank you.
9243920	9249360	Say that over YouTube. I actually later actually send you to an actual picture of me in a full
9249360	9256560	outfit. Cause it was that I had a nice white, um, scarf with my name Luigi monogrammed on the side,
9256560	9260320	you know, and I'm pulling, I'm standing there and was like, you look like a gangster of like,
9260320	9263680	well, that's the thing that's kind of going for it is gangster.
9264320	9268800	I love, I love the idea of a dapper Luigi. That's very, uh, it's very awesome.
9269840	9272960	And here, here's the best part that I'm going to get out of here. I'm on the line for the
9272960	9276960	masquerade. No, for the formal. And there's two guys just as Mario and Luigi. And I walk
9276960	9281920	over to them. I'm like, this is nice to meet you. I'm from the Northeast part of the mushroom
9281920	9290560	kingdom. Don peach sends me down here to collect payment because the coins have been a little light
9290560	9294080	lately. And they're like, we're good. It's no problem. We'll take care of it. I'm like,
9294080	9300480	well, good because you don't want the Don to come down here with her giant hammer.
9303920	9309200	I love it. They said it was the best thing the whole week that they came across. I'm like,
9309200	9313360	I try. That's awesome. Well, I hope you find a dapper peach to go to the next con with.
9313360	9319120	So working on it, working on it. Sounds good. All right, buddy. Thanks so much for the call.
9319120	9324240	And, uh, you can always look forward to, uh, Ramas cosplay and, uh, anime con wrap-ups over at
9324240	9330480	anime jam session Tuesday nights here on vog one year running. Yeah. We actually talked about that.
9331440	9336240	I know. I know. I know. All right. All right. Take care, buddy. All right. You too, bro. All right.
9336240	9340080	Bye. All right. Thanks so much to our Rama for the call. Appreciate that. One eight seven seven
9340080	9344400	game OLR username on Skype is orange lounge radio. We can probably squeeze in about one more call
9344400	9348560	here. Um, actually for some weird reason tonight, we do have like a ton of tweets though. Like we
9348560	9352480	usually don't get this many tweets, but I'm okay with that. Oh, well, the Skype lines burning up
9352480	9357120	again. So we're going to go over to it and take some more calls in the Skype line. Hello. You're
9357120	9362720	on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, this is act deaf. Hey, how you doing buddy? Really good.
9362720	9369280	Really good. Enjoying my top scores on flappy vog. You're really great on that. You are dominating
9369280	9376000	in flappy vog. They should just call the game flappy deft because act flappy act act. Oh my
9376000	9384640	God. I think that's your new name act flappy. No, I did at least for a night. All right. Act flappy.
9384640	9391200	What's the trick to high scores in flappy vog. Well, I actually did a stream of it yesterday.
9391760	9397200	Bobby talked about it on his show. Yeah. And yeah, I was talking about, uh, a strategy
9397840	9404080	I use for flappy vog and pretty much almost every flappy bird clone out there, uh, it's have a
9404080	9410160	rhythm. Yeah. That's basically it. So yeah, you have, you have to have, uh, how to get a rhythm
9410160	9417040	going. So it's basically a steady click. And I was talking, uh, saying yesterday in the stream, uh,
9417680	9421760	about that because some of the walls, uh, really changed the pattern and,
9422480	9427200	and it gets really difficult, especially with the, with the speed increasing. Yep. So yeah,
9427200	9432800	it gets really hard, uh, on the later, later scores or later, uh, later walls. Yeah. Do you,
9432800	9436400	do you know when I first played the game, I told Bobby, this is too easy. And then he told me,
9436400	9440960	did you notice the speed increases? And I was like, Oh, that's why I keep ending at a certain
9440960	9445760	point. I was like, the scores I'm getting are too high every time. And he's like, yeah, it ends. Oh,
9445840	9449120	okay. And then I noticed it and I was like, okay, yeah, this is going to screw people up when they
9449120	9456240	get too far. So yeah, the first, uh, probably 40 levels or three walls, you don't notice that the,
9456240	9462320	the speed increasing after that you'll notice it. And by 60, it, it increases really,
9462960	9468400	really rapidly by 80 and even 100. It gets crazy. I can't even believe you broke a hundred. That's
9468400	9472080	crazy. Well, here's the question I've got to ask you about flappy vog is, is who's your favorite
9472080	9481440	character? Oh God, I love them all. Uh, they're all great. And I really cannot choose. Of course.
9483520	9490400	Character pack, uh, that was released today. Uh, I do, I love the grandpa's.
9492320	9500000	Yeah. And you said it on Bobby then it's because the, uh, how he says it, like he wants to,
9500000	9508000	to do something like really, uh, at least, uh, be more enthusiastic, but he has like a release.
9508000	9514960	Uh, I don't want to disturb another people, another person that, yeah, it's, it's hilarious.
9514960	9522720	It's hilarious. I like vodka. Yeah. Any I'm going, I'm going to get the nastiest text message from
9522720	9526960	grandpa tomorrow. I already know, but, but Hey, you know what people, people are loving it. People
9526960	9531280	are loving it. By the way, Alan, Alan alchemy is in chat saying such a diplomatic answer for
9531280	9536960	Mac Deft. What a cop out. No, I S that's, we love, we love diplomatic cop out answers. You did,
9536960	9545040	you did call out grandpa. So that's, I'll say that. So, uh, that, well, and in other,
9545040	9552240	in other stuff, uh, well, uh, have you seen the, the newest humble bundle? I have. I'm pretty sure
9552240	9556480	you have talked about it. Yeah. We, we brought it up a little earlier in the show in rapid fire news,
9556560	9563280	but it's, it's great. Obviously, you know, Guacamelee right there is the, the, the whole
9563280	9567280	reason to get the pat in my opinion. But I mean, there's lots of other great games there too, but
9567280	9571920	the fact that they're also cheap, I mean, and for a good cause you can have it all go to charity.
9571920	9579120	It's great. Heck I, I own four, uh, four of the six games on there and I still bought it because
9579120	9585520	it's a really great value and the games are, are really good. Dust. I love dust. Everybody
9585520	9590320	should play that. Get the bundle and play that first. Then play Guacamelee, then play the rest.
9590320	9596000	The rest of the games are really awesome. Also Antichamber. It's a really weird game. Uh, if you
9596000	9603680	like portal and NASA trips, that's the game for you. All right. Very cool. Well, um, anything else
9603680	9608960	on your mind tonight, buddy? Well, that's all. Uh, I, I maybe do another stream. I'm happy
9609920	9616560	about, uh, night. So, uh, possibly that. All right. Well hopefully Comcast won't shut Twitch
9616560	9622000	down tonight. Uh, but check that out. Act F stream of flappy vog. Love it. That's great.
9622000	9626160	And a Black Wolf saying in chat next week's character pack will be the last. So, you know,
9626160	9630160	as much as this has been dominating the talk of the show the past couple of weeks,
9630160	9635920	we know when a joke needs to die. We know when Ed needs to go home and get, be put out to pasture.
9635920	9641920	So, and even, and even then the game will still be, uh, still be there and still be fun. So
9641920	9645840	exactly. That's a great way to look at it. Act F. Thank you very much. All right, buddy. I'm
9645840	9648960	going to let you go so we can try to sneak in one more call to have a good one. Okay, buddy.
9649520	9654240	Hey, thanks for having me. All right. Thanks. Bye. All right. That was Act F to everybody. And,
9654240	9658960	uh, we're going to go to the phones one more time. Uh, take one more call. I see a couple
9658960	9663760	calls trying to get through. So, uh, try again now that Act F is off the line. 1-877-GAMO-LR
9663760	9670640	or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Uh, I had one, I had one more tweet here. Oh,
9671200	9673520	I guess I'm never going to get to this tweet because we're getting one more call,
9673520	9678000	but that's okay. I don't mind taking more calls here. We'll get to the tweets a little later.
9678000	9682480	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, this is For the Fallen Dreams from North
9682480	9686800	Carolina. Hey, For the Fallen Dreams. I recognize your name from, uh, chat and emails and all that.
9686800	9692080	What's up, buddy? Not much, man. Yeah, I'm not in chat much just because, you know, the east coast
9692160	9696800	and it's getting close to midnight now, but, uh, I had some extra time, so I thought I'd call in
9696800	9703200	and just say, you know, what's up. Also kind of wanted to get some, uh, input, uh, from y'all on
9703200	9709520	a particular subject. Like, I'm kind of getting back into building up a PC and getting into the
9709520	9714960	PC gaming scene because it's kind of been on and off for me. You know, sometimes I'm a console
9714960	9720000	gamer for a couple years and I'm PC. My question kind of is for y'all, you know, what's the deciding
9720000	9724560	factor, um, if you're going to get a game, you know, what are some deciding factors if you're
9724560	9729920	going to get a game on console or if you're going to go for it on PC? Because I know a lot of times
9729920	9736960	it's, it's compatibility. It's, you know, do I want to play it with friends? Um, you know, just
9736960	9742000	what plays better on PC version or console? I'm just kind of curious as to what your input is on
9742000	9746160	that. That's a great question. What goes into the decision if you're going to get a game? And I'm
9746160	9751120	going to pose this to our chat room as well. I'm going to, uh, pose this chat. Um, what goes into
9751120	9757680	a decision for you to buy something on a computer or PC versus, versus buying it on console if you
9757680	9762960	have both and things are available for both? Um, I think certainly you hit on a big one about where
9762960	9768560	your friends are playing. Um, I was playing Mass Effect 3 on Xbox and I bought the PC version just
9768560	9772560	so I could play multiplayer with friends. Granted, I waited for a sale, but that was a big thing with
9772560	9779600	it. Dark Sakura? Um, for me, it's, is it on PC? Yeah. Okay. I'm getting that one. So you always
9779600	9784640	default to PC. Why? Because of my hand. I have a hard time with controller. I mean, I use an
9784640	9790240	Xbox controller to play Skullgirls, but if I have an option to play with keyboard and mouse, um,
9790240	9794960	it hurts my hand less because I have a thumb track ball. Right. So that's easier for me. Well, I was
9794960	9799760	going to say that control is a big thing too. Controller versus keyboard and mouse, um, has
9799760	9803120	always, you know, historically gone into the decision, which, you know, do you prefer for
9803120	9807440	first person shooters and some, some of those types of games, uh, and a game like Diablo 3,
9807440	9811360	which I talked about earlier, plays very differently depending on which you, you know,
9811360	9815680	way you want to do it. So you have to kind of weigh that decision. Um, although the worlds
9815680	9820320	are coming closer together, Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation 4 allows you to use keyboard and mouse.
9820320	9824800	It's like playing the PC version. There's also the customization thing like for games that are
9824800	9830960	eventually moddable and hackable, like all of the bajillion mods I have for Skyrim or, um, all of
9830960	9837520	the mods I've personally done for Mass Effect 3. So you haven't modded Skyrim enough unless you
9837520	9843440	have the engines from Thomas the Tank in there. No, I'm not going to do that because I would
9843440	9848080	actually like to play the game. I like the, uh, one where it turns the big dragons into Macho Man.
9848080	9854000	Oh yeah. That's my favorite. Every time I think that's a big seller. Um, just the fact that so
9854000	9858720	many different types of mods come out on PC as opposed to console. I mean, they both have their
9858720	9864720	pros and cons, but for me, that is a big selling point is, is, you know, what mods are available
9864720	9871200	for it. You know, like with, uh, ARMA, you had a mod called DayZ, which got so much attention that
9871200	9876960	it's now in its standalone alpha stages. Um, that's a great point is do you want to mod it,
9876960	9881040	but on the, on the flip side, just to stick up for consoles a little bit with consoles,
9881040	9885680	you know, sometimes the fact that you can't mod it actually ends up being a good thing. And I'm
9885680	9890080	speaking more about more the bench line that, you know, you know, when a game's going to play
9890080	9893440	on console, it's going to be smooth and you're not going to run into any of those issues. Like,
9893440	9897840	didn't you say Dark Soccer, when you're trying to do Strider on like Dan's one PC, it wouldn't work.
9898480	9904720	Which he was dumb and had it hooked up to his, uh, three monitor rig, which he already had the
9904720	9909120	resolution set for three monitors. So it's his own fault for not hooking it up to a single monitor.
9909760	9915680	Right. I think they all also, another pro that consoles have is just that seamless interface
9915680	9919440	you have, you know, when you get that game, you've got that disc, you pop it in the console,
9919440	9926720	it's going to run. Most of the frame rate issues are taken care of with, right, right. But you
9926720	9932400	know, on PC, there is a bit of, of Twinkie tweak, excuse me, tweaking and tinkering that goes along
9932400	9937680	with it, which granted a lot of people see as a pro in itself, just because I mean, that's just,
9937680	9942800	that's just the thing to do on PCs. Just, just tailor it to your needs, how you want the game
9942800	9948160	to play, how you want the game to look. And it is honestly addicting in and of itself. So, um,
9948160	9952160	going to the chat room for some of their answers, uh, Shane Alinko says trophies.
9952160	9956720	You don't necessarily have the whole achievement systems on PC, although steam kind of has that,
9956720	9961680	but I don't know, it's a little different between trophies and steam, uh, act deft and chat says
9961680	9967280	console equals local multiplayer. Yeah. You'd never see a game like Mario 3d world done on PC.
9967920	9973040	That's an experience that really can only be done on console. So that's, that's a true one. Um,
9973040	9977520	let's see. Dungeon buster says if my PC would have run Skyrim, I would have gone that route.
9977520	9985840	Instead I went console just to be able to play it. However, um, some, I actually did find that
9985840	9990560	the interface for Skyrim being able to mod your interface, especially your menus,
9990560	9995840	makes it far easier to play. Yeah. And Skyrim itself though, wasn't really, uh,
9998000	10003440	for, you know, for a lot of, um, PC games, they'll have them be, uh, friendlier towards one card or
10003440	10008080	another, have them be optimized and Skyrim was released as I recall without any optimization
10008080	10014320	for PC. Right. And that's just the thing, the ability to, you know, tailor a PC game to your
10014320	10019200	needs, your play style, you know, like I was saying, how, how it looks is, is definitely one
10019200	10024320	of the, one of the bigger pros of being PC grand. You have the cons, like, uh, sometimes you don't
10024320	10029600	have it on graphics card, you got to upgrade, you've got to tweak. But, uh, yeah, to me,
10029600	10034480	it's just like, I'm, I'm neither here nor there. Like as of recently, I'm, I'm in the stages of
10034480	10041200	building a PC. And that's just cause as of right now, never next gen consoles are actually current
10041200	10046800	gen consoles rather, um, are really piquing my interest. You know, I, I take a look at it and
10046800	10051680	I'm like, wow, you know, I could build a system with better specs than that. And, and, you know,
10051760	10056000	also just on a side note, like certain games are just cheaper to, you know,
10056000	10060480	go on the steam marketplace, download it, have it instantly as opposed to going out and buying
10060480	10065120	it on this. There's definitely a lot to consider. And I think this is a great debate. That's going
10065120	10069600	to go on for a very long time. It won't be solved this generation, uh, for the fallen dreams. I got
10069600	10072560	to let you go so I can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for calling into the show. Don't be a
10072560	10076240	stranger. No worries. Thanks for staying up late. All right. Take care. All right. Take care, buddy.
10076240	10080400	Bye. I'm always impressed with you East coasters that, uh, listen to the live show. Cause I know
10080400	10085200	you guys have to stay up really late. Um, so thank you guys for doing that. Uh, anyhow,
10085200	10088640	we are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line. I'm sorry. It's so funny. Like nobody called
10088640	10092000	in at first. And then after the first call, it's like the dam broke and everybody was trying to
10092000	10095520	call in. So I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, please consider emailing us,
10095520	10100480	participate at orange laundry.com is our new mailbag where you can, um, send an email with
10100480	10104160	your thoughts. I did have one more tweet. I had been trying to get to this whole time
10105200	10107920	for the record, by the way, we did pick up something for my computer today.
10108800	10115440	We picked up, um, a new sound card. Oh, uh, sound blaster auto GFX. Nice. So that I can actually
10115440	10120960	start recording the, you know, what you hear stuff. Oh, okay. So somebody might be working
10120960	10127440	on a new podcast soon. Somebody might, I might be, I might, I need to get my old mic. All right. Uh,
10127440	10131600	tiger claw sends us the last tweet I'm going to do tonight where Sony pictures and the producer of
10131600	10138640	the social network are planning a feature film about Sega versus Nintendo. And apparently there's
10138640	10143200	a book out there called console Wars by Blake J. Harris that talks about Sega, Nintendo, and the
10143200	10146800	back. I didn't even know this was a book. Now I kind of want to read it just cause I don't know.
10146800	10149760	I like, I like reading these kinds of things, even though, you know, we all live through it,
10149760	10156160	but yeah, Sony pictures, apparently, uh, doing this as a movie, calling it a behind the scenes
10156160	10162720	business thriller. This could be interesting. Uh, Chronicles how Sega, a small scrappy gaming
10162720	10168080	company led by an unlikely visionary and a team of team of rebels took on the juggernaut Nintendo
10168080	10173600	and revolutionize the video game industry. Scrappy, scrappy, happy, scrappy. Yeah, but,
10175200	10180160	um, wasn't it, there was that manga and the anime that came out from it. That's,
10180160	10186000	you know, loosely based on the Nintendo Sega wars, uh, second intuition day.
10186880	10191440	It's actually pretty funny. All right. Well, um, that's going to do it for the skyline and
10191440	10194960	that's going to do it for the Twitter. Thank you guys so much for participating with us this week.
10194960	10198560	Uh, we are about ready to wrap things up though for the night. Uh, unless Loki,
10198560	10201440	I don't know if you had any other last minute stories, Loki, while we were doing those calls,
10201440	10206000	but, uh, no, no last minute stories other than the baby pooping on stuff.
10206000	10211360	Oh, congratulations. They poop on everything. They poop on people. At least, you know,
10211360	10214560	everything's working. It's like a bird. Yeah. At least you know, everything's working in there.
10214560	10218640	That's the sign. All right. Anyhow, it is time for us to wrap up the show because it is after
10218640	10222480	midnight for you folks on the East coast is time for us to say good night. I really want to thank
10222480	10225840	you guys though, for tuning into the show and supporting the show. You know what we say every

10237360	10241120	we might not be the biggest podcast on the block and that's fine, but you guys being here are
10241120	10245520	really the motivation. So help us grow our family by telling a friend or two about the show and,

10255200	10261520	reviews on iTunes and Stitcher radio. Those go a long, long way in helping, uh, get our exposure
10261520	10265520	amped up a little bit on both those sites. So please, please take five minutes to write a nice
10265520	10271120	little review on either iTunes or Stitcher. It is so, so, uh, appreciated and love. Thank you very
10271120	10276240	much. All right. Um, before we pull the plug on everything, let's go around and get everybody's
10276240	10280000	final thought for tonight. Dark soccer. I'm going to start with you ladies first, your final thought
10280000	10287360	for tonight. Itchy, scratchy, tasty, itchy, just itchy. It needs to stop. Don't you remember from
10287360	10297440	long time ago? Itchy, ugly face. So shot him. Itchy, tasty. Uh, my final thought for the week
10297440	10302720	or for, for tonight's show is I, I really need to stop fucking around and play more bravely default.
10302720	10307120	It has been sitting on its butt for a week and I really need to, uh, not have that happen anymore.
10307120	10313280	I'm saying Merger Gerger at myself, dark soccer tried to swipe the copy jokes on you. The game's
10313280	10318320	not in there. I think you'd get Pokemon X cause I'm, I'm that guy that puts the cartridges in the
10318320	10325440	wrong game cases. What is it? Pokemon Y. I don't even know what Pokemon I have. How sad is that?
10325440	10330880	I have X, so it doesn't matter. All right. Uh, last but not least, Loki, your final thought
10330880	10341280	tonight. My final thought is my cat's being loud. Your cat's being what? Being loud. Give kitty
10341280	10346960	pettings from all of us here at OLR. That makes me want to go cuddle with Sanrio.
10349200	10352800	All right, everybody. That's it. Have a wonderful night and, uh, thanks for listening to Orange
