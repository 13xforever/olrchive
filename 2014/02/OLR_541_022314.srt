00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,400
This week we bid farewell to the Attack of the Clones as Google and Apple decide that

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,920
their stores have too many flapping things. Rumors on the future of gaming are increasing

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,640
and we may be hearing much more at GDC next month. Pour another one out for Flappy and

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,200
join us for all this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:38,040
Oh my god, don't pour the liquor out. That's alcohol abuse. Don't do that. Hi everybody.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,120
Out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,320
has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live tonight with episode number 541 for

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,240
this February the 23rd of 2014. And let me just start off by saying, happy birthday,

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,960
mom. Her birthday is February 23rd. I know she's not listening because Rob, your show

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,200
is weird, Rob. People on the internet tune in to hear you talk about games, Rob. But

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,360
anyway, yes it is my mother's 73rd birthday today. So happy, happy birthday. Anyhow, yes,

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,680
my name is Rob Robertson joining me as always in the studio. Happy un-birthday, DarkSakura

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,300
or Jamie Summers. Yeah, but I brought you presents. You did. We are having an un-birthday

14
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:26,780
celebration today. You're worth $7. That's right. Oh no, more like $10. DarkSakura sent

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,820
me a text a little bit before the show and she says, do you want anything from the dollar

16
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,380
store? And I was like, what, what does a person need from the dollar store? Well, it wasn't

17
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,100
at the dollar store, it was at the Dollar General, which is a little different. The

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,100
Dollar General basically, it sells just stuff cheaper, but it's not like a dollar store.

19
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,140
Oh, I just thought it was the, yeah, they're all the same. They have their own off-brand

20
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,140
stuff, but the Dollar General is special to me because I'm from Alabama and I didn't

21
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,700
see one like at all in this state until like a year ago. And I was like, I'm buying everything

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,780
there. Is it like that in the rest of the US? Because it really feels like here in California,

23
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,340
like those dollar stores and those 99 cent stores, like they're a dime a dozen. They're

24
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,500
like every strip mall has one. It seems like there's 99 cent stores, but the Dollar General

25
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,700
has been like, we used to go there when I was a little kid and it was just like the,

26
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,900
the cheap goods, you know, they had their own knockoff brands. They were basically Walmart

27
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,820
before Walmart was big. I remember when those stores, you know, since it is a video gaming

28
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,300
show, I will say, I remember when those stores used to sell like dirt, cheap, crapple of

29
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,500
video games. Like I'm not even talking about like overstock. I'm talking about like, like

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,460
real crapple of crappy Blu-rays. Every so often they'll have something good. But I mean,

31
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,860
it's mostly like shit and Bible books. Um, and the, the stuff that made, made on T or

32
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,540
as seen on TV, lifetime movies. No, no, no. I mean the products like the pet, the pet

33
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,860
egg, which I like those things, but, and I almost bought an aluminum wallet except it

34
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,680
was blue and ridged and I need a new wallet, but I don't want another aluminum. I will

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,320
say this. So, you know, duct tape to make wallet before I introduce our third host here

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,160
on the show. I will say, um, one great thing I do love to get at 99 cent store is candy.

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,660
That's, it's a great place to load up on junk food. Decent candy. And they also have a good

38
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,200
selection of ice cream, but I don't really, and they have wine and it's actually where

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,840
I buy my Menneshevitz for when they make blackberry sangria. Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

40
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,240
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,160
after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Uh, going to our chat room, uh, I see Gio Videa is there

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,080
saying, I love Dollar General. Their chocolate fudge cookies rock. I would've never thought

43
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,040
to get cookies at the dollar store. It's not a dollar store. It's just a cheapo store.

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,480
If they put dollar in the name, it's a dollar store. Well, but keep in mind the Dollar Generals

45
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,520
existed before they were like the big chain of dollar stores. Okay. You remember going

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:58,520
to Daiso with me? It's sort of the, the redneck kick equivalent of Daiso without all the neat

47
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,960
Japanese stuff. Is it like Wise Buys? Isn't that the $5 store? Not really. Wise Buys is

48
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,160
gone anyway, but like, like I bought you candles there and they're, they smell good. Yes. So

49
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,340
thank you for the gift. And I bought makeup there. I bought makeup today. I buy my, my

50
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,760
hair conditioner. That was the one thing I did tell dark soccer. I wanted, I said, you

51
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,760
know, if they have dollar candles, I like things that smell like dessert. And she brought

52
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,280
me a vanilla candle. And I also brought you a tropical something or the other. It just

53
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,320
smelled sort of like, like Hawaiian pizza. So fine, but I love Hawaiian pizza. Why not?

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,160
All right, look, uh, let's introducing to the show via the Skype line again tonight

55
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,760
because he is on a, you know, baby leave for a little bit from the show. But say hello

56
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,020
everybody to tech master. Loki. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Loki. I'm doing good now. So

57
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,600
for the people that were concerned about your headset and things like that last week, we're

58
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,880
here in a, you're in the kitchen now. You're in a little bit of a better place, right?

59
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,160
Well, also I was trying to juggle, like getting Josh ready for bed and stuff like that. And

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,720
so I kept, I, my headset has a mute on it too. Yeah. And so that's probably the sound

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,160
people were hearing is because I, I didn't want to hit mute, walk away from my computer

62
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,760
and then you guys are trying to talk to me and I can't talk back. So I tried muting myself

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,340
on my headset, but it makes a lot of noise when you do that. So, well, how dare you have

64
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,240
the priority of being a father first? How, how very dare you? I'm trying to get better

65
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,320
at juggling it. Hopefully I'll be back soon. Cause God, I need to get out of here. Well,

66
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,680
well we miss you buddy. And we know you'll be back soon. And uh, you know, when you come

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,060
back, dark Sakura has her Hanukkah winter festival, Jumis gift here waiting for you.

68
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,860
So you have that to look forward to. Awesome. Which might be moving to the new place, which

69
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,640
I'll talk about. And yes, there's going to be a new place. I kind of forgot what I got

70
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,080
you. We're going to have to open it and then repackage it. I think I know what I got. No,

71
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,560
I know. I remember, but I just don't remember what exactly was on it. Hopefully it's not

72
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,520
perishable. No, unless I stab it. I will say this though, Loki, you know, because uh, Jason

73
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,320
was, was kind of taking your seat for a while here on the show over the winter when, uh,

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,000
you know, he was here, but he's back in Colorado now. So we don't have anybody in studio tonight.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,800
I do have somebody that's going to be coming in early March. So I'm excited about that.

76
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,480
Um, but until then, my copy of bravely default is sitting in your chair. So bravely default,

77
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,800
do you have any comments on, uh, tonight's topic bravely default? Do you go to the, the

78
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,480
dollar store?

79
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:35,480
All right. What are you? What was that? I'm sorry, Jamie. I'm afraid I can't answer that.

80
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:42,440
That's Loki now. All right. Uh, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, uh, for you

81
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,160
guys. And I don't have a whole whole lot tonight, but I know one thing that's been capturing

82
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,920
America's attention, nay, the world's attention. This has been capturing everybody's attention

83
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:00,040
throughout the world is not the Olympics, but the phenomenon, no, no, no, no, no, no.

84
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,120
For me, it's totally been that lady that did all of those triple jumps in figure skating.

85
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Um, mal something for me, it's the old lady that was taking the picture of herself and,

86
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,000
and took a picture of her eyeball. It's out there on tumblr somewhere. Anyway, what I

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,120
really wanted to talk about was twitch plays Pokemon. Everybody's talking about this. I,

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,800
in fact, I know we brought it up a little bit on the show last week. You were talking

89
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,720
about this last week on the show because it was still kind of like a new concept. And

90
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,200
uh, now, you know, twitch plays Pokemon. It's still going. Um, I just checked in before

91
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,040
the show. Now, if you guys don't know what twitch plays, Pokemon is, I mean, I don't

92
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,040
know how you've escaped it this whole time, but let me tell you, uh, the popular game

93
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,840
streaming network twitch.tv has a channel on there that's called twitch plays Pokemon.

94
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,800
And, uh, what's happening is that they're playing through Pokemon red, but nobody's

95
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,600
actually sitting there playing the game on their webcam. Like you usually see on,

96
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,600
on twitch channels. Instead, all the controls are dictated by the input of the chat room,

97
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,520
which is pretty hilarious when you consider the twitch TV has that 42nd buffer. So nobody's

98
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:11,520
really playing it in life. So in, in a sense, Twitch is playing with this, this giant ball

99
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,280
of nonsense. Now I know they added into it not that long ago, this whole thing where

100
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,520
you can go democracy or anarchy, and if it gets into democracy, then, then the rules

101
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,240
change a little bit. But I, every time I've checked in with it, it's never been in democracy,

102
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,880
although maybe they, maybe they finally got it there and some of the worlds they were

103
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,360
stuck in. But, um, it's so interesting to me how this has become such a phenomenon.

104
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,000
Why I, and I'm going to ask this of our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why are we fascinated with watching Twitch plays Pokemon when it's essentially randomness?

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,680
It, I mean, it ends up being randomness in a way, isn't it? Loki, why is America and

107
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,880
the world obsessed with Twitch plays Pokemon?

108
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,120
Um, well, I don't know. People like Pokemon. They think it's kind of funny that, you know,

109
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,720
the hilarity of crowdsourcing actual, um, you know, gameplay is kind of hilarious.

110
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,280
But what's interesting, and I see a lot of folks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

111
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,560
Tiger Kala says, did you hear about Twitch plays Pokemon, plays Tetris, and VX Jason

112
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,240
is there saying, where is Twitch plays Super Mario now and so forth. Now there's all these

113
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,560
knockoffs. You know, we have Twitch plays everything else. You know, like the dude that

114
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,520
did Twitch plays Pokemon there, that channel consistently has like 60, 70,000 people watching

115
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,280
that channel. I think everybody wants a little slice of it. If you even look in the chat

116
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,160
room amongst all the up, down, anarchy, you know, chat commands that are going in there,

117
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I do see people that are spamming for their own channels.

118
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,920
Hell, I was doing a Twitch channel, uh, earlier this week of the Final Fantasy 14 beta on

119
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,080
PlayStation 4, cause you know, it's got the built in streaming and somehow I was able

120
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,040
to get into the Final Fantasy 14 beta when a lot of people weren't like, I think I just

121
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,520
got in there so quick that the servers went down after I got in. So I had quite a few

122
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,840
people watching my channel at one point and I guess it was to the level where somebody

123
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,560
came in and spammed my channel, putting a link to their own channel. And I was kind

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,240
of like, Oh, I guess I wear that as a badge. Yeah, I'm famous. Somebody found my channel

125
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,000
worthy enough to come spam their own channel. And I guess, you know, as much as I want to

126
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
be pissed off about that, I was like, Ooh, that's kind of, kind of neat there. Well,

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,840
really, you know, if we want to figure out what Twitch plays, Pokemon's about, we really

128
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:37,840
should consider, um, asking the helix fossil. What is this? You don't know what the helix

129
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,440
fossil is? Uh, I feel like I should and I don't. Can you explain it? Apparently they

130
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,440
keep bringing up the helix fossil in inventory, uh, during Pokemon. Oh, yeah. I got, I thought

131
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,440
I'd like for some reason my mind was going to like another game. Yes. God, that was even

132
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,960
happening while I was watching the channel just a minute ago. Yes. God, I do feel stupid.

133
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,040
Well, in full disclosure, I never really got into, I didn't get into the Pokemon series

134
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,640
until a little later. I never really played red and blue that much. I did have yellow,

135
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,640
but we still have our red and blue. Do you really? Yeah, we do. Wow. And yellow. So,

136
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,640
uh, uh, hit son. Now is not the time to use that. Yes, exactly. Um, let's see. Raginator

137
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,520
in chat says even Adam Sessler parodied the Twitch Pokemon thing. Well again, it's, you

138
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,040
know, when you've got 60, 70,000 people, everybody wants a little piece of that, right? So I

139
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,040
mean even Adam Sessler ain't above trying to get a little piece of the whole, you know,

140
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Twitch Pokemon thing, which is, you know, it's fine. So, um, but yeah. Do you guys think

141
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,720
that this is a trend that we're going to see continue in gaming, this whole crowdsource

142
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,620
gaming, or has this, is this shit already old? Because for me, like the Twitch plays

143
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,020
Pokemon thing, like, okay, it's funny. It's, it's cute to check in on once in a while.

144
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,820
It's, it's, it's neat to see that they like, that the whole thing just hasn't collapsed

145
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,020
on itself that, you know, the guy hasn't died that, that they have progressed in the game

146
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,620
and they have made progress in the game in spite of, um, you know, all the randomness

147
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,420
or whatever. But like, I don't, I don't want to watch Twitch plays Mario brothers and Twitch

148
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,500
plays Tedros. Like they're trying to do, I think Twitch plays Zelda. I thought I saw

149
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,780
happening and I don't think that's actually going to work out. But, but the joke is getting

150
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,540
old. It's getting really old. Do you know what I mean? Well, I think you'll see more

151
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,660
like, um, you know, more interactive stuff with Twitch, you know, not necessarily Twitch

152
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,100
plays Pokemon, but another good example would be Salty Bet, where it's just a Twitch screen,

153
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,260
Twitch stream, but there's other elements in there. Like you're, you're betting on two

154
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,820
computer players playing, you know, a fighting game. And I think that's kind of cool, that

155
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,980
kind of stuff. Yeah, that's, that's a lot different. And I do think that's pretty neat.

156
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,940
And there is also, was it the other survival horror game that allows, you know, Twitch

157
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,140
integration where like if you type stuff in chat, which I think this is going to be abused

158
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,260
like crazy, but if you type certain things in, you know, to the chat, um, it'll actually

159
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:18,060
spawn sounds in the game. So like maybe like, you know, Outlast or whatever, you know, creepy

160
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,180
guy jumps from the wall, you know, or something like that and have some sort of interaction

161
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,820
that way. You know, now that you bring it up, um, I'm, I'm glad I thought of this because

162
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,820
I think we are seeing this a little more in the modern consoles because I do recall

163
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,700
while playing Tomb Raider on PlayStation 4, the Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on PlayStation

164
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,720
4, I was doing some live streaming the first day I had that and people were coming into

165
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,420
my Twitch channel and there were all these people saying, revive, revive, and then someone

166
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,860
come in and say, die, die. And I was like, what the shit is this? Why do people keep

167
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,140
coming in? Well, A, it's not nice to tell somebody to die, but B, they're, they're saying

168
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,300
revive, so I couldn't figure out what the hell it was. Well, apparently there's some

169
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,340
type of feature and, and the chat might have to help me out here cause I don't remember

170
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,660
exactly the specifics of what the future was, but there's some type of feature that's either

171
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,740
built into the game or coming to the game where people can like, I think it's more for

172
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,980
the multiplayer modes, but they can like actually help give your character health or hurt you

173
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,300
as you're playing, like cause more monsters to spawn or something like that through your

174
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,340
Twitch stream. And so when you were talking about the survival horror, it almost made

175
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,020
me think of that, like that, that's kind of here in a triple A title already. I'm being

176
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,620
hilarious with like a shmup. Bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet. Yeah,

177
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,340
right. So it's very interesting at kind of what we're getting to now where, uh, you know,

178
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,180
you do have that kind of interaction, but that's, that's a little different to me than

179
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,940
the just total randomness of Twitch plays Pokemon. I mean, it's pretty cool the phenomenon

180
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,540
that they've gotten as far as they have. I didn't, I didn't recognize the area they were

181
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,740
in when I checked in on the feed last, but I know they've got at least like four or five

182
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,900
badges at this point. You know, they're doing pretty well, all things considered. So, um,

183
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,180
but yeah, as far as like Twitch plays Super Mario Brothers and all, somebody in chat was

184
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:07,060
talking about, uh, Team Meat was talking about Twitch plays Super Meat Boy. No, no, no. Until

185
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,220
they fix the whole latency problem, that's not going to work. Yeah. Right. That's, that's

186
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,020
another issue. Um, Hey, speaking of jokes that are beaten into the ground, I need to

187
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,340
give a plug for this. This is going to be a great transition. Uh, have you guys heard

188
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:27,180
about Flappy VOG? I sure hope so. Right. It's vognetworks.com. Oh, our own parody,

189
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,500
our own piece of the pie. Hey, we're not, we're not above all that. Just saying. It's

190
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,100
our own, uh, uh, Flappy Bird knockoff game, but you know, what's notable about it is,

191
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,320
and I didn't really realize this until the man said it earlier tonight on his own show,

192
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,760
but it's Bobby Black Wolf's first published game. Apparently I always thought he had done

193
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,640
stuff a while ago when he was making the music for games and all that, but apparently,

194
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,840
apparently not. He would start things, then not finish them. And in his words, anything

195
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,600
about that. Yeah. Right. Loki. Hey, I don't know anything about starting projects and

196
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,480
not finishing them. Hey, I'm just as guilty. Right. But I think, you know what, what Bobby

197
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,960
said about the process of game making is true about a lot of things in life. The first 90%

198
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:19,040
easy last 10% hard, the hardest part, if you can get through that last 10%, then that's

199
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,800
how you know, you're going to get there. So, um, you know, again, that credit for that,

200
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,720
uh, thought to, um, Bobby Black Wolf and his program, but yes, Bobby Black Wolf has created

201
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,440
flappy vog. And I know we talked about this on the show last week, but it's important

202
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,880
to note that tonight character pack one was unleashed upon the world. So now you've gone

203
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:47,920
from four playable bouncing heads to 11, 11 there. Uh, and, uh, dark Sakura is now in flappy vog,

204
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,560
right? Yes. And, uh, what, what do you, do you remember some of your catchphrases that are in

205
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,200
flappy vog? How does it feel to suck? Yep. Yes. She says that as one of the death noises. Yarp.

206
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,880
So you'll hear, welcome to the fantasy zone. There you go. Don't give them all away. Give

207
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,880
them a reason to go play. That's the first one. So I said they're trying to do it like the space

208
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,760
Harrier guy. So it's a welcome to the fantasy zone. There you go. Get ready. A little over the

209
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,200
top. Uh, and then, uh, let's see, I know the gals from electric sisterhood are in there and, uh, I

210
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:24,400
think it was a pandalicious crack me up. Uh, I was playing with her and, and, uh, her character and

211
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,920
I hit a wall and she said something like, and I just died. It was just the delivery of it was

212
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,680
great. And, uh, I know the three folks from anime jam session are over there. Rama, Mika Chan and

213
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,880
Ari Rockefeller. They are all in the game now. And, uh, I feel like I'm leaving somebody out.

214
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,640
I am grandpa. Oh shit. Oh shit. I left out grandpa from courthouse. Oh,

215
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,560
I'm going to get a nasty email on that. I said, fuck. I said, flap yourself.

216
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,360
Well, grandpa straight up got censored in one of his lines. And I'm curious if it was something

217
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,360
grandpa did or if Bobby was like, uh, I had to put the bleep down. I really actually forgot the

218
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,200
rest of the stuff I did. So it's all good. It was great. So, um, anyhow, I know everybody has

219
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,040
been asking, well, when's Loki going to be in the game? When's Loki coming to the game? And all,

220
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,800
all I'm going to say about that is that, um, this is not the last character pack that's going to

221
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,160
happen. And, um, you never know what to expect. That's all I can say. You never know what to

222
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,680
expect. Uh, but I will say that we're not going to drag this joke on forever. Probably the next,

223
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,360
I mean, this is really up to Bobby Black Wolf, but probably character pack two is probably going

224
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,600
to be the last one because Bobby might want to move on to another project there in the future.

225
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:43,280
So we'll see. All right. Um, Bobby's clarifying with me. He sent it to me bleeped. All right.

226
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,240
Good to know. Good to know. Grandpa was showing such great restraint, even if it sounds like he

227
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:57,360
taped his lines at 2 AM. I like vodka. You know, grandpa's trademark line, right? I like vodka.

228
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,320
Well, when you're playing a flappy vlog, it's like, I like vodka. Speaking of which Rob,

229
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,760
yes. Did you ever try the vanilla vodka I made? No, I keep forgetting. I have half a shot. I'll

230
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,360
have half a shot because I got to go pick up. I've made a whole bottle worth of it now.

231
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,560
Nice. And I'm making another one that's vanilla bean with, um, uh, vanilla cream and dark

232
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,240
chocolate. You're quite the little distiller now, aren't you? I'm not distilling it. I'm just

233
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,000
infusing it cause, um, cause I keep forgetting that I can't actually eat the sweets. So I just

234
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,440
throw them in vodka now. All right. Vodka. Grandpa has to come have my vodka. Maybe I'll take him

235
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,240
some next time I go visit. Cause I'm going to pay him a visit, I think twice in March. So, uh,

236
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,360
I'll, uh, help him out. All right. Uh, anyhow, so we've talked about a variety of things there

237
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,840
at the top of the show. Let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games

238
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,760
that you have been playing this week. Dark soccer. I know you told me before the show,

239
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,680
you didn't get to play a lot this week, but did you get to touch anything at all? I did. I'm

240
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,440
actually trying to play through a bit more in mass effect three now that I've been able to

241
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,520
play with hairs and play dress up with my shepherd because you've never beaten mass

242
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:15,680
effect three before I'm on my 17th playthrough. Something like that. Um, I also, um, I've been

243
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,040
playing animal crossing, of course. Um, I'm getting back into playing Zelda and I bought

244
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,880
some games, but I haven't played them yet. I bought far cry three since it's on sale.

245
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,400
And, um, I also, uh, downloaded league of legends because there's a couple of guys on my team who

246
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,400
are at, uh, at the land of cubicles and tech who are completely into it, who have, uh, made it

247
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,240
interesting enough for me to give it a try. Also, Brad, I would send you some vodka, but I don't

248
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,480
know how I'll probably have to get a flask to set it to you in. So off to the dollar store,

249
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:56,480
I go to buy a flask. Um, I, I'm dying to play more league of legends, but I am terrible at it.

250
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,600
So if we can get like a league of sucky people together to play, that would be great. Team suck.

251
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,240
Yes. Team suck it. That's it. By the way, I also downloaded a game that's, it's a visual novel

252
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,120
called go, go, go Nippon, which is basically like you're a tourist in Japan, just looking at

253
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,880
touristy stuff. It was three bucks. I was like, well, why not? You know, so I'm playing, um,

254
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:27,040
I didn't start it, but I, uh, I have it. And I know you told me, huh? You might probably

255
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,440
about to say, I think so. I did buy Strider. Dan's already been playing it. Um, it, for some reason,

256
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,560
it doesn't run very well on his computer, but he also had it hooked up to the rig and it was in

257
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:45,760
three screen mode. So, um, I'm going to be hopefully playing that tomorrow night and, uh,

258
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,600
yeah, cause it's fucking Strider and Strider is awesome. And for people, I know I've said it

259
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,480
before, but if anyone remembers back in the day, Neo Strider's Strider zone, that was Dan's website

260
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,200
and he had like one of the only Strider websites on the internet in the mid to late nineties.

261
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,200
Um, so yeah, it was pretty cool. Um, I know I played something else, but for the life of me,

262
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,760
I can't remember what it was. Um, I'm trying to think because I did, um,

263
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,400
I guess I don't remember anymore cause my week has just been sort of,

264
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,880
I think I'm going to play this game. Oh wait, no, I'm not. And I bought some other game too,

265
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,080
and I don't remember what it was, but yeah, I, I buy a lot of games and I forget what they are.

266
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,520
So thank you steam. Thank you for taking $10 of my hard earned cash,

267
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,960
which I can actually say now it's hard earned. Yeah. All right. Oh, Oh, wait. I did. I bought

268
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,800
Gullvilleous on my phone from last week. Yeah. Since I mean, I could just bust out the master

269
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,160
system and play it, but it's kind of cool having it on my phone. So yeah, I bought Gullvilleous

270
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,760
nice. Now I'm done. All right. Let's go over to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?

271
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,080
Um, well actually tend to fate still and played, um, some more, well, the last little bit of the

272
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,320
Titan fall, um, beta on my new laptop. And thankfully it, it ran a lot better on my new

273
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:21,680
laptop and the fact that it didn't melt down. Um, I played, let's see what else was there.

274
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,400
Played some flappy vog. I'm just, I don't know why. Um, and then I played, uh, earth

275
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,600
defense force 2025 because it's awesome. That's why, but yeah, earth defense force 2025. It's

276
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,160
fantastic game. I really wish I had got to play a little bit more of that, but I've been just so

277
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,440
busy with stuff. Um, but it's everything I loved about the, you know, 2017 and better. I don't

278
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,720
know. It's just, it's going to be fun and definitely a big time sink. So, uh, looking

279
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:00,560
forward to play more of that. And, um, uh, what else this week? Uh, more call duty, um,

280
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:08,960
call duty four. And I think that was a, I bought games. I bought, I bought the new humble bundle,

281
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,400
even though I have some of the games already. Um, yeah, that's pretty much it.

282
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,600
Well, I kind of have to echo my co-host this week. I know. Um, it's kind of like one of those,

283
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,600
we were well intentioned type of weeks, but, um, yeah, I haven't really been playing a lot

284
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,000
of new stuff myself. It's just been continuing to play the games I talked about last week. Um,

285
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,520
I might've given a negative perception of Diablo three on PlayStation three last week. Cause I know

286
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I was critical about a few things like the controls, but I will say this. I can't seem to

287
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,400
put it down. Like I'm still playing it. I finally got into act two. Yes. It took me that long to

288
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,120
get there, but I only play like a little piece meals at a time. Um, but I'm having a good time

289
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,040
with it. And I actually think I'm going to play it at least, at least the one play through. I

290
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,240
don't think I'm going to do all the repetitive playthroughs, you know, that Diablo set up to do,

291
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,560
but I really want to try multiplayer at some point. That'd be great. So yeah,

292
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,400
Diablo three, even though the controls are weird, like because of the way it's tuned,

293
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,640
like it works and I'm having a good time with it. So yeah, Diablo three, I'm still playing

294
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,640
and, uh, still continuing through final fantasy 14. I play way too much of that

295
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,280
and, um, bravely default. I've been trying and I've been getting asked by a lot of people,

296
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,400
how far are you in it? And the answer is not far enough. Cause I haven't been playing my 3DS enough

297
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,760
hanging my head in shame, getting judged by all my friends, but I'm just, I'm making it a slow

298
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,080
burn. I want to judge you for that. I want it to last a long time. I'm judging you for other

299
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:37,920
reasons. What, what reasons? Reasons and things. All right. Uh, I will say this one game I did

300
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:44,000
play, um, that was somewhat new final fantasy 14 is being baited on the PlayStation four right now.

301
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So I did jump into that. I was live streaming for a little bit late, late Saturday night,

302
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,040
like midnight to 3 AM. Yes. I was up until then. Uh, that would actually be early Saturday morning.

303
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,600
Um, but yeah, I was playing the beta game looks gorgeous on PlayStation four. Gorgeous. I, I am

304
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,760
seriously considering, thankfully it supports keyboard and mouse. I'm probably going to switch

305
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,840
from playing on my PC. The only thing I have to figure out is, um, what am I going to use for

306
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,320
rating? Like, cause we use mumble. So I have to figure out if I can get that as an app or something

307
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,920
that I like I'm ready to switch to PlayStation four. It's gorgeous. So, um, yeah. Uh, if you're

308
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,760
a PlayStation four owner, uh, I believe the beta is going on all week. I hear there are some Q issues

309
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,720
and character creation, but you know, it is a beta and it's free, but definitely take the opportunity

310
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,640
to check out the game while you can. So I forgot to mention, I actually got in a beta this week as

311
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,880
well. Um, I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet. Project spark. Oh yeah. You remember that?

312
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,280
I do. That was the Microsoft game they showed. It's kind of like they're answered a little

313
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,800
big planet, but with a different twist. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah. That's cool.

314
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:57,600
Cause now that I have a windows eight one PC, um, so I was like, eh, I might as well download that.

315
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,280
So yeah. Uh, some questions from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Akuma JP says,

316
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,240
did you try it on the Vita? And the answer is no, I still need to do that. Uh, black Wolf says,

317
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,200
my problem with the PlayStation four version is the text size and the pop-up boxes. Yes. Uh,

318
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,360
that is why the game would be impossible to play on the Vita as it is right now.

319
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,080
I imagine square and the development team there has gotta be fixing those issues. You can,

320
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,840
you can change the font size and your text box. So you can make that a lot easier, but yeah,

321
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,920
they've got to allow you to change those pop-up boxes that yeah, it's, it doesn't look good. It's,

322
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,400
it's really hard to read and there's not enough voice acting to make the game playable. So, uh,

323
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,080
hopefully they're going to be looking into that. Um, but yeah, so that was, uh,

324
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:47,520
Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation four. Woo. So that does it for our gaming weeks and, uh, moving into

325
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,840
housekeeping real quick before we get into gaming news tonight. Um, I mentioned this just briefly a

326
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,920
little earlier in the show. Um, we are going to be moving actually, or I should say, I am going to

327
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,560
be moving. Uh, Alan and I, um, are going to be moving in from our little dinky apartment that

328
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,520
we have now into a house. Very excited about that. And the good news for you and Loki is that it's

329
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,000
only like a mile from here. So it's not really going to change the drives of the show. Cause we

330
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,520
were looking at downtown and we did think about like, Oh, our friends are going to hate us. We

331
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,120
do that. But anyway, it's going to be about a mile from here where we're at now. And, uh, yeah,

332
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,000
it'll be a house. And the good news is a much larger dedicated space for the show.

333
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,240
Very excited about that. So who knows what we can do with that space? The only bad news is because

334
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,880
I am going through that move personally, um, there's going to be no show March 16th, which

335
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,440
I know is a very odd period, March 16th. We're still going to try to put something on the podcast

336
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,520
feed for you guys, like a best of, or some type of compilation or who knows what I have. I'm

337
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,960
kicking around some ideas, something we can do quick. Uh, but yeah, no live show on March 16th

338
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,760
due to the move into what studio number would this be? Let's see if we think way back to when

339
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,920
the show first started, I was living with my friend from high school in the one house,

340
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,360
right? That was the first studio. Then I lived with Loki. I was the second studio. That was a

341
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,080
fun time when Loki and I lived together and have that space. Um, then I lived with Exeter, right?

342
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,240
That was the third studio. Then I lived in the house with my friend, John, where we had the

343
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,240
garage. That was the fourth studio. Then there was Jamie's house. That was the fifth studio.

344
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,400
Then there's this when Shermie was there. That's right. That's right. And then there's this,

345
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,480
which is the sixth studio. So next studio is going to be lucky number seven, seven studios

346
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,640
we've done this show from twelve years, seven studios. That's pretty good. That's pretty good.

347
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,320
All right. Awesome. Awesome. Um, so yeah, March 16th will be the big day there that, um, we are

348
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,400
moving. So there'll be no show. Um, and we're actually hoping that's around the time that

349
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,960
Loki will be coming back too. So keeping our fingers and toes crossed and all that, uh,

350
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,400
also as usual for housekeeping, you can find us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. You can also

351
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,800
find us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio. And we're also on Google plus with

352
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:01,440
google.com slash plus orange lounge radio. Um, one more bit of housekeeping and dark soccer.

353
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,840
You're going to get a kick out of this. So I went to go get my half shot of vodka flask is empty.

354
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:14,240
So I just, I just messaged Alan in all caps. You drank all the vodka, didn't you? And he said,

355
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,880
Oh, sorry. I didn't think there was much left.

356
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,240
See, I was expecting responsive bitch. I might've. So I can take my flask home. Don't worry. I have

357
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,280
a whole big bottle of it now. And I am making that special batch just for you and Alan to share.

358
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:36,800
Amazing. I love it. And let's see, dungeon buster in chat. I love this says studio N seven. Yes.

359
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,880
Yes, sir. As the official name studio N seven. And I'm not commander shepherd. This is my favorite

360
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,800
studio in the show. Uh, sag is in our chat room saying, don't worry with GDC that following week.

361
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,160
You'll have a lot to talk about. Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. Uh, Rama says live from studio city,

362
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:00,000
California, it's orange lounge radio. It was almost live three blocks from the Capitol,

363
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,880
but decided not to do that. So there you go. To register participation for this week's episode

364
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,760
of orange launch radio at vog network.com. Use the passphrase yard. Uh, all right,

365
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,960
let's get into video game news. That's what you guys are here for to hear us

366
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,120
and our commentary on the week's news. And we're here to hear your guys's commentary on the news,

367
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,400
um, via our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and our email bag, which we have a brand new email

368
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,600
address. That's also something I should bring up during housekeeping. We have a brand new email

369
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,120
address. We're going to be unveiling later in the show. So, all right, let's, uh, go to Loki

370
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,640
and the news. All right. So unfortunately I got a little bit of bad news with, uh, rational games

371
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:47,120
shutting down. Um, Ken Levine basically moving on to other things and, um, with a taking only

372
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,960
15 people, the rest have been laid off. Um, of course, you know, kind of a shock to everybody

373
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,960
considering that, you know, bio shock infinite and the whole series has done really well.

374
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,600
I don't think it's necessarily that anything did poorly. It's just that he wants to move on

375
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,040
to his own projects, I guess, instead of stuff for, you know, two K or whatever. Um,

376
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,400
so no idea really what his new projects are going to be, but you know, everybody's,

377
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,400
you know, the community has been kind of helping out with, you know, trying to direct these,

378
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:24,240
you know, now orphaned employees to other jobs. And, um, I think they will have no trouble finding

379
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,640
work considering how talented of a bunch of those guys are. I do want to jump in real quick with a

380
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,560
small correction of what you're saying before our chatters kind of light up here. And before, uh,

381
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,080
we, we hear about an emails, irrational games, didn't shut down. They downsize significantly.

382
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,240
Okay. So just say, cause, uh, in Ken Levine's letter, he talks about that, you know,

383
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,480
basically it's going from hundreds of employees to he's going to have 15. So irrational guys will

384
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,640
still be around, but it's, it's not what it was. My mistake. I was assuming, you know,

385
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,520
the majority of the staff leaves that they're shutting down. So, well, it is a significant

386
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:05,760
change. Let's put it that way. Yeah. Um, surprising to hear, right? Because Bioshock, I mean,

387
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,160
I think a lot of us sit here and go, wait a minute. Bioshock was like, great. People loved

388
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:17,600
it. They won awards. What the heck? This is the thanks that that team gets. Well, they made money

389
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,000
off of it. I mean, I just don't know. I, I don't know what his intentions are, but I guess it's

390
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,720
sort of like cliffy, leaving Epic and stuff. Um, I don't know if it's necessarily a, a big deal.

391
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,800
Well, I mean, anytime you lose employees, it's kind of, you know, it's, it's sad, but you know,

392
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,680
I don't know what's going to change. I have been thinking about it a little bit and here's,

393
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,360
here's some of the things I want to say on this is that, you know, I, on one hand, I understand

394
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,480
that, you know, making a video game takes years and years and years, and we have a tendency in

395
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,960
this industry to really cram video game franchises into the ground, right? Um, we, we do this a lot

396
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,360
and, um, you know, I, I can understand where maybe Ken Levine's like, you know what? I don't want to

397
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,200
do another Bioshock game. I'm, I'm, uh, creatively, I did what I wanted to do a Bioshock. I don't want

398
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,400
that to be my entire life. I want to move on to something else. So I, I can actually kind of

399
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:23,520
respect that. The part that gets me is, okay, well, wait a minute, 2K is going to be taking on Bioshock.

400
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,640
They pretty much already announced that. 2, it's not like, you know, Bioshock 2 was done without

401
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,200
Ken Levine. Am I correct in saying that? He was, he might, he might've been like, and the same company

402
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,400
is supposed to be taking it over. Right. Right. So, you know, there's that. So, so part of me goes,

403
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:44,160
okay, well then why didn't, why wasn't there like a resource shift? And I suppose, you know, to,

404
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,720
to their credit, they are doing this internal job fair where they're recruiting for positions within

405
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,120
the company. And maybe some of them will be with this new Bioshock team. That's, that's, you know,

406
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,520
it's going to be created for the people that will continue to create Bioshock games because

407
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,520
the internet demands it. So I think in that regard, you're seeing a shift or whatever,

408
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,800
but it's just, it's kind of weird to me that, you know, okay, well, couldn't Ken Levine

409
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,520
have brought on somebody else into Irrational Games to just oversee it? Or couldn't he have

410
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:18,240
shifted his role or whatever, but maybe, maybe I don't understand how that all really works.

411
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,200
And I know that there's been some interesting press that has been run about that things may

412
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,840
have been very, um, difficult on the inside that, uh, Ken Levine possibly is not the easiest person

413
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,920
in the world to work with. I don't know how much credit I want to give to those types of things

414
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,960
that starts to get into the tabloid journalism, which I'm not like a huge, huge fan of, but okay,

415
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,640
I'm just going to acknowledge it. Sure that exists. And maybe, you know, if you have somebody

416
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,200
who is an ineffective manager of a project, maybe Bioshock Infinite was done and it was great,

417
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,560
but maybe for some people it wasn't done fast enough. I don't know. Um, so sometimes when

418
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,760
you're unhappy with an executive, you kind of shift them over here and have a lot less people

419
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,480
under them. And in a way that's kind of sounds like what's going on is that Ken Levine didn't

420
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,880
exactly make it sound like in his letter, again, assumption going off of what I'm reading in the

421
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,920
letter. I didn't exactly get the sense it was all his idea. I think this is one of those,

422
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,400
this is what I'm doing to save face. That's my honest impression I got from it. So part of me

423
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:28,480
is wondering maybe Ken Levine was strongly urged to do this and have a smaller team of people

424
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,520
because maybe he's not the best at managing a large, large team. I don't know, tinfoil hat time,

425
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,520
not making accusations. I'm just saying these are the types, this is what we're all wondering.

426
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,480
We're all kicking around these weird theories because how could a studio that made such a great

427
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,080
game suddenly go like this? It's very hard for us to explain.

428
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,920
Any other thoughts with this? I also go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

429
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,560
BobbyBlackWolf says, taking a game makes many, many years unless it's a flappy bird

430
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,080
clone, then it takes four hours. Yes, correct. Correct. Rama says, well, Irrational Games isn't

431
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,400
working on anything big, so why would they need such a big staff? Well, maybe Ken Levine wanted

432
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,520
to do a big project or maybe he didn't. I don't know, but I would be hard pressed to believe that

433
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:26,160
there's not going to be another Bioshock game. Bioshock 2 didn't flop and Ken Levine was not

434
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,600
as heavily involved with that one. Like Loki said, it was a different branch of 2K. Which

435
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:38,560
part of 2K did? I think it was Marin. Marin did it? Yeah. So, that's probably the team that's

436
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,400
going to end up taking on Bioshock 3 or Bioshock Infinite 2 or, you know, whatever they end up

437
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,760
doing with that. Infinite plus one. It was 2K Marin Australia, 2K China, Digital Extremes,

438
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,680
Arcane Studios, Dark Side Game Studios, and Feral Interactive. Holy cow, the wonder that

439
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,760
didn't do as well. Way too many people working on that. To be fair, Digital Extremes did Steam

440
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,680
with multiplayer, Arcane Studios did level design, Feral Interactive did work with some of the Mac

441
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,440
versions of the game, so it's not like they were, you know, they all had their very specific roles.

442
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,240
It looks like it was mostly 2K Marin in Australia. So, there you go.

443
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:28,480
Reporting on layoffs is never fun. Our thoughts go to those affected employees, but it sounds

444
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,880
like you guys are in demand. Everybody wants you on their teams, so, you know, best of luck to

445
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,480
finding a job that's going to be a good fit for those people. I'm really glad that everybody

446
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,400
wants you guys. It's a good place to be in. Alright, let's move on to some more news,

447
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,960
and somewhat happier news, because we've been getting some odd news out of this company lately,

448
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,960
too, that there might be some shifts going on there, and nobody seems to have an idea what

449
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,160
this developer is doing, so they decided to come out this week and say, hey, we usually don't

450
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,280
announce things this early, but this is what's going on, and the developer is Harmonix. Harmonix,

451
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,600
of course, probably most famous for Rock Band and Dance Central. Both those franchises have kind of

452
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,200
lost a lot of their steam. Harmonix near and dear to my heart for frequency and amplitude, and,

453
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,520
you know, any music game fans really loves Harmonix. So, what the heck is Harmonix doing

454
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:31,520
now? Well, Harmonix unveiled a free-to-play first-person shooter called Chroma. Chroma is

455
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,000
going to be a music-based first-person shooter, and if you actually watch the little announcement

456
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,520
trailer for it, sounds like it's going to be some dubstep, wub wub wub wub, at least that's what was

457
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,440
in the trailer. It wasn't, here's the thing. I think it's everything that's going to be in there.

458
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,280
Yeah, some dubstep is offensive, and I wasn't offended by the dubstep I heard in the trailer.

459
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,040
Right, Jamie? Some dubstep is offensive, but some is acceptable. Plenty of it is offensive.

460
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,800
Some is acceptable. Well, anyhow, if you want to check out Chroma in advance, the alpha is going

461
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,200
to be beginning this month, apparently. You can sign up at PlayChroma.com. That's C-H-R-O-M-A

462
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,640
dot com. Development will be through Valve's Steam Early Access, and it's supposed to be publicly

463
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,400
playable in the fall. Again, it's supposed to be free-to-play, so I don't exactly know, you know,

464
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,240
I'm assuming the songs will cost money or, you know, who knows what they'll do with that. They

465
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,960
said it was all going to be, um, the customization is going to cost money. Really? They're not going

466
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,400
to put licensed songs in it? I don't know. I would think they would, but we'll see. So, yeah,

467
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,080
bullets will be on a beat, and you find the flow in the music to activate jump pads to get around

468
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:42,160
the arena. Some folks out there, some of the big game blogs did get a chance to try an alpha,

469
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:49,120
but most people are saying, you know, it's early. It's an alpha. But, yeah, a lot of folks seem

470
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:55,200
intrigued, and I know I am by Chroma. Just as a fan of music games. I'm not always a fan of

471
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,280
first-person shooters, but I don't dislike them. There have been some I've really enjoyed, like

472
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,840
Halo 2, you know, I really enjoyed, and there's other first-person. Titanfall was fun for the

473
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,240
little bit I played that, so I'm curious about Chroma. Or Minecraft. Huh? Or Minecraft.

474
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,080
Minecraft's not a first-person shooter. It's first-person, and you can shoot arrows

475
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,200
in a first-person shooter. Fine, fine. Are you excited about Chroma, Loki? Surely you are.

476
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:24,320
Yeah, it looks fantastic. I signed up immediately, so, yeah, and I want to know why the next Tron

477
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:31,120
movie can't look like that, because, you know, the trailer is awesome. I just like the design

478
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,960
there. Too bad, though, that from what I hear is the game doesn't look like the trailer, so,

479
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,480
a little disappointing. Well, it isn't an alpha, though. I mean, what games do look like their

480
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:47,120
trailers? A lot of them don't. True. So, sg100matt in chat says, I was really, really expecting that

481
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,000
Harmonix was going to announce this at PAX East. PAX East is in their backyard, and their CEO is

482
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,720
going to be the keynote speaker. sg100matt, I would think that a lot of this could be, like,

483
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,640
pressure from a financial perspective, because a lot of us are kind of going,

484
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,840
what is Harmonix doing right now? Like, we really just don't even know, and, you know.

485
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,680
Where's Fantasia? Yeah, where is Fantasia? And we're hearing troubling things out of the company,

486
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,840
but I think on the on the bright side, sg100matt, I would expect that Harmonix will be there at

487
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:21,280
PAX East with Fantasia and Chroma on full display. So, you'll get that, at least. I don't see why

488
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,440
that would not be something that happens at PAX East. So, there you go. I'm excited about Chroma.

489
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,360
I want to check it out, and I'll just hope there's not as much dubstep in the game, but

490
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:37,440
I'll deal. DarkSakura, what do you have for us? I have something that's very old school and new

491
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,920
at the same time. So, it's, one of the greatest games ever is The Legend of Zelda, of course.

492
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:53,440
And there is something now called The Legend of Zelda VR that's in beta right now, and it's

493
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:00,800
basically a first person Legend of Zelda with sort of sprighty weird textures over very rudimentary

494
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,640
polygons, and it's to be played on the Oculus Rift. And it made me very motion sick just watching it.

495
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:15,840
It is pretty, it looks pretty fun. I mean, and my whole thing is that my brain was just sort of,

496
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:24,240
excuse me, trying to reorient where on the map the people were. And so, I started

497
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,080
actually figuring out certain landscapes and realizing where on the map this person was,

498
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,360
but it's weird seeing it approached. And on top of that, it's not even, you know,

499
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,920
screen where you have enemies, you know, how the way each of the screens work, you scroll to the

500
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,800
next screen and you have enemies. And here, it's just a continuous stream of enemies, but it would

501
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,840
be the ones that would have been on their respective screens. So, it was very weird. It was

502
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:56,560
interesting, but just odd, and I felt kind of vomitous afterwards. Well, you know, the resident

503
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,000
Oculus expert over at vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf, he had a few words to say about this.

504
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,160
He actually just posted an article earlier today that's a great read because he talks about,

505
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,960
I must be a VR hipster because I kind of think this Zelda thing, people are talking about it

506
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,200
way too much. And we ought to be talking about the VR demos that are actually made for VR. You know,

507
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,440
Zelda was not designed to be a Rift game. But we have this tendency in the industry to get our

508
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,640
nostalgia. Funny bones tickled, hee hee, nostalgia, hee hee. And print it, run with it. Kotaku headline.

509
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,600
Well, see what I want to see done with something like that is I actually more want to see,

510
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,920
I don't want to play it with the Rift. I just want to play it, you know, as an actual game in front

511
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,280
of me with my keyboard and mouse. So, so you actually want the 2D experience a little more

512
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,200
like it was designed. No, no, no. I want, I want the VR version. I just want it as a first person

513
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,000
game that I can play with my keyboard and mouse. I have to admit, just in watching it, I was like,

514
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,160
you know, I don't want to, obviously this is some guy's hard work. It's done out of fandom.

515
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,760
It's indie. I don't want to dog on it too much. But I was kind of watching it going, this looks

516
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,320
kind of like not really a lot of fun because it's just like, I don't know, maybe having played the

517
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:20,000
Rift before, I just kind of, some of these 2D experiences that are crammed into 3D aren't so

518
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,640
awesome. Like I think a game like, I don't know, Twilight Princess or even Ocarina of Time,

519
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,720
something that at least was a little more 3D designed might be a little better on the Rift.

520
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,160
But again, you know, these games weren't really designed with VR in mind, but at least it's a 3D

521
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,160
environment. I like anything that takes a classic and sort of gives you a new way to play it.

522
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,240
It, it revives the game almost. But I mean, more what I would like to see is actually,

523
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,240
I would like to literally see the first game redone in the style of the later games.

524
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,200
Well, I, and I'm with you to that extent, our Sakura. And I think a great example of what you

525
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,920
just said, this game and kind of the new thing would be, uh, the Legend of Zelda,

526
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,120
a link between two worlds on 3DS does this marvelously. It's an old school Zelda game,

527
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:18,240
but new school paint because you know, the 3DS that's a much closer environment, but VR whole

528
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,320
different type of world. You know what I mean? I don't know. It just, and Bobby's in our chat room

529
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,600
saying it's not fun. It's frustrating. But he does say someone else made an Ocarina of Time

530
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,840
demo where you walk around the first village. So I'm not incredibly surprised to hear that.

531
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,840
I, I just would like to, you know, I like to reserve judgment on a lot of things until I

532
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,720
get a chance to do it for myself. And I mean, which is why I'm completely reserving judgment

533
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,960
on the Rift thing in particular, even though I'm pretty sure it's going to make me, you know,

534
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,720
make my stomach into a nightmare of nausea and my brain into a, uh, apocalypse of pain.

535
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,720
But, um, I like to, I like things like that. I like giving him a try. I like doing something

536
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,400
different. Well, and at the end of the day, you know, and to be fair again, we love getting our

537
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:12,000
nostalgia funny bones tickled. Nostalgia. I love Zelda. You know? Well, it's not even just that

538
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,760
the impression that I got of watching it was like, this could be done in Minecraft.

539
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,160
Was the impression I got. Interesting. Which technically I bet you could go into

540
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,400
Minecraft and make all the dungeons. Somebody had to have, somebody's had to have done that,

541
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,080
right? Somebody put the Legend of Zelda in Minecraft, right? Cause actually that,

542
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,160
that would really work. What you're saying, like putting the dungeons underground and everything

543
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,120
that would actually like really re I don't know if you'd be able to have the monsters,

544
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,280
but you could definitely create the world. You could do the monsters. Okay. You do the

545
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,920
mom. Loki, you're the Minecraft expert. Has somebody done this? Not that I'm aware of,

546
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,880
but they have recreated the entire layout of, um, uh, Ocarina,

547
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,080
which I still would like to see somewhere installed, maybe next door to my house.

548
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,200
I would love to see that installed in our little universe.

549
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:10,960
Hit stun in our chat room says all of link to the past has been done in Minecraft. That's cool.

550
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,880
I want to check that out. I got to find that world. I want that installed next door to my

551
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,720
house and I'll move into Link's house. But here's, here's something very important to

552
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,680
keep in mind when I say I want to check that out. I want to spend 30 minutes in there going,

553
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,720
Ooh, this is neat. And then I never want to play it again because that's the way some of

554
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:36,320
these nostalgia things go. If you asked me to pay 60 bucks for that, no, no, no. It's like my shirt.

555
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:42,080
Yeah. No period. I'm wearing a black shirt. This is no period. And I like how the no is positioned

556
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:48,000
right on the boobies. It's my lack of consent shirt. The answer is no all the time. No.

557
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:55,360
Nice. So, um, Robert M and our chat says also, as I mentioned, a hit stun in Minecraft,

558
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,320
how long before someone makes a flappy bird clone in Minecraft? I assume someone, someone like Seth

559
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,480
bling or something would have it within a month. Um, I already saw it on a blog somewhere. It's

560
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,560
already been done. Um, I think it was on joystick that had an article on it. It's already, uh, been

561
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:16,960
done. So it's hard to take a picture of myself without my boobs. Scrunching up rule of the

562
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,160
internet rule of the internet. It's probably been done. All right. Uh, let's move on Loki.

563
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:30,800
All right. So, um, this is kind of cool. Sony it's rumored to be unveiling their own VR

564
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,360
technology at a gaming developers conference, which is only a few weeks away on the March 17th

565
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:43,200
in San Francisco. And, uh, this is coming from, uh, tech radar. They say they have a,

566
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,840
their confidential tipster said that they were impressed with the quality of Sony's Oculus Rift

567
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,480
competitor. The quality and resolution are great. Really good. They said, um, people will

568
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,840
definitely be impressed with Sony's build. Uh, it says also that Sony has deliberately taken

569
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:05,920
this time to tweak and polish the headset before revealing it. Um, so I don't know. I, I, I'm

570
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,960
assuming that they're going to have something like this just because they've already kind of

571
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,800
done other things with, you know, VR, you know, they've experimented with VR stuff before for

572
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:21,040
not necessarily gaming, but for just like video. So it makes sense, I guess, that they would

573
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,760
come out with something like this and it would be good to differentiate themselves.

574
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,280
Well, here's what I worry about though is, is fragmentation is that, you know,

575
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,760
if you're going to have Sony's got their VR headset and their big dollars and all that,

576
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,960
you know, it's going to cause a little fragmentation because Oculus has more

577
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,680
of the indie community route, um, you know, around it. And we're going to have this whole split.

578
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,360
No, I don't think so at all. I mean, it's just like, you know, you're having

579
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:57,120
the Sony VR would be for Sony consoles and Oculus is for PC and whoever else wants to use it.

580
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,720
Yeah, but it's just like, I don't know, but as a gamer who wants to play all the cool stuff,

581
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,080
I'll end up having to own both and that'll kind of suck, you know,

582
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:11,200
can't they work together? I suppose that's not how capitalism works though.

583
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,440
But then, then Microsoft will have their thing as well.

584
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,760
So, I mean, that's just like saying, you know, can't, can't the console manufacturers work

585
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,320
together and just make one console that all the games can be on.

586
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,960
Can't they put Mario on the Xbox? Yeah, I know.

587
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:31,360
Hey, I listened to a podcast today about that very thing. Um, it was, it was a hip hop gamer

588
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,880
and Michael Patrick, which I should have just turned it off right there because I mean,

589
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,640
why am I listening to a podcast with Michael Patrick and hip hop gamer at the same time?

590
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,040
And they were posing the idea of, uh, what if, you know,

591
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,560
Nintendo went third party just temporarily, like, you know, putting their games on, you know,

592
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,480
the PlayStation four, Xbox one, that kind of stuff for a couple of years.

593
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,080
And it's kind of a good idea if you think about it because,

594
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,840
um, that way they're hitting that audience that they can't hit right now with the Wii U,

595
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,120
you get people hooked on the great games and then you go exclusive and then people

596
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,200
have to buy your system to play those wonderful games.

597
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,480
Oh God, you drank the juice. You drank the juice.

598
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,440
Hey, I already, hey, I already said a few weeks ago about the whole, you know, third party thing.

599
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,000
I can't help it if Michael Patrick gets great ideas from me. Okay.

600
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,160
No, it's, well, the, the, the reality is it's not going to happen. Like you all,

601
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,280
all of you need to get it. I mean, and I mean, no disrespect to other fine indie shows,

602
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,160
but all of you need to understand it's not going to happen.

603
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,040
You all can wishlist wank all you want. It's not going to make it a reality.

604
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,200
A very stubborn Japanese company is not going to just suddenly do that because

605
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,840
y'all think it's a good idea. That's the reality.

606
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,680
If they change who's in charge, they may come up with some other ideas because right now,

607
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,040
Wanda is not doing very much.

608
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,040
Well, and he's also said, I'm not leaving and no one's exactly forcing him out.

609
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,560
It's a, well, eventually they're going to run out of their money.

610
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,720
It's a traded company in Japan, not in the U S it's very different.

611
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,240
So you guys are all applying us logic to a Japanese company. I'm just saying,

612
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,880
I'm not, I'm like, I'm going to get painted. Here comes the email. Rob's the fan boy and

613
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:20,720
I'm just the realist y'all. So anyway, uh, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. So we're moving on to

614
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,680
talking about Sony making their own VR headset and, uh, they're special. Yeah.

615
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,480
The way Loki phrases it, where you have one for your console and one for your PC,

616
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,720
makes it sound less offensive. Um, so I kind of hope that's the direction they're going with it,

617
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,880
but you know, um, I just, who's to say you couldn't support both. I mean, cause

618
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,840
you know, look at like, uh, 3d technology that's out there, you know, they have, you know,

619
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,640
the Nvidia stuff, they have, you know, other monitors that are non that have like, you know,

620
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,040
3d without glasses or all the different 3d technologies across, you know,

621
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,920
like Blu-ray and stuff with the, with that. And they all kind of work together. So if they come

622
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:08,400
up with a, you know, a way to, you know, if they come out with the API's for it and stuff,

623
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,080
then people can put that into their game and support both. Well, we'll see,

624
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,720
just like you can do a game for the 360 and the PlayStation three or the one in the PlayStation

625
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:25,760
four. Who knows? Yeah, exactly. All right. Uh, moving on, uh, talking about Sega and, uh, some,

626
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,000
some business moves with Sega. Um, Sega is going to be splitting a subsidiary of Sega. That is

627
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,760
index corporation index corporation will be split into two companies. That's Atlas and index, uh,

628
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,680
Sega Sammy, as they are, you know, it's technically the company name. They actually

629
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,680
acquired index corporation, which is the parent of Atlas. Are you still with me? Y'all? Uh,

630
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,440
that happened last year. I think you all saw the story. Sega bought Atlas, right? Y'all saw that.

631
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,160
And now the little K they're splitting the Atlas and the parent corporation. So that's,

632
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,720
what's happening there. And that is a business move to strengthen division and developments and

633
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,000
so forth. Atlas will have 121 employees. That's their game development office. They're going to

634
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,160
be keeping that index is going to focus solely on advertisement, advertisement, marketing,

635
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,720
content distribution and so forth. And they have 166 people working for them.

636
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,040
I guess it takes more to market the game than it does to make the game. That's very interesting.

637
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:30,160
So, uh, yeah. Also, uh, Yukio Sugino, who is the, um, current Sega managing director,

638
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,840
he's going to be the acting head for Atlas. All this is expected to take effect by April 1st.

639
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,240
So there you go. All your business happenings with Sega, but there's something else to note

640
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:46,720
here that has a lot of people going, what? And this is, this is weird. I don't, I don't know,

641
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:53,600
but anyway, apparently some blogs are running that Sega has lost the Shenmue trademark because of

642
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:00,480
years of inactivity. And, uh, apparently you can actually go to the site, the USPTO.gov. And it

643
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,120
actually talks about that registration was canceled because registrant did not file an

644
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,760
acceptable declaration under section eight to view all documents on file, dah, dah, dah, dah,

645
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,480
look at all the, uh, extended stuff. So apparently because there hasn't been any followup

646
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:22,080
Sega lost the trademark to Shenmue in the U S yes. In the U S that doesn't mean they can't get

647
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,920
it back, but, uh, I think we should change the name of the show to Shenmue. What do you guys

648
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:32,160
think? We should, we should drive a forklift. Can we invite our listeners to play the lucky hit

649
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,440
and spend the rest of the time playing our new theme song will be space Harrier music

650
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,520
orange Shenmue radio debuting next week.

651
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:51,680
Uh, that's, that's unfortunate about, um, the, uh, loss of the trademark. I hope that doesn't

652
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,360
mean they're just leaving this whole franchise aside, but I seem to recall, didn't they actually

653
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:05,120
put a Shenmue reference in, uh, the Sega all stars racing game just recently. So maybe,

654
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:10,720
yeah, maybe, uh, dungeon buster makes it very clear in our chat loss of trademark does not mean

655
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,840
loss of IP does not equal this. So for the record, it's funny that you mentioned the

656
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:24,240
Sega racing thing. Dan was watching the Daytona 500 today. And I saw just how short Danica

657
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,560
Patrick really is. She's actually kind of adorable. All right. Uh, yeah, actually I

658
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:36,880
love playing as Danica Patrick in the Sega game. It's so random. It's great. Anyhow. All right.

659
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:43,440
Uh, moving on with more news, dark soccer. Well, there is a, um, college, uh, it's called

660
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:50,720
Abertay university in Dundee that's in Scotland. Um, that has a lab that is the largest in Europe

661
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:58,000
and has, uh, 30 new PlayStation Vita development kits and PS3 and PS4 dev kits so that students

662
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,920
who go to the lab will be able to use the hardware for different parts of, uh, developmental learning

663
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:11,280
as far as like actual, uh, game and application development. Um, they're basically saying that

664
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,120
they're trying to do their best to bring young and talented new developers onto, uh, Sony's

665
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:24,240
various platforms. And there's a quote here from professor Lewis Natanson, um, who is the head of

666
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,880
the arts, media and computer games at Abertay university saying that having access to professional

667
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,920
Sony development kits is increase, is incredibly exciting for students learning how to design and

668
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,720
build games. And we've seen a real jump in the enthusiasm of our students since we created this

669
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:44,320
lab. So, I mean, basically saying it's encouraging the students to learn on their own. And he even

670
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,920
goes on to say that there are, um, students who are just spending their free time in the lab

671
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,240
working on their own projects. So I think it's pretty neat. We're probably going to see a lot more,

672
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:04,080
um, unique content coming out for the Sega platforms. This kind of reminds me in a way of when

673
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:08,720
I was in junior high and high school and we used to go to the science room that had the computers

674
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:14,720
on lunch and we would play tank wars. And, um, what was the other, we always talk about this

675
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,760
game. I can't remember the name of it anymore. No, not that the other kicks. It was another tank

676
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,480
shooting game that has like scorched earth, scorched earth. Thank you. We used to play the

677
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,120
shit out of that game on, on breaks and so forth. And I think we tried to install doom, but it

678
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,120
didn't work and so forth. But like, I always just chalk that up to the fact that we were hardcore

679
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:38,000
nerds, which is fine. I'll own that we were hardcore nerds, but, um, this kind of sounds

680
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
like that to me is that like, Hey, if we have this open room with these development kits and,

681
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,920
and let people kind of play, then people are going to play and create and share. And I just

682
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,440
became a PlayStation tagline, but that's what they're going to do. Right? Well, yeah, pretty

683
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:59,360
much. I think it's cool. Um, let's see more of this happen in other countries, namely America,

684
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:06,080
but no, we suck. You never know. You never know. All right. Let's travel around the world and check

685
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,400
out some release dates of what the PlayStation labs around the world and that Microsoft labs

686
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:17,120
are bringing to you very soon. Okay. Um, so in, uh, North America, we've got a few things come

687
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:22,880
out of this week, plants versus zombies, garden warfare on Xbox one and Xbox three 60, uh, tales

688
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:31,280
of symphonia Chronicles on PlayStation three, uh, Castlevania Lords of shadows two on PlayStation

689
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:39,920
three and Xbox three 60, uh, Magus on PlayStation three thief on a PlayStation three PlayStation

690
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:47,920
four, Xbox one, Xbox three 60. And I believe PC, uh, professor Leighton, uh, finally on Friday,

691
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,600
uh, professor Leighton and the Azran legacy would be the last game coming up that week.

692
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:59,760
All right. That's it. I, I, um, I, there's actually quite a few titles in there,

693
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,360
like a thief and so forth that are like, Oh, Hey, that's finally coming.

694
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,560
Well, that's the thing too about thief is like, it looks like a good game,

695
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:12,480
but they're doing zero advertising on it. Yeah. Well, I saw some people live streaming

696
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,240
it on a PlayStation four the other night. So some copies are already out there. So,

697
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:22,000
yeah. All right. Uh, moving on to, uh, Japanese release dates. Hey, uh, just in case you missed

698
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,440
it, Japan got their PlayStation four. It was released over the weekend. Um, I, I haven't

699
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,000
seen a lot of reports on how it did. I'm hearing that there weren't really the people lining up

700
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,800
and all that stuff. So I don't know. Like it's, I don't know. Again, this is just from one news

701
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,040
source, so I'm not trying to say like, Oh, it flopped. I don't know, but I'm be curious to see

702
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,640
what the numbers are going to look like. Um, for PlayStation four out of Japan, there's really no

703
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,520
competition cause you know, Xbox one still not even dated for Japan. So, uh, it'll be, I'd be

704
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:54,000
curious to see how it sells over there. So, uh, we will start talking about PlayStation four releases,

705
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,880
except because the system just launched there, pretty much everything came out. We're not going

706
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,240
to really see any more releases on PlayStation four in Japan until mid March, March 19th is the

707
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,880
next game called natural doctrine is the next game that they're going to be getting in Japan outside

708
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,920
of the released games they already got. However, on the PlayStation three, things are a little

709
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,960
different. You have infinite Stratos to ignition hearts in regular limited and Famitsu packs all

710
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,800
coming out this February 27th as well as Kagero dark side princess in a regular and premium

711
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:30,720
edition. I'm also coming out on PlayStation three this week. Sengoku Hime for Soya. Hi,

712
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:38,080
Kay. Uh, Hana, Mamoru, Chi Chi comes out this week and I want to say what is Sengoku Hime? I've

713
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:43,520
heard of this series before. I was trying to see if I could read it actually. Well, sorry. Cause

714
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,920
I'm trying to see if, uh, there's a screenshot cause I want to know what game this is. Earth.

715
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,440
I feel like this is something we have here and I don't know what the translation,

716
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:58,320
somebody in shadow will get me. Um, something protect earth.

717
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,880
I think, I don't know. I can read a little bit of it.

718
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,680
All right. Protecting the flowers of the earth. There we go.

719
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,400
Uh, is it based? It's based on like an anime or something, right?

720
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:18,560
I think so. I don't know. Ikuma JP tell us what it is. It's it's a, it's a strategy game

721
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,960
series featuring historical Japanese warriors re-imagined as cute anime girls.

722
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,040
That's what it says. I Googled it. I'm sure none of you can hear me blink.

723
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,600
Akuma is that like a real popular game over there? I've got to know. That's actually kind

724
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:44,240
of awesome. Oh my God. Can you imagine if they made a game like with Abraham Lincoln

725
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,080
and like George Washington as Muppets?

726
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,960
That would actually be kind of awesome. Technically we have that at Disneyland,

727
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,200
except he's an animatronic. I guess that's true, huh? Which actually going in and watching that

728
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,880
was pretty cool. Well, they have, it's not Muppets, but they have the Lego movie game

729
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,920
has Abraham Lincoln in it. Oh, does it? Yeah. Oh, I got to, I got to check out the Lego movie

730
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:15,040
at some point. I still haven't seen it. Uh, Xbox 360 has a game out this week called she,

731
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,880
she, hey, no, so not Neil refrain. What a beautiful memories. That is the name of the game

732
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:28,400
from lyre soft. What a beautiful memories. And on the PlayStation Vita, infinite Stratos too,

733
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,360
and Kagero dark side princess are both on their way to the Vita as well. And Phantom

734
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:39,440
breaker battlegrounds gets a limited edition on the Vita this week and checking out the Wii U.

735
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,760
Unfortunately it doesn't look like anything's going on in the Wii U. They already got Donkey

736
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:51,840
Kong over there, which was our big news. We knew, uh, over on the Nintendo 3DS, uh,

737
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:59,120
Bokuju Monogatari Sunaguru Shintenshi comes out this week as well as Kasuke.

738
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,960
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Tenchi? Yeah. Oh, nevermind. That's not what I think it is.

739
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:13,760
Kasuke Houder Mugen Gear comes out, uh, from Nintendo. So I'm trying to figure out what game

740
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:20,000
this is. Cause this is a first party game. That's coming out over there. Um, it looks like dinosaurs

741
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,880
that are fighting each other. That's kind of cool. And then you get in a Jeep and you hunt dinosaurs

742
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,560
Dinosaur Hunter, I guess is what that game is. That's kind of interesting. There you go. Japanese

743
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:37,200
releases. How about the UK Dark Sakura? Um, a few things we have as soon as it decides to load back

744
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,320
up for me. Um, let me just jump in here. Akuma JP in response to, uh, the, uh, game we were talking

745
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:48,640
about earlier saying never heard of it. Looks like it plays like Nobunaga. Okay. Well, we have,

746
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:57,120
let's see, starting on the 26th, we have Pac-Man Museum, uh, for, uh, PS3, PC, and Xbox 360.

747
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,880
On the 27th, we have Plants vs Zombies, uh, Garden Warfare, Shadowrun Dragonfall,

748
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,000
on various variouses. And there is a Mac release, which is good. On the 28th,

749
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:15,120
Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2, um, for PC, Xbox 360, PS3. There's also Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD,

750
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:22,400
Thief 4, um, and then just, yeah, it looks like also there's going to be all of the Thief 4

751
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,080
releases on that date. And that's all that's listed.

752
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,920
All right. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

753
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:39,200
Sorry about that. Um, I heard, I heard the kids in the background, so I figured there must be some

754
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:44,000
activity going on there. So, yeah, good stuff. Anyways, um, so Microsoft, they're testing the

755
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,760
lower pricing for some of the digital games on Xbox One. They've been doing this, like,

756
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:54,080
kind of sale, if you will, I guess, the last few days. And one of those is going to be for, uh,

757
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:59,440
Rise Son of Rome. They're actually marking it down to $39.99. And, um, I guess that's running

758
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:06,480
through February 24th. So, um, it's kind of interesting to see them mark their titles down

759
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,280
that much. Um, but, you know, basically they're saying, you know, a lot of people are asking for

760
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,240
better deals on our digital marketplace, so we're testing some. Um, noting, I guess, that the

761
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,040
$39.99 is lower than the used price that you can find at retail right now.

762
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:27,600
So it'd be interesting to see them do that. Right now I know a lot of new releases,

763
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:33,040
they just come out about $5 cheaper. So this is a very interesting move,

764
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:38,400
uh, by Microsoft, in my opinion, because, you know, back when we were first talking about all

765
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,200
this digital rights and what's the advantage of buying digitally and all this. And I said,

766
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,840
you know, you can't turn around and sell these games. So these games don't have as much equity.

767
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:52,320
So you would really be able to make it worth my while if you would charge 20 bucks for these

768
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:58,160
games. Now, all right, so maybe they didn't drop all the way down to $20, but they cut $20 off the

769
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,880
price with this. So now they've sweetened the pot a little bit because as far as I know, the physical

770
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,760
copy of Rise, they're still selling those for $59.99, right? That hasn't changed.

771
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:12,080
I believe so. Yeah. And the price of a used copy is still way up there,

772
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,800
right? Like only $5 less, right? Probably depends on how many they have.

773
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:25,120
So Microsoft is giving a lot of incentive to go digital, but with the cheaper price.

774
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:29,200
But the question is, you know, is it going to work? And is, is a game like Rise

775
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,680
the best game to demonstrate that with? I don't know. So, um, Dark Soccer,

776
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:39,760
let me ask you this as a, you know, you, you like to collect games and so forth,

777
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,440
but you've also done digital games with Steam and so forth. A lot of them.

778
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:49,840
Do you think that charging $20 less for a digital copy of the game makes that more attractive for

779
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:53,840
consoles? Let's cut PC out of the picture. Do you think $20 less for a console game makes

780
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,280
it more attractive to go digital? No, I really prefer having a physical

781
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:02,480
copy if I'm going to have a console game. And I mean, a lot of my, there's been PC games that

782
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:08,000
have gone out and also bought physical copies, bought, bought, bought physical copies versus

783
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:17,200
the digital ones. And it wasn't for anything like paying less for a convenience. It was me paying

784
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:21,840
so that I have something to hold in my hands and look at, you know, it's, it's part of the

785
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:30,000
experience. So I, I don't, there's people who will find it attractive. But me, it's not fair to ask

786
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,200
somebody who loves print media, if they would rather have a physical copy. So.

787
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:41,120
Fair enough. Um, Loki, if, if you're able to answer, um, what about for you,

788
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:45,520
does this make it more attractive for you? Um, honestly, it's still too high. I mean,

789
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:50,320
you know, with even their digital games marketing down 20 bucks, like, I mean, it's a good start,

790
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:56,560
but I've just been kind of spoiled with Steam. I'm just not going to buy anything if it's, you know,

791
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,800
unless it's significantly less, I guess, you know, if I was getting the console now and that was the

792
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,840
game I was looking to buy, then yeah, I might consider digital, but I don't know, considering

793
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,320
that the hard drive's not replaceable and how long it's going to take for me to download it.

794
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,720
I may just wait, you know, until it becomes a price that I want to pay for.

795
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,560
All right. Sounds like somebody else in the background is spoiled.

796
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,880
All right. A little upset at something. All right. Uh, I'll move on to the next story

797
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,320
while you go show them a little attention. Uh, I will say this though, as far as like,

798
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,000
you know, I'm, I'm looking, I'm looking over at the empty host chair tonight and my copy of

799
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,240
bravely default. And, you know, I was really tempted to get the digital release of bravely

800
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:42,560
default so I could have it right at midnight. Um, but I was thinking like, you know, if,

801
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,920
if Nintendo had charged $10 less for me to get it digitally, the night it comes out,

802
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I would have done it. I would have never bought the physical copy. So I don't know,

803
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,600
just food for thought. Like that's kind of my perspective on it is that, yeah, if they can kind

804
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,000
of have this competition when it's the day of release and get the price of the games cheaper,

805
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,520
it does make it more attractive. That's definitely the reality of it. Anyhow, moving on to, uh, one

806
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,880
more story here before we get to the classic game of the week, there was a little bit of back and

807
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,520
forth on Reddit this week. And yeah, this is important because it has to do with steam and

808
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:19,840
could steam be actually spying on you. Well, one Reddit user actually posted to the counter

809
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:26,400
strike community that, Hey, uh, I decompiled the VAC, which is, um, a VAC is like the anti-cheat

810
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,800
methodology that goes into a lot of games online. Just kind of, I'm oversimplifying things, but

811
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,400
that's basically what it is. And apparently the module will go through your DNS, DNS cache

812
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:42,720
entries. It'll hash each one with MD5 report it back to the servers. So in other words,

813
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:48,080
and he goes on to say that, you know, reddit.com would become this and so on. And, uh, you know,

814
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:52,880
if you hash with MD5, that's not foolproof. You can actually kind of see what this is. So

815
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:58,560
long story short, uh, steam was essentially reading like what URLs are you looking at?

816
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:03,120
What, what websites are you looking at? What are you viewing? And of course the first thought,

817
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:09,440
the first reaction everybody has is OMG, my porn. Okay. Maybe not really, but come on. I'm sure a

818
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:14,720
lot of you thought it. Well, this caused, and I had no idea he posted on Reddit, but he does

819
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:20,880
Gabe Newell under a confirmed account actually posted in the general gaming community on Reddit.

820
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:26,960
And I actually super loved his response because he actually talked about, okay, we're not spying

821
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,520
on what websites you did. We you're looking at, we don't always talk about VAC, which is the

822
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,120
counter hacking system and so forth, because we don't want cheaters to know kind of how we're

823
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:41,440
doing it. But what's happening, basically, the reason why this is happening is that we're looking

824
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:48,640
for certain cheat servers in your cache. And if it finds it, then it's going to do this further

825
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,760
check to see if you're doing this, this cheat. And they, he actually said 570 cheaters got banned as

826
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,880
a result, but he went on to clarify, if you just visit the website, that's not going to get you

827
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,560
banned because some people were concerned that, Oh, well that means if I've ever visited the

828
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,640
website, I'm going to be banned. He said, no, this is just kind of, you know, what it's looking for.

829
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,920
And he said, the Q and A at the very end was my favorite part because he gave some very

830
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:18,640
plain answers. He said, number one, do we send your browsing history to Valve? No. Number two,

831
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:25,680
do we care what porn sites you visit? This is Gabe Newell. Oh dear God, no, my brain just melted.

832
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,720
I might want to know what porn sites you visit. What's hot, y'all? What's hot? No, I'm just

833
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:37,520
kidding. Uh, and number three is Valve using its market success to go evil? I don't think so,

834
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,080
but you have to make the call if we are trustworthy, we try really hard to earn

835
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,120
and keep your trust. Very interesting comment, you know, and I think it's that kind of openness

836
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:52,000
that people do kind of dig about Valve. I mean, when they are open, I mean, it's not like you can

837
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,520
just go say, Hey, how about Half-Life 3 already? I mean, some things are never going to be open

838
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,240
about, but that's, that's pretty cool that he did go and make a very, uh, very night and day comment

839
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:09,600
like that. I love that. Dear God, no, my brain just melted. Love it. So there you go. If you

840
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,680
want to trust Steam, Steam is telling you they don't care if you're looking at porn or not.

841
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:19,360
That's not what they're looking to get. So, all right. Anyhow, let's travel to a simpler time.

842
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,000
Let's travel to a time where, you know, you didn't, you didn't get porn on the internet

843
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,800
and it wasn't reported back to companies. If you wanted porn, you went to raid the closet

844
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:37,200
and the hiding place under your bed. It's the classic game of the week. Every week Dark

845
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:42,480
Sakura dives into the fault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey, you little brats, you should be

846
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:47,760
playing this game. And yet again, this week, Dark Sakura, we have one of those games where I go,

847
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:55,200
how in the hell, how in the actual hell have we never had this game before? Because I've done

848
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:59,440
other games in the series that never did this one. And I double check to be sure of that.

849
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,480
All right. Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

850
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:12,320
It's the Legend of Zelda. The first one early on, and it came out in Japan as the Hyrule

851
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:18,880
Fantasy Zelda no Densetsu. And it came out in 1986 and was released in North America in 1987

852
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:27,840
designed by Miyamoto and Tezuka Takahashi. And it's, well, I know I shouldn't have to

853
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,360
tell everybody what it's about, but I'm going to anyway. So basically you have to get the

854
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,400
eight fragments of Triforce of Wisdom to rescue Zelda and kick pig face Ganon in the butt.

855
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,040
It's top-down perspective. You walk through the world, you shoot stuff with your sword.

856
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:47,840
If you have full hearts or you just go step, step, step, step, step, please die, please die,

857
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,720
get rid of that damn shield, just die already when you're playing.

858
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,800
And it has different little puzzles thrown in it. Like they go up and up and up and up in the

859
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:02,160
Northwest Southwest, I believe it was. It first came out as a launch title for the

860
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:06,960
Family Computer Disk System, which actually it's got really good music on the disk system.

861
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:16,080
Yeah, the disk system had that different like a different sound processor. Sorry,

862
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:20,720
I'm very impressed. This little video that we're watching. It's a speedrun. Yeah, it's actually

863
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:24,720
a speedrun. You can see this too over the OLR episodes that are posted on YouTube every week.

864
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:29,120
Just want to plug the YouTube channel again because Jason splices all this in. I hate those

865
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,840
guys. The little night guys, right? That you have to get them in the back or with a bomb like the

866
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,560
speedrunners doing. But you are watching a speedrun here and this guy is starting in level three and

867
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,120
it's kind of warping my mind because I'm like, wait a minute, don't you go to you go up, up,

868
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:47,600
up and then to the left. Why are you starting with level three? You're doing it wrong,

869
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:53,200
but I guess not really. Well, all you need for level three is because you have to have,

870
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,920
he's basically going for the raft first because you need to have that to get to one of the later

871
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,720
areas to get the items you need. I think you have to get the silver arrows before you can kill

872
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,000
Ganon. Right. Yeah. I know you have to have the silver arrows, but I always thought you had to

873
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,800
have each Triforce fragments. Not really. You can beat the game. Really? I thought that you still

874
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,840
had to collect each Triforce fragment. I didn't realize you could just because yeah, level one

875
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:19,360
and two give you what the boomerang or, um, no, I'm wrong in that the bow, the bow is in one

876
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,240
and then. Well, there's also, even if you go through it, there's faster ways. Yeah. I mean,

877
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:31,120
if this is a speed run, then it makes sense to do the levels in a faster method so that you're not

878
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:42,640
going back and forth. Um, I'm just impressed. So anyway, um, as I was saying, um, it was the

879
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:49,360
best seller for the Nintendo. It has, uh, sold over 6.5 million copies and it's listed as one

880
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:57,760
of the greatest ever role-playing games. Um, it has a sequel, several prequels, different spinoffs,

881
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:05,200
and it is among Nintendo's most popular series. Um, there also now was, in 1994,

882
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,200
there was a version that was released in Japan called the Hyrule Fantasy Zelda no Densetsu 1.

883
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,320
Um, that was, uh,

884
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:25,360
it was basically the re-release, um, as well as it was also, uh, one of the first home console games

885
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:33,120
that had an internal battery. So, I mean, the game was awesome. It's, there's hardly anything

886
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:38,480
that I need to say about it. Um, especially in America, we got the gold cartridge, which,

887
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:45,920
if anyone still has the gold cartridge, then consider yourself to be fortunate. We still have

888
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,440
a gold cartridge. If you have a gold cartridge with its original battery working and haven't

889
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:55,360
had to replace it, oh my god. But one thing is that, um, Miyamoto said he designed Link,

890
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:02,400
um, as sort of a coming-of-age type of thing with, uh, just a regular guy who strengthens himself up

891
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:11,680
to overcome evil. And Zelda was, um, named after Zelda Fitzgerald, who was, uh, the wife of F. Scott

892
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:20,400
Fitzgerald. You know, who wrote The Great Gatsby. Um, I did not know that. Yep, you didn't know.

893
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,080
Oh, I thought you meant Zelda, uh, meant F. Scott Fitzgerald. No, no, no. Yes, I know what that is.

894
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,760
I didn't realize that that's where, that's where the naming came from. There were other different

895
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,640
neat things that were involved in the Japanese version. Like, you remember, um, the little whole

896
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:43,040
thing where, uh, it said, what was the name of this stupid, um, things with the big pulse voice?

897
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:48,720
Was it pulse voice? Oh yeah, where they dislike noise, so everybody thought you had to use the whistle.

898
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:55,840
Yeah, but what you did is you actually, um, you had to own a Famicom. Well, because the Famicom on the,

899
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:03,280
um, on one of the controllers actually had a, um, a microphone on it that you could blow or shout into

900
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:12,640
and it would kill the, um, pulse voice. Um, so you have to, you, you have to use, um, weapons, of course, in

901
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:18,080
the US one. Um, the cartridge, um, version that came out in Japan also used the memory management

902
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:25,280
controller chip, the MMC1 model. So you could, uh, do bank switching, allowing, um, larger games, uh,

903
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:32,960
to, uh, be possible. And, you know, another thing too that I was reading about this too is that, um,

904
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:43,360
the game itself for the disc cartridge, it was about 128 kilobytes. So, um, it ended up being at

905
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:51,760
the time a little too expensive for them to originally do on a, uh, cartridge. So, um, and like

906
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:59,280
all of the, uh, all of the, uh, dialogue was written in katakana and, um, the passwords were used on,

907
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:04,240
uh, instead of the passwords, they used the rewritable data on the disc. So that's how they led to it

908
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:09,920
being a battery control, a battery save on the American version. And then, you know, the gold, we

909
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:16,960
had the gold copy and lots of, lots of neat stuff. And, of course, they sort of learned from the gaming

910
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:24,480
magazines in Japan that people love gaming tips. So they did a lot of stuff in Nintendo Power. They

911
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,840
had different tips in the book, you know, the strategy stuff. And it's really one of the single

912
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:36,320
best games there ever were. We've had all kinds of, I'm not even going to go into the sequel,

913
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:43,760
sequel, sequels and prequels and stuff, but we've had other RPGs that, you know, kind of bit off of

914
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:49,040
the Zelda formula. Like we mentioned, um, Golvelius had some of the same elements, um, that, you know,

915
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:54,240
we talked about last week. There's Crystalis. There's a Seiken Densetsu series. Alindra. You

916
01:21:54,240 --> 01:22:02,160
know, all of these RPGs really can owe their, uh, their success to Zelda, you know, for introducing

917
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:07,360
people to that kind of genre. And, you know, as far as the clones were going, like I was saying,

918
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:14,640
you know, we had, um, I think I did Neutopia before as a classic game. I do seem to remember

919
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:21,680
that, yeah. Neutopia was a HuCard game for the PC Engine, and, um, it's very much like a Zelda

920
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:27,760
clone. It plays very similarly. Um, even if you want to go in Ys, except for, you know, the bumping

921
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:33,360
into people to kill them, because Adol apparently can't swing a sword, he has to bone them to death.

922
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:38,080
Um, well, I'll do Ys another day. But, you know, we've got all of these, you know, classic characters

923
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:45,440
too, like we have Link, we have Zelda, Ganon, Impa, you know, and I named my cat Midna after, uh, Twilight

924
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:54,960
Princess, which was a good game too. Um, so yeah, like I said, there were re-releases. Um, there was the, um,

925
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:03,920
the cartridge got re-released for the Famicom in 1994, and then, um, there was, uh, they get, you

926
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,600
could play it in Animal Crossing, remember? Although the only way you could get it was through an

927
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:14,800
action replay. You had to do hacks, or, um, hacks or it. You had to have Link from Hyrule, as your, like,

928
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:19,040
your town name was Hyrule, and, because there was that internet resource that had, like, a code for

929
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:26,640
everything. If your character was Link from Hyrule, you could, like, get everything. Yeah. And then, um,

930
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:34,320
there was also, uh, the Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition for GameCube, and then a Game Boy Advance

931
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:40,160
version that, you know, was that, and you also had the Adventure of Link as part of the, uh, Famicom

932
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:46,320
Mini, or as we got it in America, the Plastic Nest series. Um, there's a Virtual Console release in 2006.

933
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,960
There was a demo of the game that came out in 2008 for Super Smash Bros. Brawl that was in the

934
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:56,320
vault section. Um, we've just got so many different versions, and then don't forget, one of my favorite

935
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:03,520
versions, which I don't even see it listed in here, was the, uh, Satellaview one. The BS, uh,

936
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:10,880
you, when you see the ROM, it's also just listed as BS, um, Zelda. Actually, it is. Um, that was 1995 through

937
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:17,760
1996. There was BS Zelda No Densetsu Map 2. That was a Satellaview game that was an equivalent of

938
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:23,760
Zelda Second Quest. So, there we go. We did have something, and it was pretty difficult, but very

939
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:28,800
pretty in general. It was just really nice. So, that's it. It's, um, The Legend of Zelda,

940
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:35,200
classic game. Enjoy. All right. There it is, your classic game of the week, The Legend of Zelda, and

941
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,960
again, it's one of those games where you go, how the hell has that never been a classic game before?

942
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:43,600
But, you know what? I did other Zelda games. Yeah, you did, I think you did Link to the Past, you did

943
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,520
the Game Boy ones, and I'm pretty sure you did Ocarina at some point. You just never did the, the

944
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:54,080
very first. You know what? One of my favorite memes actually was from, uh, Ocarina of Time.

945
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,960
Yeah. And it was how the Lake Hylia looks like the Forever Alone guy.

946
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:06,480
That made me laugh. Wow. And by laughing, I mean, just sort of go, huh. Yeah, isn't that neat? All

947
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:12,560
right. What a damn thing. Well, uh, isn't, isn't, uh, isn't Part A of our show pretty neat, but, uh,

948
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:19,120
more show is to come. Look at this show, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you say this episode is complete?

949
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,440
No. I didn't know we'd get Dark Sakura singing tonight, everybody. Take a shot,

950
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,720
that's going to be in the drinking game, right? She never sings. I never sing. All right. Except

951
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,400
when I end on a high note. Are you going to sing Let It Go for us? I know that's your song right

952
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:35,120
now. You know what? Just wait till the cookie, cause it's a different version. All right. And

953
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,880
that, and I'm not a soprano, so no. All right. Uh, we're going to take a break, guys. When we

954
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,360
come back, uh, we're going to get to the football question of the week, rapid fire news. Um, some

955
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:48,880
interesting news about Duke Nukem, uh, exploits on the Wii U and plenty more when we come back.

956
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:55,280
Maybe, maybe more Jamie singing. Raginator? CDI Zeldas don't count. Yeah. CDI Zeldas are,

957
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:03,040
are not good. It's a blemish. Excuse me, princess. That's not even, that wasn't even in there. It

958
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:07,840
was just, it was awful. It was, but it was, I still had to watch it. Nintendo, never,

959
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,480
ever after that licensed anything out of pity ever again. What is Everything is Awesome?

960
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,920
Uh, from the Lego movie. I, fuck that movie. I haven't watched it yet. You're just Maggie

961
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,200
Dempsey. We should go. We should go on a date. You want to go on a date? Let's go on a date.

962
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,240
Dan won't mind. We're going to have a play date like we're five. All right. Uh, anyhow,

963
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,760
we're going to take a break, guys. We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

964
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:41,760
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live here on this Sunday evening,

965
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,960
of course, with episode number 541 of our show already in progress. And if you're just joining

966
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,160
us live at voggenetwork.com, be sure to check out the podcast when it goes up or the YouTube

967
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,760
of the show when it goes up to check out some of our discussion from earlier in the show,

968
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,400
including, uh, we're talking about Twitch plays Pokemon, um, the, uh, character pack for a flappy

969
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:05,760
vog, uh, chroma, the harmonics game, and so much more, but we have plenty more show here coming up.

970
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,760
Uh, Dar soccer, of course, here in studio, we're, we're dining on popcorn. We're doing some fine

971
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:15,120
dining here. I'm having a little bit of it. Yes. And, uh, good stuff. Popcorn's good and coffee's

972
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,600
good too. You're on two cups of coffee tonight. Yeah. I mean, it's still decaf. It's just,

973
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:24,480
you know, it feels good. It makes my throat feel good. Orange Lounge Radio. It's powered by coffee.

974
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:28,080
Although I do not know if tech master Loki is powered by coffee. I seem to recall. He's not

975
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:32,720
a coffee fan. I'm not a huge fan of coffee now. What drink does power you? I guess maybe Mountain

976
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:37,040
Dew. Although didn't you come back on that too? I don't like Mountain Dew. What is it? What drink

977
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:42,960
powers you? Red bull. Oh yeah. God, you can drink. Oh, you can drink lots of that stuff. I can't. Oh,

978
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:47,840
no, no, no. That's the stuff that, well, the rock stars anyway, that's what put Dan in the hospital.

979
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:54,080
Red bull is what got me to 4 AM on the, you know, once a month when I would go do Rocky Horror

980
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,480
in San Francisco at midnight. And then the show was over and I drive 90 minutes back home. That's,

981
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:03,840
that was red bull nights for me, but, uh, you know, I can't do that anymore. It's doing 10

982
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,280
o'clock locally is bad enough, but no more midnight far away. Anyway. Uh, let's get back

983
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:15,280
into some video game news. Loki starting us off rapid fire news. All right. So, uh, apparently

984
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,520
there's going to be another mortal combat game. Cause uh, keeper, someone said, yeah, I'm doing

985
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:26,560
a voice in it. So he didn't say, so I did mortal combat and that's such a huge game, but it's not

986
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:32,800
like Mel yourself five. Well, I mean, of course there's going to be a new mortal combat game.

987
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:37,840
That reboot game did so fricking well. And uh, you know, they, they did their thing last year

988
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,400
with injustice and you know, now they can come back to a new mortal combat game. Here's my fan

989
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:48,480
wank though. What if Kiefer Sutherland is doing Jack Bauer? He's sweet. Think about it. Why not?

990
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:53,920
Freddy Krueger was in the last world combat game, right? They got a new 24 series to promote. Why

991
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:59,920
not? Let him be Jack Bauer in mortal combat. That would be bad. Of course, probably end up looking

992
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:05,040
more like striker who is one of the lamest mortal combat characters ever. In my opinion,

993
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:12,400
I'm going to hate that he was all right. Uh, um, so then here's the other cool thing. They

994
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:17,280
had a new trailer for a Wolfenstein, the new order come up and they also announced, you know,

995
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:23,200
that's going to be coming out in may now. But with that though, on the box of, um, the game,

996
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:29,920
it says also you get access to the doom beta. So, Hey, guess what? There's going to be a new doom

997
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:36,880
game now. I heard rumblings. They were working on doom four, but it's kind of like, Oh my God,

998
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,600
it's really here type of thing. Yeah. Like it's probably going to be coming out later this year,

999
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:46,720
you know, by the sounds of it, that's going to be crazy. A Wolfenstein in a doom game in one year,

1000
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:55,040
man was it the nineties? Yes, it's the nineties. Um, and then last but not least, uh, humble bundle

1001
01:29:55,040 --> 01:30:00,160
11 started last week and it's got a bunch of great stuff in there. In fact, a lot of games,

1002
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:05,440
I think we've played, uh, Guacamelee, uh, dust and the lesion tale, Gianna sisters,

1003
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:11,680
twisted dreams, the swapper anti-chamber, uh, and Monaco, of course, you know, anti-chamber

1004
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:16,640
Monica or those ones that you get, if you pay over the average, um, and then they still haven't

1005
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:20,880
even, you know, said what the other couple of games are. Cause they always add stuff towards

1006
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:26,000
the end. Usually it's stuff from prior bundles though. So if you buy them all like me, he already

1007
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:33,520
have it, but great cause. And those games, I mean, are so good. Like, you know, I just,

1008
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:40,000
please buy this bundle. I really don't know how else to say it. Yeah. Donate all the money to

1009
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:48,000
charity if you want. Let's move on some more stories for you guys. Um, a really cool mod for

1010
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,160
Spelunky. I was talking about that game a lot at the end of last year. Well, somebody has actually

1011
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:57,280
done a mod here. I'm actually going to see if I can play this video in studio. Um, of course

1012
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:03,040
there's some stupid ad attached to it, but let me see if I can skip ahead from this and get into the

1013
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:10,960
mod itself. But apparently somebody has combined Spelunky with Metroid. Somebody's got to do some

1014
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,320
stupid narration on this. All right, fine. I'm going to play it muted there, but yes,

1015
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:18,080
there's little, uh, Metroid. They were only seeing what we were thinking. Yeah, I know. Right. When

1016
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:23,120
I first saw this, I said hot diggity dang too. So, um, apparently what he did, he actually went

1017
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:28,560
through and reskinned the original sprites and then he swapped out the music to actually recreate

1018
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,080
the look of Metroid. Well, all I see right now is a title screen. So I'm going to fast forward

1019
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:38,960
to the five minute mark in the video here. It's the five minute mark and, um, you can, I can see,

1020
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,720
okay. Yeah, it's got, they've actually changed the little guy to a little Samus is running around

1021
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:47,040
and everything's like purpley. There's a little, oh, it's the Chozo statues that shoot things and

1022
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:51,760
okay. That's really cute. That's kind of cool. I like that. That's really neat what they did to

1023
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:58,080
that there. So, uh, this is Joey for track who did this reskin these, uh, sprites and actually

1024
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:02,640
swapped out the music too, to kind of make it look a little more like Metroid, but, um, you know,

1025
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:09,520
obviously Spelunky Metroid, very different games, but, um, that's pretty awesome. Very cool. I like

1026
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:15,600
that. All right. Anyhow, moving on a story about Gran Turismo five, uh, Gran Turismo five will

1027
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:22,400
have its DLC go bye-bye on April 30th. Very strange. Why would you end DLC? I would think

1028
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,960
you would keep it out there forever, but I guess due to maybe licensing issues, because these are

1029
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:31,840
cars that they license or whatever, um, Gran Turismo five, not only will the online play end up,

1030
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:38,880
uh, expiring in may, but, uh, April 30th will be the end of the DLC. So, uh, the racing car pack

1031
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:44,400
and the course pack, uh, that is, that's it. You, um, can download and install a free supplemental

1032
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:48,400
piece of DLC though, called family upgrade. Um, that's the only way you're going to be able to

1033
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:54,160
access those after April 30th. Um, some DLC can still be reloaded through PSN, even if the local

1034
01:32:54,160 --> 01:33:00,720
data gets, uh, erased, but, uh, yeah. Um, Gran Turismo TV also shutting down March 14th. So a lot

1035
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:05,440
of this stuff in Gran Turismoville going bye-bye, but that's because Gran Turismo six is where they

1036
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:10,480
want you to be right now. And that's, that's what they do. Uh, lastly, but not leastly,

1037
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:14,640
we mentioned this last week on the show, but I just want to bring it up again. Ikaruga is now

1038
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:20,800
out on steam. And, uh, the reason why I bring this up again is that, uh, it's based on the 2008 Xbox

1039
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:27,840
live arcade port, Xbox 360 controller port, uh, support screen rotating and horizontal play. And

1040
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:34,320
the price $10 in North America is, uh, what this is going to cost there. So pretty cool. Ikaruga

1041
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:38,560
now available on steam. Dark soccer owns this game about four times. Is there going to be a fifth?

1042
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,320
Why can't they just give us a radiant silver gun?

1043
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:46,800
Uh, also just want to say the steam version also features the double play mode that lets you beat

1044
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:53,760
the two player game with just one controller. Have fun. Good luck. Moving on dark soccer.

1045
01:33:54,640 --> 01:34:01,760
Well, it's about time. The year of Luigi is going to conclude on March 18th and the Mi

1046
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:08,080
versus communities that are attached to it will be closing. You know who says so? Miyamoto says so,

1047
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:13,440
that's who. It'll always be the year of Luigi in our hearts. It'll always be the year of Luigi

1048
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:19,200
at DJ run the S's house. It'll always be the year of black Luigi during the Skype segment

1049
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:25,920
here on OLR. Yes. Also in other news, um, super smash brothers has a new character

1050
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:32,400
and that's for the 3DS and Wii U. It will be Diddy Kong. Yay. Why should you just give us

1051
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:37,520
new characters? I mean, it gets a little Mac was new, right? That was actually really funny trailer.

1052
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:42,640
Yes, he is brand new and in high demand, but like I'd rather have brand new characters in it. Oh,

1053
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:47,360
Hey, like this character's back and this character's back. What brand new Nintendo

1054
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:53,360
characters they haven't really had. There is a lot that hasn't been smashed for a submarine

1055
01:34:53,360 --> 01:35:02,000
from steel driver. How about Gino? There's a good start. Fair enough. Can I continue?

1056
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:10,080
Yes. After Loki and I are done arguing and we're done men. Um, and also there will be, um,

1057
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:17,520
Hatsune Miku Project Diva F. It's going to have, um, we've got an update in the release

1058
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,800
date. It's going to be out March 4th in North America and March 12th in Europe. And it's going

1059
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:28,480
to be 30 bucks on the PS store. And on top of that, even though it's not cross buys,

1060
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:33,760
Sega has said that any DLC purchase for the PS3 version will automatically unlock on the Vita.

1061
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:40,480
Yeah. And that's including the snow Miku 2013 set, the extra songs and extra character modules.

1062
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:48,080
And that's it. Get your Miku on. By the way, you know what I found today? What? When I was

1063
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:53,440
looking for parodies of, let it go. And then I found the Japanese version. I found, um,

1064
01:35:53,440 --> 01:36:00,320
someone who had done it for, um, uh, Vocaloid. Oh, it was pretty cool. It was funny. All right.

1065
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:05,440
And to go back to characters that have not been in Smash Brothers that could easily be in Smash

1066
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:11,760
Brothers. How about, um, there's Geno, the Unicycle from Uniracers, the car from Stunt

1067
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,720
Race FX, um, or hell we could even have the car from RC Pro-Am. I don't know if that was

1068
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:22,240
a Nintendo game though. We need Slippy. That was a rare game though. Slippy. I'd go with Slippy,

1069
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:28,080
that's fine. Uh, Awesome Unicorn in chat suggests Monita for Super Smash Brothers. Did people liked

1070
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:36,000
Monita? She was kind of annoying. Captain Rainbow. How about Tingle? Loki. How about Tingle? Come

1071
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:42,000
on. He's in the cyst. He's in the cyst. All right. Fair enough. All right. Let's get to the Fugu

1072
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:55,040
question of the week. You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam it together, you get Fugu.

1073
01:36:55,040 --> 01:37:01,280
And, uh, our question, excuse me, I have a cough. Radio guy's worst nightmare.

1074
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,200
Help. Uh, Rob, don't die. Please don't die. And by the way, Rama, I can't link you the

1075
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,720
Vocaloid version because I have the same from my computer at home. Okay. This is why I should not

1076
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:18,000
eat popcorn during the show. Shame on me. Anyhow, uh, let's get to the Fugu question of the week.

1077
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:24,320
Every week, uh, we ask you guys a question on our Fugu, uh, communities and you guys answer it.

1078
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:29,200
So this week we decided to go off the, uh, success of the, uh, Chroma announcement and

1079
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:34,560
how everybody's talking about that. So this week, Harmonix announced that they were working on

1080
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:40,560
Chroma, which is a game that combines two genres, music games and first person shooters. What kind

1081
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:46,400
of odd couple marriage of genres would you like to see in a video game? So here we have music games

1082
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:52,560
and shooters. What do you want to see when genres collide in your game? Uh, I'm going to go to Google

1083
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:56,400
Plus tonight because I'm very impressed. Six answers on Google Plus. Who knew there were six

1084
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:02,160
people using Google Plus? So six whole people, six whole people. All right. Starting off with

1085
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:08,880
Rhetortainment who says an RPG complete with a leveling system, quests and unlocking abilities

1086
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,920
with a combat style that is similar to a fighting game. For example, Street Fighter or Mortal Combat.

1087
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:21,840
I thought there was something like this out there. Maybe I'm just crazy. Uh, Noel G says,

1088
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:27,600
uh, data track, Katamari and portal. Oh, data track must be the name. I'm sorry. Katamari and

1089
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:35,360
portal. Dark soccer. Would that work for you? A Katamari plus portal? Possibly. It could be fun.

1090
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:39,840
All right. Uh, going to act deaf to says, are there any combinations who haven't been done

1091
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:47,440
already? I mean, Chroma does break the mold, but, um, outside of that, I don't know of any

1092
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,600
combinations that haven't been done already. Maybe a fighting rhythm game, but that's probably

1093
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:57,280
been done too. I feel like there was one of those many times. Def Jam icon, for example.

1094
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,920
All right. Um, sorry guys. I'm trying to troubleshoot another issue here.

1095
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:11,760
That's okay. You're forgiven, Rob. I have absolved you of all dead airspace.

1096
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:17,440
Thank you. Appreciate it guys. Live radio. It's a lot of fun. So, all right. Anyhow,

1097
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:23,200
um, moving on to the next question on, or excuse me, the next answer on Google plus,

1098
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:26,640
our friend Renee. Oh, I miss her face so much. If you're out there listening,

1099
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:30,160
Renee, I miss your face. We need to hang out soon. But Renee replied and said,

1100
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:36,160
survival horror and puzzle. Think candy crush saga on rails. Okay. When you hear,

1101
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,720
when I hear candy crush saga, I'm going to admit I get a little like,

1102
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:46,000
but what about like bejeweled in hell? That's kind of cool. That might be interesting. You

1103
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:52,560
play with soul gems, but isn't that sort of like a puzzle quest? A puzzle quest is more like RPG

1104
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:58,640
and puzzle, but survival horror and puzzle, like, I guess there is a part of me that kind of thinks

1105
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:02,960
of maybe like phantasmagoria. If you want to get old school, cause that was like an old, like that

1106
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:08,320
type of puzzle game was like a nineties, you know, Sierra, but anyhow, I still have trivia and

1107
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:17,120
survivor horror answer the question or die. You don't know Jack just got real.

1108
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:25,360
This sounds like the type of game that dark soccer would create. It's like correct grammar or death.

1109
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:32,640
He will learn to speak proper English. I really think you should make this game dark soccer,

1110
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:36,240
correct? Damn grammar or death. The only way to win is not to play.

1111
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:44,000
This could be your last visit. Y O U apostrophe R E death.

1112
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,680
It would be like, what's that earthworm adventures, except it would be like death worm.

1113
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:58,080
That'll be my game. Deathworm adventures. All right. Travis H says, how about a modern day

1114
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:04,080
builder like SIM city meeting a real time tactical like CNC or red alert. Uh, once you've

1115
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:09,440
built your proper city, you log into a multiplayer server and defend or attack other cities as well

1116
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:13,920
and preserve and protect humanity and your own kind of like Eve on a much smaller or personal

1117
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:20,720
scale. I like that idea. That's really cool. Um, um, there's people have got some really

1118
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:24,800
unique ideas. It sounds like it kind of also sounds like sieve to me a little bit. I mean,

1119
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,840
maybe not as action oriented as what you're thinking, Travis, but I don't know. That's

1120
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:33,840
where my mind went. Uh, our, our buddy Jason is over on Google and saying, uh, typing trainer

1121
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:39,200
and rails shooter. Oh, typing at the dead. Yep. Typing trainer and platformer. Oh,

1122
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,600
Mario teaches typing, typing trainer and parkour, I guess.

1123
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:58,080
Uh, let's see. Moving on to, uh, some of our Facebook answers here. We have a gamer girl who

1124
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:03,360
says puzzle and RPG. It just seems like a good idea unless it's already been done. Puzzle quest

1125
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:07,440
would be my answer there, which is, which is a fabulous little game gamer girl. If you haven't

1126
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:11,920
checked that out, it's, it's on like every fricking it's on PC. I'm sure it's on steam.

1127
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:18,400
Uh, every console, mobile, everywhere. KJ submits a haiku. Well done KJ. KJ says,

1128
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:25,280
I want to play a horror music rhythm game. My name is made up. I think that's because

1129
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,120
I always mispronounce his name when I read it there. You get KJ now. How's that? There you

1130
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,520
have it. What is a horror music rhythm game? Rock of the dead. Oh, good thought. Good thought.

1131
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,760
All right. It was terrible, but it's basically house of the dead or even type into the dead,

1132
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:47,120
but with, um, rock band instruments or guitar instruments. Um, Andy R says a strategy, RPG,

1133
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:51,600
and a third person shooter. Basically I want Sega to stop making hedgehog stuff and make

1134
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:58,000
Valkyria Chronicles 4. Understood. That is a worthy response. Understood. Understood.

1135
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,520
There should be another Valkyria Chronicles. Degenerate Johnny says, I'm fairly certain

1136
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:06,160
that this has been done before, but I'd like to see more RTS shooters. A game in which you command

1137
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:10,160
armies overhead, but you also have the ability to take control of the year units from their

1138
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:14,720
perspective. A nice balance between macro management and micro management. Does that

1139
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:20,720
game exist that you know of Loki? Which one? An RTS combined with a shooter. You command the

1140
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:25,600
armies when they go to battle. What about like, yes, that is, I actually already have a few of

1141
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,960
those. There is, um, there's an indie game that's like that. I know I can't remember the name and

1142
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:37,680
there was one on 360 that was released by Sega. I'm thinking super old school, but, um, Arkon

1143
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:40,880
kind of makes me think of that. Although it's not really a first person shooter, but there was,

1144
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:46,160
I think a command and conquer game is like command and conquer generals, I think was like that.

1145
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:52,080
Yeah. All right. Uh, moving on, uh, Unfolded Raptor says, Starhawk was like that.

1146
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:57,920
Um, Unfolded Raptor says, I want to see a Cabela's big game RPG. You go around the world

1147
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:02,240
hunting down beasts and you have to level up hunting rats at first, then hunting skeletons

1148
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:07,440
and goblins. Guns can be upgraded and there would be stats and skill trees galore. You can outfit

1149
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:12,320
your Hunter with different armor, shoot magic out of certain guns with lighting, fire, ice,

1150
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:17,120
et cetera. Your main goal of the game is to kill an evil family of dragons that have captured all

1151
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:22,480
the deer in the world and to set them free. So Cabela's big game Hunter 2015 can exist.

1152
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:27,760
If you fail, the series ends forever. Well, I know Dark Sakura would play that and purposely

1153
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:37,360
fail. Uh, Trihexan, maybe it's kind of close. Only thing I can think of, uh, Raginator says,

1154
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:40,640
I can't think of a serious answer. So I'll go with the strangest, most whacked out answer I

1155
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:44,800
can come up with. How about a zombie game like left for dead combined with a music rhythm game,

1156
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:50,560
like space channel five, part two, and a Japanese dating gate dating SIM. You play the role of a

1157
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:55,840
zombie and in between eating human brains, you try to win the decaying heart of another zombie with a

1158
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:02,800
dance off. Was that lollipop chainsaw? Maybe it just didn't really have the music part. All

1159
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:09,680
right. Anyway, uh, Renee, uh, answers, uh, saying I don't remember it being in existence, but I'd

1160
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:18,240
love to see a fighter rhythm game. Um, Def Jam icon. There you go. Fifth dream says I'd love

1161
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:26,240
to see a virtual pet slash puzzle game. Imagine raising a tetromino from birth, teaching it,

1162
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:30,640
playing with it, feeding it, and depending on the kind of food you give it, whether you train it to

1163
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:35,440
behave well and its intelligence level, it might involve into an L shape or a T shape, or if you're

1164
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:39,760
lucky, the coveted straight piece. Then when it reaches maturity, you send it off to fulfill its

1165
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,960
destiny, falling from the sky and completing lines with other tetrominoes. Best game ever. Um, fifth

1166
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,960
dream. There is a virtual pet puzzle game and it's huge in Japan. And I think it's pretty huge

1167
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:54,640
here. It's called puzzle and dragons. It's on mobile. I thought it was stupid as hell. I tried

1168
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:59,200
playing it. I thought it was dumb as hell. I don't know why this is so popular, but it is. Maybe

1169
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:03,200
you'll see something in it. I didn't, but I kind of ranked it right up there with candy crush to be

1170
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:08,400
honest. But that is all the, not as cool as what you're describing fifth dream. It is a virtual

1171
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:15,600
pet meets puzzle game. And lastly, um, Austin S replies and says dating sim slash survival horror

1172
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:20,320
slash FPS. It's very similar to, uh, radiators either. Be careful who you date because they may

1173
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:25,280
be out to get you. Alternatively, your waifu could help you progress throughout the game.

1174
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:30,720
Well, they do have dating sim and shooter. Remember Galgun?

1175
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:36,560
Yeah. Oh God. Yes. Yes. All right. Good answers. I actually read them all tonight,

1176
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:40,320
but if you want to go support the listeners and see them, see the full answers for yourself,

1177
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:44,560
you can check it out over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, or you can check it out at

1178
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:51,440
Google plus over at, uh, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio Akuma JP in the chat says,

1179
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:56,720
I love it. Puzzle and dragon. Is it, is it just the version here we have sucks or something? Like

1180
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:01,440
I would believe that that the Japanese version is better than what we have, but yeah, I think it's,

1181
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:06,880
I think it's kind of bad, but again, I just, you know, everybody's welcome to their opinion.

1182
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:14,960
All right. Back to some more gaming news. Loki. So gearbox has sued 3d realms and interceptor

1183
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:19,360
over their brand new Duke Nukem title that they're, they were teasing. I don't remember

1184
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:23,120
the full title for the new game, but it's supposed to be like a arts. He asked, I think,

1185
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:29,920
or something like that. Um, anyways, apparently gearbox, um, yeah. Isometric action role-playing

1186
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:36,960
game was new Duke Nukem, which sounds kind of terrible, but okay. Um, apparently it's because

1187
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:45,680
gearbox actually purchased the rights to Duke Nukem back in 2010. And, um, I guess they're

1188
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:52,320
saying that, you know, 3d realms is attempting to re-license the IEP that it already sold. And in

1189
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:59,600
the process has infringed, um, gearbox's copyright and gearbox, of course, honestly shouldn't have

1190
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:03,440
the copyright after the terrible game that they made with Duke Nukem forever, but you know,

1191
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:11,120
that's another story. Um, I guess they're saying that, uh, because of this, they're trying to stop

1192
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:21,600
the, uh, creation of that new game. So yeah. I don't know. I think, I mean, if that's true,

1193
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,120
that they did actually sell the rights to Duke Nukem, then I guess there's not really much they

1194
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:31,520
can do, but I mean, if they licensed it maybe just for that game, maybe that's something

1195
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:37,360
different. I'm kind of surprised that 3d realms and interceptor would have gone as far as they

1196
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:42,320
did without thinking that they have the legal ground to do it. I gotta think that they have,

1197
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:47,200
they must have licensed it just for that. You know, I have a feeling it's just for that game

1198
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:53,840
because, you know, we had since then, we've had the Duke Nukem 3d, you know, being re-released,

1199
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:02,800
and that was done by Devolver Digital and they obviously had licensed that. So there's been

1200
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:08,560
licensees since then, unless that was a whole separate thing. I don't know. I just, what's

1201
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:12,160
gearbox really going to do with it other than poopoo on the whole franchise again? I mean,

1202
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:16,480
I don't know. Well, Bobby Blackwolf is in chat wanting to stick up for gearbox a little bit

1203
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:21,360
saying, you know, 3d realms made most of the Duke Nukem forever game. Gearbox just finished it.

1204
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:26,320
Oh, there's that. Dungeon Buster says the filed lawsuit for this has quite a bit of legal

1205
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:32,240
snarkiness in it. And nemesis 47 says, I actually enjoy Duke Nukem forever, despite the reviews.

1206
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:37,200
So I tried, it just kept crashing up. Yeah. All right. Those comments from our chat room

1207
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:44,240
over at live.vognetwork.com. Well, I'm all, this will end as it always does. Settlement,

1208
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:51,120
right? Somebody will get paid, then it'll be a settlement. All right. Moving on to another

1209
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:55,600
story. And this was mentioned in tonight's intro and we're finally getting around to discussing

1210
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:02,640
this, but, uh, it is, uh, it's, it's more of the impact of this. Fucking little mobile phone game

1211
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:06,880
that we would have never given a second thought to had it not just caught on like crazy. And of

1212
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:13,840
course it is flappy bird still going, but here's the thing. And here is why flappy VOG will never

1213
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:20,320
come to the app store because apparently Apple is starting to crack down on the use of flappy

1214
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:25,360
in the app store. Uh, some developers are saying that they are submitting apps that have the word

1215
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:31,120
flappy and they will get rejected by Apple. Uh, one of the folks speaking up, John Carpenter,

1216
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:37,680
who tried to do flappy dragon and, uh, Apple replied and said, this isn't happening because,

1217
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:41,360
uh, and they cited different reasons. We found that your app and or its metadata

1218
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:44,240
contains content that could be misleading to users, which is not in compliance with

1219
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:48,480
the app store guidelines. We found your app name attempts to leverage a popular app.

1220
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:54,000
So even though flappy bird is gone, they're still trying to, you know, shoot down that name.

1221
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,880
Can we call it flappy? He could call it flappy dragon. And, and I like that they, they, they

1222
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:05,120
say that now, meanwhile, like how many years has the app store been around and how many games we

1223
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:12,960
had based on angry birds or, you know, uh, doodle jump or cut the rope or any of those other popular

1224
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:17,920
apps. It should be noted that there's, uh, there's already a crap ton of these on the store, but

1225
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:23,040
some are changing their name. There's a very popular one called flappy bee that changed its

1226
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:27,760
name to jumpy bee. I, and I don't know, we don't know if this was due to Apple pressure or just

1227
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:33,600
some, a lot of times people proactively change something out of fear. Uh, by the way, don't just

1228
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:38,480
blame this on Apple because Google reportedly doing the same thing apps being submitted to

1229
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:45,040
Google play that say flappy and the title are being denied saying spam. So interesting. So

1230
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:49,440
time to come up with a new word. What would we have to call? Here's a question for the folks

1231
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:54,800
here at OLR. Let's say Bobby decided to make flappy vog for mobile. He's not gonna, don't get

1232
01:51:54,800 --> 01:52:01,520
your hopes up, but let's just, let's do a little, let's do some flappy vog fanfic. Let's say that

1233
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:08,160
flappy vog goes to mobile since he can't use the word flappy. What will the game be called?

1234
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:15,920
Vog splat. I like vog splat. Loki. What would, uh, what would this, this almost begs for a list

1235
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:19,840
list. I don't know. I should have planned one for tonight. Loki. What would flappy vog be called?

1236
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:32,240
Vappy vog. I don't know. That's it. Crappy vog. Hold on. I haven't done one of these in a while.

1237
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:34,800
Hold on. I did think of something we could do this here. I'm going to do,

1238
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,280
I'm going to do a live poll. So wait, we have crappy vog.

1239
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,520
Okay. That's a good idea. What was the other one that you said? Um, vog splat.

1240
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,960
My sub, my submission will be don't flap it up.

1241
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,400
Ha ha ha. And what else did, what did you have, Loki?

1242
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:59,200
Vappy. Vappy.

1243
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:07,600
I think that was vappy vog. Do we have, do we have one more for this? All right. I guess we'll,

1244
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:12,400
we'll run with four. So, uh, there you go. So we're going to go to it. Um,

1245
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,080
let's see if I can get it to it. We're going to ask the audience

1246
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:27,200
right now over at live.vognetwork.com. We want your answer. What would flappy vog be called

1247
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:37,200
on mobile? Would it be crappy vog, vog splat, don't flap it up or vappy vog? Answer now over

1248
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:42,640
at live.vognetwork.com. I have a 50% chance.

1249
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:49,200
I don't think the game's crappy. I just think it's funny.

1250
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:51,200
Yeah. I think it's just funny to call it crappy vog.

1251
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:59,120
A rage nator in chat says, try saying vappy vog fanfic five times fast.

1252
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:06,800
All right. Um, we'll get those answers and, uh, read the, read the winner here in just a minute.

1253
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:11,280
Uh, meanwhile, let's go to our next story, which is dark Sakura.

1254
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:15,120
That is me, isn't it? Well, how about, um,

1255
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:21,280
and you know, we, we did talk about apps just a moment ago, and this does play into the whole

1256
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:27,440
Google play thing is that they're actually have stated that the number of play apps,

1257
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:34,800
Google play apps, um, has quadrupled in two years for the ones that, uh, contain malware.

1258
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:41,600
Um, the number of apps that, uh, had malicious code in them in 2011 was 11,000.

1259
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:50,720
2013 is 42,000. And of course, um, the, the number of apps on Google play, um,

1260
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:56,240
grew from a 250,000 to a million apps, um, within the two years. So that's, uh,

1261
01:54:56,240 --> 01:55:01,360
basically about 4% of the apps on Google play have some sort of malicious code.

1262
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:05,520
So just, uh, make sure it's reputable, read, reuse.

1263
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:08,160
And by malicious code, they mean cat pictures.

1264
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:14,320
No. Well, I'm sure there's a lot of cat picture apps that would then inject malicious code.

1265
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:17,280
It's really sad to me how much this crap is out there. And you know,

1266
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,720
I really wish Google would do more to crack down on it. I realized

1267
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:26,880
some people do not like how cramped down Apple store is, you know, but, um, the,

1268
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:31,680
on the bright side, very few, I, nothing is foolproof, but very few of the malware gets

1269
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:36,080
through on Apple comparatively. So it's just, it's unfortunate because it makes people just

1270
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:42,480
not want to install anything and that hurts the indie developers. Right. So, all right,

1271
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,280
we'll do one more story. Then we'll go to the results of our poll. Loki.

1272
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,920
I'm curious.

1273
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:53,760
Okay. So the first ever Wii U exploit, and this is actually getting, I mean,

1274
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:57,440
there's been stuff that actually works on the Wii U. I think you can actually install the

1275
01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:02,800
home brew channel on the Wii part of the Wii U, but this is actually something that's accessing

1276
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:09,120
parts of the Wii U, um, operating system itself. And so there's an exploit that actually uses the

1277
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:16,640
Wii channel, um, that they've been able to dump the boot ROM, uh, bin file, which is part of the

1278
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:23,280
Wii U system. And they're saying it's similar to the, I guess, the same way that, um, that they

1279
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:30,000
access boot zero on the Wii. Um, and basically what that's going to allow them to do at some

1280
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:36,640
point is to have stuff hook into that to where, you know, you can run your own home brew that

1281
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:41,920
has access to the Wii U, you know, processing power instead of just being locked down within

1282
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:50,080
the confines of, um, the Wii itself. How interesting and ironic that there's so many

1283
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:54,160
similarities to how it was done on the Wii. And here's the, here's the interesting part

1284
01:56:54,160 --> 01:57:00,320
about that too. The way that the exploit's done, it cannot be patched. It says it's basically,

1285
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:05,120
it's hard-coded and in order to patch it out, they would have to issue new hardware.

1286
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:13,120
So wait a minute, hold new hardware to block the thing?

1287
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:19,360
Yeah, because it's hard-coded. So there's no way that they can, um, patch it out with like

1288
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:23,680
a software patch or something. Well, that's gotta suck for Nintendo, but be good for the

1289
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:31,360
developers. Yeah. Well, I'm just saying if piracy comes to the Wii, that's not going to really

1290
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:37,040
attract more third parties. They're already hurting in that department as it is. Um, Bobby

1291
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:41,200
Blackwolf in our chat room says, well now Nintendo will remove the Wii channel the same way Sony

1292
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:51,520
removed other OS. I don't know if they'll do that. I don't know. They do seem kind of remove

1293
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:56,400
happy these days with, you know, just removing functions from things and shutting down whole

1294
01:57:56,400 --> 01:58:04,400
communities. Yeah, but you're Luigi's one thing. So, all right. Anyhow, let's move on. We're going

1295
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:08,800
to get to the results of our poll. I'm going to shut it down. If you haven't voted by now,

1296
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:16,960
it is too late. The poll is closed. So again, the question, what would flappy vog be called

1297
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:21,120
on mobile? Cause they can't, we can't use flappy anymore cause they've put the end of that.

1298
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:24,480
And I'm not saying that Bobby's ever going to actually do this, but let's just,

1299
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:29,440
this is our fanfic. If it was done on mobile, what would it be called? The overwhelming majority,

1300
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:37,840
58.82%. So over half of the listeners voted for vog splat would be the name of the game. Vog splat

1301
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:45,200
coming in second place, vappy vog and a crappy vog and don't flap it up tying for last place.

1302
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:50,400
Good job. So vog splat. All right. Thank you for, uh, thank you for indulging us there with

1303
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:55,520
the votes. Appreciate it. All right. Let's move on to another story here before we get to the mail

1304
01:58:55,520 --> 01:59:00,960
bag, our last week of a mailbag at Orange. We're not ending the mailbag. It's just a new address.

1305
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:06,800
So here's the deal. Uh, Square Enix is commenting on a new game that they made called NOS Goth. It

1306
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:11,440
is a free to play multiplayer game. It's set in the legacy of Kane universe, which we've talked

1307
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:16,960
about this game before. So NOS Goth is the game that's being created, but they are saying this

1308
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:25,120
is not a pay to win game. Square Enix is coming out. Here's the quote. NOS Goth is a free to play

1309
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:30,240
game, but it's not pay to win. One of the key goals has been to create a fair experience that

1310
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:36,000
doesn't penalize players who don't spend money in the game. As such, NOS Goth does not include items,

1311
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:41,280
weapons, or abilities that are inherently better. So what do you do? You use what's called,

1312
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:47,840
here's a new term everybody, side grades. Oh, they're not upgrades. They're side grades.

1313
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:51,600
These paid items will be better in some respects, but there'll be worse than others.

1314
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:55,760
For instance, something called a full board cannon. It's stronger than the hand cannon,

1315
01:59:55,760 --> 02:00:02,400
but it will carry fewer rounds. So you can enhance areas that you're stronger in, but you know,

1316
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:07,840
at whatever cost. So, uh, two different currency systems in NOS Goth. You get gold and doing

1317
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:12,640
battles, more gold if you do better performance. And of course you can pay real money for rune

1318
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:18,080
stones and the rune stones will give access to items before you've earned gold or experience

1319
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:22,080
to unlock them. And it's the only way you get chess keys and all this crap you're used to in

1320
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:27,760
these free to play games. But side grades y'all that's, that's the new way of making you pay for

1321
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:35,440
side grades. They're not better. They're just different. I don't know. It takes a lot to make

1322
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:40,800
me look at a mobile game these days and I'm not sure this is, uh, I'm not sure this is going to

1323
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:47,600
win me over. So, all right. Is anybody going to check out this free to play game with side grades?

1324
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:52,720
Loki? No, no, no way. I had a feeling, I had a feeling. All right guys, let's get to the mail

1325
02:00:52,720 --> 02:01:01,360
bag every week. You guys mail us at mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com. But no more after this

1326
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:06,720
week. Um, we are going to be closing our mail just, we have a really bad spam problem that's

1327
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:11,600
just gotten worse over the past few years. So you know what? We want, you know what? We want our

1328
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:15,760
most loyal listeners to still be able to contact us. We know you guys are listening. So we do have

1329
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:20,560
a new email address and I'll tell you what that email address is in just a minute, but let's get

1330
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:26,800
to the emails tonight. Dark Sakura. This comes from Robert M. Just for a last email to this

1331
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:30,960
address. I have quite a few fighting games on PSN from the disappointing ragdoll kung fu to

1332
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:37,760
Marvel versus Capcom two to acceleration of sugary X. I was wondering, is that X or 10? I don't know.

1333
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:43,840
I was wondering which fighter would be the better $15 purchase dive kick or skull girls encore.

1334
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:47,840
And what do you think either would get a discount on PS plus I'd give her skull girls just because

1335
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:53,360
I've played it and skull girls is pretty fun. And I also don't know about PS plus. I've played dive

1336
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:58,000
kick and I think it will go free on PlayStation plus. It seems like a really good candidate

1337
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,680
and I'm going to be honest. I think the game is a little bit over-hyped. I don't,

1338
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:07,040
I don't think it's as great as everybody thinks it is. Sorry. I know that's the unpopular opinion,

1339
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:12,400
but I would also say go with skull girls. Also my chiropractor uninstalled steam on his windows PC

1340
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:17,520
because he was getting too much spam email. Could this actually possibly be related to his account?

1341
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:23,360
I don't think so. You can tell it not to email you stuff. The only stuff I ever get on my,

1342
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:27,360
from my email that's attached to my steam is just, uh, my purchase receipts.

1343
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:34,320
And when I changed my password. So no, I don't think so. It got quiet.

1344
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:41,520
I got nothing else to say. I'm eating popcorn. Okay. Hello LR. Well the theme music finished.

1345
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:45,280
Yeah. Okay. You guys kept me company in Friday night traffic. So thank you for that.

1346
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:49,280
You covered the recent Nintendo direct, but didn't even mention that a part of it that I

1347
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:52,880
was personally most excited about the announcement of Rusty's real deal baseball.

1348
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,360
This is the localization of Danameshi sports shop. A game I've really been enjoying on my

1349
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:02,560
Japanese 3DS that I was really hoping for. In a nutshell, a former baseball player now broke

1350
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:08,240
with 10 kids to feed runs a store that sells baseball themed Nintendo 4DS mini games. These

1351
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:13,200
mini games are bought with real money and appear to be $4 each, but using items obtained in game

1352
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:17,360
and some hackling skills, you can basically cut the price of each to between a buck 50 and $2.

1353
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:21,680
You know what I just will say real quick. I totally did slip through the

1354
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:24,720
cracks and didn't mention it last week. There was just a lot of info that came out of that

1355
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:28,880
Nintendo direct, but thank you for bringing it up because that was a pretty big deal where the

1356
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:34,560
real life price of items could be negotiated within the game. That is kind of a new little

1357
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:38,800
twist. So thank you for bringing it up. It is worth mentioning cause it's, it's a little bit

1358
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:44,560
new for DLC. The mini games themselves. Oh, where was I either were or feel like they were made by

1359
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:48,960
WarioWare developers. Each mini game has 50 different challenges to complete and they're

1360
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:53,600
insanely fun to play. Some are traditional like pressing A to hit a ball and others aren't like

1361
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:59,680
the, uh, like tilting the 3DS upwards to catch a fly ball hit high into the air or stepping into

1362
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:04,320
the shoes of an umpire calling ball strikes and more. You can buy everything there is for under

1363
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:09,200
$20 and if this sort of game sounds fun to you, you absolutely will get your money's worth. I

1364
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:15,280
definitely recommend it. Unlook is dismal Wii U outlook. I personally believe that there is one

1365
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:19,040
thing that could turn, um, that could totally turn Wii U around. A brand new character driven

1366
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:23,600
Nintendo developed IP that has such gorgeous graphics and great gameplay that everyone says

1367
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:28,560
I need to have that. I don't think that this will be very likely to happen but I do want to believe

1368
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:32,240
that Nintendo is still capable of creating compelling new characters in a brand new world

1369
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:37,360
even if it's been years since they last did so. A Master System game that definitely didn't get

1370
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:41,840
enough love over the years, Zillion, which I have covered Zillion by the way. I do believe I have

1371
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:48,880
because, um, I talked about the anime too and that the Master System gun was actually the Zillion gun.

1372
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:54,480
So I remember that. And this one's to me. Oh, to a guy friendzoning can be a bummer if the guy

1373
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:58,240
actually wanted a deeper relationship with the girl. A deeper relationship doesn't always have

1374
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:03,600
to mean sex and I've said it on the show tonight. Some of us think about other things too like who

1375
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:13,680
we want to spend our futures with and my, my rebuttal with that is that I don't believe that

1376
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:22,000
it's right to go after, to have, you know, what's the way to say this? A lot, a lot of the times you

1377
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,000
run into the friendzone thing complaining about a girl that won't put out but at the same time

1378
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:31,120
when you're looking for the person to spend the rest of your life with,

1379
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:38,560
I don't always think that going into something with the expectation of long-term is healthy

1380
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:41,040
to start a relationship off of from the very beginning.

1381
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:45,520
Would it be fair to say just as a piece of general advice, and I'm not directing this at

1382
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:49,920
the emailer, I'm just saying in general, a good piece of advice would be don't be creepy.

1383
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:55,040
Yeah, don't be creepy. Because I'll be perfectly honest, you know, what, what attracted me to Dan,

1384
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:59,840
we went into our relationship with no sort of long-term thing in mind. I mean, we were pretty

1385
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:05,200
sure that we were going to stay together but we went into it without, you know,

1386
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:13,040
we were friends first. That's what made us great and we are still friends but we also have a very,

1387
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:17,520
very deep loving relationship but we were friends first.

1388
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:23,920
Alan and I were friends on a website that's now archaic to many of you. We were friends on a site

1389
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:28,240
called LiveJournal for four years and we were just LiveJournal pals because of the nature of

1390
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:32,240
LiveJournal which is a very popular blogging site back in the day. Because the nature of

1391
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:36,000
that site, we knew a lot of things about each other's lives but we just, we never met.

1392
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,840
And then when we, we met at video games live of all things, it was kind of like,

1393
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:43,920
oh, hey, we should like go out on a date sometime. All right, cool.

1394
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:50,160
Yeah. Well, see, and that, that I think is ideal. You know, how many truly successful

1395
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:56,000
relationships do you see coming out of people just getting together for the sake of romanticism?

1396
02:06:56,560 --> 02:07:04,000
If you're going to spend time with somebody who is going to become your, you know, your long-term

1397
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:12,160
partner, it makes sense I think to have, what's the word I'm thinking of? To have a connection

1398
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:18,560
to them on a personal level before you go any deeper. You know, you have to, you have to hit

1399
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:23,440
the surface before you can, you know, go further. But you know what? There's also, there's also

1400
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,880
something very important we have to bring up is different strokes for different folks. And

1401
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:33,280
don't take that the wrong way, but some people hook up and spend the rest of their lives together

1402
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:39,600
as a result. It happens. I mean, it just, I mean, so what dark soccer says that works for a lot of

1403
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:43,680
people, but for some people, you know what? They, they do it. And then it's like, hey,

1404
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:49,760
we should get married. It's just my point is don't go, this is, this is how I feel.

1405
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:54,880
This is how I feel. And this is the advice that I would give based on how I feel. So don't take it

1406
02:07:54,880 --> 02:08:04,160
as me laying this down as absolute psychological doctrine, okay? But I think that going, that

1407
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:09,280
meeting a person with the expectation, and this is a problem I actually have with a good friend

1408
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:15,840
of mine who you know. Don't go into being friends with somebody with the expectation that you are

1409
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:21,440
looking at your life partner. Don't go into meeting somebody with the expectation that

1410
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:25,360
this is somebody that you're going to want to date, that that's your first thought. Value them

1411
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:33,040
as a human being first. That was some good advice and gossip. Well, I'll tell you more about that

1412
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:38,320
later. All right. Cause yeah, I, it made me really pissed off when I found out that that was going

1413
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:44,240
on. I was, I'm still pissed off actually today. I really am. It really does anger me. Breathe in,

1414
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:48,720
breathe out and get back to the emails if you could. Um, Rob, were you, were you trying out

1415
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:53,360
Taiko no Tatsujin at Playland Japan? When you were trying out Taiko no Tatsujin at Playland Japan,

1416
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:58,960
did you also try Bishibashi? I've played Bishibashi. No, I didn't cause we, we weren't

1417
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:02,480
going to spend too much time there cause we were going to dinner before they closed. We got there

1418
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:06,400
kind of late. If not, you need to go back. Maybe have someone show you. I nominate myself. Hit me

1419
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:10,400
up as this can be arranged. All right. Well, let me know when you're in San Francisco next, buddy.

1420
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:13,840
FlappyVog is hard and I think I need some game genie codes or something.

1421
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:21,040
Please don't friendzone me at YYR. Talk to ActDeft. ActDeft is streaming the game on

1422
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:25,680
Twitch and giving tips. And Bobby said, you have to hear Bobby's comments on it. He's like,

1423
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:30,720
it's the most surreal thing I've experienced. And yeah, that's, that's awesome though. It's great.

1424
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:35,520
Yeah. And for the record, I wasn't trying to go too much on the, the friendzone thing. It's

1425
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:42,960
just that hits a bajillion bad, raw nerves for me. And it's being friends with somebody

1426
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:47,840
should never be a bad thing. It should never be put in a negative light. I like being friends with

1427
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:53,600
all of my friends and I like hating the people I really hate. I don't hate anybody really.

1428
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:57,040
I'm friends with dark soccer and it's great. And I, and we're going to have a friend date.

1429
02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:00,400
Yes. We're going to, we're going to go on a date and there will not, no sex, no pressure.

1430
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:05,520
No, because that now would be weird. That'd be beyond weird. That's like,

1431
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:12,320
no, no, it's not in the dictionary. We're going to have a play date and play with Legos.

1432
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:15,840
It would be like dividing by zero. Sex with you is dividing by zero.

1433
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:20,240
I'm all creeped out now. You have to read the rest of the emails.

1434
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:26,240
All right. Okay. I am the same person that got freaked out when I saw you playing spin the

1435
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:31,680
bottle and kiss a girl. I was drinking. All right. Weren't you getting back to the emails

1436
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:36,800
over there? It was, but, and you know, it's kind of funny because nevermind. Hey gang.

1437
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:40,880
Oh, sorry. I have to say this. Black Wolf is in chat saying the guy who made bungee

1438
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:46,880
ferret tossing said my game was hard. Has he not played his game? Oh, little, little shade there,

1439
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:53,680
but I like it. Hey gang. I'm the type that loves a good story in a game. And if it has that I'm

1440
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:57,760
hooked. I'm not the sappiest of guys, but I can tell you that after completing to the moon,

1441
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:01,680
it was hard for me to tell my fiance about it without getting choked up. If you haven't played

1442
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:06,560
it, do so. I know it's been out for a while yet. It was a game in my backlog that I've been

1443
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:13,040
craving to complete. It's four hours long of 16 bit style graphics that has one of the most

1444
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:18,080
amazing stories and soundtracks I've ever played through. This small little dev Freebird Games

1445
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:22,640
keeps up the great work because this game was simply fantastic. Apparently they're doing a

1446
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:26,480
kind of sequel called A Bird Story. Get your tissues and popcorn ready. That's from Travis.

1447
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:31,040
And for the record, I am about halfway through to the moon, but I think I lost my save. So I'm

1448
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:35,680
starting, I have to start over. And it really, I did, I did actually have to stop playing for

1449
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:40,000
a little while and have a sob fit. I am like right where you are buddy, where it's like,

1450
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,920
that game has been sitting in my backlog and I really need to play it. And I just haven't yet.

1451
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:49,600
I will. That was a very good endorsement. It's such a good game. It really is such a good game.

1452
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:54,800
Um, although I really put it more like in the realm of the visual novel, because there's not

1453
02:11:54,800 --> 02:12:00,720
really, you just walk around and explore. It's just the RPG part of it. Um, hi O.L.R. it's your

1454
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:09,600
favorite email or raginator. That's what he said. It was a equal P. I mean a colon P. A raspberry.

1455
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:15,280
Yeah. I just thought I'd send you a quick random question. If you were to stick, uh, Paul WS

1456
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:20,800
Anderson, Uwe Boll and Jack Thompson into Gitmo for crimes against gaming and do some geek-centric

1457
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:26,320
torture to them, what would that entail? Playing Yaris for 96 hours nonstop, play Superman 64.

1458
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:32,400
Please give a reason for your answer. Thanks. Wait, what are my options again? Well, I think,

1459
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:36,800
I think those are just suggestions. Oh, I thought that was a multiple choice question. Playing Yaris

1460
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:43,600
for 96 hours nonstop, play Superman 64. What geek-centric answer version of torture? I would

1461
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:50,400
make them listen to every episode of this program. So would I. I would make them listen to our drunk

1462
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:57,040
show on repeat. While playing flappy vog. With, um, N.W.A. playing in the background, since it's

1463
02:12:57,040 --> 02:13:03,520
Thompson. Fair enough. Loki, do you have any idea for, for geek, uh, geek punishments? Geek

1464
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:08,560
punishments? Yes, for these folks that have committed crimes against gay-manity.

1465
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:22,720
I have no idea. And make them play, uh, dungeon. Was it, uh, what's that dungeon game that we

1466
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:27,360
really hate now that EA just re-released again? Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know what you're talking

1467
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:31,280
about. Dungeon Master or something like that? Yeah, yeah. Have them play that in real time.

1468
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:37,120
I do agree with SSJ100Matt, however. How about just ignoring them and not talking about them

1469
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:42,160
ever again? That is the ultimate torture. Lock them in a house with Ed. Make them dress as Tingle.

1470
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:46,640
Lock in a house, lock them in a house with Ed. That's a good answer. Ed and his jackhammer.

1471
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:50,000
All right, fair enough. They have to go live with Ed. There was one last bit to the email. Oh,

1472
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,080
this is, is this the official last email? Yes, there was one last bit to the same email. Oh,

1473
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:58,640
one last bit to the same email. This email was brought to you by Yummy Delicious Bacon. Bacon,

1474
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:05,360
all the things. Farmers of America are standing behind you. So that was it. Rageinator got the

1475
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:10,000
last email. There it is. Yep, last email. And he ended it with a thought on bacon.

1476
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:14,560
Very appropriate. Very appropriate. You know what? I finally had bacon jerky, Rob. Yeah,

1477
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:20,320
how was it? Oh my God, it was good. All right. Uh, well, anyhow, after a long, uh, I don't know

1478
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:25,360
what it's been like 12 years running, we are going to close a mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

1479
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:30,320
But you know, what is this show all about? What is the thing we ask you guys to do every week?

1480
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:34,720
What do we like to think kind of makes our show unique amongst all the podcasts out there?

1481
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:40,400
That keyword is participation. So the new email address to reach our show is

1482
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:45,120
participate at orangelaungeradio.com. But not precipitate.

1483
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:47,760
Yes. Not to be confused. Because we don't want you to rain.

1484
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:52,320
So the new email address to reach us and you can email us so we can read the comments next week.

1485
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:57,360
Email us at participate at orangelaungeradio.com. There you go.

1486
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:02,480
All right. So, uh, let's get to the FUs of the week because, uh,

1487
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:10,160
not only do we invite your participation, but we also invite our anger.

1488
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:29,440
So, um, my FU goes to dermatitis, which, um, I normally get dermatitis on my hands.

1489
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:33,920
Um, usually if I've been using car soap or things, you know, but I've gotten into something else I'm

1490
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:39,680
allergic to because now I've broken out like basically from the nose down to, um, the bottom

1491
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:44,080
of my neck. And I don't know what I had, but it had to have been something I've eaten because I

1492
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:48,400
only break out like that when I've eaten something I'm not supposed to have. And I can't remember

1493
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:52,720
what it is. Although I did actually eat a piece of cheese that had sneaky red bell pepper in it.

1494
02:15:52,720 --> 02:16:00,480
And that made me sick too. So I know it's not kosher, but it's delicious. Uh, low key.

1495
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:06,640
Uh, if he was really tall and really low bars and flappy bugs, I can't get past them.

1496
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:11,840
That's when they're right. Um, here's a, here's a tip. Right. Click will dive.

1497
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:16,480
Yeah. Dive usually ends up being die. Yeah, that's true. It's it's tough,

1498
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:20,720
but that's, that's the only way you can do it. All right. Um, let's see my, a few of the week,

1499
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:24,720
I don't have a lot of anxious cause you know, I'm going to be moving into a place that's twice

1500
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:29,440
as big and that makes me so flipping happy. You guys don't even know, but F you to moving.

1501
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:35,760
What a pain in the ass that's going to be, but we'll get through it. So that's my, a few of the

1502
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:41,840
week. Uh, Lisa, what was I going to say? Flaco Jones is closer now. Yeah, I know. Flaco. Flaco

1503
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:45,280
Jones was supposed to be here a couple of weeks ago, but he got sick. So he wasn't able to be

1504
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:50,800
here. And I think, uh, seg is going to be with us live and in person. I think he's here next week.

1505
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:55,120
It might've been two weeks, but I know he's here before the move. He'll probably be our last guest

1506
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:59,760
in this studio and then we're going to move, but I expect that Flaco will be meeting us in the new

1507
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:05,680
place. Uh, pretty early on had a great suggestion. What's that virtual boy gaming session for geek

1508
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:10,000
torture. Oh, he'll have to play the Oculus rift legend of Zelda and beat it. That could be the

1509
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:14,480
torture. All right. Anyway. Um, let's get into a couple more news stories for you guys and we'll

1510
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:20,080
get to, uh, phone calls, uh, orange lounge radio on Skype, all one word or one eight seven seven

1511
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:25,600
game OLR. But first we do have a couple quick stories for you guys. So there is a possibility

1512
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:34,160
that final fantasy 15 will be out on PC as well as next gen platforms, which makes kind of sense

1513
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:39,280
because they're going to be probably building it on PC anyways. And those two systems are very

1514
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:45,440
PC friendly. It's very easy to port to it. So as they're saying, you know, um, you know,

1515
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:50,240
let's not forget when we developed the final fantasy 13 series, all three titles at early

1516
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:55,280
development were working on PC and then we had to port it to consoles as far as technology is

1517
02:17:55,280 --> 02:18:00,160
concerned, it would have been possible for us to make a PC version, but we decided against it for

1518
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:04,800
two reasons. We looked at the market situation and we didn't think it would be a good idea. Also,

1519
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:09,760
also, um, it would have involved a lot of complex issues like security. So we decided

1520
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:14,800
not to do it this time around, but you know, they see the potential and, you know,

1521
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:19,920
there's countries where that would be very, um, very popular. Plus they just

1522
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:24,400
released final fantasy seven and eight and they've been doing pretty well. So maybe

1523
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:30,400
well, I am following fantasy 14, I believe is doing all right for him on PC. Although

1524
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:33,840
certainly it's very well received on consoles as well. So, uh, yeah,

1525
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:39,440
I think final fantasy 15 on PC would make sense. Um, I would see it as like a version that comes

1526
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:44,560
out a year or two later, maybe with DLC bundled in or something, but I could see it as something

1527
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:50,080
that's going to happen. Oh God, DLC and final fantasy 15. Like I'm saying it cause y'all know,

1528
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:57,520
it's going to happen. They've been dipping their toe in with 13, two and lightning returns. So

1529
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,400
by the way, our chatters say hi to your cat Loki.

1530
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:07,280
She's being an asshole because she wants to go out in the garage and I'm not gonna let her.

1531
02:19:08,720 --> 02:19:12,960
Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. One more story I've got for you guys. And it's about

1532
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:18,880
NES remix. You know, um, the first game was, was okay. It was kind of one of those things where

1533
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:22,880
it was a great concept, but some of the games that were included with it were kind of suck,

1534
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:26,640
but, uh, it looks like the games that are going to be in NES remix too, are going to be a whole

1535
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:33,360
lot better. Um, let's see here if I can get to the notes there. Uh, some of the games are talking

1536
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:39,360
about there that are going to be in NES remix too are Kirby, um, Metroid, Super Mario brothers,

1537
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:45,840
two Zelda, two punch out and so on. So there's a lot. Um, what they're also talking about in

1538
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:52,240
the game is that there's going to be, um, a mode that actually does three rapid fire levels in

1539
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:58,320
different NES games using the scoring system from the 1990 Nintendo world championships.

1540
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:03,600
Now, if I remember right, that cartridge had Tetris and rad racer in it, which I won't expect

1541
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:08,240
to see in this because of the Tetris licensing and the fact that rad racer was a square game.

1542
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:13,520
But, um, they're going to set up competitions like that from these other NES games. That's

1543
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:19,200
going to be really cool. Um, also there's a mode called championship mode. I think this is that

1544
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:23,600
same mode. I I'm assuming because it is modeled off the world championships, but the mode will

1545
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:31,040
require the first NES remix game. So we are going to see modes that integrate the two versions.

1546
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:35,040
That's going to be very interesting. Did you see the one though that it combined like different

1547
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:40,640
games together? Like they had one that was like, um, I think it was like adventure of link and they

1548
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:47,680
had, um, the booze chasing after him. Uh, they did kind of some things like this in NES remix one

1549
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:52,720
though, like you would play as link in donkey Kong, which was very annoying because link can't

1550
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:58,400
jump. Um, but it was kind of like, I think it was more of like, uh, they tried it a little bit and

1551
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:02,880
now they're taking it a step further. So it sounds like any S remix two will be a whole lot better.

1552
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:07,360
So, uh, we'll see. It's going to be very interesting. So, um, that is going to be out soon

1553
02:21:07,360 --> 02:21:13,920
of note in Japan. They're actually going to get this as one bundle. Uh, Famicom remix one plus

1554
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:19,920
two is going to come out as a game on store shelves on April 24th is when that's going to

1555
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:26,640
come out. So, uh, that's pretty cool. Famicom remix one plus two in Japan on store shelves,

1556
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:37,760
uh, April 24th for it looks like a 28 58 yen. Neat. All right. Uh, let's get to the calls.

1557
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:41,760
That's it. We're going to open up the Skype line over. Oh shit. No, we're not because I don't even

1558
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:46,560
have the Loki. You need to buy me time with the last minute story. I forgot to turn on the

1559
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:52,640
Skype line. I'm so embarrassed. So there's a new mod that they're working on for Arma three. That's

1560
02:21:52,640 --> 02:22:00,000
um, basically adding dinosaurs in there. So they have some, uh, Arma three test animation for a

1561
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:06,480
T-Rex running around and I guess it was to be like Jurassic park or something. Um, but Hey dinosaur,

1562
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:11,920
I would love to see like a, a daisy type thing, but with dinosaurs instead of zombies,

1563
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:19,440
that'd be a pretty creepy. Um, let's see what else here.

1564
02:22:22,480 --> 02:22:28,480
I have no idea. You know what, speaking of that, uh, retro, um, the Nintendo remix thing,

1565
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:34,640
I can totally see them doing that and releasing that over here as well to pad the first party

1566
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:38,880
content that they're releasing. So they can use that as an excuse to eat their stuff coming out

1567
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:46,080
on, you know, with a Wii U. It's not just nothing. Um, Skype lines open. Sorry guys. I totally

1568
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:50,320
screwed that up. Uh, but yes, Skype lines should be open. Am I actually signed in? Oh no, it says

1569
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:54,560
we're offline. Let me fix that. I don't like using the iPad for this sometimes. All right,

1570
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:59,600
now we're good to go. One eight seven seven game of LR or username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

1571
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:03,840
Thank you chat room for razzing me over that. I'm not used to the iPad thing.

1572
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:11,280
Loki, I miss you. Max's studio. No, it's fine. All right. Uh, was there any other

1573
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:17,120
last minute stories that you had? Uh, that's it. Let me go to some Twitter topics while we wait

1574
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:22,320
for some calls over at orange lounge radio on Skype. I know there were just a couple

1575
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:32,000
Twitter topics for me to get to. Um, twitter.com slash O L R is the place where you can follow us.

1576
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:40,240
And let's see. Um, sir, sort, I always mispronounce this name and I'm so sorry buddy,

1577
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:47,440
but it's Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Surtur. Sends us a tweet

1578
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:52,960
that says, is Loki O L R ever going to get a decent microphone headset? Well, I think we talked

1579
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:56,800
about that a little bit earlier in the show. You sound a lot better tonight. There's, there's not

1580
02:23:56,800 --> 02:24:00,320
like the fidgetiness that we had last week. I don't hear that tonight. So that's good.

1581
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:06,480
So we will get Loki back in studio soon, but you guys, he just had a baby. You guys, you guys.

1582
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:15,440
It's a Sony, uh, was it a PlayStation 3 stereo headset? Oh, is it? I didn't know that. Yeah.

1583
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:21,760
That's great. All right. Um, we have another tweet here from SSG100 Matt who, uh, sends us,

1584
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:28,000
I've seen a lot about this, uh, the past couple of days. Netflix agrees to pay Comcast for direct,

1585
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:33,040
in other words, non throttled connection. This doesn't set a good precedence. Yeah.

1586
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:37,120
Apparently Netflix and Comcast reached an agreement where Netflix is going to get,

1587
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:41,360
you know, their bandwidth won't be, you know, a lot of people were worried that, uh, with the

1588
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:46,240
whole net neutrality falling through that Comcast would start blocking Netflix. But I think something

1589
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:51,200
even worse has happened where now Netflix is paying up to get the preferential treatment.

1590
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:57,840
This sucks. I, I, I, this is not good news. I'm sorry. I mean, I like my Netflix too. And,

1591
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:01,600
you know, they shouldn't have to be paying for it. There should not be an agreement reached.

1592
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:07,360
Where's net neutrality? Well, something actually came out from, um, you know, cause the whole, uh,

1593
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:12,720
uh, I actually have the email somewhere in here, but they, uh, the white house actually did release

1594
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:20,480
a response. Um, to invest, uh, about investigating. I just have to, uh, stop a moment and actually

1595
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:24,720
look through it cause I didn't read the email all the way through. Well, but that's that good.

1596
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:30,480
They do need to get involved and maybe, maybe com I think there's, I think Comcast is agreeing to do

1597
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:35,840
this because somebody is going to bring up antitrust on Comcast because Comcast is trying

1598
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:41,360
to buy time Warner and somebody was going to use Netflix as leverage that will Comcast prefers

1599
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:45,680
their own movie services. So this is why they cock block Netflix. Well, now that they have

1600
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:48,960
this agreement in place, no, they're not going to be able to say that when the antitrust lawsuit

1601
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:55,200
comes down. Yeah. So I just, this makes me very nervous. I don't like this whatsoever. Um,

1602
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:59,680
SSJ100 Matt says, who's to say that your favorite site or app won't attempt to cut back features

1603
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:05,680
to avoid bandwidth overages and being throttled. You guys, they might come for your flappy vog and

1604
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,600
then what are you going to do? What are you going to do when they come for flappy vog people?

1605
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:14,320
What are you going to do? This is why we need net neutrality. I would still think that they would

1606
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:19,440
see that as preferential since they have to pay to get past that, you know, blockage.

1607
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:23,040
So I don't think it's really changed anything. If they all of a sudden said, Hey, yeah, we're not

1608
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:28,080
going to, you know, throttle you guys then yeah, that could be a little bit more, you know, ammo

1609
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:32,960
for the whole defense that, Oh, we're preferring one service over another and the antitrust and

1610
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:38,000
stuff like that. SSJ100 Matt says Twitch is in trouble. Oh, you know, it Twitch is in big

1611
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:45,120
trouble. I just, Oh, I hate, I hate it. It's so irritating to tell me, tell me where I've got to

1612
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:50,320
go pick it at and I'm there. All right. Uh, Obiwan jabroni sends us a tweet twitter.com slash OLR

1613
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:55,920
saying a Georgia teen holding a Nintendo Wii controller was shot by police. Good Lord. Did

1614
02:26:55,920 --> 02:27:00,560
you guys hear about this? Where I guess the teen was, let me see if I can get to the actual story,

1615
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:05,440
but the teen was holding like a Nintendo Wii controller and it was, uh, you know,

1616
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:09,920
in a threatening manner, I suppose. And he was shot by police because they thought it was a gun,

1617
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:15,680
I guess. Was that the zapper? I don't believe it was the zapper and I'm sure it wasn't the zapper

1618
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:21,280
cause no one owns that. According to his attorney, he did nothing more than answer the door while

1619
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:26,560
holding a controller of a Nintendo Wii. The kid lived? Uh, that's coming from the guy's attorney.

1620
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:34,080
Let's see. Um, I'm trying to know, uh, officer Faily shot the teen. I, I'm sorry. That's hitting

1621
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:42,400
way too many plan to join the Marines after he finished school. No, no witnesses. Sorry. No

1622
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:46,560
witnesses reported seeing the boy holding any weapons. Authorities won't say whether a weapon

1623
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:54,240
was found on the scene. So that's just, I mean, again, this really doesn't have anything to do

1624
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:59,360
with games though. I mean, yeah, it was a wiimote, but that is kind of inconsequential. It just has

1625
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:08,240
to do more with, uh, abuse of power and basically living in a military state these days. Again,

1626
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:14,000
uh, Orange Launch Radio on Skype, all one word or 1-877-GAME-OLR. I thought I saw a call come

1627
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:18,960
through, but I was in the middle of my rant and I missed it. Sorry. Uh, act-dev tweets us and says,

1628
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:24,640
uh, a dev promises steam keys if his game got greenlit, but he doesn't deliver on promise and

1629
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:30,160
links us to a NeoGaf thread. So there's your disclaimer right there, but, uh, I don't see why

1630
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:36,080
this would be, uh, illegitimate. Uh, what was the game for greenlit? Uh, the game was called Zombies,

1631
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:45,440
which was getting a name change to corporate lifestyle simulator. Sorry. That is pretty funny.

1632
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:51,520
Um, he made a greenlight promise apparently is that, um, you promise steam keys for all those

1633
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:55,680
who have previously purchased the game. It's a great way to boost votes and ultimately get

1634
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:02,000
your game on steam. Um, and apparently the game was greenlit and now the dev is backtracking.

1635
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:08,560
There was a tweet that said, um, no site has ever agreed to provide me that list and I'm unwilling

1636
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:14,000
to randomly give them thousands of keys because of new content and changes from the original game.

1637
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,880
Steam keys will not be given out for anyone who bought zombies. And then there was an update,

1638
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:27,840
more tweets. Um, wow. It sounds like he had a Twitter meltdown. We all love these. Uh,

1639
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:31,520
there are a lot of scumbags out there and basically they win zombies will be released

1640
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:35,840
on steam. You'll get your keys. That pretty much does it for my career in making games.

1641
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:40,640
I promise keys to no one. The bundles did my contract state. Absolutely nothing about keys.

1642
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:44,000
I wouldn't assign them if they did. Of course, this is a business and I want sales,

1643
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:48,240
but understand that I'm now giving away free copies of the game, having never agreed to do so.

1644
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:55,760
So anyways, now my iPad locked and I can see people are trying to call and I can't get to them.

1645
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:03,120
Yeah. Technology. There we go. Finally, finally I can hit the button and take a call. Hi, you're

1646
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:09,360
on orange launch radio. Who's this? It's Ron. And seriously, nobody's called in. I know. Well,

1647
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:14,160
I missed one other call, but, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's a little slower tonight. Who knows?

1648
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:18,400
Who knows? Uh, by the way, just some quick comments from the chat. Um, uh,

1649
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:22,720
Wade in the chat says that's the best name, corporate lifestyle simulator. I agree.

1650
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:27,120
You know, for no other purpose, I got to give the developer props for that. Um,

1651
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:32,400
nemesis 47 talking about the police and the Wiimote nemesis 47 says, I do normally support

1652
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:37,120
the police. I do normally support the police. This case, the cop was in the wrong and if proven,

1653
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:40,960
he'll serve his life in prison. Awesome unicorn says, I believe the cop was a female.

1654
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:45,440
She was serving some sort of warrant against the father and immediately realized her mistake and

1655
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:49,840
broke down. Not that that really changes what happened. So it's just still a,

1656
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:57,360
I think a horrible precedent that the first instinct is no matter. I mean,

1657
02:30:57,360 --> 02:31:01,200
the gender is inconsequential. It doesn't matter. Like none of that matters. The fact that matters

1658
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:06,960
is an innocent kid got shot and what allowed that to happen anyway? Sorry. Don't mean to take up

1659
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:11,840
your time Rama, but appreciate the call. You're like wearing a robe or something. You're well,

1660
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:17,280
it is later over there on the East coast. Well, yeah, cause I do have to get up at six

1661
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:22,080
30 in the morning for work. So it could be a smoking jacket. Okay. Is that your smoking jacket?

1662
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:31,840
Depends on what smoking is, you know, you stay up till four 20. All right. I always do.

1663
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:39,120
Um, what else was going to ask you? Oh, the year of Luigi ending on March 18th. Are you,

1664
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:43,520
are you, are you okay? Do you, do you. I'm fine with it. Here,

1665
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:48,640
Luigi is going to go out with a blast for me because that's one of the reasons why I called in.

1666
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:54,480
Please tell us, uh, please explain what, what, uh, what's the reason for your call tonight?

1667
02:31:55,280 --> 02:32:00,240
Well, ever since the whole black Luigi thing went up and running, I decided to work it for

1668
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:07,600
what it's worth. So at cats con, I decided to debut a brand new cosplay. I can't think I have

1669
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:15,520
any pictures of it, but I will put it together for photos. I decided to do Dr. Luigi. It's very

1670
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:19,760
topical too, because Dr. Luigi of course was released on Wii U not that long ago. So I mean,

1671
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:25,120
it makes sense. Yes. I thought I saw a picture of you as that somewhere. It was, it was awesome.

1672
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:31,600
Might be, but this is what I did. I did these a little bit differently. What I did was I walked

1673
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:39,040
around with my clipboard and a big box full of chocolates and gummy bears and this and that.

1674
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:45,440
So every time I ran to any female cosplayers or whatever, I handed them chocolates and candies.

1675
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:49,600
I said, here is a chocolate prescription Valentine from the good doctor.

1676
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:54,480
Look at you trying to get some phone numbers. Look at you.

1677
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:57,840
He could have been just being a gentleman.

1678
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:01,920
Okay. Rob, have you been spying on my phone lately?

1679
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:07,760
Bitch, I already know.

1680
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:18,480
Also that night, you know, the big thing now with conventions is they're having

1681
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:22,160
formals on Friday night. So I'm like, you know what? I'll throw something together.

1682
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:28,240
I did a classic vintage Luigi. Yeah. We're talking the overalls and everything.

1683
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:33,040
No more 20 seconds. Hold on for one second. Actually, let me see if I can grab it real quick.

1684
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:38,480
Oh God. I love that I can get the visual here. Thanks to Skype. Apologies to the, uh, uh, you

1685
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:42,480
know, everybody else basically, cause it is a radio show, but I'll try to describe it for you guys.

1686
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:47,360
So, Oh, like a little, that's like a little pimp hat with the little Luigi mark.

1687
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:54,400
Stripes suit and everything. And on the lapel of my, of my jacket,

1688
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:57,200
instead of a normal flower had a nice little orange fire flower.

1689
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:00,160
Wait, hold that hat up again. Nice.

1690
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:03,920
Yeah. Dark soccer. I wanted to see it and I wanted to snap a picture of it. Thank you.

1691
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:09,360
Say that over YouTube. I actually later actually send you to an actual picture of me in a full

1692
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:16,560
outfit. Cause it was that I had a nice white, um, scarf with my name Luigi monogrammed on the side,

1693
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:20,320
you know, and I'm pulling, I'm standing there and was like, you look like a gangster of like,

1694
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:23,680
well, that's the thing that's kind of going for it is gangster.

1695
02:34:24,320 --> 02:34:28,800
I love, I love the idea of a dapper Luigi. That's very, uh, it's very awesome.

1696
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:32,960
And here, here's the best part that I'm going to get out of here. I'm on the line for the

1697
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:36,960
masquerade. No, for the formal. And there's two guys just as Mario and Luigi. And I walk

1698
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:41,920
over to them. I'm like, this is nice to meet you. I'm from the Northeast part of the mushroom

1699
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:50,560
kingdom. Don peach sends me down here to collect payment because the coins have been a little light

1700
02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:54,080
lately. And they're like, we're good. It's no problem. We'll take care of it. I'm like,

1701
02:34:54,080 --> 02:35:00,480
well, good because you don't want the Don to come down here with her giant hammer.

1702
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:09,200
I love it. They said it was the best thing the whole week that they came across. I'm like,

1703
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:13,360
I try. That's awesome. Well, I hope you find a dapper peach to go to the next con with.

1704
02:35:13,360 --> 02:35:19,120
So working on it, working on it. Sounds good. All right, buddy. Thanks so much for the call.

1705
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:24,240
And, uh, you can always look forward to, uh, Ramas cosplay and, uh, anime con wrap-ups over at

1706
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:30,480
anime jam session Tuesday nights here on vog one year running. Yeah. We actually talked about that.

1707
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:36,240
I know. I know. I know. All right. All right. Take care, buddy. All right. You too, bro. All right.

1708
02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:40,080
Bye. All right. Thanks so much to our Rama for the call. Appreciate that. One eight seven seven

1709
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:44,400
game OLR username on Skype is orange lounge radio. We can probably squeeze in about one more call

1710
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:48,560
here. Um, actually for some weird reason tonight, we do have like a ton of tweets though. Like we

1711
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:52,480
usually don't get this many tweets, but I'm okay with that. Oh, well, the Skype lines burning up

1712
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:57,120
again. So we're going to go over to it and take some more calls in the Skype line. Hello. You're

1713
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:02,720
on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, this is act deaf. Hey, how you doing buddy? Really good.

1714
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:09,280
Really good. Enjoying my top scores on flappy vog. You're really great on that. You are dominating

1715
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:16,000
in flappy vog. They should just call the game flappy deft because act flappy act act. Oh my

1716
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:24,640
God. I think that's your new name act flappy. No, I did at least for a night. All right. Act flappy.

1717
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:31,200
What's the trick to high scores in flappy vog. Well, I actually did a stream of it yesterday.

1718
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:37,200
Bobby talked about it on his show. Yeah. And yeah, I was talking about, uh, a strategy

1719
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:44,080
I use for flappy vog and pretty much almost every flappy bird clone out there, uh, it's have a

1720
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:50,160
rhythm. Yeah. That's basically it. So yeah, you have, you have to have, uh, how to get a rhythm

1721
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:57,040
going. So it's basically a steady click. And I was talking, uh, saying yesterday in the stream, uh,

1722
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:01,760
about that because some of the walls, uh, really changed the pattern and,

1723
02:37:02,480 --> 02:37:07,200
and it gets really difficult, especially with the, with the speed increasing. Yep. So yeah,

1724
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:12,800
it gets really hard, uh, on the later, later scores or later, uh, later walls. Yeah. Do you,

1725
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:16,400
do you know when I first played the game, I told Bobby, this is too easy. And then he told me,

1726
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:20,960
did you notice the speed increases? And I was like, Oh, that's why I keep ending at a certain

1727
02:37:20,960 --> 02:37:25,760
point. I was like, the scores I'm getting are too high every time. And he's like, yeah, it ends. Oh,

1728
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:29,120
okay. And then I noticed it and I was like, okay, yeah, this is going to screw people up when they

1729
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:36,240
get too far. So yeah, the first, uh, probably 40 levels or three walls, you don't notice that the,

1730
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:42,320
the speed increasing after that you'll notice it. And by 60, it, it increases really,

1731
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:48,400
really rapidly by 80 and even 100. It gets crazy. I can't even believe you broke a hundred. That's

1732
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:52,080
crazy. Well, here's the question I've got to ask you about flappy vog is, is who's your favorite

1733
02:37:52,080 --> 02:38:01,440
character? Oh God, I love them all. Uh, they're all great. And I really cannot choose. Of course.

1734
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:10,400
Character pack, uh, that was released today. Uh, I do, I love the grandpa's.

1735
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:20,000
Yeah. And you said it on Bobby then it's because the, uh, how he says it, like he wants to,

1736
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:28,000
to do something like really, uh, at least, uh, be more enthusiastic, but he has like a release.

1737
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:34,960
Uh, I don't want to disturb another people, another person that, yeah, it's, it's hilarious.

1738
02:38:34,960 --> 02:38:42,720
It's hilarious. I like vodka. Yeah. Any I'm going, I'm going to get the nastiest text message from

1739
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:46,960
grandpa tomorrow. I already know, but, but Hey, you know what people, people are loving it. People

1740
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:51,280
are loving it. By the way, Alan, Alan alchemy is in chat saying such a diplomatic answer for

1741
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:56,960
Mac Deft. What a cop out. No, I S that's, we love, we love diplomatic cop out answers. You did,

1742
02:38:56,960 --> 02:39:05,040
you did call out grandpa. So that's, I'll say that. So, uh, that, well, and in other,

1743
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:12,240
in other stuff, uh, well, uh, have you seen the, the newest humble bundle? I have. I'm pretty sure

1744
02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:16,480
you have talked about it. Yeah. We, we brought it up a little earlier in the show in rapid fire news,

1745
02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:23,280
but it's, it's great. Obviously, you know, Guacamelee right there is the, the, the whole

1746
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:27,280
reason to get the pat in my opinion. But I mean, there's lots of other great games there too, but

1747
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:31,920
the fact that they're also cheap, I mean, and for a good cause you can have it all go to charity.

1748
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:39,120
It's great. Heck I, I own four, uh, four of the six games on there and I still bought it because

1749
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:45,520
it's a really great value and the games are, are really good. Dust. I love dust. Everybody

1750
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:50,320
should play that. Get the bundle and play that first. Then play Guacamelee, then play the rest.

1751
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:56,000
The rest of the games are really awesome. Also Antichamber. It's a really weird game. Uh, if you

1752
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:03,680
like portal and NASA trips, that's the game for you. All right. Very cool. Well, um, anything else

1753
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:08,960
on your mind tonight, buddy? Well, that's all. Uh, I, I maybe do another stream. I'm happy

1754
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:16,560
about, uh, night. So, uh, possibly that. All right. Well hopefully Comcast won't shut Twitch

1755
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:22,000
down tonight. Uh, but check that out. Act F stream of flappy vog. Love it. That's great.

1756
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:26,160
And a Black Wolf saying in chat next week's character pack will be the last. So, you know,

1757
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:30,160
as much as this has been dominating the talk of the show the past couple of weeks,

1758
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:35,920
we know when a joke needs to die. We know when Ed needs to go home and get, be put out to pasture.

1759
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:41,920
So, and even, and even then the game will still be, uh, still be there and still be fun. So

1760
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:45,840
exactly. That's a great way to look at it. Act F. Thank you very much. All right, buddy. I'm

1761
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:48,960
going to let you go so we can try to sneak in one more call to have a good one. Okay, buddy.

1762
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:54,240
Hey, thanks for having me. All right. Thanks. Bye. All right. That was Act F to everybody. And,

1763
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:58,960
uh, we're going to go to the phones one more time. Uh, take one more call. I see a couple

1764
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:03,760
calls trying to get through. So, uh, try again now that Act F is off the line. 1-877-GAMO-LR

1765
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:10,640
or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Uh, I had one, I had one more tweet here. Oh,

1766
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:13,520
I guess I'm never going to get to this tweet because we're getting one more call,

1767
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:18,000
but that's okay. I don't mind taking more calls here. We'll get to the tweets a little later.

1768
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:22,480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, this is For the Fallen Dreams from North

1769
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:26,800
Carolina. Hey, For the Fallen Dreams. I recognize your name from, uh, chat and emails and all that.

1770
02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:32,080
What's up, buddy? Not much, man. Yeah, I'm not in chat much just because, you know, the east coast

1771
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:36,800
and it's getting close to midnight now, but, uh, I had some extra time, so I thought I'd call in

1772
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:43,200
and just say, you know, what's up. Also kind of wanted to get some, uh, input, uh, from y'all on

1773
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:49,520
a particular subject. Like, I'm kind of getting back into building up a PC and getting into the

1774
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:54,960
PC gaming scene because it's kind of been on and off for me. You know, sometimes I'm a console

1775
02:41:54,960 --> 02:42:00,000
gamer for a couple years and I'm PC. My question kind of is for y'all, you know, what's the deciding

1776
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:04,560
factor, um, if you're going to get a game, you know, what are some deciding factors if you're

1777
02:42:04,560 --> 02:42:09,920
going to get a game on console or if you're going to go for it on PC? Because I know a lot of times

1778
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:16,960
it's, it's compatibility. It's, you know, do I want to play it with friends? Um, you know, just

1779
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:22,000
what plays better on PC version or console? I'm just kind of curious as to what your input is on

1780
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:26,160
that. That's a great question. What goes into the decision if you're going to get a game? And I'm

1781
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:31,120
going to pose this to our chat room as well. I'm going to, uh, pose this chat. Um, what goes into

1782
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:37,680
a decision for you to buy something on a computer or PC versus, versus buying it on console if you

1783
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:42,960
have both and things are available for both? Um, I think certainly you hit on a big one about where

1784
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:48,560
your friends are playing. Um, I was playing Mass Effect 3 on Xbox and I bought the PC version just

1785
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:52,560
so I could play multiplayer with friends. Granted, I waited for a sale, but that was a big thing with

1786
02:42:52,560 --> 02:42:59,600
it. Dark Sakura? Um, for me, it's, is it on PC? Yeah. Okay. I'm getting that one. So you always

1787
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:04,640
default to PC. Why? Because of my hand. I have a hard time with controller. I mean, I use an

1788
02:43:04,640 --> 02:43:10,240
Xbox controller to play Skullgirls, but if I have an option to play with keyboard and mouse, um,

1789
02:43:10,240 --> 02:43:14,960
it hurts my hand less because I have a thumb track ball. Right. So that's easier for me. Well, I was

1790
02:43:14,960 --> 02:43:19,760
going to say that control is a big thing too. Controller versus keyboard and mouse, um, has

1791
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:23,120
always, you know, historically gone into the decision, which, you know, do you prefer for

1792
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:27,440
first person shooters and some, some of those types of games, uh, and a game like Diablo 3,

1793
02:43:27,440 --> 02:43:31,360
which I talked about earlier, plays very differently depending on which you, you know,

1794
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:35,680
way you want to do it. So you have to kind of weigh that decision. Um, although the worlds

1795
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:40,320
are coming closer together, Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation 4 allows you to use keyboard and mouse.

1796
02:43:40,320 --> 02:43:44,800
It's like playing the PC version. There's also the customization thing like for games that are

1797
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:50,960
eventually moddable and hackable, like all of the bajillion mods I have for Skyrim or, um, all of

1798
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:57,520
the mods I've personally done for Mass Effect 3. So you haven't modded Skyrim enough unless you

1799
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:03,440
have the engines from Thomas the Tank in there. No, I'm not going to do that because I would

1800
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:08,080
actually like to play the game. I like the, uh, one where it turns the big dragons into Macho Man.

1801
02:44:08,080 --> 02:44:14,000
Oh yeah. That's my favorite. Every time I think that's a big seller. Um, just the fact that so

1802
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:18,720
many different types of mods come out on PC as opposed to console. I mean, they both have their

1803
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:24,720
pros and cons, but for me, that is a big selling point is, is, you know, what mods are available

1804
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:31,200
for it. You know, like with, uh, ARMA, you had a mod called DayZ, which got so much attention that

1805
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:36,960
it's now in its standalone alpha stages. Um, that's a great point is do you want to mod it,

1806
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:41,040
but on the, on the flip side, just to stick up for consoles a little bit with consoles,

1807
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:45,680
you know, sometimes the fact that you can't mod it actually ends up being a good thing. And I'm

1808
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:50,080
speaking more about more the bench line that, you know, you know, when a game's going to play

1809
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:53,440
on console, it's going to be smooth and you're not going to run into any of those issues. Like,

1810
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:57,840
didn't you say Dark Soccer, when you're trying to do Strider on like Dan's one PC, it wouldn't work.

1811
02:44:58,480 --> 02:45:04,720
Which he was dumb and had it hooked up to his, uh, three monitor rig, which he already had the

1812
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:09,120
resolution set for three monitors. So it's his own fault for not hooking it up to a single monitor.

1813
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:15,680
Right. I think they all also, another pro that consoles have is just that seamless interface

1814
02:45:15,680 --> 02:45:19,440
you have, you know, when you get that game, you've got that disc, you pop it in the console,

1815
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:26,720
it's going to run. Most of the frame rate issues are taken care of with, right, right. But you

1816
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:32,400
know, on PC, there is a bit of, of Twinkie tweak, excuse me, tweaking and tinkering that goes along

1817
02:45:32,400 --> 02:45:37,680
with it, which granted a lot of people see as a pro in itself, just because I mean, that's just,

1818
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:42,800
that's just the thing to do on PCs. Just, just tailor it to your needs, how you want the game

1819
02:45:42,800 --> 02:45:48,160
to play, how you want the game to look. And it is honestly addicting in and of itself. So, um,

1820
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:52,160
going to the chat room for some of their answers, uh, Shane Alinko says trophies.

1821
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:56,720
You don't necessarily have the whole achievement systems on PC, although steam kind of has that,

1822
02:45:56,720 --> 02:46:01,680
but I don't know, it's a little different between trophies and steam, uh, act deft and chat says

1823
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:07,280
console equals local multiplayer. Yeah. You'd never see a game like Mario 3d world done on PC.

1824
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:13,040
That's an experience that really can only be done on console. So that's, that's a true one. Um,

1825
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:17,520
let's see. Dungeon buster says if my PC would have run Skyrim, I would have gone that route.

1826
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:25,840
Instead I went console just to be able to play it. However, um, some, I actually did find that

1827
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:30,560
the interface for Skyrim being able to mod your interface, especially your menus,

1828
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:35,840
makes it far easier to play. Yeah. And Skyrim itself though, wasn't really, uh,

1829
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:43,440
for, you know, for a lot of, um, PC games, they'll have them be, uh, friendlier towards one card or

1830
02:46:43,440 --> 02:46:48,080
another, have them be optimized and Skyrim was released as I recall without any optimization

1831
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:54,320
for PC. Right. And that's just the thing, the ability to, you know, tailor a PC game to your

1832
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:59,200
needs, your play style, you know, like I was saying, how, how it looks is, is definitely one

1833
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:04,320
of the, one of the bigger pros of being PC grand. You have the cons, like, uh, sometimes you don't

1834
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:09,600
have it on graphics card, you got to upgrade, you've got to tweak. But, uh, yeah, to me,

1835
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:14,480
it's just like, I'm, I'm neither here nor there. Like as of recently, I'm, I'm in the stages of

1836
02:47:14,480 --> 02:47:21,200
building a PC. And that's just cause as of right now, never next gen consoles are actually current

1837
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:26,800
gen consoles rather, um, are really piquing my interest. You know, I, I take a look at it and

1838
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:31,680
I'm like, wow, you know, I could build a system with better specs than that. And, and, you know,

1839
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:36,000
also just on a side note, like certain games are just cheaper to, you know,

1840
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:40,480
go on the steam marketplace, download it, have it instantly as opposed to going out and buying

1841
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:45,120
it on this. There's definitely a lot to consider. And I think this is a great debate. That's going

1842
02:47:45,120 --> 02:47:49,600
to go on for a very long time. It won't be solved this generation, uh, for the fallen dreams. I got

1843
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:52,560
to let you go so I can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for calling into the show. Don't be a

1844
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:56,240
stranger. No worries. Thanks for staying up late. All right. Take care. All right. Take care, buddy.

1845
02:47:56,240 --> 02:48:00,400
Bye. I'm always impressed with you East coasters that, uh, listen to the live show. Cause I know

1846
02:48:00,400 --> 02:48:05,200
you guys have to stay up really late. Um, so thank you guys for doing that. Uh, anyhow,

1847
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:08,640
we are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line. I'm sorry. It's so funny. Like nobody called

1848
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:12,000
in at first. And then after the first call, it's like the dam broke and everybody was trying to

1849
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:15,520
call in. So I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, please consider emailing us,

1850
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:20,480
participate at orange laundry.com is our new mailbag where you can, um, send an email with

1851
02:48:20,480 --> 02:48:24,160
your thoughts. I did have one more tweet. I had been trying to get to this whole time

1852
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:27,920
for the record, by the way, we did pick up something for my computer today.

1853
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:35,440
We picked up, um, a new sound card. Oh, uh, sound blaster auto GFX. Nice. So that I can actually

1854
02:48:35,440 --> 02:48:40,960
start recording the, you know, what you hear stuff. Oh, okay. So somebody might be working

1855
02:48:40,960 --> 02:48:47,440
on a new podcast soon. Somebody might, I might be, I might, I need to get my old mic. All right. Uh,

1856
02:48:47,440 --> 02:48:51,600
tiger claw sends us the last tweet I'm going to do tonight where Sony pictures and the producer of

1857
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:58,640
the social network are planning a feature film about Sega versus Nintendo. And apparently there's

1858
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:03,200
a book out there called console Wars by Blake J. Harris that talks about Sega, Nintendo, and the

1859
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:06,800
back. I didn't even know this was a book. Now I kind of want to read it just cause I don't know.

1860
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:09,760
I like, I like reading these kinds of things, even though, you know, we all live through it,

1861
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:16,160
but yeah, Sony pictures, apparently, uh, doing this as a movie, calling it a behind the scenes

1862
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:22,720
business thriller. This could be interesting. Uh, Chronicles how Sega, a small scrappy gaming

1863
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:28,080
company led by an unlikely visionary and a team of team of rebels took on the juggernaut Nintendo

1864
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:33,600
and revolutionize the video game industry. Scrappy, scrappy, happy, scrappy. Yeah, but,

1865
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:40,160
um, wasn't it, there was that manga and the anime that came out from it. That's,

1866
02:49:40,160 --> 02:49:46,000
you know, loosely based on the Nintendo Sega wars, uh, second intuition day.

1867
02:49:46,880 --> 02:49:51,440
It's actually pretty funny. All right. Well, um, that's going to do it for the skyline and

1868
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:54,960
that's going to do it for the Twitter. Thank you guys so much for participating with us this week.

1869
02:49:54,960 --> 02:49:58,560
Uh, we are about ready to wrap things up though for the night. Uh, unless Loki,

1870
02:49:58,560 --> 02:50:01,440
I don't know if you had any other last minute stories, Loki, while we were doing those calls,

1871
02:50:01,440 --> 02:50:06,000
but, uh, no, no last minute stories other than the baby pooping on stuff.

1872
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:11,360
Oh, congratulations. They poop on everything. They poop on people. At least, you know,

1873
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:14,560
everything's working. It's like a bird. Yeah. At least you know, everything's working in there.

1874
02:50:14,560 --> 02:50:18,640
That's the sign. All right. Anyhow, it is time for us to wrap up the show because it is after

1875
02:50:18,640 --> 02:50:22,480
midnight for you folks on the East coast is time for us to say good night. I really want to thank

1880
02:50:37,360 --> 02:50:41,120

1881
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:45,520
really the motivation. So help us grow our family by telling a friend or two about the show and,

1882
02:50:45,520 --> 02:50:51,040
um, yeah, we'll be back next week to do it again. Um, also another way you can spread the word.

1883
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:55,200
If you don't have a lot of friends, you think would dig the show. We always can use nice

1884
02:50:55,200 --> 02:51:01,520
reviews on iTunes and Stitcher radio. Those go a long, long way in helping, uh, get our exposure

1885
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:05,520
amped up a little bit on both those sites. So please, please take five minutes to write a nice

1886
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:11,120
little review on either iTunes or Stitcher. It is so, so, uh, appreciated and love. Thank you very

1887
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:16,240
much. All right. Um, before we pull the plug on everything, let's go around and get everybody's

1888
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:20,000
final thought for tonight. Dark soccer. I'm going to start with you ladies first, your final thought

1889
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:27,360
for tonight. Itchy, scratchy, tasty, itchy, just itchy. It needs to stop. Don't you remember from

1890
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:37,440
long time ago? Itchy, ugly face. So shot him. Itchy, tasty. Uh, my final thought for the week

1891
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:42,720
or for, for tonight's show is I, I really need to stop fucking around and play more bravely default.

1892
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:47,120
It has been sitting on its butt for a week and I really need to, uh, not have that happen anymore.

1893
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:53,280
I'm saying Merger Gerger at myself, dark soccer tried to swipe the copy jokes on you. The game's

1894
02:51:53,280 --> 02:51:58,320
not in there. I think you'd get Pokemon X cause I'm, I'm that guy that puts the cartridges in the

1895
02:51:58,320 --> 02:52:05,440
wrong game cases. What is it? Pokemon Y. I don't even know what Pokemon I have. How sad is that?

1896
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:10,880
I have X, so it doesn't matter. All right. Uh, last but not least, Loki, your final thought

1897
02:52:10,880 --> 02:52:21,280
tonight. My final thought is my cat's being loud. Your cat's being what? Being loud. Give kitty

1898
02:52:21,280 --> 02:52:26,960
pettings from all of us here at OLR. That makes me want to go cuddle with Sanrio.

1899
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:32,800
