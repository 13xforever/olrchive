This week, our favorite gaming companies are strengthening their history with rumors of Sony bringing backwards compatibility to the PS4, Microsoft Studios taking ownership of Gears of War, and Nintendo bringing dual screen games to the console.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 538 for this February the 2nd of 2014. Happy Puppy Bowl Sunday everybody. It's a big big day today.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Kitten Bowl

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Kitten Bowl, Puppy Bowl. Hey, my name is Rob Roberts and that other voice you hear over there is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Sup bitches.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How you doing Jamie?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Um, feisty.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Were you really excited about all the big games going on today?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well yeah, I played some Mass Effect today and it was great.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's the only game you need right?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well yeah. Now that I've got text mod working.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There you go, there you go. So have you watched the Puppy Bowl or the Kitty Bowl yet and how did you choose?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, I didn't watch any but I've been looking at Tumblr and Tumblr has been taking care of it for me because then I can watch both through the power of animated gifs.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's true.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
GIFS!

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Who needs picture in picture and all that stuff anymore when you just have Twitter and it just tells you everything you need to know and Facebook and all that stuff.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well that and they were talking about the sports ball stuff in the front room and I felt my brain shutting down and my eyes glazing over and I had to leave.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We do tape live and if you're joining us live and skipping the big football game to listen to our show, first off thanks, we really appreciate it.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you are participating with us, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Loki is not here tonight, Techmaster Loki, as y'all know, they had a new baby a couple weeks ago, Loki and Mrs. Loki, so he is still off on baby leave.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He'll be back soon, we don't know if he'll be back next week or the week after.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Jason has been filling in a lot lately but he is also not here tonight because of course the Super Bowl stuff going on, he decided to go to a party and he's earned it.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He comes here from San Francisco which is quite the drive every week or so.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But, you know what, because I know a lot of you are distracted with the big game going on, I got a few stunts up my own sleeve here on how we can have ourselves a heck of a show here on the Big Puppy Bowl Sunday.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So we've got some special guests in studio, one of them I told you was going to be here and he is here in the house, he hasn't been on Orange Lawn's radio in a very long time.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But you might know of him from his frequent phone calls to the show or his time on Horde House.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Everybody say hello to Shane.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hello.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How you doing Shane?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm okay, my old co-worker needs some contact information for work.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Wait, so you're having to work during the show, you haven't come to the show in five years and you want to work during the show?

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The mic is really fuzzy.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, because I have a cat, I don't know what to tell you.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, just real quick, you can keep talking, I'll pretend I'm listening.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Alright, so what brings you out here to California? You're visiting from Kansas, why do you live in Kansas?

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because it's where I live.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Alright, well you're out here in California, why?

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
An airplane took me here.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay, that's a very good answer.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What are you here to plug or promote these days? Do you have like a Twitter or something? I don't know.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What egotistical way should you promote yourself today?

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't know. I don't plug anything. I plug my ears when I'm listening to this show or Horde House.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hey, hey, watch it, watch it.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He plugs in his charger.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Fine, then you know what, we're going to move on.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Shane, believe it or not, I don't know how, but has fans in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
SJ100matt says, yay Shane. Tigerclaw says, well Shane's got to pay them bills so he has to work no matter what.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, alright, fine, we'll check back in with you later.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I do have some other guests here in studio tonight, this is very exciting.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I promised some big stunts for Puppy Bowl Sunday and I can't think of a bigger stunt than this guy I'm about to introduce.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Everybody say hello to, from the Horde House podcast, Extafur is here live in studio.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh hello there Rob.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hello Extafur.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hello.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How are you doing?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm doing fantastic. How are you doing?

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm better now that you're here and that you're a part of Orange Lawns Radio officially.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You haven't been on this show in a very long time. I know we've lived together.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's been perhaps seven years?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's been about that long.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, it's been a long time.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Ever since Orange Lawns Radio was its own network and we had Extafur's case of the Mondays.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Right.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So, what have you been up to for the last seven years?

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, you know, getting fat, getting skinny, then getting fat again, then getting skinny again. You know, I'm Oprah. That's what I'm saying.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, for the listeners who don't know, you did lose a lot of weight. You lost what, like 120 some odd pounds?

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
She lost a supermodel.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I was at 1.335 pounds and I was down to 195 at one point.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And it all happened because my doctor said I was high cholesterol.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And because my liver enzymes are too high, I had to do it by myself. I had to diet by myself.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I couldn't rely on any gimmicks or medications or anything like that.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I just kicked my ass and I went to the gym and I grew this passion for the gym.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So now I regularly go. I try to go at least five times a week. And I love it. Are you guys hearing me?

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, no, you're fine. The gym is the best thing ever.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Once you get hooked on going, then you really get hooked on going.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes, and it's good to have a habit. Build the habit of going. And I'm just loving it. So that's my...

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now, since this is a program about video games and video gaming and all that stuff, did you use any of the Wii Fit or any of the technology stuff?

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, but I do have a Fitbit.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you?

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Me too.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have the Fitbit Flex, the one that you wear on your wrist.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have the one that you put on your pants.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, my sister has that one. She puts it in her bra.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Me too, when you guys aren't here.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I believe you. I really enjoy the Fitbit. I haven't worn it in a little while because after the move I think I misplaced it.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We just moved into our own house.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And so anyways, yeah, but it's good. I don't rely on gimmicks like that though. I didn't use Wii Fit.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I train with a trainer and I actually last year, like in September, decided that I wanted to do a program to learn to become a personal trainer myself.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So I tried to stick with that. I kind of fell off the bandwagon about October and it's taken me a lot of energy to try and get back on that.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But I'm hoping that once I regain my focus and everything that I can pick that right back up again and finish it.

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, you look like you're doing fine to me.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you.

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're welcome. So let's talk about video games a little bit.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay.

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You obviously, I'm sure a lot of our listeners know, you are one of the hosts of Horde House. Hordehouse.com if you want to check that out.

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And do you have any other internet projects going on these days? Like Twitters to Pimp or Facebooks or other ego promotion things?

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Well, I stream regularly at Twitch.com. Twitch.tv slash E-X-T-O-P-H-E-R.

103
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why do you have to spell it all weird?

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, the way I usually spell Extrofer was taken so I had to kind of improvise. So, E-X-T-O-P-H-E-R.

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And what types of games do you stream?

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I stream a lot of Rayman Legends.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you a fan?

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If you like Rayman Legends then my channel is what you want to watch. I love that game so much.

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's kind of funny because our show, Horde House, is online games and I tend to talk about console games every single time we have a show.

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, console games are an online experience.

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, there are many console games that have online experiences but I've just been in a very big console gaming phase.

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And so a lot of the games I stream are very single player games that are very limited with their online connectivity.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I stream the entirety of Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons.

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Which I still haven't finished but it's good. I've played that. You were hyping that up on Horde.

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, I cried on my stream.

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Baby.

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I know. It was pretty pathetic. You can call me a pussy if you want. It's fine.

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Although I don't have a vagina. Rob does.

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Lies. And girl bits should never be used as an insult.

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No, no, no. I think that his vagina is very empowering.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It makes me feel like a butterfly in springtime is what I want to say.

122
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So it makes you feel douchely fresh?

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Just stop.

124
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes. I feel like I'm in touch with Summer's Eve.

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Just stop.

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And you guys expect this from me by the way because I coined bleach asshole on this.

127
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
At my house.

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You invented them.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
At my house.

130
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's see.

131
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Anyways, so yeah.

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks,

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you think they'll make a follow-up to Brothers called Sisters?

134
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Isn't that a Lifetime show?

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No, I think you're thinking Sister, Sister.

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, there might have been a Lifetime show called Sisters.

137
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, I don't think they will. I think this one was pretty contained in itself.

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You should play it. It's really good. It's only a three hour game.

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's really good.

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Codeman's in our chat saying he was watching the stream and he cried watching it.

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That doesn't surprise me.

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I haven't cried yet, but I'm only in chapter four.

143
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You haven't gotten to the crying bits yet.

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Excuse me.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Alright.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We'll get to your gaming week a little later, but let's talk about how did you get into video games?

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I mean, you are a bit more of a nerd than you lead on sometimes.

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
How did you get into video gaming and all that?

149
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, when I was growing up, I mean, I grew up with video games.

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We had an Atari growing up.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I wasn't that much into it, but when it was Easter and it was like 1985 or something,

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and my parents came home with a Nintendo Entertainment System for my brother and I,

153
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and it was really aimed at my brother more than me,

154
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but it really ended up being me that played it most of the time.

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I absolutely loved it.

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I played all of the trademark Nintendo games,

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Super Mario Brothers, Zelda, Kid Icarus, all of those things.

158
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And I just really loved all of them.

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
My favorite one was Metroid, and that started it all.

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And then we got a Sega Genesis.

161
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We were the first family on the block to have a Sega Genesis.

162
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So, of course, all the kids.

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So you're the most popular kid on the block.

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, when it came to video games, I was kind of a wuss and got made fun of a lot in school.

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But when it came to, yeah, yes, they called me a girl and I was bullied in school quite a bit.

166
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What's wrong with being a girl?

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Nothing, but they used it as an insult to me.

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Which we can all blame the patriarchy for.

169
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They used it as an insult to me, and I was very much bullied in school.

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But video games were my way of just escaping,

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and a lot of kids on my block would come over and watch me play Sonic,

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and I loved that. It was my element.

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And then when we got a Super Nintendo, we got a Sega CD,

174
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
we got the Game Gear, we got Game Boys.

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We had pretty much every system you could think of except for Neo Geo, those really niche systems.

176
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Only the really rich kids could afford that.

177
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
My friend had a Neo Geo and a Turbo Graphics CD or whatever, PC Engine.

178
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The Duo.

179
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, and he was awesome because whenever I got to go to his house, it was like Christmas,

180
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
because I got to see the games that I couldn't normally play.

181
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But that was what ruled my life when I was younger, was video games.

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I got two more questions for you, and then I want to move on because we have one more guest here in the studio.

183
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't want to make him sit there quietly much longer.

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But I got two questions for you.

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The first, since you brought up Nintendo, this kind of got me thinking that on Hoard House,

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
you've often been quite a defender of the Wii U on the show,

187
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and that you're a big fan of the Wii U console, and Nintendo's been a lot in the news lately.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We're going to get into some of the recent developments tonight with their latest investors meeting.

189
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Obviously, I'm sure you saw all the news out there about Wii U flopped and all this stuff that was out there.

190
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
A, what do you think about all that news as a Nintendo fan?

191
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And B, what do you think people are missing about Wii U?

192
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Well, I don't consider myself a huge proponent of Nintendo.

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't feel like I'm a big Nintendo fanboy, but I do really like the Wii U.

194
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I feel like it's a fine system.

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I think that people write it off because of its name and the fact that it's Nintendo,

196
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and we're not used to having Nintendo consoles really put out a lot of good third-party titles and stuff like that.

197
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And that's all understandable, but I don't know.

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I think that Nintendo has a pretty tough job.

199
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,000
They need to sell people on this system, and I don't really have anything to say other than that, really.

200
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What do you think people are missing about the Wii U?

201
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Well, I don't know. You're missing some good, exclusive games that Nintendo has brought out.

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Obviously, Rayman Legends was brought out for every platform, really, but it's the definitive experience on the Wii U.

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And if you haven't played it on the Wii U, then you're really missing out on a really great co-op experience.

204
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And I say this, I have that game on three different platforms.

205
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So I really feel like I know what I'm talking about when it comes to that experience.

206
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And there's other games that share the experience.

207
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I know that a lot of people don't like Nintendo for their gimmicks and stuff like that.

208
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I go back and forth on it, but I feel that if you have a gimmick, you can do it right.

209
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And I think that with a lot of their games, they have done it right.

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I think that's really important.

211
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It is possible to have a gimmick.

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
A lot of people wrote off the DS when it first came out, right?

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
People thought that was going to be a gimmick. Look at that now.

214
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No comment.

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
She's playing hers right now, just for the record.

216
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'd probably have bred with people.

217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Going to our chatroom for some comments on those questions too.

218
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Locopoco says, just give me Bayonetta 2 soon and no one gets hurt. Right?

219
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Tech2030 says, Wii U is so great. I play it in bed on the gamepad before I go to sleep.

220
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Dartitsuya says, oh yeah, I love mine. Mario 3D World, freaking great.

221
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So we got a lot of Wii U supporters in the chatroom.

222
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We'll talk a little more about the Nintendo stuff later.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm very curious to hear what you have to say about that.

224
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Alright, totally different direction, but I have a second question for you.

225
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Since you do this show, Horde House, with me, the online games show, right?

226
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What's been your favorite experience with online games?

227
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Because I figure you've played a lot of them. And why?

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What's been your favorite online gaming experience and why?

229
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
My favorite online gaming experience was probably World of Warcraft.

230
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Back when the Wrath of the Lich King expansion was the big deal.

231
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And the reason why is because it's when I got into a real hardcore gaming type mode, I guess.

232
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And I got accepted into a really high-end guild on a server.

233
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And I got to beat a lot of endgame content with that guild.

234
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And it was just really fun. It was like a rush.

235
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And the thing is, it was very brief lasting.

236
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I only was doing the hardcore gaming rating thing for just maybe about six months.

237
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Compared to the six years that I played WoW.

238
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And yet it was one of the best experiences I ever had.

239
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Ulduar, that dungeon in particular, that was my favorite dungeon experience.

240
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I think that I'll always hold that as probably my favorite online gaming experience.

241
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You made friends with that that you still talk to pretty regularly.

242
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, I do. And they're all good people.

243
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And I like that. As much as I don't like WoW now, I still hold that as a very good, solid experience.

244
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
MMOs are really kind of unique in that.

245
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Well, Shane's sitting right here. And Shane and I met on LiveJournal over Animal Crossing.

246
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I remember that. But I kind of feel like we really got to know each other and kind of got closer because of Final Fantasy XI.

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah, I think so. That sounds right.

248
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Kind of interesting how MMOs work like that.

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Before I move on to Matt, since it looks like you're wrapped up with your work stuff, what's been your favorite online gaming experience?

250
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm playing Phoenix Wright, so no, I'm not wrapped up with my work stuff.

251
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, excuse me. Objection!

252
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What's been your favorite online gaming experience?

253
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Fantasy Star Online.

254
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, that's a good answer. Why?

255
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It is. Because I almost failed a semester of high school because of it. Because it was so good. That's how amazing to me it was.

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Are you playing too?

257
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I did for a little bit, and then I decided not to.

258
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It was fun, I think.

259
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It was okay. I just...

260
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's weird that they won't release it here.

261
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Sega, they're dumb.

262
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, let's move on. I want to introduce our other guest who's been sitting there very patiently waiting.

263
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Say hello, everybody, to Matt, who's here joining us in studio as well.

264
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Hello.

265
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hi. Not to be confused with Loki.

266
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Just so you know, you're going to want to get that mic nice and close to you when you talk, because Xtrfer is really loud, so you've got to be about the same.

267
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
How are you, Matt?

268
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I am pretty good. Good to be here.

269
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, I know. We're happy to have you.

270
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You play a lot of online games, too. Let's start with that.

271
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Because I really feel like, since I've known you, I've probably known you for about a year and a half, since you and Xtrfer have been friends.

272
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I've known you for about a year and a half, and I feel like every online game I've played in that time, I've played with you at some point.

273
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We played Path of Exile for two days. You played League of Legends. We played Final Fantasy XIV extensively, obviously.

274
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What's been an online game you've really enjoyed and liked a lot?

275
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The game I like the most is League of Legends. I'm really hardcore with that. I play it all the time.

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I go into phases, actually. Depending on the MMO that's coming up, usually I'm playing that. Like right now, we're in Final Fantasy XIV.

277
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I took a break from League of Legends when I started Final Fantasy XIV, and then I went home for Christmas, and all my cousins are like,

278
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Matt, play League of Legends. And so I play League of Legends. I like a lot of board games, too, actually. I played Dominion a lot.

279
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, right. You introduced Alan and I to some really cool board games. Dominion's fun.

280
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Dominion's a lot of fun. I bet we have a lot of board game geeks out there listening. What are some of your favorite board games you've played?

281
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Dominion's definitely one of my favorites. I like Race for the Galaxy. The same designer for Dominion also made a game called Kingdom Builder, which is really fun.

282
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I've tried a game similar to the Dominion style. It's called Marvel Legendary, but it's with a Marvel theme, and that's a lot of fun.

283
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I like playing more strategic games. I played Le Havre over Christmas, and that was a lot of fun. I don't know if you know any of those games.

284
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No, but I'll smile and nod. I like board games, too, though, and every time my friends that are really into them introduce me to them,

285
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I never have a bad time. The ones you've introduced me to were great. Tim, who was on the show a while ago, he was into some board games, too.

286
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We played The House on the Haunted Hill or something like that. That was a lot of fun. I love that one.

287
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Dan's still trying to work on completing our dungeon quest.

288
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I have some friends here locally that are into some games. One of my friends here had a night at the comic book shop where we all went and played Sentinels of the Multiverse, and that was a lot of fun.

289
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I have not tried that one.

290
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That was a lot of fun. That was a fun card game.

291
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Let me get this out there, because this is pretty cool. You actually work in the games industry, and it's important to say you're here as yourself tonight, not representing your company.

292
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I can't go too far down this rabbit hole asking about the game, but you worked on a game that I'm sure a lot of our music game fans know, right?

293
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Rocksmith 2014?

294
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yep, and Rocksmith, the first one, and Rocksmith 2014. I'm our game designer for it.

295
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Awesome, and everybody should go buy it and check it out, right?

296
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes, they should. It's a lot of fun.

297
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Available on Amazon.com.

298
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And retailers near you, right?

299
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah, Exover is the greatest, my greatest cheerleader.

300
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So even though I can't go too far down that path asking you questions of that tonight, I can say that if you look at some of the Rocksmith trailers that are out there and some of the behind-the-scenes video, you can see Matt in them.

301
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah, you can see me a little bit. I'm not in a lot of them, but I'm the Asian guy with yellow glasses.

302
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
By the way, Shane got to play a little bit of Rocksmith 2014.

303
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I did. It's fantastic.

304
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I haven't played it. I'm such a bad friend, but I don't have the guitar and all that, and I've never really had the drive to learn to play, but everybody tells me Rocksmith is so good.

305
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
This is before I met you.

306
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We actually have people in my training class who are totally into it.

307
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

308
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
See, I want to be able to ask him questions like, how does it feel to have killed Rock Band, but I can't go down that path.

309
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I would love to play it, but I legitimately can't because of my hand.

310
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:32,000
All right, let me go to the questions I can. So everybody check out Rocksmith 2014, but let me ask you the questions I can't ask you, and that is, what made you want to get into game design? Why did you choose that path in life?

311
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I've always loved games growing up. I grew up with a Nintendo and a Super Nintendo, and my childhood friends would always be like, oh, let's start a video game company.

312
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In my spare time, I'd write new spells for Final Fantasy. Just because I was really into it, I wanted to make a game.

313
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay, I love that you fess up to this stuff because so many people did nerdy shit like that but won't fess up to it.

314
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And I remember being in grade school, we would draw those dungeon games on pencil and paper. Like, did anybody else do this in their school?

315
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And it'd be like, have the pits and the dragons. You'd have that like item shop that you draw and everything. Like people, like that's how people get, you play them on lunch.

316
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:21,000
When I was in high school, my friend Ashley and I, my senior year of high school, sat in the back room during our study hall and made up our own RPG.

317
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
With maps, everything, you name it. We did our own role play game.

318
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That's awesome, that's awesome. So did you do all that too? You designed your own levels?

319
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yes, I think every child.

320
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He designed games on his calculator, like those graphing calculators.

321
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Oh, were you that guy trying to get Tetris on your TI-81 and all that?

322
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, my TI-82, I remember. I was sick of all these bad poker games on there so I was like, I'm going to create something better.

323
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But I didn't make anything original. I remember learning how to program. I created the game Mastermind. I don't know if you know that one.

324
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh yeah, that's like the old, with all the pigs?

325
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The guessing one, yes.

326
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, is it true that, like, because I know I've talked, like Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us here at the voice games network, he's done a lot of game design stuff too.

327
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And I know it's always interesting. He talks about that when you first design a game, you actually should make a game you know.

328
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That's why you see a lot of people make Breakout clones. I remember when he was learning XNA, he did Crazy Eights, you know, like a card game.

329
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So a lot of people always start with something they know. So is that kind of why, you know, Mastermind is a game a lot of people know?

330
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah, I mean, I think, well, I think it's different between trying to learn how to program something versus trying to create something on your own.

331
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Because I think as a game designer, it's really easy to come up with your, I mean, it's really easy to not use programming.

332
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You really don't want to say, like, programming's my crutch when you're trying to create a game.

333
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Try to create a card game or a board game and just put all your ideas out on paper and then put them on cards, make a fake board, you know.

334
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Just draw on pencil and, you know, stick figures or even less of that.

335
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What I like to do sometimes, like, take magic cards and I put them in sleeves and then I print out stuff, paper, and put them in the sleeves.

336
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And then you can make your own little card game that way and, you know, have friends try it out and play.

337
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And, you know, you guys might just have a lot of fun.

338
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah, that's awesome. So you knew pretty early on game design was what you wanted to do.

339
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Like, you never, like, oh, maybe I want to do, I don't know, I want to be a teacher or an actor instead or something.

340
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You kind of always knew that?

341
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
No, my life actually was, well, as a kid, I thought that was just kind of a thing you dream of but you never really actually aspire to go towards.

342
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Like a porn actor. Would you say it's similar? I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

343
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So, I mean, and I had other dreams like that, you know, I wanted to design roller coasters too when I was like, maybe I'll be an engineer or something of that sort.

344
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And so I just kind of went into computer science because I was interested in programming and I went through that.

345
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And I didn't really think actually that I would really go into games at first.

346
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I was like, well, maybe I could try to get into a game company.

347
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And I actually, when I was in college, I had an internship at a company called Wild Tangent.

348
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh, I remember that. That was the stuff that installed its crap. That wasn't you that did that, did you?

349
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
No, I probably was because that was back in 2000, 2001. So that was those time of years.

350
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But I actually hated the job environment there. And so I was like, I have no idea what I'm going to do.

351
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So I decided like, well, I really like the math side of computer science.

352
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So I actually went, I spent like the next eight years in academia and that ended up not panning out.

353
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And I was like, well, what I'm going to do? And I was like, well, what did I want to do when I was little?

354
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I was like, I wanted to design games.

355
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So I at that point of time, I was really into a game called Hellgate London at that point of time.

356
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah, that game.

357
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, it's a fun game. It's made from the old Diablo 2 team.

358
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And I played it a lot and I contributed on their forums a lot.

359
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And I just kept on contributing and contributing that the developers started talking to me a lot.

360
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And then there came the point of time during my academic career, it's like I ran out of funding.

361
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Because most of my academia life, I was under a grant or something.

362
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But then my grant ran out and my research wasn't being published.

363
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So I was like, what am I going to do?

364
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And I talked to the developers and they said, oh, we're going to have a game design open up pretty soon.

365
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And I was like, awesome, I want to try it. And they're like, okay.

366
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And so I applied for it and they liked me when I interviewed with them and that's where I started.

367
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Wow, that's awesome. That's a great story, though. That's really cool.

368
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's funny because I interned when I was in college.

369
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I was originally wanting to be started as a weatherman.

370
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And then I was going to be a broadcast journalist, right? I was going to be that guy on the news.

371
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I actually interned at a news station up where I went to school and I really hated it.

372
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Well, actually, I take that back. It was a lot of fun. I had fun, but everybody else seemed really miserable.

373
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And it was kind of really a wake up call that like, wow, this isn't as glamorous as it looks.

374
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
A lot of people here really are not having fun. I don't know if I want to do this.

375
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But it kind of turned into like if I didn't go through that, I might not have this radio show I have now,

376
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
you know, with my friends on kind of our own terms. So, you know, it's interesting how what you learn can kind of turn into something else.

377
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Anyway. Yeah. What's great about I feel the game design field is that if you if you work forward towards it, you can get a game design job.

378
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I've met a lot of other game designers. They don't have a formal education or anything of that sort.

379
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But what they do is they have passion and usually the most important aspect.

380
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And when I interview other prospectus for game designers is they have to be they have to be excited about games that be playing games.

381
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They have to. And then and then hopefully they have one more step above that where they start analyzing like, well, this is what makes a good game.

382
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This is what makes a bad game. But how do you know that in general?

383
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's just what you do and don't like. And you you know, you start from that from that point.

384
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And and then usually I mean, you'll have a lot of people that have that same skill set,

385
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
but you would want someone who's then taking the next step of trying to create something on their own.

386
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I've had friends that, you know, she created she worked on her own webcomic for a couple of years,

387
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and that's really what got her in the in the game industry and, you know, helped her helped her get a more narrative game design type position.

388
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And me, my Wow. Why are we still trapped in my spare room for after 12 years doing this little dog and pony show?

389
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
No, I'm kidding. We love it. We love it. All right. No, I mean, a lot.

390
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I mean, and that's the thing is that, you know, and that's why I was saying earlier, you can anyone could create a game.

391
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You could create games out of paper just from, you know, make your own card game, make your own board game.

392
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And just that itself and just showing your passion for creating and trying to, you know, entertain other people.

393
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That that that is really the most important thing when we when when when people are looking for game designers.

394
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That's great advice. I love that. And that's straight from somebody who knows what they're talking about.

395
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm going to our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com Dungeon Buster says Hellgate London had a lot of promise to it.

396
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Wish it had a better chance to actually accomplish what it wanted to sit out to do.

397
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So definitely the game had a lot of fans there. Yeah. That coming from live dot vog network dot com.

398
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Well, anything I know we plugged down the Rocksmith series.

399
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Is there anything else you want to plug out there? Personal projects or anything while you're here tonight?

400
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Just Rocksmith 2014 play it. Yeah. You're welcome to give me your feedback.

401
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'll take it by Rayman legends. This is still Matt talking, by the way.

402
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah. A lot of my spare time playing games is watching Christopher play Rayman legends on three different platforms.

403
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Also, our chats are a little distracted right now because Loki joined the chat room.

404
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Loki is in our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com. And Loki says, I'm hoping to be back on next week.

405
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So be great. We miss Loki, but totally understand why he's got to take the time to be with the additions to the family.

406
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And Loki is probably just kind of mad he's missing all you guys here in studio tonight.

407
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So we have a pretty packed house tonight. I really wish we could see Loki and Miss Loki and their baby.

408
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Wish we had more time. You should go there right now. I'm sure they're not trying to sleep or anything.

409
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Just go right now. All right. No, stay here on the show. Darn it.

410
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Shane, I want to go back to you for like just a minute because you blew me off earlier.

411
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But now you're not doing anything important. You're just playing Phoenix, right? Trying to save my client's life.

412
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
All right. But when it will, because we were talking, we were just talking with Matt and Matt, you know, has a lot of experience in the game industry.

413
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And I know you've told a little bit about this on the show before, but since, you know, we do gain and lose listeners every so often,

414
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
there's probably people out there that don't know that you at one time worked in the industry as well, right?

415
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yes. And where did you work? Konami. And what did you do? I made DDR. You yourself made the whole game?

416
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Just me. Just you? With a piece of paper and a dream.

417
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh, so your story is kind of like grassroots. How did you get into it?

418
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Was it really a piece of paper and a dream or what? It was connections. Connections.

419
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
That's that's true. That's how it went. I guess. I guess so. Yes.

420
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But you you were really passionate about music games though, right? Yeah. And I still am. Yeah.

421
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's just they don't have to. They have to be good. They can't be crap. What's what's good and what's crap?

422
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
See, he can't say, but you can. You don't work in the industry anymore.

423
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
D.J. Maxx is awesome. Uh-huh. DDR is kind of crap.

424
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Pump It Up is awesome. And what else is crap? Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero is crap. Glad it died.

425
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
D.J. Hero was awesome though. So what what why don't why don't you work there anymore?

426
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Because they moved and they weren't. Can I even talk about that? Probably not.

427
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
All right. I guess I can. All right. Just in that sense, they moved.

428
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And oh, God, I don't know what else to ask you. How's life? Yeah.

429
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It's full of courtroom drama right now. Why do you love Phoenix Wright so much?

430
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It's full of courtroom drama. That's true. You do.

431
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And now that I think about it, you you your favorite TV show is Law and Order SVU, right?

432
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Oh, Power Rangers. Do you want to talk about Mass Effect?

433
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Would that make you feel better? No, I can talk about Power Rangers. I don't care.

434
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I would like to hear more about Power Rangers. So only the Japanese ones.

435
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
OK. My favorite one for a while was the one where there were cops.

436
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So I guess it kind of makes sense. That one was interesting. But now now they're going to be trains.

437
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And it's awesome. Really? Yeah. I mean, I understand why the train ones like popular,

438
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
but still. Yes. And they switched their costumes, which is awesome.

439
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I still think that nothing is as awesome as Mega Ranger was. I didn't watch the Japanese

440
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
version, but it kind of sucked in America. I'm watching Japanese

441
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
one of Time Ranger Time Rangers. Awesome. The intro sounds like a

442
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
90s sci fi show. And it's amazing.

443
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I still think Mega Ranger was best. All right. Well, congrats, Shane. You succeeded in bringing Power Rangers chat to the show.

444
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I hope I'll bring more than that way. There's going to be some Pokemon.

445
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Well, that kind of works. Well, we got it. We got to keep it moving and get into a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

446
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yes, we usually do a kickoff topic, but we talk to everybody for a little while. That was our kickoff topic.

447
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.

448
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So we know Shane has been playing Phoenix Wright, so we can skip him. How about you,

449
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
DarkSocker? We'll go back to him. I'm kidding. I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now, am I?

450
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
That bitch, Ed, won't leave my town. Seriously, he's fucking creepy. You need the right to be able to evict people.

451
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But I guess Nintendo will. Blue horse with purple eyeshadow. That's just so to clash. Anyway,

452
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I am playing Animal Crossing. I finally deleted Julian's character now that he has my old wild world.

453
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So I played Mass Effect 3 because I finally figured out how to seamlessly change out hair textures in the actual game files.

454
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So I have completely modded my game. And the only problem is that I can't get custom textures replaced.

455
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So I'm using text mod for that. Does your hair look as good as Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider Definitive Edition now?

456
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't want to say anything bad about it, but it still doesn't move like real hair does. No.

457
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But one of my shepherds has a really neat looking ponytail that doesn't look like the crappy ponytail that comes in the game.

458
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:24,000
With the little, what is that thing in her face? It's actually really good. So I played, I've been playing some more of my characters and customizing them because it's also The Sims for me.

459
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And I finally beat that stupid dungeon in Zelda. After passing my week exam at work and then I go and just say,

460
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'll try that dungeon again. Beat it. So it's very happy. And I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that I'm sure have hit a wall in a video game.

461
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And then they come back to it like weeks later and it's like, beat it in one hit. Like, I know I've totally done that on a game before.

462
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, yeah. And I knew that that's what it was going to take is that's what it took back in on that same boss in Link to the Past.

463
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Because it's a stupid, whatever the circle thing is that knocks you off the platform. Or as I call it, God damn you bitch when I'm playing it.

464
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
How classy.

465
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Well, because I'm a classy bitch. So anyway, I think that's really about it. I mean, I've kind of put off my Japanese coach because I found my Kanji book. So I'm trying to study on paper.

466
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You've been learning enough lately.

467
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
My brain is full. I know how to do so many things on non-PC computers now.

468
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Good times. All right. We're going to go over to Shane and ask Shane about his gaming week. But before I get to that, I have some comments for Shane from our chatroom at live.mognetwork.com

469
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Tiger Claw says, you ever watch the Power Rangers that had that crossover with Ninja Turtles, the next mutation?

470
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Try to forget it.

471
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
S2100 Matt says, the other question is, will Shane convince Rob to buy a game live on air tonight? He always convinces him to buy something.

472
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh, Lord.

473
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'll figure out something. I was going to bring Skylanders. Apparently it's supposed to be Rocksmith.

474
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Rocksmith.

475
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Dartitsuya says, Mighty Morphin Power Voggers. Possibly.

476
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
By the way, remind me and I'm going to have to show you the Mega Ranger versus Car Ranger movie.

477
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I don't like Car Ranger.

478
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But it's better Japanese.

479
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
All right, Shane. How was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

480
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I played, well, I've been mostly in California for this week, so I played a lot of Vita and 3DS stuff.

481
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I've played Phoenix Wright. I've been playing Pokemon and Zelda. I've played DJ Maxx and a little bit of The Walking Dead.

482
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And if I were at home, I could have been playing my copy of Bravely Default, and it makes me mad that I'm not home for that.

483
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Kind of sucks.

484
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Why are you tapping your fingers at me? You like to hurry up.

485
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
No, I'm not.

486
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Well, now I'm done.

487
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
All right. Let's see. Loki in our chat room says, seriously, fuck Skylanders.

488
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
No, they're amazing, and I don't think they're attractive, so I'm not going to.

489
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Why do you like Skylanders so much?

490
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Because it's a fun, stupid game with neat characters, and the newest one's really fun because you can jump.

491
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Why do you like Pokemon so much?

492
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Because they're adorable, and you can collect so many.

493
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And why do you like Mass Effect so much?

494
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Because they're adorable, and you can collect so many.

495
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That sounds like me in all of my saves.

496
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Did I miss anything? Did I miss any big games?

497
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Why do you love Final Fantasy XIV so much?

498
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Because they have minions, and you can collect so many, and it's fun to play.

499
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And I'm very sad I haven't got to play it this week, really.

500
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Aw, I could boot it up on the PlayStation 3.

501
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yeah, and then I could not play it because that's a crappy way to play it.

502
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Shade. All right.

503
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Extover, how was your gaming week?

504
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It was fine. What did I play? I played some Don't Starve.

505
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I played a lot of Rayman Legends, of course,

506
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
because I'm trying to get my last trophy in that game.

507
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I only have one left to go.

508
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Wait, wait. We also played Mario.

509
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
We did. We played...

510
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And I kept getting the crown.

511
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
We played Mario 3D World 4-player. It was fun.

512
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
That's the only way I can enjoy that game, I figured out this week.

513
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Actually, I figured it out a while back.

514
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I was reminded of how much better it is with multiple people as opposed to single player.

515
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I don't know. I just don't enjoy it as much on single player.

516
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So sue me.

517
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But I actually got to see Tomb Raider today briefly at Rob's tonight on PS4.

518
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I've already completed it on PC, but it looks excellent on PS4.

519
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And yeah, I think that's it.

520
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I don't think I've played anything.

521
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh, I played Android Cactus, too.

522
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Assault Android Cactus. Great, great, great, great indie game event.

523
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You've been livestreaming that one a lot lately, too.

524
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Oh, yes.

525
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Again, I'm on Twitch.tv.

526
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Thank you, Rob, for the opportunity to plug my Twitch.

527
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You're so welcome.

528
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Slash e-x-t-o-p-h-e-r.

529
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Also, you can add me on Twitter.

530
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
My handle is...

531
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
What is it? It's X-to-fer-c.

532
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's X-t-o-f-e-r-c, as in cat.

533
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
But anyways, I got to see Tomb Raider, and that was cool.

534
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And Android Cactus.

535
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's called Assault Android Cactus.

536
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's a weird name, but it's a shoot-'em-up.

537
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's a twin-stick shooter, kind of in the style of Smash TV.

538
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And it's really fun, and it's available on Steam.

539
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It was only made by three people.

540
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And I can't stress that enough, because when you see the game...

541
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
With a piece of paper and a dream.

542
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah, it started with a piece of paper and a dream.

543
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Much like how Shane started with DDR.

544
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So yeah, you should check it out.

545
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
There's a demo on Steam.

546
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I mean, it's a gorgeous game, and it's really fun.

547
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's very addictive, and it's kind of challenging.

548
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So there you go.

549
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Excellent.

550
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Matt, what does a week in playing games look like for you?

551
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
What have you been up to?

552
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
With Shane being here, I was, I guess, introducing him to other games.

553
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Dominion and Rocksmith, of course.

554
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Also fun.

555
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And playing Mario with what Exo said.

556
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And we also played Cards Against Humanity.

557
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That was really good.

558
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Oh god, that was an epic...

559
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
How many hours? Like, four hour cards.

560
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
We played through every single card.

561
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Every single white card.

562
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah, our friend Tim, who you've had on the show before, right?

563
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:02,000
He has every single expansion, and he brought him over, and we played the crap out of that game.

564
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
He must have played that a lot, because that was like New Year's Eve, too.

565
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
It was like going through the entire deck.

566
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But yeah, I had a great time.

567
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Definitely a great time.

568
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And then, of course, Final Fantasy XIV.

569
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yay.

570
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And League of Legends.

571
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Boo.

572
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Why the League of Legends thing?

573
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Because it sucks.

574
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Why? You gotta have a reason.

575
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Because it's not fun.

576
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You haven't played with me yet.

577
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Counterpoint.

578
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
That will make it less fun. I don't want to get yelled at.

579
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I'm not going to yell at him.

580
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's a lie.

581
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Does Matt yell at you when he's playing games with you?

582
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
No, but I hear stories.

583
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Matt is notorious for pulling out the bitch side on League of Legends.

584
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Is he? Because I've heard him playing Final Fantasy XIV.

585
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Sometimes I hear his tone.

586
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
No, you know what? He's awesome because he can separate games from real life.

587
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Shane totally can't.

588
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
If Shane doesn't like you in a video game, he doesn't like you in real life.

589
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Oh yeah, I've laid you off completely.

590
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's a good thing you already like him in real life.

591
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Occasionally.

592
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
No, he's actually very professional when it comes to that.

593
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
He doesn't do it personally.

594
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
He's not there for personal insults. To his defense.

595
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But yeah, he does yell at you.

596
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Well, I've never heard him go like,

597
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Rob, you're a fucking idiot.

598
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But I definitely hear that tone.

599
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Like, you know, you've got to not get hit with the plumes again.

600
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I can't do it like he does it.

601
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
But you know, the whole clenched, like,

602
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Gosh, Rob, you sure have a problem dodging those landslides.

603
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Sorry, I can't stop laughing.

604
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
No, that's fine. It's because it's true. No, no, it's great.

605
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Alright, let's see, I'm trying to look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

606
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Segg says, when I get on the show, how about I do a cardboard game segment?

607
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
You know what? I know it's a video game show, but...

608
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Like a cardboard game?

609
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
No, card slash board.

610
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Well, you didn't specify.

611
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Card or board.

612
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I didn't know if there was, like, a game with a refrigerator box that I was unaware of.

613
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Alright, I think a lot of folks like card and board games, too.

614
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
So, why not? Games are games.

615
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Let me talk quickly about my gaming week.

616
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I haven't been playing a whole lot besides Final Fantasy XIV, honestly,

617
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
because, you know, I've got problems.

618
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But I have been playing the new Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on PlayStation 4.

619
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Now, I did play Tomb Raider before on Xbox 360,

620
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
so this is really the second time I'm playing it.

621
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And I don't...

622
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You alright over there? Your phone just blew up.

623
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It's vognetwork on my phone.

624
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It did a fanfare for me playing Tomb Raider this week.

625
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So, yeah, I've been playing it on the PlayStation 4,

626
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and I noticed that they definitely did a lot more to the game than just,

627
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
ooh, it's prettier and more high-res textures.

628
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I mean, obviously it has all the DLC stuff in there, too.

629
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So, ooh, all the outfits.

630
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But I thought it was interesting, like, just the really subtle things,

631
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
like that little light that's on the back of the PlayStation 4 controller,

632
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
like, they actually use that, like...

633
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So if you're playing in the dark or whatever,

634
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
like, let's say you have Laura get a torch,

635
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
and she lights it up in a dark cave.

636
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
The light on the back of the PlayStation 4 will actually glow,

637
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
like, red and yellow and, like, flicker on those colors,

638
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
like a flame would.

639
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And just little subtle things like that are really cool.

640
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And then it uses the speaker inside the controller quite a bit, too.

641
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So there are... there's more than just, like, the prettier graphics.

642
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So I thought that was good, because, you know,

643
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm paying $60 to play a game I've already played before.

644
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But it's cool, because the neat thing about where the PlayStation 4 is at right now

645
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
is that there's really not... and the Xbox One, really,

646
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
is that there's not really a whole lot of games on either one.

647
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I mean, yeah, you've got, you know what, Need for Speed, Knack, the sports games,

648
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
but I think there's, like, kind of a lull right now

649
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
as systems tend to get to in this time of year.

650
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So I actually think the repackaging of Tomb Raider,

651
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
which was, you know, one of the best from the end of the last generation of games,

652
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I think that was kind of a smart idea. I think it really was.

653
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You know what else is getting repackaged?

654
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
What?

655
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Rayman Legends.

656
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Is it really? Oh, that's right, it is.

657
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's coming out in, like, two weeks, right?

658
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yep, and I... you should get it. Everybody should get it.

659
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
You're gonna play it again, right?

660
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
You know what? I think I will.

661
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

662
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Locopoco says,

663
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Tomb Raider Definitive Edition is so, so pretty.

664
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah, it's really not just the hair, it's just you can...

665
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
you just noticed it in the textures and everything,

666
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
and the smoothness is really...

667
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and I know there's a lot of that controversy

668
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

669
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I couldn't tell you because I haven't played the Xbox One version,

670
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I've only played the PlayStation 4 version,

671
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
but it's really smooth, and the framerate's great, and yeah.

672
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It's really cool.

673
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And Tech2030 says,

674
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
That game is worth playing more than two times.

675
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
There you go.

676
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So that was... I mean, I didn't really play an awful lot

677
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
besides those games, honestly.

678
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I spent a lot of time... I did some livestreaming.

679
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Oh, I did play Pinball Arcade,

680
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
because I did some livestreaming of that on PlayStation 4.

681
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I bought the entire Season 1 worth of tables,

682
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
and I died a lot on the Star Trek Next Generation table,

683
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
because that table is an asshole.

684
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But it's Star Trek.

685
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It is in real life, too.

686
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It is. Like, the gutters on the left and right eat your ball,

687
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
like, all the time. There's nothing you can do about it.

688
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Did your balls get eaten?

689
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I hate you.

690
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

691
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
All right. Let's move on.

692
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
That's it for our gaming week.

693
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So, quickly, some housekeeping.

694
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I don't have a lot, so I'm just gonna say follow us on Facebook.

695
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Laundry Dale.

696
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
We're also on Twitter.

697
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

698
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
We should be here for most of the coming weeks.

699
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
We may miss a show in early March,

700
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
but I'll keep you guys posted on that

701
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
as we get a little closer to that date.

702
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Have we missed a week since, like, last year?

703
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I don't think we have.

704
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I did.

705
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You did, but...

706
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Because I had the plague.

707
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
The show is still going on.

708
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So, yeah, we might have a week off in March,

709
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
but we'll keep you posted on that.

710
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
All right. In the meantime, I guess we'll get into some news,

711
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and I'm actually gonna start us off tonight with some gaming news,

712
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
since Loki and Jason's both not here to start us off.

713
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I'll start us off.

714
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And we're gonna talk Nintendo, like I promised.

715
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
There was a lot of chatter this week with what's going on with Nintendo.

716
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
As I mentioned earlier in the show when I was talking to Extifer,

717
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
we all saw the news stories about,

718
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Wii U is flopping and Wii U's not making expectations.

719
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
What's gonna happen?

720
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
What are they gonna do when they have the investor meeting?

721
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Are they gonna put Mario on cell phones?

722
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Well, that investor meeting happened this week,

723
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and quite a bit kind of came out of that meeting.

724
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Let's touch on some of the bullet points.

725
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Mario Kart 8 officially dated.

726
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Mario Kart 8 will be out in May at this point.

727
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I don't want to be that guy,

728
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
but I kind of thought this was gonna be the case

729
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
when they delayed Donkey Kong Country Freeze.

730
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
What the heck's the name of that game, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze?

731
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze.

732
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Thank you, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze.

733
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I kind of had the feeling when they delayed that game

734
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
that it meant that Mario Kart 8 was getting delayed.

735
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So the push to May doesn't really surprise me.

736
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Sure, it's sad, I want the game now,

737
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
but I would rather they wait till May to make it good

738
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
than release it before it's really ready.

739
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And who knows, maybe the release in May is strategical too.

740
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Maybe they need to space things out for the end of the year.

741
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I don't know.

742
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Other big news that came out of the investor meeting.

743
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Wii U Virtual Console will be getting Nintendo DS games.

744
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And there's a lot of people out there going,

745
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I called it.

746
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
One of them being Loki, the other one being Alan,

747
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
because when we did our silly little list list

748
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
at the end of the year last year,

749
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
they both, in one way or another,

750
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
said that that was the type of thing that was gonna happen.

751
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So we are gonna get the DS games on the Wii U Virtual Console.

752
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
No, we don't know which games.

753
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
No, we don't know when.

754
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We do know that they showed Brain Age

755
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
in a conceptual type of thing,

756
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
and that would be an obvious choice.

757
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I mean, most of those Nintendo first-party games

758
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
are gonna be the obvious things that come out on Wii U

759
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
pretty quickly.

760
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Another very interesting comment that came out of that is that

761
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
we've got over a technical hurdle with Virtual Console

762
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and expect to get the games out quick.

763
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And I think that was in regards to the Nintendo DS games,

764
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
but some people have been interpreting it as

765
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
there's gonna be more Virtual Console games.

766
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That's not a bad thing, I don't think.

767
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
They've really been trickling out.

768
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But, again, I wish there was more to Virtual Console.

769
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I don't know.

770
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I get the whole concept that people just wanna have

771
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
the emulated games, but it just seems like

772
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
there would be value in online play,

773
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
leaderboards, trophies,

774
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
being able to see your friends play on the webcam

775
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
that's built into the gamepad,

776
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
just something like that.

777
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
They're gonna be building a Quick Start function

778
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
into the Nintendo Wii U gamepad.

779
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
They say it still takes too long to play Wii U games,

780
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
that they're gonna do a Quick Start function,

781
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
that you're gonna be able to get the game right up,

782
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
and that's something that's supposed to come later this year.

783
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I think that's a good thing.

784
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's a good thing, but I don't understand...

785
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I don't quite understand why people feel like

786
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
it takes too long to boot up and play a game.

787
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It literally takes two inputs.

788
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
You click your user, me,

789
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
and then you click the game that you wanna play.

790
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
That's it. It doesn't take too long to boot it up.

791
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
People... I think I read on Kotaku...

792
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You know how sensationalist they can be?

793
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Well, first off, you shouldn't have read that.

794
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I know, I know, I know.

795
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
But on Kotaku, they were talking about how

796
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
you go through a myriad of menu screens

797
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
to get to the game you need to get to.

798
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
That is complete bullshit.

799
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
That is not true.

800
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You don't go through a myriad of video game menus.

801
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
You go through two screens.

802
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Like, you know, get over it.

803
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And so I don't feel like it's absolutely needful

804
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
that you have to have a quick boot.

805
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
But I mean, it is fine.

806
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It's fine for what it is, I guess.

807
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Brad from Pod Culture says,

808
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
If you can't get your game up, you might need Wiagra.

809
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Oh, I see what you did there.

810
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
To be fair, I don't think the process

811
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
is really any slower on Wii U

812
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
than it is on any of the other consoles.

813
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It's actually faster on Wii U than it is PS3

814
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
to get to your game.

815
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It's just I don't understand why people are...

816
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
But I can also understand the allure

817
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
in being able to maybe just turn on the gamepad

818
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
and you have your virtual console game

819
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
right up on the gamepad without maybe even

820
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
necessarily having to navigate menus.

821
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah, I mean, I can see the draw for it.

822
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I'm certainly not against it.

823
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But I don't know where the controversy is.

824
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I can't see where the controversy is.

825
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Nintendo is talking about tying an ID

826
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
across all hardware platforms,

827
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
which I guess they've kind of already been doing

828
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
as they've merged Nintendo Network into 3DS.

829
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
But now we're talking about future systems

830
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and I think whatever they're going to plan

831
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
in the mobile space, which they've pretty much

832
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
come very clear and said it is not...

833
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Like, we're not putting Mario on...

834
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Like, we're not designing a Mario game for the iPhone.

835
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
But we're not opposed to new ideas.

836
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
So they are exploring some new ideas.

837
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And some of those ideas have to do with fitness.

838
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And that could be a place...

839
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Non-wearable health monitoring tech

840
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
was something they were talking about,

841
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
which struck me as particularly interesting

842
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
because last week I talked about the whole...

843
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And, you know, if you didn't listen to last week's show,

844
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
you really should because I feel like I made a good point

845
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
about how, you know, you talked about Fitbit,

846
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I talked about Fitbit.

847
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
That should have been Nintendo.

848
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Nintendo could have had that.

849
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
They could have hopped on that

850
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and had Fitbit for themselves.

851
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And I talked about that last week.

852
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Well, plus, if they...

853
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Because they have a monitor for the new Wii U Fit, right?

854
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Yeah, right, yeah.

855
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
But it's crap compared to Fitbit and all those things.

856
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
If they invest a little bit of money to make it

857
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
a little bit more premium-feeling,

858
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
then, yeah, I see them.

859
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So that's something they're going to.

860
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Nintendo's also talking about flexible price points

861
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
on games for loyal consumers.

862
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
That that might be the trick is to make the games a lot cheaper.

863
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So, I mean, cheaper is good news for us,

864
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
especially those that have been supporting.

865
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Just a couple other tidbits here.

866
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Legend of Zelda was listed on the Wii U's 2014 lineup

867
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
as To Be Determined.

868
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
That was some documents that came out of the investors meeting.

869
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Okay, so what does that tell us?

870
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
They're working on a new Legend of Zelda game.

871
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
We already knew that.

872
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Oh, shit.

873
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
No shit.

874
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And that is not news, but it was on the list

875
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
and people have been reporting it as news, so there you go.

876
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
One of the other big pieces of news,

877
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Iwata taking a big pay cut but not stepping down.

878
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Iwata's going to take a 50% pay cut, which is pretty big.

879
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
He's still making bank.

880
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
He's still making bank, but not going to step down.

881
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I'm certainly not one of those people that's thinking,

882
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
like, off with his head.

883
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Yeah, I'm not either.

884
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I don't think he needs to really take the fall,

885
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
but they all need to kind of, like,

886
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
this needs to be, like, the wake-up call.

887
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I mean, it's a wake-up call,

888
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,000
but he's sitting on the success of the 3DS,

889
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
and he turned that system around.

890
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
You know what I mean?

891
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
So he's not all, like, bad,

892
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
and for people to call for his resignation,

893
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I think, is just kind of silly.

894
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Yeah, I think it's, no, I wouldn't agree with that either.

895
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Possibly one of the most interesting things

896
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
to come out of all this, and I'll end on this,

897
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Nintendo is considering mergers

898
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
and new game studio acquisitions,

899
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
which led to a lot of wank in comment sections

900
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
about Microsoft should buy Nintendo.

901
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

902
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Don't think that's going to happen, kids,

903
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
because Nintendo still has a shitload of cash on hand,

904
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
so it's not like, you know,

905
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
it's not like going to the bargain bin at Walmart

906
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
and buying a new company.

907
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
You know, it's not really that easy,

908
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
but it could be interesting to see

909
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
if Nintendo makes a grab for somebody,

910
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
and my head can't help but go here.

911
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I just had this weird feeling,

912
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
what if Nintendo buys Sega?

913
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Like, that's the wank I'm coming up with in my head,

914
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I mean, because it would make so much sense.

915
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It would make absolutely a lot of sense.

916
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
It would make so much sense for Nintendo to buy Sega.

917
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
What if Nintendo bought Capcom or Konami?

918
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I think that would be really cool.

919
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
A lot of people think it's platinum games

920
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
that they're eyeing, but...

921
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Well, yeah, and again,

922
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
it's a company they kind of work with.

923
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yeah, like Wonderful 101 or whatever.

924
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
But it's going to be very interesting to see,

925
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
because, yeah, I bet Nintendo would snatch up a company

926
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
and get a whole lot of exclusives that way.

927
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Sega's kind of a company that's already been

928
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
very supportive of the Wii U,

929
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
but, you know, obviously my 12-year-old self can't help

930
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
but go, God, it was weird enough

931
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
when Sega started putting Sonic games

932
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
on the Nintendo platform.

933
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
We can go back in time

934
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and tell everybody that Nintendo won.

935
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Right?

936
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Seriously, you know, I would love, actually,

937
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
to see what Nintendo would do with Sega,

938
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
with any Segas, you know, like Sonic or whatever.

939
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Yeah, it would just be so weird.

940
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
My mind would be blown.

941
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Right?

942
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So, SSJ100Matt says,

943
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
That's some 1990s wank.

944
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I know, I can't help it.

945
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It's the only one in my mind that I go,

946
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
wow, that would make a lot of sense for that to happen.

947
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So, OrangeRight in chat says,

948
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Konami won't happen because they'd have to cancel all their games.

949
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That's a good point.

950
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Konami's really developing a lot of stuff on other platforms.

951
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Nintendo buys them.

952
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's not as easy as like, oh, put Castlevania on Wii U.

953
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Are they really relevant anymore, anyway?

954
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Ooh.

955
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I mean, let's just be honest.

956
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
What do they do?

957
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
They make a Metal Gear every once in a while.

958
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Castlevania.

959
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And yeah, at Castlevania, that's kind of...

960
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
What does the chat think is really taking off?

961
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I don't think it's really taking off.

962
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I think they're trying to make it take off.

963
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
No, Silent Hill's really gonna get successful this time, Shane.

964
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
That's a lie.

965
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Maybe they'll buy up some of their IPs.

966
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Or, you know, I'm not talking about just Konami,

967
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
but other companies like Mega Man,

968
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
you know how everybody's really, really butthurt about Capcom

969
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
pushing them to the curb.

970
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Capcom wouldn't let it go.

971
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Yeah.

972
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Oh yeah, I wouldn't see Capcom...

973
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Nintendo would have to buy Capcom for that to happen.

974
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
But see...

975
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
But then the fighting game world would just poop itself.

976
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yeah, they would.

977
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
The fighting game world would literally shit itself

978
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
if Nintendo bought Capcom.

979
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
No kidding, that would be great.

980
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I'd love to see that happen, honestly.

981
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Have you tried playing a fighting game on the Wii?

982
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
No, because all you do is try to play the fighting game on a Wii.

983
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom was...

984
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I love it, but it's just not great.

985
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
You have to have the classic controller to play it.

986
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And you know me, I'm probably one of the world's biggest

987
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Tatsunoko fans.

988
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
No.

989
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Even Gatchaman was not enough to make me love it.

990
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Alright, so enough wank and all this stuff.

991
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Obviously we're going crazy here.

992
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Chatters, I ask you this.

993
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
People in the room, I ask you this.

994
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Live.vog.network.com if you want to chat with us.

995
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
After what you heard come out of this Nintendo event,

996
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
do you think they're on the right path at this point?

997
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It's hard to say, because Nintendo,

998
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I feel like with every step forward they take,

999
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
it feels like they take a couple back.

1000
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And I just don't feel like it got to the point of excitement for me

1001
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
in anything they came out with.

1002
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
But I don't know, they've never been a company

1003
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
that wants to be very aggressive.

1004
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
They don't ever give me that impression.

1005
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
So, I don't know. What do you say, Matt?

1006
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Well, I think for Nintendo,

1007
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I think they just want to make sure they take it slow

1008
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
and they actually know they will make it big on their own IPs

1009
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and everyone loves their properties and their games.

1010
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So if they're spreading it out, they're spreading it out.

1011
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But I think we could take a look at Take-Two and GTA V

1012
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
and all of a sudden one game can put you on top.

1013
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Unfortunately, I guess the game industry is kind of that way now.

1014
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
There's a lot more blockbusters and hit or miss type of things.

1015
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But I don't think Nintendo has that much to worry about

1016
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
because they have a lot of strong IP.

1017
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And they have a lot of cash on hand.

1018
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And we know they have patience.

1019
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And they do turn out the quality games.

1020
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And they make the next GTA V.

1021
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
This is coming from a Microsoft fanboy.

1022
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com,

1023
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Loki giving his opinion with the show tonight saying,

1024
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I could see them acquiring Atlus or Tecmo Koe,

1025
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
a smaller third-party company maybe.

1026
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And, let's see, Bochikawa says,

1027
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I use the Classic Controller for everything. Nothing wrong with it.

1028
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Yeah, but that is, I mean, the problem with the Classic Controller,

1029
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
it's optional. And when you have an optional piece of hardware,

1030
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
games don't necessarily have to support it.

1031
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
That is kind of why the Xbox One included the Kinect,

1032
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
for better or worse, because they wanted designers to know

1033
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
the Kinect will be on every Xbox One.

1034
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
So you can design for it and not have to worry if somebody has it or not.

1035
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
When you design a game for the Classic Controller,

1036
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
not everybody's going to have it.

1037
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
A lot of people who owned a Wii didn't have a Classic Controller.

1038
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
So something to think about with that.

1039
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Tech 2030 says, if they're really thinking of buying companies

1040
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
to get more first-party titles and IPs, then yes.

1041
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And I think that's in response to the Atlus and Tecmo Koe thing.

1042
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:33,000
So, Dar Tetsuya says, if they announce even more than one bombshell title at E3,

1043
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
they might be able to turn things around, I think.

1044
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
You know, and I kind of agree with that answer.

1045
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
That's where I'm going, is that E3, I mean, E3's always important,

1046
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
and I feel like we say this every freaking year.

1047
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
But this is, the stakes are like super fucking high for Nintendo this year.

1048
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Super, super high.

1049
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And the weird thing is, I still don't, I would see that they're not going to get on stage again.

1050
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I think we're going to have another year of Nintendo Direct.

1051
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Why should they get on stage? Why should they?

1052
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Honestly, I liked the Nintendo Direct thing.

1053
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Well, the only thing I hated about it was that Ustream was full of fail.

1054
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I liked the theory behind it, but it didn't work.

1055
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And that thing was crashing every five seconds, so they better fix that shit.

1056
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
But otherwise, yes, in theory, I think there's nothing wrong with what they did with Nintendo Direct.

1057
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It's very interesting how they're changing the landscape that way.

1058
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
But I would fully anticipate we have another E3 where they do that.

1059
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Gonna be very, very, very make or break this year.

1060
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
All right, let's move on. We got a lot of other companies to talk about.

1061
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So, Dark Saga.

1062
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Speaking of other companies, we have some Sony news.

1063
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Well, more like a rumor, which, you know how I feel about rumors, but this could be a good one.

1064
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Basically, there was a source close to Sony was saying that there is going to be a backwards compatible PS1 and PS2 emulator.

1065
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
For the PS4.

1066
01:04:49,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And they say that the theory is that, from what I can tell in here, it's supposed to be able to let you play the games you already have.

1067
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Which is actually sort of opposite of what Sony was saying about having the PS1 and PS2 games available through PlayStation Now.

1068
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So, it would be interesting if they did that, but I don't see it.

1069
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Well, I mean, there's PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 emulators on PC.

1070
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And isn't the PlayStation 4 just kind of like a PC in a box?

1071
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I mean, we're getting closer and closer to that.

1072
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
So, I like that idea as opposed to streaming.

1073
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I mean, as cool as a lot of the stuff they were talking about was streaming sounds.

1074
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Like, I really worry about the lag and the bandwidth and all that that goes with it.

1075
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
So, I really like this as an approach. I hope they can do it.

1076
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:51,000
The thing I like about it is that it actually would add more value to the system itself so that people who already have their older games would be willing to upgrade to the next level of hardware.

1077
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I would be so flippin' happy if they implement this and they do the right thing, which would be...

1078
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Remove region locking?

1079
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:10,000
That and, well, if I could play the games I already bought on PlayStation 3 for PS1, if I could play those on PS4 as well because they're already in my catalog.

1080
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
That would be the right thing to do and I really hope that's what they do.

1081
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I hope so, too.

1082
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Which, by the way, would include... Those were region-free because they release Japanese games all the time.

1083
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
The Japanese Mega Man releases were out and I bought one of those and, like, Castlevania Chronicles.

1084
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I bought a... Sweet Coding 2. There's a series that Shane didn't get to fanboy over yet.

1085
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I bought... No, Sweet Coding 1, not 2. Sorry.

1086
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah, 2 will never be on there.

1087
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Why won't they release 2? Jerks.

1088
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I don't know. Maybe.

1089
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Or maybe they would have this as something that you can subscribe to.

1090
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You know, beyond their whole PlayStation Now thing, they have an emulator subscription service.

1091
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Or maybe it has to be licensed per game.

1092
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Tech2030 in chat says, I think because of PlayStation Now, I'm gonna say backwards compatibility won't happen.

1093
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It would almost be hindering their sales potential with PlayStation Now.

1094
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Why can't they be together?

1095
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Is it giving people an opportunity to get games that they don't have access to anymore?

1096
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Why can't PlayStation Now be both emulator and streaming?

1097
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It could easily be.

1098
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Yeah.

1099
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And, again, it's the whole concept of added value to make the hardware more attractive.

1100
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Absolutely. So we'll see what develops with that.

1101
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I'm hoping that it does turn out to be true.

1102
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And, again, I'd love to see the library of PlayStation 1 stuff I already bought open up on PlayStation 4.

1103
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
That would be fantastic.

1104
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Alright. Well, let's move on to some Microsoft news.

1105
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
So, Matt, if you're a Microsoft fanboy, pay attention. Although I'm sure...

1106
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I was just being kind of facetious when I said that.

1107
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
But, honestly, he had an Xbox only when I moved in with him.

1108
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Oh, did you force him to go buy console?

1109
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
No, no. I didn't force him to buy anything.

1110
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I forced him to get the newest console for free, though.

1111
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Alright. Moving on to some big news out of Microsoft.

1112
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Microsoft, I'm sure many of you heard this week,

1113
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Microsoft Studios purchased the rights to the Gears of War franchise from Epic Games.

1114
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
They will be taking over the existing games that are already out there,

1115
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
as well as development of future games.

1116
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Development of future games will be handed over to Black Tusk Studios,

1117
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
which at one time was Microsoft Vancouver.

1118
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But Black Tusk will now be working on future Gears of War games.

1119
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
So, hmm. We'll see.

1120
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Rod Ferguson, who is the director of production at Epic Games and on the Gears of War franchise,

1121
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
is now going to be going over to Microsoft and will play a key studio leadership role.

1122
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
We don't know what that is all about.

1123
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
2K did put out a statement that says,

1124
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
We can confirm that Rod Ferguson is no longer with 2K.

1125
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Any projects the new studio is working on are unaffected by his departure.

1126
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
We wish him the best of luck in future endeavors. Blah de blah de blah. All that stuff.

1127
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
So, not a lot of surprise here, honestly.

1128
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I mean, of course, Gears of War has been a great franchise for Microsoft.

1129
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Of course they want to keep it going.

1130
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It's interesting that it's going to end up getting the Halo treatment of sorts.

1131
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Now that Epic Games isn't doing them anymore, they'll go to a new developer.

1132
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
But you know what? Halo 4 was way better than Halo 3, in my opinion.

1133
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Or any of the Halos that came out after 2. It wasn't as good as Halo 2.

1134
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I've never played a Halo.

1135
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Really? Halo 2 is really the best out of all those if you're going to play one.

1136
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Well, speaking of all that, in other Microsoft news,

1137
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
take this with a huge grain of salt,

1138
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I would really be not talking about what everybody's talking about

1139
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
if I didn't talk about this story, which is the Xbox leaks.

1140
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Apparently there's been some Xbox One rumors or leaks that are posted out there on NeoGaf.

1141
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
And, you know, we take a lot of those posts with a grain of salt,

1142
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
but the problem is this guy, N-T-K-R-N-L, not Colonel or whatever his name is,

1143
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,000
this guy apparently he's been a source before,

1144
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
and people have verified yes he is with Microsoft or what have you.

1145
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Here's a summary of what he said was going to be coming from Xbox One this year.

1146
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Halo 2 anniversary on Xbox One. November 11th even gave a date.

1147
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Halo 2 anniversary. Crackdown 3 coming in 2016.

1148
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Halo 5 possibly delayed. Not going to come out as soon as we thought.

1149
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Forza Horizon 2 for the Xbox One in September at 1080p.

1150
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And a white Xbox One that's diskless, meaning there will be no disk drive.

1151
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And perhaps that's how they're going to cut down the cost a little bit.

1152
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
They're not going to cut out the Kinect, they're going to cut out the disk drive,

1153
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
which is a very interesting way of, you know,

1154
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
when we talked about all that digital distribution

1155
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
and some of the stuff that Microsoft was considering at one point,

1156
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
it's very interesting that they might end up going down that road

1157
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
where it would be all digital after all.

1158
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Just if you get that, make sure you have no bandwidth caps.

1159
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Right? So, let me do some quick comments from our chatroom

1160
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
on the Gears of War thing that I just talked about,

1161
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
and then we'll talk about these rumors a little more over at live.vognetwork.com.

1162
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Tech 2030 says they really need to sit on Gears for a while,

1163
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,000
give people a break, and come back with an awesome sequel or maybe even a reboot.

1164
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
SSG100Matt says, to be fair, as a long time Gears of War fan,

1165
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
the series has been hoarded out a little too much.

1166
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Dungeonbuster says 343 Industries didn't do a half bad job with a new Halo,

1167
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
but Blast Tusk really needs to shake up the Gears formula.

1168
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Back to these rumors, here's the thing.

1169
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I don't, I mean, rumors are rumors, whatever.

1170
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
We'll find out what's true or not at E3,

1171
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
but here's my thing, is that pretty much everything this guy revealed,

1172
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
these are like the safest fucking bets you could make with Microsoft, right?

1173
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
This is like the whole, Nintendo is working on a new Zelda game that'll come out in a year.

1174
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Well, no shit. And if it doesn't come out in a year, oh, it got delayed, it wasn't ready, and you still look right.

1175
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Am I right? Like, if Nintendo comes out at E3 and says,

1176
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
we're working on a new Zelda game, and I see people going,

1177
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I called it, I'm gonna be like, did you also call that the Pope was Catholic and that bears shit in woods, because no shit.

1178
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And so when I hear news like, you know, Forza Horizon 2 coming to the Xbox One, no shit.

1179
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Forza Horizon was great. That was a great game. It sold well. It's gonna get a sequel.

1180
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I will buy an Xbox One for Forza Horizon 2. No shit that's happening.

1181
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Crackdown 3, okay, maybe a little more risky, whatever.

1182
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Halo 2 Anniversary. Again, I think that's a safe bet.

1183
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Especially if it's true that Halo 5 is getting pushed back a little bit, you want a Halo to bridge the gap in there a little bit.

1184
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Halo 2 Anniversary?

1185
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
It's like what they did with Wind Waker HD on Nintendo.

1186
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Which, by the way, when they announced Wind Waker, they already said they were working on another Zelda.

1187
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
So I don't understand how this is like...

1188
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I'm just, I'm comparing. But here's the thing.

1189
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Only one of these where I go, okay, well now that's a little bit ballsy is the white Xbox One that happens to be diskless.

1190
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Now, again, it's not... I mean, we knew that Microsoft was thinking about going down this path at some point anyway.

1191
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
It's not like that's new information, right?

1192
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:23,000
But for them to actually do it would really be something to see.

1193
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Matt thinks they should do it.

1194
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
They should be digital only, right?

1195
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Don't put words in my mouth.

1196
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Come on, don't be shy.

1197
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Well, I mean, just X for an I. We like everything being digital, so it's easier.

1198
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I don't go to the store. Just order something.

1199
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Let me ask this question. People are very hostile about that.

1200
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:54,000
What would you tell people that are very hostile and don't want to see people that are really attached to their disk-based games?

1201
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
What would you say to them? What are they missing?

1202
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I don't think they're missing anything. I mean, everyone's allowed to kind of prefer to play games how they like to,

1203
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
but, I mean, at the same time, you should be open up to how other people like to play.

1204
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And so we like to play without having to put a disk in. That's annoying.

1205
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I'm a graphic designer who is in love with print media, so I miss disks, and I miss manuals,

1206
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
and I miss everything that gives you something to hold and to possess,

1207
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,000
because some people are just attached to things, and some people like to have something tactile,

1208
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and I think that that shouldn't be abandoned,

1209
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
especially since you're going to be putting a whole bunch of designers out of business in print shops.

1210
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Sadly, I hate to say it, but too late. I mean, already, I don't see games really coming with manuals anymore.

1211
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
In fact, Tomb Raider I just bought this week doesn't have a manual. It says, for the online manual, go to this website.

1212
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
That's sad.

1213
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Granted, somebody still has to design the online manual, so there's that.

1214
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Yeah, PDFs aren't hard, but, for example, Dan and I have this box. We have an Atari 5200 Frogger box.

1215
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:12,000
You know what it's full of? Manuals that we go back and look at, especially when we are playing said games that we have those manuals for.

1216
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:25,000
One of my favorite things as a gamer from the old Nintendo days was to, when I got a new game,

1217
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
was to pop open that manual and look through it like it was a new book, you know what I mean?

1218
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I don't think that actually is ever going to be replicated by an online manual or a manual that you can access through the video game itself.

1219
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I just feel like there's a certain joy as a little kid that I had looking through the Legend of Zelda manual.

1220
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And reading the story of the game because it might tell you.

1221
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Exactly. And my mom would always joke, she would always be like,

1222
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I don't know how he masters these games, but he opens them up and he reads that manual from cover to cover and then he beats the game!

1223
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And I felt like, I was no childhood prodigy, but my mom sure made me feel like I was.

1224
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
She would brag to her friends about that and I was just like, I love the manuals.

1225
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
That's how I knew the evil mushrooms were called goombas.

1226
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Sometimes there would be hints in those manuals and everything.

1227
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I've heard in Japan that they still really treasure the instruction manual.

1228
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh yeah. Now that's one thing I've seen, especially because there's a big thing for collector's editions that come with a bunch of stuff.

1229
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:38,000
It's the manuals and art books coming with things are really, that's half the reason why my husband and I have imported stuff.

1230
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Yeah. So I wonder why there's this big cultural difference between Japan and I guess the Western world.

1231
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I remember when I was younger, I would get the manuals and I would color them because they were always a black and white and I had markers.

1232
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Well, I'm trying to think of an example of something. Okay, here, now it's a Dreamcast game, but it came with, it was a Cardcaptor Sakura game.

1233
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,000
That came with, and the game was kind of crap, but it was cute because it was Cardcaptor Sakura, but it came with a pillowcase.

1234
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It came with a clock, a fork and a spoon. You remember this?

1235
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
What's this? Sorry, I left the room for a minute.

1236
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
My Cardcaptor Sakura game.

1237
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Oh God, that was so hilarious.

1238
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And they did a Sakura Taisen game that came with all that same stuff too.

1239
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:33,000
But it's like, we see, you know, Collectors editions that come with postcards and things and companies just passing out postcards.

1240
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:43,000
You know, I've got a whole bunch of postcards thanks to Ikuma JP who sent me some Phoenix Wright ones and some other Capcom game ones.

1241
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:53,000
It's just a whole lot more of a Collectors audience to have just things that go with your game that enrich the game itself without actually being in the game.

1242
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Well, I do feel there is kind of, there is a boom in the US with different varying Collectors editions. You see like every game now has a Collectors edition.

1243
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I'm going to our chat room for some feedback.

1244
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Live.vognetwork.com. Segg says, my hope with the move to going full digital on consoles will put pressure into network neutrality and a better investment in broadband.

1245
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And Segg continues that saying, because you tell me with a straight face that Microsoft would like to pay for better access to every ISP in the US.

1246
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And Drew in the chat says, I just like manuals, but oh well, I honestly don't have time for them now. I do all the reading I used to now before the game comes out.

1247
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
We didn't have the internet when manuals were big. That's a good point.

1248
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I mean, Extifer would read the manual cover to cover when he bought the game, but now you have the internet.

1249
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You already know everything about the game before you buy it.

1250
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Yeah, but you know what's funny is that I still like, when I opened, for instance, when I opened the new console, and I used to do this when I was a little kid too.

1251
01:18:50,000 --> 01:19:00,000
When I opened the PS4, I love looking at all the little inserts. I like looking at all the little advertisements. I like looking through all of that stuff.

1252
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I seriously, it's like bathroom reading.

1253
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Here's what I ran to get in the back room for a minute here is that I was going to say all hope is not lost, because here's Retro Magazine.

1254
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Watch your gamers better.

1255
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Well, how mean, because Retro Video Game Magazine, this is where we had the guy on the show not that long ago.

1256
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I know, I know, I'm kidding.

1257
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
All right, yeah, sure.

1258
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Actually, Dan and I picked up the issue.

1259
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Did you?

1260
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
At Fry's.

1261
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Nice.

1262
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yeah.

1263
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:37,000
This magazine came out, and I was going to say, people are going to Kickstarter now. There's a lot of people that are really upset about, you know, I wish I had the magazine and so forth.

1264
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And maybe they want things that they can read in the bathroom or what have you.

1265
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
But yeah, they got this whole little magazine, and this is what was really cool is that if you go to the very back page, look at that, supporters.

1266
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Look at the number one right there. Yeah, orangelunchreader.com.

1267
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Yep.

1268
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
After you went and said something nasty.

1269
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
You know what?

1270
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
You said nasty mouth.

1271
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
You know what? I didn't mean it.

1272
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
That's pretty awesome.

1273
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
No, like I said, we actually picked it up because we saw it at Fry's.

1274
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Nice.

1275
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And I remembered it. But yeah, it was very good.

1276
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I was going to say, all hope's not lost. Like, there's still communities that are like, you know, hey, we missed this, so let's make it.

1277
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Yeah, I miss the old days where I'd pick up the new EGM or GamePro or whatever.

1278
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
They got what, Nintendo?

1279
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:22,000
You'd flip through that thing, like, over and over and over again, and even when you thought you read the whole thing from cover to cover, you'd still look through it, you know?

1280
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Why do you think I kept issues of EGM, like, for years? We actually ended up having to throw them away because they were just decaying.

1281
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I think I was reading up on Twitter or the internet somewhere that Nintendo Force is another magazine that's kind of run off Kickstarter and stuff, and they're gearing up for their second year.

1282
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,000
So, kind of, it's not dying. There's going to be an audience for it that appreciates it, so there you go.

1283
01:20:48,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It's becoming more of a specialty market, and I really wish that it was more the norm then. Well, it's like, I was even having a conversation with Becky, my best friend, a while back, about how whenever she gets DVDs, she just throws the cases away and puts them in a binder.

1284
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And I'm like, but you realize that someone put work into this design and that, you know, it's as much a part of the experience as having the disk, right?

1285
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And she's like, oh, I didn't think about it that way. But, I mean, I don't know. Some don't. Some don't. It's sad.

1286
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:31,000
All right, let's move on. Dark Soccer, you have another story for us? I do, and it's about how pissed off I am that print media is dying, and I'm kidding.

1287
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:40,000
This is about the Ouya. Well, it's getting makeover. It was kind of crap before, and it's still kind of crap, but we still like it.

1288
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:56,000
What? It's just the way you phrased, that's really funny. I'm sorry. No, well, okay, a lot of people will say it's kind of crap, and then there's people like our Brad from Pod Culture, who likes his Ouya and plays retro games on it.

1289
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:16,000
But the Ouya is going to have better Wi-Fi connectivity, or as they say in Quebec, Wi-Fi. It will have more storage. It's going to be going to a 16GB flash storage, and I wonder if anyone will need it.

1290
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Better controller, better analog, it's supposed to be better everything, and it's all black and sleek, and I still am not buying one.

1291
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I was just saying, you just pre-ordered one today, didn't you? Just kidding. No, because you can't pre-order, you can only order, and it will be delivered when it's ready.

1292
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,000
You're so mean. I am not. I have a personal grudge against unnecessary prefixes.

1293
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Alright, so I have to admit, I'm also still not really big on the whole Ouya thing. I think it's a pile of shit. Sorry, I'm sorry to crap on your parade.

1294
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I don't think I'd go that far, but... It has untapped potential, meaning its potential is really hard to tap, I guess?

1295
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:18,000
It's a fucking Android phone on your TV. I just feel like it's having a hard time finding its audience. What am I really getting out of that thing I can't get on my PC?

1296
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Absolutely nothing. You're getting one exclusive, that Soulfjord? That's it?

1297
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:34,000
To be fair, other people might say, well then why do you get a PlayStation 4, Rob? Because all those games are on your PC, but I'll tell you what, they run a lot better on the PlayStation 4 than they do on my PC.

1298
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:40,000
They're dedicated gaming consoles with all that power, whereas an Ouya is not really about the power.

1299
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Plus there's going to be exclusives on this.

1300
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:49,000
If you look at this, I'm sorry. Buying a PS4 is basically cheaper than buying a graphics card.

1301
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Ooh, interesting thought here from Sega in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. If the Ouya would drop its requirement for having a demo or free version for every title, they would have a lot more buy-in.

1302
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Brad from PodCulture says, it is a neat bit of kit to tinker with, but it sure as hell isn't mainstream.

1303
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Well, let's talk about what is coming to the mainstream as we go over release dates and the types of things that are coming out around the world this week.

1304
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm going to start with the US release dates. We have a few things coming out.

1305
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Earth Defense Force 2025. If Loki does come back next week, I think we're going to hear a lot about this, because this game is out on February 4th on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

1306
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Fable Anniversary also out this week on the Xbox 360. I think that's just the one, two, three games all out together.

1307
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:42,000
The Lego Movie Video Game is out on pretty much all consoles. Windows 360, PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Lego Movie Video Game.

1308
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
And, let's see, Outlast making its way to the PlayStation 4 this week as well.

1309
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And the Windows version of Double Dragon Neon makes its way to Steam this week as well.

1310
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,000
And then lastly, I think this is another, this is a Friday release. Did Nintendo move their things to Friday?

1311
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Bravely Default comes out on February 7th. And I know a lot of people are excited about that.

1312
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I still need to play the stinkin' demo, but I'm hearing a lot of good things about that.

1313
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Did you get your four swords, by the way?

1314
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I already had four swords.

1315
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
This is special.

1316
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It's the same one they gave away at E3 a while ago.

1317
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Yeah, when the 3DS was first, first out, they gave it away before, and I got it then.

1318
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Well, I didn't have one then.

1319
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Oh yeah, for all the new 3DS owners, it's great. But yeah, I had it from before.

1320
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Was it part of the ambassador thing?

1321
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Why don't you buy it again, Rob?

1322
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
It's free, Rob. Get it again.

1323
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Why is everybody picking on me?

1324
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Because you're here.

1325
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I already own the fucking game. Leave me alone.

1326
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Alright.

1327
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Moving on.

1328
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Let's see, Brad from Pod Culture says,

1329
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,000
No, it's a remastered version of the game a la Halo. Looks good too.

1330
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Shoot, I don't know which game he's talking about, but alright.

1331
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Oh, he's talking about Fable? Oh.

1332
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Well, that's pretty cool then.

1333
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
A Fable 2 was good.

1334
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
This is not Fable 3.

1335
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Going over to Japan and checking out the releases there.

1336
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
On the PlayStation 4 this week.

1337
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Gotcha, it's not out in Japan until the 22nd of February.

1338
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Just seeing if you were paying attention.

1339
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Going over to the consoles that are out in Japan on the PlayStation 3.

1340
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge goes into the Best Hits collection.

1341
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I'm sure Dark Sakura will be excited to play Puyo Puyo Tetris.

1342
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Puyo Puyo.

1343
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I guess they just combined the two.

1344
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It's both. It literally is both at the same time.

1345
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Holy shit.

1346
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Are you really excited?

1347
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Why the crap do I not have this?

1348
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
PlayStation 3 is region free. You can do it.

1349
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Hey, I have brand new news.

1350
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
What?

1351
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Did you know what it's called when a brony masturbates to ponies?

1352
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I just want to tell you, we have bronies that listen to this show.

1353
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I don't care. Don't be offensive. Alright, what?

1354
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It's called clopping.

1355
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Where's that from?

1356
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It's true. And so somewhere in the United States, somewhere, somebody is clopping right now.

1357
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I'm clopping listening to you talk.

1358
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
So nasty.

1359
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Moving on.

1360
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Bronies are disgusting.

1361
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
No they're not.

1362
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
You probably like things that are stupid too.

1363
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Actually, if I may.

1364
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
You like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

1365
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
I like Buffy.

1366
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
That is amazing.

1367
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I don't understand you right now.

1368
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I do need to actually set aside and make a statement because there's a little boy who is 11 years old who is a brony and got picked on and tried to hang himself and he's in critical condition.

1369
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So I just like to say, don't mock anybody's fandoms because they may be very seriously affected by it.

1370
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Are you listening to her?

1371
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I'm listening to her. I'm not trying to get people not to commit suicide.

1372
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I'm not trying to people.

1373
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I'm sorry, that came out completely.

1374
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
That completely.

1375
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I did not intend that to be interpreted the way that it did because I didn't mean to say it like that.

1376
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I'm talking about all the other guys that are the creeps.

1377
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
You know, if you're creepy about it, just keep your creepy in your closet.

1378
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And the thing that's cracking me up most of all is that Rama, who I know is a brony, is in our chat room saying, really Shane? Really?

1379
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
That was extra for talking.

1380
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
No, but I said something. I said that terrible because I'm not going to lie, they're terrible.

1381
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
You guys are too mean.

1382
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:43,000
But if you like something, shout it from the mountains and don't let anybody hate on you.

1383
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And also follow your dreams and don't kill yourself.

1384
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And I think the point here is rainbows and gummy bears.

1385
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I'm allergic to gummy bears.

1386
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Well, non-allergic.

1387
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
They make you shit.

1388
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
They make you shit rainbows.

1389
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
No, they just make you shit for hours.

1390
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Didn't you see the Amazon review?

1391
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Where was I? Talking about Japanese release dates.

1392
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Which somehow led to clopping.

1393
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And poop.

1394
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Fable Anniversary Limited Edition comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.

1395
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Going over to the Playstation Vita in Japan this week.

1396
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Puyo Puyo Tetris.

1397
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Terraria comes out on the Vita this week. I didn't even know that was a Vita release.

1398
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
And Super Heroine Chronicle.

1399
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
That means a female hero, not a drug warlord type game.

1400
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Especially since that guy just died.

1401
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Yeah, it would be in poor taste, wouldn't it?

1402
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
It would be in poor taste.

1403
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
On the Wii U, hey guess what's out on the Wii U?

1404
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Puyo Puyo Tetris. This game is getting around.

1405
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I love Puyo Puyo.

1406
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
And Monster Hunter Frontier G Memorial Package.

1407
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
They need to have a re-release of Monster Hunter every week in Japan.

1408
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Well, that's just because they want to set up permanent residents outside of the Capcom headquarters.

1409
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Lastly, but not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS.

1410
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
This is important because this is a big title for some people.

1411
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Dragon Quest Monsters 2 is out this week in Japan.

1412
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I know some people like that little spin-off series.

1413
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
There's a lot of slime accessories to go with that.

1414
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
The iconic Dragon Quest character.

1415
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
You know, we had a slime that used to wear Dan's wedding ring as its crown.

1416
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
That's awesome.

1417
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
And then Midna found it.

1418
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I was like, can I play with this?

1419
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And lastly, but not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

1420
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Dar Sakura.

1421
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Clopping.

1422
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Puyo Puyo Tetris!

1423
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Alright, let's go to the UK.

1424
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Kind of off topic.

1425
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Kind of.

1426
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
From Valentine's Day, Dan and I are going to bust out our Dreamcasts.

1427
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
So I can play Puyo Puyo Da.

1428
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And Blue Stinger.

1429
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
With a really motion sick camera.

1430
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Just saying that that's our idea of romantic.

1431
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Okay, so in February in the UK, we have a few things.

1432
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
On the 4th, we have The Sun at Night on PC.

1433
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
We have on the 5th, Outlast for PS4.

1434
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
And on the 7th, we have Fable Trilogy on the Xbox 360.

1435
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
And Jazzpunk for Mac and PC.

1436
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Jazzpunk.

1437
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
That sounds interesting.

1438
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
What is jazzpunk?

1439
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
It's jazz and punk.

1440
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Oh, it's like an indie game sort of thing with...

1441
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
It has a neat art style to it.

1442
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
That's kind of cool.

1443
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Okay, I'll have to get that.

1444
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Alright.

1445
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
By Necrophone Games.

1446
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Necrophilia Games? What?

1447
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Necrophone.

1448
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Oh, okay.

1449
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Sounds like a company Extrovert might work for.

1450
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And it looks like they had a big thing at PAX Prime.

1451
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
So, that's cool.

1452
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Alright, moving on to one more story before we get to our classic game of the week.

1453
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And this talks about a newer game.

1454
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And it's an MMO that some people are very excited about.

1455
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
We talked a lot about this game a couple weeks ago on Hoard House.

1456
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
And it made me excited for it.

1457
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
EverQuest Next is going to be released on the PlayStation 4.

1458
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
It was confirmed.

1459
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
It's coming to PlayStation 4.

1460
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
This came from an AMA over on Reddit, which is how we break news now.

1461
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
But John Smedley, who's the CEO of SOE,

1462
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
was really talking about the closures of those games there.

1463
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
But he also took some questions on other titles.

1464
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And one of the things he talked about, EverQuest Next.

1465
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And it will be available on the PlayStation 4.

1466
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
He almost confirmed this last November.

1467
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But kind of stopped short of actually confirming it.

1468
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
But now it went out on Twitter.

1469
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
It went out on the official Twitter.

1470
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And that's how we break news now.

1471
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
AMAs and Twitters.

1472
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Gotcha.

1473
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
So, there you go.

1474
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Is it going to be cross-platform between PC and...

1475
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I don't think they've said that yet.

1476
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I would sure hope so, considering it's an SOE, Sony online entertainment game.

1477
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
No kidding.

1478
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
No kidding.

1479
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Anything is possible.

1480
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Yeah, that's really interesting.

1481
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I mean, you're looking at the PlayStation 4, it's getting a lot of MMOs now.

1482
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Between Final Fantasy XIV, Elder Scrolls Online, and now EverQuest Next.

1483
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
And I mean, these are not...

1484
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
They also have Warframe, which is, I mean, kind of MMO-lite.

1485
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Yeah, some of those free-to-play games.

1486
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
It's very interesting.

1487
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
And we're not, like...

1488
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
In the PlayStation 3 days, we had some cool MMOs.

1489
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
But there was a lot of shit, too.

1490
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Like, Free Realms.

1491
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Sorry, that's one of the ones that's closing.

1492
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
So, it's kind of neat to see that, like...

1493
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Oh, and PlayStation 4's got DC Universe, which is pretty cool, too.

1494
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Like, it's very different.

1495
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
So, it's kind of neat that, you know, we're seeing, like, a lot of MMOs.

1496
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
EverQuest Next is free-to-play, isn't it?

1497
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Oh, I have no idea.

1498
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I have been really following it.

1499
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
All the other EverQuest games are.

1500
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I know there was Landmark and there was Next, so...

1501
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Hey, I'm all for more free games.

1502
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
How about it?

1503
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
All right.

1504
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Well, let's move on to...

1505
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
We're gonna take a trip back down memory lane to a time when games definitely weren't free.

1506
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
They cost you at least a quarter.

1507
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Or, who are we kidding?

1508
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Two tokens, 50 cents per credit.

1509
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,000
We're gonna walk down the aisle of memory lane where Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault

1510
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
and finds a game that she thinks,

1511
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Hey, you, brat, play this game.

1512
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Or I'm gonna, you know what?

1513
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Get off my lawn and play this game.

1514
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
All right.

1515
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Get inside from the outside.

1516
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Or, play this game where I'm gonna take a shit in your mouth.

1517
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Ew.

1518
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Ew.

1519
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Let's take off this game where I'm just gonna pull your head off with your spine attached

1520
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
to it and set the rest of you on ice.

1521
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
There's gonna be a babality, right, Dark Sakura?

1522
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
And then I'm gonna take a shit in your mouth.

1523
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
What?

1524
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
You're obsessed with shitting.

1525
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I don't know.

1526
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I'm not obsessed with shit.

1527
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I take my fiber.

1528
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Let's get to the classic game of the week.

1529
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week already?

1530
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Are you watching porn?

1531
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
No, it's got an ad here.

1532
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Okay.

1533
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Is it pony porn?

1534
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
What is the classic game of the week?

1535
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Are you copping?

1536
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
It's Mortal Kombat.

1537
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Sorry, X versus Mortal Klop bat.

1538
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:55,000
So, Mortal Kombat was put out by Midway and later on Acclaim for the home consoles.

1539
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And, it was done by Ed Boon and John Tobias and this has spawned quite a lot of wank over

1540
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:08,000
the years and crossovers and all kinds of things.

1541
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:16,000
And is now the franchise owned by Warner Brothers since 2009 after Midway went bankrupt.

1542
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,000
So basically it is, it was supposed to be an original game that was starring Jean-Claude

1543
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,500
Van Damme, but it fell through.

1544
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,600
And like I said, it has all kinds of shit around it.

1545
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:32,320
Even a TV show, I tried to watch some of the TV show and it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't

1546
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,320
Tara bad, but it was terrible.

1547
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:41,520
So, it's bloody violent, has fatalities where you just kill them at the end of the round

1548
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:52,280
and this was the game of my high school experience, actually Mortal Kombat 2 was more of the game

1549
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:57,120
of my experience, but you can't talk about Mortal Kombat 2 without going to its roots.

1550
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:14,800
So anyway, all of the games, well up through the third game they were digitized actors

1551
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,160
and sometimes it would just be palette swaps depending on the different characters, like

1552
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:25,360
for example Scorpion and Sub-Zero, same dude, different colors.

1553
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:32,320
And I remember back in EGM actually having interviews with some of the actors and showing

1554
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:36,640
them the costume and behind the scenes filming, so it was really neat.

1555
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:48,620
So yeah, the first three were 2D style with digitized actors and you had a high punch,

1556
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,720
low punch, high kick, low kick and block.

1557
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,960
Mortal Kombat 3 added a run button.

1558
01:36:53,960 --> 01:37:00,400
So basically it was just kick everybody's ass, try to make it to the end of the game

1559
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:05,880
and if you have your timing perfectly and know where to do it, where to stand to do

1560
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:14,160
your moves, you get a fatality where you can rip someone's neck out or all kinds of things,

1561
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:19,400
set them on fire if you're Scorpion, blow the kiss of death if you're Sonya.

1562
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:24,800
And it had, starting with, I think it was really with Mortal Kombat 2, it started having

1563
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:34,520
more of the people would start going into like the game menus and start reading things

1564
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:40,760
and that's where they got the noobs I bought from and a bunch of different rumors and then

1565
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:46,200
a little easter eggs hidden in the game and it really just sort of, it seemed that basically

1566
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:52,240
if someone made up a theory about game A, then by the time game B came out, the theory

1567
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,760
would actually be in the new game.

1568
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:58,480
So it seemed like a lot of feedback was actually listened to, the fan community was really

1569
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:01,560
paid attention to.

1570
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:05,560
Yes you can drop an arcade machine on somebody, I think that was Mortal Kombat 2.

1571
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:10,520
Or you could, see Mortal Kombat 2 just really started putting in, Mortal Kombat 3 started

1572
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:18,120
putting in the funny stuff like the, the, what was it, the fableties and the animalities.

1573
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,120
Those were in 2 I think.

1574
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:27,920
No, 2 had the fableties and the friendships, friendships were great, friendships were great.

1575
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:36,780
Which honestly, it's just that this was really kind of a shift in fighting games at the time

1576
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:42,340
because you were going from the, I would say a good number of the popular fighting

1577
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:44,620
games at the time were out of Japan.

1578
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:50,300
You know we had our Street Fighter at the time, we had our, I think, you know KOF started

1579
01:38:50,300 --> 01:39:01,300
after that because this actually was first out in 1992 so yeah this was before King of

1580
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:02,300
Fighters.

1581
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:07,980
By the time you had like Fatal Fury and World Heroes and you know all of those games and

1582
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:14,740
this was something that was new, it was supposed to be more of a realistic kind of, of, I mean

1583
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:20,660
at least by just having actual human looking people and the violence, you had all the blood

1584
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:28,300
which oh my god they're just, everybody's freaking out over fake skeletons and red pixels.

1585
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:31,700
It was something else though that it was like, I mean it's one thing to have the violence

1586
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:35,220
of cartoons but this was really one of the first circumstances where you had that kind

1587
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:41,380
of extreme violence, as I say as Raiden gets impaled on a spike there in the video, using

1588
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:43,620
like digitized real people.

1589
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,620
That was a real eye opener for some people, you know what I mean?

1590
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:47,620
It was.

1591
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:51,980
And then there was, they also had the stage based fatalities, remember the pit?

1592
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:53,940
Yeah we just saw that in the video, yeah yeah.

1593
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:59,020
Yeah and they really played on that in Mortal Kombat too with having the acid bath and the

1594
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:00,020
pit for that one.

1595
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:03,420
I think every Mortal Kombat game has had a pit stage now.

1596
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:05,420
Yeah now.

1597
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:10,980
But you just, you have those, and the storyline in the game, you know, the first one was like

1598
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:16,340
oh you have to go to the outer world and fight to save Earth, blah blah blah, cliche, but

1599
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:25,860
as it's gone forward, the series itself has really developed its own rich type of mythology,

1600
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:29,180
you know, really vast character base, I mean.

1601
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:33,900
Yeah when you play the new one, it's like there's a lot of story in it, which is really

1602
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:38,500
weird for such a dumb fighting game, I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Mortal Kombat,

1603
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:41,300
but it's kind of dumb.

1604
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:44,660
And I also thought it was funny that some of the influence for this game actually came

1605
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:46,940
from Big Trouble in Little China.

1606
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:47,940
I can see that.

1607
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:55,340
Well especially in, what was the character, Kung Lao, and Raiden, which I hate how people

1608
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:58,060
mispronounce that name, but anyway.

1609
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:03,940
So yeah, now the other thing about this, and this is actually where one of my pinball heroes,

1610
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:09,700
Steve Ritchie, comes into play, who I have met, he's a lovely guy, he autographed a couple

1611
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:16,140
of our pinball tables, but he's the one that suggested the K instead of the C for Mortal

1612
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:19,220
Kombat.

1613
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:23,060
And that, it just sort of stuck.

1614
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:25,900
So there you go.

1615
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:32,860
It was, like I said, it was with Mortal Kombat 4 that it really went to the 3D and then moved

1616
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:41,140
on from there, but I think that really this was just the big thing to stick.

1617
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:45,420
And then when you had the home copies come out, like for example, the Sega version, the

1618
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:51,220
Genesis Mega Drive, had different Easter eggs in it, like for example, Mortal Kombat 2 had

1619
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:52,580
Pong in it, remember?

1620
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:53,860
Yeah, I do.

1621
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:56,500
For record, that does not work on the Super Nintendo version.

1622
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:00,900
My brother and I stayed up all night playing 250 versus matches to try to get that to work,

1623
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,700
but I have done it in the arcade.

1624
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:12,900
There were the Fergalities for the Genesis version, the Sega CD had the D.A.D.D.S code

1625
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:19,620
that changed all the fighters to the characters from a show called D.A.D.D.S Army.

1626
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:23,700
Reptile and Jade were included as hidden characters and they finally came out in the later ones.

1627
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:25,940
So there's the toasty thing around here.

1628
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:26,940
I do.

1629
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:36,580
But again, we can't really go into any of the other ones without it.

1630
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:37,580
Absolutely.

1631
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:41,020
So, how about the list?

1632
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:43,020
Or I won't go through the whole list.

1633
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,020
Can I ask about this?

1634
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:45,660
Because I'm seeing comments on it in chat too.

1635
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:51,100
You said you are bothered when people say Raiden, but I thought that's what the announcer

1636
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,100
said.

1637
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:55,740
That's how it's pronounced in the game, but the actual legit way to pronounce that name

1638
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:56,740
is Raiden.

1639
01:42:56,740 --> 01:43:00,300
Well, because I'm thinking like obviously there was that other game that was called

1640
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:04,060
Raiden that, you know, was out in the arcades and I'm sure we think of that, but then I'm

1641
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:05,060
thinking...

1642
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:06,060
No, that's people being Americans.

1643
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:09,500
But wasn't, well, wasn't his name at one point spelled R-A-Y-D-E-N?

1644
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:14,340
Yeah, but if they're trying to name someone after a legit thunder god and just misspell

1645
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:18,140
it because that's how they think it's supposed to be, that doesn't necessarily make it right.

1646
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:19,140
Alright, alright.

1647
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,140
I had to ask.

1648
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,140
I'm sorry.

1649
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:25,340
It's my little uppity internal Japanese major.

1650
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:26,460
At least you can admit it.

1651
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:27,460
I can admit it.

1652
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:35,060
So we started in 1992 and the franchise is still going on 20 years later.

1653
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:36,740
So that's to say something.

1654
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:40,980
We have the first Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat 2, Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate, Mortal Kombat

1655
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:44,300
3, Mortal Kombat trilogy, Mortal Kombat 4, Mortal Kombat mythology sub-zero, Mortal Kombat

1656
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:48,220
2, Mortal Kombat Gold, Mortal Kombat Special Forces, Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance, Tournament

1657
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:53,540
Edition, Deception, Shaolin Monks, Unchained, Armageddon, Ultimate Mortal Kombat, Mortal

1658
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:58,140
Kombat Collection, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, which was kind of amusing but they took out,

1659
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:01,900
they changed Joker's fatality, but they put it in with another character in a later one

1660
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,460
where he just comes out and shoots them.

1661
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:04,460
That's pretty funny.

1662
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:10,840
Mortal Kombat, which was the 2011 release, which is the reboot game, Mortal Kombat Arcade

1663
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:14,400
Collection and Mortal Kombat Complete Edition.

1664
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,400
So yeah.

1665
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:21,040
And then we had one good movie and a bunch of crap after that.

1666
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,480
And Utah Saints remix.

1667
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,480
That's right.

1668
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,480
Good stuff.

1669
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,480
The first movie was so good.

1670
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,280
How could the second movie be so bad?

1671
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:34,180
An interesting kind of like FYI from Dark Tetsuya in the chat room saying again back

1672
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:38,200
on the Raiden thing or Raiden, but I have to go here because Dark Tetsuya says, I think

1673
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:41,240
that was because of Fatal Furies Raiden at the time.

1674
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,240
That's right.

1675
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:46,120
I think that's why they had ended up in later games, they had changed the spelling was because

1676
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:47,480
of the Fatal Fury character.

1677
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:48,920
I don't know.

1678
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:49,920
All right.

1679
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,120
We're done with that topic.

1680
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:53,820
I just, I had, I thought I kind of went, Oh yeah.

1681
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:54,820
When I read that comment.

1682
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:58,600
The TV show was actually kind of okay.

1683
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:59,600
It was...

1684
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,600
They also had a cartoon.

1685
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,600
Well, they had the web series on YouTube not that long ago.

1686
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,600
Cartoon was awful.

1687
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,600
What, the cartoon?

1688
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:05,600
The cartoon was awful.

1689
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,600
The web series was kind of neat.

1690
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,040
They had some big actors in it.

1691
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:09,880
I'm surprised about that.

1692
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:10,880
All right.

1693
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:11,880
All right.

1694
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:12,880
I have a Mortal Kombat story.

1695
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:13,880
All right.

1696
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:14,880
Yeah.

1697
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:22,840
Did you guys see that there, the subway or the 12 minute YouTube subway ad that this

1698
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,840
band did?

1699
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:24,840
No.

1700
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:25,840
What?

1701
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,080
Where they, they sing $5 foot long for like 12 minutes.

1702
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:31,660
They're all in Mortal Kombat cosplay.

1703
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:37,320
Actually it starts with like Sub-Zero in Scorpion and Scorpion on the mic, you know, Sub-Zero

1704
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:38,320
on the drums.

1705
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,320
Wait.

1706
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:40,320
Is that on YouTube?

1707
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,320
It's on YouTube.

1708
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,320
It's called...

1709
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,320
I don't know.

1710
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,320
12 minutes, $5 foot long.

1711
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,520
And they're like $5 foot long.

1712
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:47,520
And then as the...

1713
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,520
There it is.

1714
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,520
Your classic game of the week, Mortal Kombat.

1715
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:50,840
Now I gotta find this $5 foot long.

1716
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:56,200
As it's going on, more and more cosplay, you know, like Molina and like all kinds of other

1717
01:45:56,200 --> 01:46:00,600
characters come in with their subways and they're like eating as he's singing $5 foot

1718
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:01,600
long.

1719
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,600
Oh my God.

1720
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,600
I think this is it.

1721
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:12,080
It's uh, it says 12 minute, $5 foot long cover by Mortal Komband.

1722
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,080
Is it?

1723
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:16,200
You know, I was going to end this with a really profound statement.

1724
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,800
Is $5 foot long the statement?

1725
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,800
No.

1726
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:22,800
I have to hear this.

1727
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,800
There's smoke.

1728
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,800
Are they going to sing the song or not?

1729
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,800
Scorpion on drums.

1730
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Dar Sakura, let's get to your statement while we wait for them to actually sing something.

1731
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,000
It's going to sound awful if it is.

1732
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
This sounds like a Wesley Willis song.

1733
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:58,100
So Time Magazine in 2012 had a quote that Mortal Kombat had become the boogeyman for

1734
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:01,320
anti-games activists and politicians.

1735
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:06,400
But the reason the 1992 classic remains seminal is because it broke the implicit taboo about

1736
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,000
what was okay to put in a game.

1737
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
And there you have it.

1738
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,080
All right, there it is.

1739
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,200
Your classic game of the week, $5 foot long.

1740
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,600
Oh, they're not even paying us to advertise.

1741
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,800
Look at that stealth marketing.

1742
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:20,480
I don't eat at Subway because of bread.

1743
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:23,400
The classic game of the week was $5 foot long.

1744
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,400
That's what you just said.

1745
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,400
That's what I just said.

1746
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:30,400
The classic game is Jamie kicking Rob's ass during the break.

1747
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,480
There might be a fatality.

1748
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,480
But stay tuned, guys, because we've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come,

1749
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,480
including some rapid-fire news.

1750
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:41,480
The FUGO Question of the Week and your calls at 1877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

1751
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,480
Orange Launch Radio.

1752
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,480
We've got more show to come.

1753
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:46,480
More Matt, more Exfer, more Shane.

1754
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:50,480
Maybe more Shane if he's not too busy playing Phoenix Wright.

1755
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:54,480
Plenty more of that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1756
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:08,400
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio live on this Sunday evening.

1757
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:13,400
Happy Groundhog Day because there's not any other bowl type of games going on today.

1758
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:17,400
Actually, we were talking during the break, and I think Matt, who is one of our guests tonight,

1759
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:23,400
was mentioning that one of the teams got annihilated in the Super Bowl or something.

1760
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,400
Do we want to spoil that?

1761
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:26,400
Okay.

1762
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,400
We're going to download this tomorrow.

1763
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,400
Watch it live or you didn't.

1764
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,400
I don't know people that DVR the Super Bowl game, but...

1765
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:36,400
Yeah, well, I actually don't know anything about football, but...

1766
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,400
Tough titty.

1767
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:38,400
I'm from Seattle.

1768
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,400
I'm happy the Seahawks won.

1769
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,400
So Seahawks won their first Super Bowl, right?

1770
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:43,400
Their first Super Bowl.

1771
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:44,400
All right.

1772
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,400
Congratulations.

1773
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:48,400
Now, that led to a topic we were talking about just briefly during the break.

1774
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,400
Speaking of Seattle, and I didn't bring this up earlier, you guys went to PAX last year.

1775
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,400
You guys go, like, a lot, don't you?

1776
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,400
Yeah, we love it.

1777
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,400
Since you're from Seattle?

1778
01:48:55,400 --> 01:49:00,400
Yeah, Christopher and I have gone the last two years and I've gone probably six or seven times since then.

1779
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,400
Yeah.

1780
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:04,400
I remember the first time I went, it was super small.

1781
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:14,400
You can buy a ticket at the door and the expo hall would be one small room and there'd be...

1782
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:18,400
You could play anything, but now it's like super long line.

1783
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,400
Yeah.

1784
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,400
It's really long, but it's really great.

1785
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,400
I was going to say, how does it feel though?

1786
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:27,400
Now that it's this big thing that everybody's into, do you kind of miss the old days?

1787
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:35,400
I do miss the old days, but I like how it is now because now there's so much excitement and it feels like a giant party almost.

1788
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:40,400
You see the enthusiasm of everyone and everyone's there.

1789
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:43,400
You know it's into things like me.

1790
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:46,400
You can probably smell the enthusiasm too.

1791
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:51,400
What does enthusiasm smell like?

1792
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,400
Probably B.O.

1793
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,400
All right, you guys are going back to PAX again this year, I imagine?

1794
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,400
Most definitely.

1795
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,400
As long as you can get a ticket.

1796
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,400
What are you most looking forward to out of this year's PAX?

1797
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,400
I guess it's too early to ask maybe, but...

1798
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,400
Yeah, I don't know.

1799
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:08,400
I mean, the thing I like the most actually is back to board games.

1800
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,400
At PAX, they have a huge board game.

1801
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,400
They always have a huge board game library.

1802
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,400
I was going to ask about that, yeah.

1803
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:19,400
We're always, my friends and I, we're just like, let's find something that we've never played before and check it out.

1804
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,400
Board games are expensive.

1805
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:23,400
I just remember Wil Wheaton signed my iPhone.

1806
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,400
That did happen at PAX.

1807
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,400
It wore off by the end of the day.

1808
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:30,400
Shane, are you going to try to go to one of these expos this year?

1809
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:36,400
It would be cool, especially now that it's not associated with Penny Arcade anymore, so it's tolerable.

1810
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:41,400
Do they have any big gaming shows in Kansas?

1811
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,400
I guess...

1812
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,400
Is there like a Wichita anime slash video game?

1813
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:49,400
I don't know if there's an anime thing, but no.

1814
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:52,400
I thought I'd ask.

1815
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,400
All right.

1816
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:54,400
Let's get back into the news.

1817
01:50:54,400 --> 01:51:02,400
We're running a little long tonight with all these great people in the studio, but we want to just run through the news here so we can get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1818
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,400
Not yet, because we've got plenty of news first.

1819
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:07,400
Rapid fire news, and I'm actually going to start us off.

1820
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:13,400
We were talking about online games earlier, and one online game that hasn't come up was The Secret World.

1821
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:16,400
But I know there's some people that are really into The Secret World.

1822
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:19,400
Well, some very interesting news regarding The Secret World this week.

1823
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:25,400
Funcom's offices, Funcom is the group that made The Secret World, they got raided.

1824
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,400
And this is coming out of Norwegian.

1825
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:31,400
Was it like a 20-man raid?

1826
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:36,400
I don't know how many people are on the police force in Norway.

1827
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:41,400
I almost said Norwegian, but I corrected myself and said Norway.

1828
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:46,400
I don't know how many people are on the police force in Norway who went to where these guys are located in Oslo.

1829
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:52,400
But yeah, they went to get boxes of seized documents.

1830
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:58,400
And yeah, apparently the reason why, infringement of the provisions of the Securities Trading Act.

1831
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:05,400
Now, of course, Funcom came out later and said, move along, everything's fine, nothing happened, the game's still being made, we're good, y'all.

1832
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:10,400
But certainly it made a lot of people raise their eyebrows if they got raided.

1833
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:15,400
All right, moving on to news on Pac-Man Museum.

1834
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:20,400
If you were looking forward to getting Pac-Man Museum, yes, yet another repackaging of various Pac-Man games.

1835
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,400
Does anybody even want this game? Because I think the answer is no.

1836
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:27,400
Dark Sakura, you like Namco stuff. Do you want Pac-Man Museum?

1837
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:30,400
I do. How many freaking versions of Pac-Man do I have to own?

1838
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:31,400
Exactly.

1839
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,400
Don't you want Pac and Pal again?

1840
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,400
All right, well here's the thing.

1841
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,400
I want baby Pac-Man, okay? That's it.

1842
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:45,400
If you were looking forward to this on the 3DS or Wii U, tough titty, because the games are no longer coming out. It was cancelled.

1843
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:52,400
The game was announced last summer and it was supposed to come out on Steam, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and then Wii U and 3DS eShops.

1844
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:57,400
But then it was updated to remove the references to Wii U and 3DS.

1845
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:03,400
And the reason why they got cancelled? Quote, a result of delayed development.

1846
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,400
Hmmm.

1847
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:06,400
Made sense.

1848
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:07,400
Hmmm.

1849
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,400
All right, so there you go.

1850
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:13,400
Also, one quick story here on The Wolf Among Us.

1851
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:18,400
This was a game from Telltale that they did last year that a lot of people were talking about.

1852
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,400
It's like one of their favorite games of the year.

1853
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:24,400
I have yet to play it sadly, but I'm really excited to check it out.

1854
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:33,400
Episode 2, Smoke and Mirrors, has been announced that it is coming out for PC, Mac, and PlayStation 3 on February 4th.

1855
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:36,400
Xbox 360 the very next day.

1856
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:40,400
Telltale announced that news and I know a lot of people will be very happy to hear about that.

1857
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,400
The Wolf Among Us.

1858
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:47,400
Okay, there's giggling going on because of something that you brought up earlier about JCPenney being drunk.

1859
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,400
Wasn't that really funny, the tweets you're making?

1860
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:51,400
Yeah, but Kia.

1861
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:52,400
I love Kia.

1862
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,400
Kia came and said do you need a Disney dress?

1863
01:53:54,400 --> 01:54:00,400
They came out, JCPenney came out later and said they were typing with mittens that are available at JCPenney.

1864
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:05,400
Yeah, were those mittens soaked in alcohol that they were spilling all over themselves?

1865
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:09,400
You know what? I call it a brilliant viral marketing move.

1866
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,400
Like, okay, everybody's talking about it.

1867
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:15,400
I didn't even watch the damn Super Bowl, but I heard about that Radio Shack commercial, which was awesome.

1868
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:16,400
I didn't hear about that.

1869
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:22,400
The Radio Shack commercial was, hey, we're that store from the 1980s.

1870
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:29,400
And then all these 1980s icons run into the store like Alf and Mary Lou Retton and all this stuff.

1871
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:32,400
And then they say, you know, we're not just that store from the 80s anymore.

1872
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,400
So it was very, very like, tongue in cheek.

1873
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:38,400
What's the assurance when I keep seeing hashtags for on Twitter all over the place?

1874
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:39,400
I don't know.

1875
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:44,400
Somebody tell me because it looks like it might be a contest.

1876
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:49,400
You can tell Shane in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, although he'll have to look over my shoulder to see it, I guess.

1877
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:50,400
I can't see it.

1878
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,400
Go home, JCPenney. You're drunk.

1879
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:53,400
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for rapid fire news?

1880
01:54:53,400 --> 01:55:00,400
Well, in other news, it's stupid machinery that I actually really love, the Apple technology.

1881
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:05,400
There is sad news in the gaming world, and that has to deal with cave.

1882
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:09,400
You know, we have lots of listeners who are totally cave shooter fans.

1883
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:22,400
Well, and if this gives you an idea of, you know, just what cave's done, it was DeathSmiles, Dodonpachi, Espagaluda, Espagaluda 2.

1884
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:28,400
But they basically are closing their western offices. They've closed their English blog.

1885
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:35,400
And I think the last thing that they've done was the DeathSmiles 2X, which was untranslated.

1886
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,400
They just published it over here.

1887
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:41,400
So, that's sadness, but we will still be importing them.

1888
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:45,400
Were they found in their apartment with a needle in their arm, too, like Philip Seymour Hoffman?

1889
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:49,400
Stop it! Why would you say that?

1890
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:53,400
What even provoked you to say such an awful thing?

1891
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:55,400
Is your name Extafirm?

1892
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:57,400
He's laughing at it.

1893
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:58,400
I am laughing.

1894
01:55:58,400 --> 01:55:59,400
Your fans are awful.

1895
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:01,400
Here's my thing. Here's my thing. Okay, okay.

1896
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:04,400
I'm gonna make one little political comment, and then I'm gonna move on to the rest of this.

1897
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:08,400
Oh, boy. When she says one little political comment, brace yourself.

1898
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:13,400
Why is it that everybody is all like, oh, he's going to be so missed, and it's such a shame he was battling drugs,

1899
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:19,400
when if it was just a regular person on the street that died of a heroin overdose, you'd call him a fucking junkie?

1900
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:21,400
What's up with that?

1901
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,400
He was a fucking junkie. I'm sorry.

1902
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,400
Yeah, he was. Well, stop with that!

1903
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:29,400
They found him with a needle hanging out of his body.

1904
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,400
Look what you did! Look what you did!

1905
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:34,400
That had nothing to do with video games!

1906
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:39,400
Are you just mad that nobody answered your question about dumbass insurance or whatever it was you were asking about?

1907
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:41,400
Yes, that's what they get punished for.

1908
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:45,400
Apparently it's too soon, because that's all I'm seeing in the chat room.

1909
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:51,400
Video games, people. Video games.

1910
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:55,400
He is about to be a Cards Against Humanity card pretty soon.

1911
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:56,400
He is.

1912
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,400
May I go back to my serious thing?

1913
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,400
Yes.

1914
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:06,400
Why is it that celebrities are held to a higher standard for doing the same fuckery that we belittle other people for?

1915
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,400
God damn it, I thought serious thing meant video game news.

1916
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:13,400
Just think about your double standards, people.

1917
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:15,400
Okay, so moving forward.

1918
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:17,400
Don't nod.

1919
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:26,400
There was a rumor, and I actually read the rumor on Eurogamer myself, that they filed for bankruptcy, but they actually did not file for bankruptcy.

1920
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:36,400
They did something in France called judicial reorganization that allows them to basically reorganize the company without having to file for bankruptcy.

1921
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:40,400
And by the way, this is the company that did Remember Me for Capcom.

1922
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:44,400
And then last, but not least, but very unsurprising news.

1923
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:50,400
Zynga bought another company, they bought Natural Motion, and then they fired 15% of their global workforce.

1924
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,400
So fuck you, Zynga.

1925
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:58,400
No, Jamie, tell us how you really feel.

1926
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:01,400
Alright.

1927
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:02,400
Moving on.

1928
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,400
I'm gonna make a bad joke.

1929
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:05,400
Oh no.

1930
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:07,400
I don't know if you're allowed to talk anymore.

1931
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:19,400
I wonder if King is gonna rip them off and fire 15% of their global workforce and repackage it as firing global workforce saga.

1932
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:28,400
This is why I don't visit often.

1933
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:33,400
This is why it'll be another five years before Shane's invited back on the show.

1934
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,400
Hey, it's the Fubo Question of the Week.

1935
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:37,400
Oh, what, Jamie?

1936
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:43,400
I'm just saying, people need to get their priorities straight and not live in, you know, the brave new world.

1937
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:51,400
I'm just saying Fubo Question of the Week, y'all.

1938
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:55,400
You take Facebook and Google Plus and you slam them together, you get Fubo.

1939
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:57,400
It's the Fubo Question of the Week.

1940
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,400
This week's question, very easy.

1941
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:01,400
Whatever could have inspired a question like this.

1942
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:06,400
What is your favorite sports game ever made and why?

1943
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:09,400
And I clearly said, by the way, at Facebook and Google, I said,

1944
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:16,400
Don't be a party pooper with the I hate all sports answer because there's more sports than those that involve balls.

1945
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,400
Yes, I said balls.

1946
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,400
How many people said that they hate all sports?

1947
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,400
You shouldn't read them.

1948
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:23,400
I'm not going to read them.

1949
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,400
But we can make fun of them. Read their names.

1950
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:27,400
Okay, I will.

1951
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:29,400
Osfer says, NFL Blitz.

1952
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:33,400
That series was just plain silly and I loved playing as a bald eagle that caught on fire.

1953
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:37,400
It would be all kinds of need if that's actually how Super Bowl games win.

1954
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:40,400
Unfolded Raptor says, Harry Potter Quidditch World Cup.

1955
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:43,400
You know, that's a creative answer. Great answer.

1956
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:49,400
It's the closest thing you get to playing real Quidditch without actually going outside on a broom beating balls into vertical hoops with a stick.

1957
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,400
It plays a lot like soccer and is a lot of fun.

1958
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:56,400
The game was fairly overlooked, but as a sports game, I find it to be an underrated gem.

1959
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:59,400
Andy R. replied and said, Blizz Ball.

1960
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:03,400
I think you meant to say Blitz Ball and I'm assuming that's from Final Fantasy X.

1961
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:07,400
Rob H. says, California games on the Sega Master System 2.

1962
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:11,400
But I've always loved the WWE SmackDown games since PlayStation 1.

1963
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:16,400
But I've gone off of them since the 360 and PlayStation 3 era.

1964
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:20,400
I also have a soft spot for Sensible Soccer on the Amiga.

1965
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:25,400
It's one of those games that's fun, simple multiplayer and I spent a lot of time on that with my brother and friends in the early 90s.

1966
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:29,400
Sly Red Panda says, Beach Spikers for the GameCube.

1967
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:34,400
Great mechanics and design and you can do four player versus, two versus two co-op matches.

1968
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:37,400
It's one of the few games my non-gamer cousins love to play.

1969
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:43,400
There's nothing better than throwing shade at your opponents by smashing their faces in via a full powered volleyball spike.

1970
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,400
And that's followed by a heart.

1971
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:49,400
Monty Boggs says, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey.

1972
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:51,400
I've never had an interest in hockey but that game is great.

1973
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:55,400
Delvin, our buddy from Video Game Realness.

1974
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,400
That's a really hilarious show, by the way.

1975
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,400
Check that out, Video Game Realness.

1976
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:01,400
Delvin says, Skate or Die is pretty rad.

1977
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:03,400
And also, Paperboy.

1978
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,400
Yes, that's right, Paperboy.

1979
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:10,400
Because dodging bitches with bats and people exercising in the street and assholes who back out randomly is a sport.

1980
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:13,400
Of course, there's the bonus round that's actually more sports-like.

1981
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:17,400
Tech 2030 says, SSX Tricky on PlayStation 2.

1982
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,400
It was insane, unrealistic and I loved it.

1983
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:23,400
Renji221 says, NBA 2K11.

1984
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:25,400
That was the first basketball I played in years.

1985
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:29,400
Eddie K says, always been a fan of most NHL games.

1986
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,400
Being Canadian and all.

1987
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:34,400
Also, the most recent UFC games were really good.

1988
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:38,400
And although it's not technically a sport, I've always had a soft spot for pro wrestling games.

1989
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:42,400
Strudels89 says, I was a huge fan of NBA Street on the GameCube.

1990
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,400
Basketball is my favorite sport.

1991
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:48,400
I loved getting my meters up and just breaking the backboards doing those crazy tricks.

1992
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,400
Tim Tripp says, Bushido Blade.

1993
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:52,400
Kendo is totally a sport.

1994
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:59,400
Tiara says, if poker counts as a sport, since they show it on ESPN, sure it counts.

1995
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:03,400
Then my favorite sports game ever created is Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII.

1996
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:08,400
It's probably one of the most fun minigames in the Final Fantasy series other than Chocobo Hot and Cold.

1997
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:13,400
But it wasn't nearly as good as Chocobo Racers, just saying that game was the bomb.

1998
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:17,400
AZHP said, I just recently discovered a Neo Geo gem called Windjammers.

1999
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,400
I think it came out in America as Flying Power Disc.

2000
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,400
Dark Soccer is probably the only person who heard of it though.

2001
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:25,400
I've heard of Windjammers actually. I haven't heard of the US one.

2002
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:29,400
Codeman says, my favorite sports game is and always will be NBA Jam.

2003
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:33,400
I always played a lot of it in arcades and console and well, best catch phrases ever.

2004
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,400
Boom Shakalaka.

2005
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:39,400
CyberJudge says, I have to say that I love hockey and soccer games in general.

2006
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:43,400
But the one game that sticks in my mind when I think of sports games is the very first sport game I owned on NES.

2007
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:45,400
Blades of Steel.

2008
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:51,400
The joys of 8-bit graphics, blue and red, nameless guys skating around in fights out in the yin yang.

2009
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:53,400
The best.

2010
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:56,400
Generate Johnny says, I'm going with Mutant League Hockey.

2011
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:01,400
Why? What's not to love about robots, undead and trolls playing hockey together?

2012
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:05,400
Besides, the only hockey game that turns a traditional hockey fight into a brutal deathmatch.

2013
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:11,400
Ryan B. responds and says, here is the game that tops all sports games.

2014
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,400
Tecmo Bowl or Super Tecmo Bowl.

2015
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:16,400
It was way better than Madden, better than NFL Live or Blitz.

2016
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:19,400
Hell, I'm shocked that nobody said Daytona USA.

2017
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:25,400
Haseo Sumerugawa says, I'm going to just say Mirror's Edge.

2018
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:30,400
Because Parker is technically a sport and the game is centered around using Parker to get around.

2019
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:35,400
So yeah, otherwise NBA Jam on the Genesis because Boom Shakalaka.

2020
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:38,400
Backwards Glance says, Super Monkey Boxing.

2021
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:41,400
Beating up a friend as a cute monkey. I also love their billiards.

2022
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:45,400
NFL Blitz is the answer from Matt Jay.

2023
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:49,400
The only traditional sports game I ever got into.

2024
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:53,400
Now if you're willing to step beyond anything really traditional, then I'd go with Mario Kart.

2025
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:58,400
Have owned nearly every title in the series and loved every single one.

2026
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:02,400
Going over to Google Plus real quick, we just have a few answers over there.

2027
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:05,400
Rettertainment says, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004.

2028
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:09,400
I like golf games in general and Tiger Woods PGA Tour especially.

2029
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:13,400
But the 2004 model of the game is the first Tiger Woods game I really sunk my teeth into.

2030
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:17,400
The experience I had playing this game is what I compare other sports games to.

2031
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:24,400
Sam H said, NFL 2K5 had 3, 5, and 7 step drops with actual play verbiage.

2032
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:28,400
True pocket passing and offensive lineman and receivers blocking correctly in the run game.

2033
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:33,400
And lastly, Jason. He's here tonight through the Fugu question who says,

2034
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:36,400
The Mario sports games have been incredibly impressive.

2035
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:40,400
I had a ton of fun with Mario Strikers, Tennis, Virtual Boy, and GameCube alike.

2036
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:43,400
And really all the Mario universe party games.

2037
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:47,400
I generally don't like golf games, but Mario Golf was fun and approachable.

2038
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:53,400
With just enough charm and tweaks to the way the game played to make it really worth, sorry,

2039
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:57,400
to make it a worthwhile and even legitimate golf game.

2040
02:04:57,400 --> 02:05:00,400
Really hotshots golf with a recognizable brand attached.

2041
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:06,400
So I'd probably pick NFL Blitz as my favorite. After naming all those games.

2042
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:13,400
Alright. There. I read all the answers because the last couple weeks I've been skipping some of the answers and I felt bad.

2043
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:16,400
How about you guys? Quickly. Like favorite sports games.

2044
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:18,400
Shane, do you have a sports game?

2045
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:21,400
Yes, I played the crap out of Ken Griffey on Super Nintendo.

2046
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:26,400
It was part of, I think, the Nintendo Power Fest one year and so I wanted to get good at it.

2047
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:29,400
I played it non-stop and I ended up liking it a lot.

2048
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:35,400
My favorite sports game, and I can't believe nobody named it, is Kirby's Dream Course on the Super Nintendo.

2049
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:37,400
It's cause Act F didn't answer tonight.

2050
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,400
It's miniature golf. What? It counts?

2051
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,400
He was too busy clopping.

2052
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:49,400
I would also say, honestly, Wii Sports Bowling really changed everything in many ways.

2053
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:52,400
So, I don't know. I kind of have to tip my hat to that too.

2054
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,400
But of course I loved a lot of the stuff you guys named too.

2055
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,400
Like NBA Jam and Blades of Steel. Of course, of course.

2056
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:57,400
Extrovert?

2057
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:04,400
I think the only sports game, besides fighting games if you consider that sports, I don't know.

2058
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,400
Would boxing be considered?

2059
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:10,400
Sure, why not?

2060
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,400
I love Mike Tyson's Punch Out.

2061
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:15,400
Fifth Dream just said that in the chat and I was like, that's a really good answer.

2062
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:18,400
And Super Punch Out was one of my favorite games ever.

2063
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:19,400
Sure, of course, boxing is sports.

2064
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:22,400
Oh, and NBA Jam. I liked that a lot too when that was around.

2065
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:23,400
Jamie?

2066
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:27,400
Well, actually, you just named all of the ones that I liked too.

2067
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:33,400
Also, the one football game that I have to really say I liked was Super High Impact on the Super Nintendo.

2068
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:35,400
Last but not least, Matt?

2069
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:39,400
Not sure if I'd call it a sports game, but I really liked Excitebike way back.

2070
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:40,400
That game's awesome.

2071
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:41,400
It's Motocross.

2072
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:42,400
So why not? Why not?

2073
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:45,400
There was a Game Boy version of that that was really good.

2074
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:46,400
Or no one.

2075
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,400
There was Motocross Maniacs, I think, was the Game Boy.

2076
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:52,400
And then there was Uniracer on the Super Nintendo, which kind of reminded me of Excitebike.

2077
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:53,400
Yeah, Uniracer was fun.

2078
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:56,400
I don't know why that game really reminded me of Excitebike, and I really liked it.

2079
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,400
I loved Excite Truck, though. You know that.

2080
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,400
Actually, there is a game.

2081
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:03,400
Hydro Thunder.

2082
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:06,400
Hydro Thunder was super, super fun.

2083
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,400
A lot of good racing games out there. A lot of good stuff.

2084
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:12,400
Let's just say F-Zero. It's a racing game.

2085
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:17,400
That's a very good way of looking at it. Why not? F-Zero's amazing.

2086
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:20,400
Alright, let's do some more news here before we get to some calls.

2087
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:25,400
Quickly, some updates on free games. Yay, free games.

2088
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:29,400
If you are an Xbox Live Gold member, you've got some free games coming your way.

2089
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:33,400
Dead Island is the free game right now. That's the original.

2090
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:37,400
But I'm sure if you like Dead Island enough, they'll be happy to sell you.

2091
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:40,400
Dead Island, the new one. Riptide? Is that the name of the new one?

2092
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:42,400
They'll sell you the sequel happily.

2093
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:45,400
But that's free right now if you want to experience Dead Island 1.

2094
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:50,400
Free starting on February 16th will be Toy Soldiers Cold War.

2095
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:55,400
I don't know anything about that game, but it's got a Rambo-looking guy and a Guile-looking guy on the front of it.

2096
02:07:55,400 --> 02:08:00,400
Man, Xbox Live games they get for free are such crappy games.

2097
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:05,400
They must hate their customers. That's what I'm seeing off that picture.

2098
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:07,400
Now let's talk about PlayStation Plus.

2099
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:12,400
And then going over to PlayStation Plus, here's the free games that are coming out on PlayStation Plus.

2100
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,400
They just posted a February preview.

2101
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:17,400
PlayStation 4 Outlast is going to be the free game on PlayStation 4.

2102
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,400
Oh, that's so scary. I don't know if I can do that.

2103
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:20,400
I know, right?

2104
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:26,400
On PlayStation 3, Metro Last Light, Payday 2, and Remember Me.

2105
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:27,400
Solid titles.

2106
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:28,400
Those are all going to be pretty good.

2107
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:30,400
And on the PlayStation Vita, this is pretty rad, too.

2108
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:34,400
ModNation Racers Road Trip, which was an okay launch title.

2109
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:40,400
But Street Fighter versus Tekken, which, you know, even though that game was kind of not the best fighting game,

2110
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:44,400
it's still a pretty high-profile title to be going free on the Vita.

2111
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,400
Again, with PlayStation Plus. Those are all coming in February.

2112
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:51,400
But are they getting Dead Island, the first game from like five years ago?

2113
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,400
No, they are not, actually.

2114
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,400
Dang.

2115
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,400
I know.

2116
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:56,400
Really upsetting.

2117
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:57,400
All right.

2118
02:08:57,400 --> 02:09:00,400
If only there was like a Humble Bundle I could have bought a while ago to have that in it.

2119
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,400
Dude, I think I got that one.

2120
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,400
But I did not get Dead Island because I did not install that.

2121
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:07,400
All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.

2122
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:09,400
Well, we do have other news.

2123
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:13,400
And it's actually really, really good news.

2124
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:26,400
There's been a study that came out that stated that playing relaxing video games actually will increase your positive social behavior.

2125
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,400
And they weren't just saying like just casual games.

2126
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:34,400
They included the Endless Ocean or the mini fishing game from Twilight Princess.

2127
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,400
They had Super Mario Galaxy, Wii Sports Resort.

2128
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:44,400
They even tested it against violent games and they said that they used the noise blast test.

2129
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:53,400
And basically said that it was the relaxing games caused better social behavior.

2130
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:57,400
Of course, it's not saying that violent games cause aggression.

2131
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:04,400
Just saying that they were overall less relaxed than those who played the more calming games.

2132
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:07,400
So, I mean, it's kind of a common sense duh thing.

2133
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:09,400
But at least we have a study behind it.

2134
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:12,400
Video games are good for you.

2135
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:16,400
It's always nice to hear more positive news like that come out of studies.

2136
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:22,400
See, and I find games where I kill lots of people to be highly relaxing so that makes me a much better person.

2137
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:24,400
Ace Trainer Jelly Bean.

2138
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:26,400
Which, by the way, I really like that name.

2139
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:28,400
And our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says,

2140
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:31,400
I believe it. Flower, the game, makes me feel so happy.

2141
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:35,400
Flower is a very like zen kind of game.

2142
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:42,400
I put it to how I use fractal to calm myself down before I'm about to go melty.

2143
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,400
I was talking about this last week, Minecraft.

2144
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:47,400
And when I was playing Minecraft and I was building that tunnel, somebody said,

2145
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:49,400
Oh, you want to use world edit to do it real quick?

2146
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:50,400
I'm like, no.

2147
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,400
It's like popping bubble wrap.

2148
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,400
It's therapeutic.

2149
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:56,400
I don't want to just click every little thing and make my own damn tunnel.

2150
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,400
I don't want to have the help.

2151
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,400
I mean, I appreciate it, but I don't want to do it myself.

2152
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:04,400
Well, that's kind of how I feel about doing stuff in Minecraft as well.

2153
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:15,400
But a friend of mine showed me another iOS game that is called Art of Glow.

2154
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:19,400
And really, it's just like having a moving light bright on your phone.

2155
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:25,400
But at the same time, it was just super relaxing and it gives another focus for,

2156
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:29,400
I think, any type of emotion that happens to pop up.

2157
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:33,400
Or, you know, like how we all felt after playing a music game.

2158
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:35,400
You know, you have happy music.

2159
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,400
You have the activity that goes with it.

2160
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:41,400
And that really, I think, also changes the mental state.

2161
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:44,400
Now, on the other end of the spectrum, I downloaded an iOS game this week

2162
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:46,400
that everybody's been talking about.

2163
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:51,400
An iOS game this week that everybody's been talking about called Flappy Bird.

2164
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:53,400
Fucking hell.

2165
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:57,400
This game is straight from the bowels of hell by Satan himself.

2166
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:58,400
I refuse to play it.

2167
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,400
Let me play it.

2168
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:00,400
I have a void.

2169
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,400
You want to play it?

2170
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:02,400
I have a void.

2171
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:03,400
Candy Crush.

2172
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:04,400
Flappy Bird.

2173
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:05,400
I have a void.

2174
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:07,400
All you do is you tap the screen to flap the bird.

2175
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:09,400
And you're going to fly through the pipes, okay?

2176
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:12,400
And try not to hit Mario while you're at it.

2177
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,400
Because it looks like...

2178
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:15,400
No, it's nothing to do with Mario.

2179
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:17,400
It's more techno kitten adventure than Mario.

2180
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:18,400
Okay.

2181
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:19,400
Shane's...

2182
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:21,400
Oh, he died already before he even got to the first pipe.

2183
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:22,400
Way to go.

2184
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,400
You fly through the pipes.

2185
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:26,400
You're supposed to not play it and play a good game.

2186
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:31,400
All you do is you tap to flap, and you fly through the pipes.

2187
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:32,400
Way to go.

2188
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,400
Mom, did you say tap to flap?

2189
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,400
Tap to flap.

2190
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:37,400
This is the worst game.

2191
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:38,400
Did you pay for this?

2192
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:39,400
No, it's free.

2193
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:41,400
You get your money back.

2194
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:42,400
Too much.

2195
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:43,400
Too much.

2196
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:44,400
My best score is 11.

2197
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:48,400
And then for the pony version, you bop to the crop.

2198
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:50,400
Shut up.

2199
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:55,400
Shane, do you have a zen game that you play to relax?

2200
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:56,400
To relax?

2201
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:58,400
And get yourself at peace?

2202
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:00,400
Like maybe you should have played it before coming to the show tonight?

2203
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,400
Super hexagon.

2204
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,400
That game is stressful.

2205
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,400
That game is awesome.

2206
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:08,400
I can just play it for like an hour and not even care.

2207
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:09,400
That's like me playing fractal.

2208
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:13,400
I kind of get a little frustrated with it, but I have such a good time.

2209
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:17,400
Ragenator in chat says, DarkSakura wants to flip Flappy Bird the bird?

2210
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:20,400
No, I want to pretend it doesn't exist in my version of reality.

2211
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:23,400
Who makes it so I know not to get their games ever?

2212
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:27,400
Extifer or Matt, do you have a zen game that you?

2213
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:32,400
I'm going to go with Rocksmith 2014.

2214
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:36,400
I second that.

2215
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:43,400
Well, that's perfectly legitimate. Music is an outlet for the soul.

2216
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:45,400
Do not justify his answer.

2217
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,400
I'm totally justifying your answer.

2218
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:50,400
Rayman Legends, I just want to get that one in there.

2219
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:54,400
Well, I play Mass Effect 3 still because it's got a great engine.

2220
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:57,400
Even if I don't really care for the story in 3 as much as the first one.

2221
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:01,400
It has a great engine and I get to shoot people and make my Shepard look pretty.

2222
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:03,400
That's calming.

2223
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:07,400
I don't know if these are zen-like relaxing games.

2224
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:10,400
No, these are games also that make you want to scream.

2225
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:14,400
These are awesome games. They're games by Treasure Games.

2226
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:17,400
Which, you know, they recently did a green light campaign for Ikaruga.

2227
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:22,400
Well, now Treasure is considering doing a new, original game for PC.

2228
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:28,400
That's right, the makers of Gunstar Heroes and Bangayo and a lot of great classic shooter games.

2229
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:31,400
They could be making other games for Steam.

2230
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:36,400
This was from a comment from Treasure President Masato Megawa who said,

2231
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:39,400
Ikaruga is the first one and we don't intend on stopping there.

2232
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:42,400
There are some players who say, how about Radiant Silver Gun?

2233
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:44,400
But we also don't intend to do only ports.

2234
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:48,400
We're thinking of making a new, original title for the platform, Steam.

2235
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:56,400
Well, and keep in mind Treasure, it's not just Radiant Silver Gun and Ikaruga.

2236
02:14:56,400 --> 02:15:02,400
They did Silhouette Mirage, which is one of the best Saturn games ever.

2237
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:05,400
Have you literally done every Treasure game as a classic game of the week now at this point?

2238
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:09,400
No, I have not. Because I don't think I did Miss Shiftmakers.

2239
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:16,400
And I don't think I've done... I think I've done Bangayo. I've done...

2240
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:17,400
Well, anyway.

2241
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,400
I think I did Radiant Silver. You know, I forgot to play that in Arcade.

2242
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:22,400
Do you want them to make a shooter? Do you want them to do something a little more outside the box?

2243
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:24,400
I want another platformer.

2244
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:27,400
And Gunstar Heroes is freaking amazing.

2245
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:32,400
Which I'm still irritated at my husband because I bought him Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear.

2246
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,400
He still has not opened the damn box.

2247
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,400
Rude.

2248
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:36,400
How rude.

2249
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:41,400
Let's go to the mailbag. Dark Soccer's gonna open up the mailbag box right now.

2250
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:42,400
No, I'm not.

2251
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:43,400
Yes, you are.

2252
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:44,400
The mailbag box?

2253
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,400
Yes.

2254
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:46,400
Is it a bag or a box?

2255
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:48,400
It's both. It's a box made out of bag.

2256
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:51,400
It's one of those bags with the hinged cover on it.

2257
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:52,400
Yes, shaped like a box.

2258
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,400
It's a bag.

2259
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:55,400
It's like a Chinese takeout.

2260
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:56,400
It's a Bax.

2261
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:57,400
Alright, anyway.

2262
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:58,400
It's a Bax.

2263
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:02,400
Dark Soccer's gonna go to your emails at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2264
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:04,400
and Dark Soccer's gonna jump into the mailbag head first

2265
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,400
and hopefully she doesn't drown in all those spam emails.

2266
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,400
But she's gonna find the legit ones and read them now.

2267
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:10,400
I have no idea what you're talking about, Elliot B.

2268
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:13,400
Um, hey O.L.R. I don't know if this will translate to radio

2269
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:17,400
but I felt the need to share this inspired use of screenshots in the App Store.

2270
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,400
I have no idea if this game is any good.

2271
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:23,400
I'm gonna click it and it'll probably pull up my App Store.

2272
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:26,400
If it pulls up Flappy Bird, I'm gonna poop my pants with laughter.

2273
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:27,400
If it's Flap Prisma Drop.

2274
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:29,400
Oh, bummer.

2275
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:34,400
Um, I don't know. I don't think it's gonna work.

2276
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:38,400
Is this stealth advertising for, I mean, it looks, it's all like rainbows and pretty things.

2277
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:39,400
I like rainbows and pretty things.

2278
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:40,400
Wait, keep going though.

2279
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:42,400
Like, is there, I'm wondering, is there a joke in there?

2280
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:44,400
Like, if you look at all the screenshots, can't you swipe?

2281
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:45,400
I, no.

2282
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:46,400
Oh, that's weird.

2283
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:48,400
I don't see, oh, there we go.

2284
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:51,400
No, that's just not very good.

2285
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:56,400
I think maybe you're thinking of the PC App Store, so no, I, no.

2286
02:16:56,400 --> 02:17:00,400
Oh, it's trying to bring it up in my, in my iOS App Store and no.

2287
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:03,400
We have to look at it on, on a computer.

2288
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:09,400
This is from Imus, which I'm guessing is I, it's spelled E-Y-E-M-U-S,

2289
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,400
so I'm guessing I-E-mus.

2290
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:13,400
Or a-ye-mus, maybe?

2291
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:14,400
Hello, OLR.

2292
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:16,400
I'd first like to congratulate Loki on his new arrival

2293
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:18,400
and hope he has a lot of sleep and rest in the coming months.

2294
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:20,400
I'm writing because in the last week's show,

2295
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:22,400
I think you misunderstood the issue that the majority of people had

2296
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:24,400
with the Machinima debacle.

2297
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:27,400
The problem wasn't that they were paying YouTubers to say good things

2298
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:29,400
about Microsoft as part of an ad,

2299
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:32,400
but the fact that part of the contract said they were not allowed to mention

2300
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:37,400
that it was a paid ad in the first place, which is against FTC guidelines.

2301
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:40,400
And, let me find where I was.

2302
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:43,400
This is an issue because it would be like if it was revealed that

2303
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:46,400
Dark Soccer was getting paid by EA to talk favorably about Mass Effect

2304
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:48,400
all this time and not because she actually loved the game.

2305
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:50,400
Well, that's not true.

2306
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:51,400
You got us.

2307
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:54,400
Or if Loki got money every time he mentioned GTA and how great it is.

2308
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:56,400
That's not true either.

2309
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:59,400
It would cause all listeners to take everything else that you say

2310
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:02,400
with a skeptical eye in the future and your credibility would be shot,

2311
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:04,400
if it's not already.

2312
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:08,400
In every previous contract that Machinima and other outlets have,

2313
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:11,400
they say that you must include the fact that this is a paid promotion,

2314
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:14,400
but for some reason this deal with Microsoft said the exact opposite,

2315
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:16,400
that you can't mention it's an ad.

2316
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:19,400
Love the show and keep up the great work you guys do every week.

2317
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:20,400
Thank you.

2318
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:21,400
Thank you.

2319
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:23,400
And I thought we had talked about that.

2320
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:24,400
I mean, maybe we didn't.

2321
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:25,400
We talked a lot about that.

2322
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:27,400
I thought we had brought up that part of it was that, you know,

2323
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:29,400
they weren't talking about it and mentioning it.

2324
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:31,400
We kind of talked about how with product placement,

2325
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:33,400
a lot of times they don't mention it.

2326
02:18:33,400 --> 02:18:36,400
But what that emailer did bring up that I don't think we really talked about

2327
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:40,400
last week was that stark difference between usually you do say it's an ad

2328
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:42,400
and this is very different.

2329
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:45,400
But I still think a lot of the points that we brought up last week were still

2330
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:48,400
kind of valid even considering what you're saying.

2331
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:51,400
But thank you for clarifying because, yeah,

2332
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:54,400
that is a very good point that it's very different from what they were doing

2333
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:55,400
in the past.

2334
02:18:55,400 --> 02:18:58,400
Thank you for that email I miss.

2335
02:18:58,400 --> 02:19:01,400
Okay, this is another email.

2336
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:02,400
This is the last one.

2337
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:04,400
Hey, OLR, I've been listening to your podcast.

2338
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:06,400
Now for about three years and while I'm a fan of the show,

2339
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:08,400
I never take the time to write in.

2340
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:12,400
I recently signed up on Vogue Network under their user name, Andrew.

2341
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:14,400
Let me start off by saying congratulations to Loki on the new baby

2342
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:16,400
and to Jamie on her new fun job.

2343
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:17,400
That's right.

2344
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:19,400
It's called fun job.

2345
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:21,400
The reason for my email is because I recently started playing DC Universe

2346
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:23,400
on my PS4 because I'm a noob.

2347
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:26,400
Added it's really difficult to find a party to join up with.

2348
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:28,400
Rob, I know you recently picked up a PS4

2349
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:31,400
and if you or any listeners would like to make an OLR clan,

2350
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:32,400
that would be great.

2351
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:36,400
My PSN name is Andrew, as in A-N-D-R underscore capital U.

2352
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:38,400
By the way, I typed this on my phone,

2353
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:41,400
so if there are any typos, tough titties, Jamie, deal with it.

2354
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:45,400
You did miss a comma, but I will let this pass.

2355
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:49,400
You spelled everything correctly, so that spelling is, yeah.

2356
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:51,400
Was there a question in there? Sorry.

2357
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:56,400
No, I just wanted to say that he wanted to start an OLR clan on the PS4 DCU.

2358
02:19:56,400 --> 02:19:57,400
Oh, okay.

2359
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:02,400
I just wanted to say that he wanted to start an OLR clan on the PS4 DCU.

2360
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:07,400
Oh, you know, I haven't played a lot on DCU, I have to be honest.

2361
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:08,400
Not since the beta.

2362
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:11,400
And I started a new character and I keep getting sidetracked

2363
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:13,400
because Final Fantasy XIV is my MMO right now.

2364
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:16,400
But I would be totally down with a VOG clan.

2365
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:18,400
I would have to talk to Brad from Pod Culture.

2366
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:20,400
He's the resident DC Universe expert at VOG

2367
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:23,400
and I'll have to see where he's playing and try to figure that all out.

2368
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:31,400
Our person, our reader here, Andrew, username is ANDR underscore U, Andrew.

2369
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:33,400
So, thank you.

2370
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:36,400
And that's it. I'm not reading any more, even if there were more.

2371
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:39,400
I'm kidding. I would, but not.

2372
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:43,400
So, Bobby Blackwolf, our good pal from VOGnetwork.com,

2373
02:20:43,400 --> 02:20:46,400
just joined our chat room and said,

2374
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:50,400
the emailer with the iOS App Store link is referencing the iPhone screenshots,

2375
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:52,400
not the iPad screenshots.

2376
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:55,400
I never realized there was a difference. I guess that makes sense.

2377
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:57,400
Well, since I'm on my iPad.

2378
02:20:57,400 --> 02:20:59,400
Yeah, so maybe that's why it didn't make sense.

2379
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:01,400
Well, I'm going to bring it up right now.

2380
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:02,400
You do that, Rob.

2381
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:05,400
I'm working on it.

2382
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:08,400
You know what, Raginator? I'm just going to boot you from the chat room right now.

2383
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:11,400
I'm misspelling everything. I can do it too.

2384
02:21:11,400 --> 02:21:12,400
I'm not going to ban you.

2385
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:13,400
Power trip.

2386
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:15,400
But I'm going to boot you because I can and it's hilarious.

2387
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:18,400
Okay, so that would explain why it made no sense to you.

2388
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:21,400
Look at that. Two more spam messages came in just in the time it took you.

2389
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:24,400
You know what? I'm about ready to offer up something different, so.

2390
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:26,400
Right? Annoying.

2391
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:30,400
Oh, my God. Okay, it is way funnier on the iPhone.

2392
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:34,400
Now I get it. See, so there's like they play any time anywhere.

2393
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:40,400
Play birthdays, play while parenting, play on your commute, play at your own funeral.

2394
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:42,400
Okay, that's funny.

2395
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:46,400
Why aren't the iPads, like Elliot's probably listening to the show going,

2396
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:49,400
did they not see the same thing I saw?

2397
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:52,400
No, we didn't. It's very different on iPad.

2398
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:56,400
And lol kidding, Raginator.

2399
02:21:56,400 --> 02:21:59,400
By the way, Rob, I have a suggestion for you after the show.

2400
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:00,400
Okay.

2401
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:01,400
About our email situation.

2402
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:03,400
Oh, yeah. Okay, great.

2403
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:05,400
All right, you done looking at that? You want to see this too?

2404
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:07,400
Since everybody's laughing at this, Shane?

2405
02:22:07,400 --> 02:22:08,400
That's hilarious, actually.

2406
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:11,400
Shane's too busy reading like gossip websites.

2407
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:13,400
What are you reading on your phone over there?

2408
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:14,400
I'm reading about Harry Potter.

2409
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:15,400
Reading about Harry Potter.

2410
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:19,400
That's okay, because I used to read Harry Potter during the show.

2411
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:20,400
All right.

2412
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:24,400
Every time a new Harry Potter book would come out, I would just read the book on the show.

2413
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:27,400
No, the one with the little baby crying.

2414
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:28,400
All right.

2415
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:29,400
Play on birthdays.

2416
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:31,400
Let's get to the FUs. They can't hear you, expert.

2417
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:33,400
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2418
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:50,400
This is fucked up.

2419
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:52,400
FUs of the week time.

2420
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:56,400
I guess I really don't have any.

2421
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:57,400
Well, okay.

2422
02:22:57,400 --> 02:23:03,400
FUs making a new friend at work just to have to have them move to Tulsa, Oklahoma.

2423
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:05,400
That was a really fucked up situation.

2424
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:07,400
Fuck you to his ex-remates.

2425
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:10,400
And I hope that life treats you better in Tulsa.

2426
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:13,400
Also...

2427
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:18,400
Acceptance, Oklahoma. Sorry, code man.

2428
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:25,400
I'm just really, I don't know, I'm a little bit just irritated at double standards.

2429
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:26,400
I'll put it that way.

2430
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:29,400
But I love my job and I wish I could tell everybody where it is that I'm working.

2431
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:33,400
So cool job is super fucking cool.

2432
02:23:33,400 --> 02:23:34,400
All right.

2433
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:38,400
Shane, do you have any FUs of the week or FUs of the past five years?

2434
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:42,400
The past five years? No.

2435
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:46,400
All right, then how about extrovert? Do you have any FUs of the week?

2436
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,400
I don't have anything.

2437
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:51,400
FU to life.

2438
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:55,400
No, I'm generally good, Rob.

2439
02:23:55,400 --> 02:23:58,400
All right. Well, FU to being happy. You don't get the point.

2440
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:00,400
No, I take it back. I got one.

2441
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:03,400
So, FU to my car dealership.

2442
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:08,400
I left my car there to get an oil change while I was gone and they're keeping it for like the week I'm gone.

2443
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:09,400
Yeah.

2444
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:13,400
And they ask for my phone number in case something goes wrong.

2445
02:24:13,400 --> 02:24:16,400
I'm like, okay, but you should already have it. So I give it to them.

2446
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:23,400
And on Thursday morning, I get a call from them at 6 a.m. Pacific time.

2447
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:24,400
Right.

2448
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:27,400
They don't leave the message. I'm like, holy crap, what's wrong with my car?

2449
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:32,400
I give them a call, call the wrong number.

2450
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:33,400
That's scary.

2451
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:35,400
Yeah. So they're jerks.

2452
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:37,400
Matt, do you have any FUs of the week?

2453
02:24:37,400 --> 02:24:39,400
Nope. Pretty happy.

2454
02:24:39,400 --> 02:24:41,400
God, y'all make me sick.

2455
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:47,400
I have an FU. FU to all the fuckers that keep texting me and calling me.

2456
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:49,400
I keep getting freaking wrong.

2457
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:51,400
Rebecca or something?

2458
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,400
No, Rachel.

2459
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:53,400
Rachel.

2460
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:58,400
Everybody wants to talk to Rachel and she doesn't even bother telling anybody she dropped her phone.

2461
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:06,400
Save a list of all of those people, send them a mass message, and then drop yourself from it so that they keep texting each other.

2462
02:25:06,400 --> 02:25:08,400
Oh, that's excellent.

2463
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:16,400
So I think that the Gold's Gym in Valencia needs to stop fucking calling me.

2464
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:20,400
I have called them and told them to take my number off their list.

2465
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,400
You're blowing out people's speakers, Exeter. Calm down.

2466
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:30,400
I have called them and politely asked them to change or drop my number and they won't stop calling me.

2467
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:34,400
I'm like, I don't know who you guys are. Stop calling me.

2468
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:36,400
Leave me alone, Rachel.

2469
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:37,400
Yeah.

2470
02:25:37,400 --> 02:25:42,400
My FU of the week, actually things are fairly alright so I don't have a lot of angsty stuff.

2471
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:50,400
FU to the fact that I missed all the fun this weekend when Shane got here because I had other real life commitments and stuff.

2472
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:52,400
I got here in the middle of the week, not even this weekend.

2473
02:25:52,400 --> 02:25:56,400
I know, but you know. I missed Espeduce, Sniff, OL.

2474
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:57,400
Yeah, it was really good.

2475
02:25:57,400 --> 02:25:59,400
Yeah, yeah, rub it in. That's fine. That's fine.

2476
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:01,400
I had like 15 chicken hearts.

2477
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:03,400
Did you demand everybody's chicken hearts?

2478
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:05,400
No, me and Annie fought over them though.

2479
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:06,400
Of course, of course.

2480
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:09,400
I wanted to go but I'm poor.

2481
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:16,400
Alright, one more story for you guys and then we're going to go to the Skypline at 1877 Game OLR.

2482
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:20,400
This one's really quick. You know, everybody's talking about Google Glass.

2483
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:22,400
Oh my God, y'all. Google Glass.

2484
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:24,400
Are you interested in Google Glass, Matt?

2485
02:26:24,400 --> 02:26:26,400
Would you replace your glasses with Google Glass?

2486
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:30,400
I don't know. It'd be fun.

2487
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:32,400
Well, now they have games on it.

2488
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:40,400
Some games you can download on Google Glass are Tennis, Balance, Clay Shooter, Matcher, and Shape Splitter.

2489
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:43,400
Do you just like move your head and shake it to play?

2490
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:47,400
So don't trust anybody driving with Google Glass on? Is that what we're saying?

2491
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:52,400
Well, you probably shouldn't but you can play these games with your Google Glass.

2492
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:55,400
I don't know where you would but I guess where do we play games today?

2493
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:58,400
On the subway or something. You wouldn't look weird at all.

2494
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:04,400
Balance has you using Glass's gyroscope to balance books on your head.

2495
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:05,400
Sounds like fun.

2496
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:10,400
Clay Shooter is like a first person shooter where you blast clay targets like Duck Hunt or something.

2497
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:13,400
Matcher is memory. You know, the tile matching game.

2498
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:18,400
And Shape Splitter is like Fruit Ninja. Can you imagine playing that game with your head?

2499
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:24,400
Playing Fruit Ninja. You'd look like you have a tick or something. It'd be very interesting.

2500
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:30,400
So, there you go. You can play those games on Google Glass if you like.

2501
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:35,400
I guess it's just the start of what is to come.

2502
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:38,400
Extrovert, would you get Google Glass?

2503
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:45,400
I don't think so. I saw a person with Google Glass at the Bay Street Mall in Emeryville a while back.

2504
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:50,400
That was kind of nifty. But they're like $1500.

2505
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:51,400
They're very expensive.

2506
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:53,400
I don't need it.

2507
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:57,400
Think about all the world peace you could buy with $1500. It's a lot.

2508
02:27:57,400 --> 02:28:02,400
Screw world peace. I want a damn shiny new electronic.

2509
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:05,400
That's what Google Glass is.

2510
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:06,400
It's world peace?

2511
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:08,400
No, it's a shiny new electronic.

2512
02:28:08,400 --> 02:28:14,400
Well, not in the form of Google Glass, is what I'm saying.

2513
02:28:14,400 --> 02:28:17,400
I want an Xbox One over Google Glass.

2514
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:21,400
Alright, we're going to go and open up the Skype line, y'all.

2515
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:28,400
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2516
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:30,400
And the phone is already ringing.

2517
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:32,400
Oh, they just disappeared.

2518
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:35,400
Somebody else is calling, so let's go to the next call.

2519
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:38,400
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2520
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:39,400
Hello?

2521
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:43,400
Hello? Bienvenidos a OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2522
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:45,400
Yo soy Mateo.

2523
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:47,400
Is this Grandpa?

2524
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:48,400
Is this Hoard House?

2525
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:51,400
No, this is not Hoard House. This is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2526
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:54,400
Ah, shit. My bad. Where's the end call button?

2527
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:56,400
Grandpa?

2528
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:57,400
Rob Roberts.

2529
02:28:57,400 --> 02:29:02,400
What are you up to? Why aren't you here with everybody else?

2530
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:03,400
I wasn't invited.

2531
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:04,400
Yes, you were. You're always invited.

2532
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:05,400
Why don't you ever come visit me?

2533
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:06,400
Yeah, why do you hate me?

2534
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:07,400
Why don't you ever come visit me?

2535
02:29:07,400 --> 02:29:12,400
You and Jamie were going to come down and visit me in San Francisco, but then you abandoned me.

2536
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:14,400
I actually had my first day of work.

2537
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:16,400
She started Cool Job.

2538
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:21,400
Jamie, your excuse is acceptable. Rob Roberts, no.

2539
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:26,400
Well, to what do we owe this phone call tonight? Do you want to talk about video games?

2540
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:28,400
Is there something in the news you'd like to talk about?

2541
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:34,400
Well, there was a major game that was played today that was a shit show for Denver Broncos.

2542
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:37,400
Oh, was that the Puppy Bowl?

2543
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:40,400
No, the Kitten Bowl.

2544
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:44,400
Oh, Rob, my little kumquat. No, it was the Super Bowl and it was a very, very depressing game.

2545
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:47,400
I was hoping that the Broncos would avenge the loss of the Niners to the Seahawks.

2546
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:52,400
If you're going to lose, don't you want to lose to the best?

2547
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:57,400
No, I just made Grandpa explode from logic, everybody. Look at that.

2548
02:29:57,400 --> 02:30:00,400
Mind blown. No, I just want to say hi. I'm a long time listener, first time caller.

2549
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:03,400
You have never called O.L.R. before, have you?

2550
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:05,400
No, you never invited me to.

2551
02:30:05,400 --> 02:30:09,400
I invite everybody to call. Did you not hear me? Just say, what are you drinking?

2552
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:14,400
I was drinking vodka orange juice. It's the only thing I have left in the house.

2553
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:16,400
You know what's at my house right now?

2554
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:18,400
Free willow.

2555
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:20,400
Home infused vanilla vodka.

2556
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:21,400
Sounds good.

2557
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:25,400
And mocha vodka that I also infused and Metaxa.

2558
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:27,400
Why is your elixir not all inside my mouth?

2559
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:29,400
Because you're not at my house.

2560
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:31,400
Why don't you guys get a room?

2561
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:33,400
Party at Darth Sockra's house after the show.

2562
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:36,400
Totally. Except after work tomorrow.

2563
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:41,400
Now, here's the best idea. Do you take your pinkberry and pour some of that vodka goodness on top?

2564
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:43,400
That sounds good.

2565
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:54,400
I just want to call and say hi. I'm looking forward to seeing Rob Roberts and his entourage Tuesday night as Shane departs back to the unforgettable, hospitable land of the Midwest.

2566
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:56,400
Tell everyone my personal schedule, why don't you?

2567
02:30:56,400 --> 02:31:05,400
Well, you said your schedule is the homosexual agenda, which means what? Breakfast at 8. Democratic posturing at 10.30.

2568
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:07,400
NPR for lunch.

2569
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:14,400
Definitely. And then adopt a gaybee at 1.30pm. Head to Grandpa's at 5.30.

2570
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:20,400
Alright. Do you want to plug your other little... I know you cannot leave this show until you plug your other little project.

2571
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,400
It's like you know me.

2572
02:31:22,400 --> 02:31:23,400
I know.

2573
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:33,400
Well, I wanted to. I wanted to make a continuous plug to my up and coming, well one episode anyway, project called the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.

2574
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:35,400
It's a Star Trek podcast you hope doesn't fail.

2575
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:37,400
There better be lots of DS9.

2576
02:31:37,400 --> 02:31:38,400
What's that?

2577
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:40,400
There better be lots of DS9.

2578
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:53,400
We were a little Star Trek Online Voyager heavy this last time, but all three hosts. We've got Lieutenant Commander Eddie who's been on Orange Lounge Radio in yesteryears and Dr. Ken who's been on Hoard House before.

2579
02:31:53,400 --> 02:32:02,400
We all have our different favorite series and we do talk about them, so check us out. We've only got one episode under our belt. It is a project. We're a little rough around the edges.

2580
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:08,400
We're not as refined and Caviar-esque as Orange Lounge Radio after two decades.

2581
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:10,400
I was like, this is episode 538.

2582
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:12,400
We are totally whale eggs here.

2583
02:32:12,400 --> 02:32:16,400
If you listen to episode one, it was a hot ass mess. Episode one was a hot ass mess.

2584
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:18,400
I had a migraine and passed out after the show.

2585
02:32:18,400 --> 02:32:20,400
Yeah, but...

2586
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:23,400
Damn, and you're still going at it almost 12 years later.

2587
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:27,400
I took two days off and lived in the Harry Potter closet in a gay frat house.

2588
02:32:27,400 --> 02:32:36,400
Before the other boys got here, I was just sitting here with Dark Sire before the show going, Dark Sire, that's 538 weeks we've been sitting here doing this show. It's so crazy.

2589
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:40,400
Plus your vacations, plus or minus, all that. It might be more like 600.

2590
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:48,400
Alright, Grandpa, I'm gonna go ahead and let you go so we can get more calls because I know there's other people trying to get through, but thanks for calling and everybody listen to Hoard House on Wednesday, alright?

2591
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:50,400
Can I at least give the website where to go to?

2592
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:52,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2593
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:54,400
Jesus. I can't take you anywhere.

2594
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:56,400
Sorry you're not on iTunes.

2595
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:58,400
Jesus doesn't have internet.

2596
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:13,400
Right now, before we get to iTunes, go to Facebook.com slash Starboard Power Coupling. You'll find questions and things to get involved with as well as the first episodes, so check us out and we look forward to your feedback and hopefully many, many more episodes on a podcast.

2597
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:17,400
That's Starboard Power Coupling.

2598
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:19,400
You say it so freaking fast.

2599
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:23,400
Get on iTunes and all that crap.

2600
02:33:23,400 --> 02:33:25,400
It's my project tonight, actually.

2601
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:26,400
Alright.

2602
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:27,400
Fine, I'll get off your line now.

2603
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:28,400
Great. Bye.

2604
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:29,400
Bye.

2605
02:33:29,400 --> 02:33:38,400
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Tech2030 in the chatroom saying, is there anywhere to listen to really old episodes of OLR?

2606
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:41,400
Uh, yes.

2607
02:33:41,400 --> 02:33:44,400
Let's go to the phones.

2608
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:54,400
I don't like to give it out because it was such a different show. Ask Dart Tetsuya. He's in the chatroom and he has the link to the archive for the really die hard, but I just, I always get the footnote.

2609
02:33:54,400 --> 02:34:01,400
It was a mess in the beginning, but it was a good way. I'm proud of it, but it was just very different. Don't expect to hear what you hear now.

2610
02:34:01,400 --> 02:34:04,400
Alright, we're going to go to the phones and take another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2611
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:08,400
Uh, Dave. Holy crap, I actually just got through.

2612
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:13,400
Holy crap! I know it is kind of hard to get through the show sometimes. What's up, Dave?

2613
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:30,400
Uh, not much. Just finished up dropping my brother off at UMass Amherst and I have told myself for probably the last like three months I would call in and say something and I just would always end up busy on Sunday nights.

2614
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:38,400
Well, here you are, Puppy Bowl Sunday. You made it on what's actually a pretty crowded show. What do you want to talk about? What's up?

2615
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:50,400
Uh, well, I want to start off with one question for you guys. I've kind of polled my friends who play video games and it seems like I'm alone on this. Do any of you guys ever get motion sick playing first person-

2616
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:54,400
Yes. Here we go. Yes. Absolutely.

2617
02:34:54,400 --> 02:35:07,400
Because, like, I've got a PS4 and I've got Battlefield 4 with it and I can basically only play half the game. I have to play with a friend of mine and we sort of switch off where he does all the gunfights and I just fly jets. That's all I do.

2618
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:20,400
I get super motion sick on a lot of games, not just first person games. Katamari Damacy makes me sick, which sucks because I love the game. Um, Mass Effect used to make me sick. Actually, all of the Mako missions make me really nauseous.

2619
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:30,400
You have some interesting particulars about that, though. Like, if you, and I mean, it's just the way it is. I'm not trying to, like, make fun or make light of the situation, but it's just interesting how you've kind of learned what does and what doesn't trigger it.

2620
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:37,400
Like, didn't you say that Mass Effect, part of the reason you're okay with that is because it's third person, not first person? Exactly. That's a big difference?

2621
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:46,400
Exactly. If I have a character on the screen, then I'm not as likely to get motion sick because it gives me a different focus, but sometimes I get motion sick in multiplayer.

2622
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:56,400
And you can play Doom and 3D games that were, like, sprite based, right? Yes, but sometimes they still make me motion sick, depending. Depending. But for the most part, I was fine with them.

2623
02:35:56,400 --> 02:36:05,400
Sonic Adventure made me motion sick. Dave, is it just these new games that are doing it to you? Like, are the games getting too real and that's the problem?

2624
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:25,400
Yeah, it's like, you know, when I was in high school, me and my friends would play Counter-Strike all the time, and I never had a problem with that. But my friends tried to get me into Black Ops 2, and it's just something about the fact that they just want to try and simulate being a person in the game and having all that screen shake and the explosions and the suppression,

2625
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:31,400
where my brain goes, this isn't real, this isn't happening, so I'm going to make you vomit now.

2626
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:34,400
How big is the TV that you play on?

2627
02:36:34,400 --> 02:36:42,400
I play on anything from the 25-inch IPS monitor in my bedroom all the way up to a 60-inch plasma in my friend's place.

2628
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:51,400
Do you think that might be part of the problem? Because when you play on a monitor, you're usually sitting up really close, so it's almost just as big as a 60-inch TV in some ways. Do you think that could be the issue?

2629
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:58,400
I don't know, because usually I get more motion sick on the bigger TVs than I do on my own monitor.

2630
02:36:58,400 --> 02:37:10,400
I actually get more motion sick the lower the resolution is on the screen I'm using, like for example on our old 32-inch Toshiba, and it was a full CRT everything.

2631
02:37:10,400 --> 02:37:24,400
I would watch Dan play Goldeneye on Nintendo 64, and I've thrown up watching him play that game before, but I've gone back and watched emulated playthroughs from a computer and haven't been as sick.

2632
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:48,400
The thing I've kind of settled on that I've accepted as an answer for myself is that something about gunfights in some of these games with all the screen movement that's going on, when things change really, really quickly in front of my eyes in some of these video games, it just doesn't seem to sit right with my head, whereas I can fly the jets around in Battlefield 4 no problem.

2633
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:55,400
Let me ask you another question. When you see polygon clipping, does that make your head hurt?

2634
02:37:57,400 --> 02:38:00,400
Could you tell me what that actually is first?

2635
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:15,400
It's when the collision doesn't hit for two items, and one polygon will go through another one, and I'm not talking about so much as like seeing someone's arm go through the wall, but when you actually see the other side of the polygon that your house looks to.

2636
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:19,400
Oh, when you can see the other level or the other side of the level, stuff like that.

2637
02:38:19,400 --> 02:38:22,400
This happens in Minecraft a lot, I notice.

2638
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:24,400
Yeah, okay, I know what you're talking about now.

2639
02:38:24,400 --> 02:38:25,400
Does that affect you?

2640
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:27,400
That doesn't really bother me, no.

2641
02:38:27,400 --> 02:38:42,400
See, that affects me. That's why part of my problem is with the first Sonic Adventures, there was a lot of camera issues with the polygons, and it would be just for a moment like my head would shut down, and then when it was gone, I was better.

2642
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:47,400
It's just a really weird thing, but I have issues with depth perception, too.

2643
02:38:47,400 --> 02:38:59,400
Well, sadly, Dave, I can't sit here and come up with solutions for you. I think that's something you might have to actually bring up with the doctor, and I think a lot of it could just be, you know, you gotta look away more often and take more breaks.

2644
02:38:59,400 --> 02:39:04,400
I know I cannot watch an entire 3D movie in the theater without looking away from the screen every few minutes.

2645
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:09,400
Yeah, I have a problem with 3D. My problem is MS related, so maybe you have MS.

2646
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:10,400
Don't say that.

2647
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:16,400
I'm saying my problem is definitely related to that, so I can't do 3D.

2648
02:39:16,400 --> 02:39:23,400
Okay, that was like WebMD diagnosing you right now. WebMD always tells you, you got cancer, sorry. You got a cough? Oh, it's probably cancer.

2649
02:39:23,400 --> 02:39:25,400
And mine may be related to autism.

2650
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:36,400
But just, you aren't alone, Dave. I see in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, 5th Dream says, I do. I do very much. Killzone kicked my ass. Some bother me more than others.

2651
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:43,400
Chris109 says, Killzone was fun, but yeah, I had two or three dizziness. 5th Dream says, serious Sam was pretty bad.

2652
02:39:43,400 --> 02:39:48,400
5th Dream says, the odd thing is I've noticed I get really motion sick when I'm looking for something.

2653
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:54,400
If I'm just running and shooting and stuff, I'm better than if I'm trying to find an objective or an item that searching makes me really sick.

2654
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:57,400
Yeah, that happens to me too. But two more really quick things.

2655
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:58,400
Yeah, of course.

2656
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:13,400
One, to answer what Dark Soccer was saying earlier about why do celebrities kind of get the pass on doing stupid things or, you know, why are they put on this pedestal when they pass away.

2657
02:40:13,400 --> 02:40:26,400
I think that for a lot of people, it's that this person has contributed something to their life, whereas the random guy on the street who would otherwise just be a junkie really hasn't.

2658
02:40:28,400 --> 02:40:33,400
I still kind of see that, but I still believe there's a lot of double standard in place.

2659
02:40:33,400 --> 02:40:38,400
I think Dark Soccer comes from the place of why don't we show compassion the same.

2660
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:46,400
I mean, I think you get why people might feel that connection with celebrities when we see them fall or whatever, but it's like, why don't we have that same compassion, I guess would be the same.

2661
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:54,400
Yeah, I really think that's it. I think that society as a whole needs to stop being as judgmental and look at every individual life as something that's important.

2662
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:56,400
You know, funny story.

2663
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:57,400
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

2664
02:40:57,400 --> 02:40:59,400
Go ahead, X for real quick and then we'll let Dave finish.

2665
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:04,400
Somebody back when I was going to school in college told me that I looked like Seymour Hoffman.

2666
02:41:04,400 --> 02:41:06,400
Oh, that's going to make you feel really good today.

2667
02:41:06,400 --> 02:41:09,400
Well, I wonder if he looked like me when he was killed over.

2668
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:10,400
Stop it.

2669
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:12,400
You are a bad person.

2670
02:41:12,400 --> 02:41:14,400
Okay, you were saying, Dave.

2671
02:41:14,400 --> 02:41:15,400
Dave, please finish your thought.

2672
02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:26,400
But the very last thing, this is just sort of a technical thing I've noticed because I started listening to this show probably like April of last year on the way back from a White Mountains camping trip.

2673
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:27,400
Nice.

2674
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:36,400
But I don't know kind of how you guys have the volume set up between the microphones, whether there's multiple or not.

2675
02:41:36,400 --> 02:41:50,400
But something I've noticed because I usually listen to this in my car or on my laptop is that Jamie's voice is, you know, compared to someone like, let's say, Jason, who has a bassier voice, it's much, much louder.

2676
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:53,400
So I keep on doing this thing where I'm like, oh, Jason's talking, I have to turn the volume on.

2677
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:56,400
And then Jamie comes on, I have to turn the volume down.

2678
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:58,400
It might have to do with pitch.

2679
02:41:58,400 --> 02:42:00,400
We try to balance the mics best we can.

2680
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:02,400
But unfortunately, we are using hand mics.

2681
02:42:02,400 --> 02:42:04,400
I don't have a studio set up.

2682
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:09,400
We don't really have the finance to get the mics that are in place that pick up from where a person's sitting.

2683
02:42:09,400 --> 02:42:16,400
And with the hand mics, if somebody moves the hand to a different position, or I can mic balance for somebody before the show.

2684
02:42:16,400 --> 02:42:24,400
And not to pick on Loki because we love Loki, but Loki will give me a mic check before the show where he's talking like in his normal voice.

2685
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:27,400
But then he gets really mad about Nintendo or some shit during the show.

2686
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:31,400
And he gets really loud. It's like, God damn it. I didn't balance your mic for that.

2687
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:35,400
So I have a friend tells me it's my Welsh blood when I get worked up, I get higher pitched.

2688
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:38,400
Yeah. So sadly, it's not just you.

2689
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:44,400
I am if there's sound engineers out there that have some tips, some ideas, I am I'm more than open to it.

2690
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:50,400
So when you say hand mics, are you talking like the kind of microphones you would normally sing into it like karaoke?

2691
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:51,400
Yeah.

2692
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:55,400
I mean, I might end up donating like a blue mic to you guys.

2693
02:42:55,400 --> 02:43:01,400
Wow. I'm not going to have a blue mic in there. Pretty, pretty nice.

2694
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:03,400
Those things are pretty neat.

2695
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:04,400
All right.

2696
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:07,400
I think it'll be worth it for my ears in the long run.

2697
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:09,400
I'm trying not to be overly loud.

2698
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:10,400
So all right.

2699
02:43:10,400 --> 02:43:13,400
We'll try to get our eye on it.

2700
02:43:13,400 --> 02:43:15,400
Thanks for taking my call. Hope you guys have a good one.

2701
02:43:15,400 --> 02:43:16,400
All right. Take care, buddy.

2702
02:43:16,400 --> 02:43:17,400
All right. Bye.

2703
02:43:17,400 --> 02:43:18,400
Bye.

2704
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:23,400
Yeah, I do notice like if you're listening on headphones, usually it's whatever it works fine.

2705
02:43:23,400 --> 02:43:28,400
But if you listen in the car, I have listened to show in the car and it does kind of use notice the volume differences.

2706
02:43:28,400 --> 02:43:31,400
So I really try to adjust that stuff on the fly best I can.

2707
02:43:31,400 --> 02:43:35,400
But some things like extra first little fit he threw earlier where it got really loud.

2708
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:37,400
Some things you can't foresee.

2709
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:42,400
So but if there's anything we learned about that call, it's that that guy probably has MS.

2710
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:43,400
Stop it.

2711
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:48,400
Actually, I can I sort of get the same way with certain people's voices.

2712
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:52,400
Like, for example, I can't listen to Sarah Brightman.

2713
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:53,400
No, I'm serious.

2714
02:43:53,400 --> 02:43:56,400
Are you sure that's not just because it's it's bad or no.

2715
02:43:56,400 --> 02:44:01,400
Sarah Brightman's got a gorgeous voice, but she's too brassy of a soprano for me to listen to without being uncomfortable.

2716
02:44:01,400 --> 02:44:05,400
You know, I'm just saying as an example, sometimes pitch has a lot to do with it.

2717
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:07,400
All right. Well, let's move on because we got another call on the line.

2718
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:09,400
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

2719
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:10,400
Hey, it's Sturlock.

2720
02:44:10,400 --> 02:44:11,400
Hey, Sturlock.

2721
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:12,400
How are you doing?

2722
02:44:12,400 --> 02:44:13,400
Pretty good.

2723
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:14,400
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2724
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:16,400
A lot, actually.

2725
02:44:16,400 --> 02:44:20,400
I wanted to talk about something very, very cool that happened.

2726
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:23,400
Please. You've been teasing me on Twitter all week.

2727
02:44:23,400 --> 02:44:24,400
Yes.

2728
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:26,400
This is huge.

2729
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:34,400
So Dark Sakura, as noticed, I'm sure because you added me.

2730
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:35,400
Yes.

2731
02:44:35,400 --> 02:44:39,400
That I have taken the plunge and I am now on Steam.

2732
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:40,400
Yes.

2733
02:44:40,400 --> 02:44:47,400
There is a very good reason for this, and it has to do with Skullgirls.

2734
02:44:47,400 --> 02:44:49,400
I love Skullgirls.

2735
02:44:49,400 --> 02:44:50,400
Isn't it great?

2736
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:51,400
Yes, it is.

2737
02:44:52,400 --> 02:45:03,400
Well, the developer, Mike Z, has been very, very open in the community in general.

2738
02:45:03,400 --> 02:45:20,400
And just recently, a buddy of mine named Liren was talking to him about a lot of the text that's in the game.

2739
02:45:20,400 --> 02:45:23,400
Because he's blind like I am.

2740
02:45:23,400 --> 02:45:32,400
And he wanted to play online and get some enjoyment out of the story mode.

2741
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:53,400
And basically, they came up with a method of doing this where if you set a certain option in the launcher properties or whatever it is through Steam,

2742
02:45:53,400 --> 02:45:59,400
that now all of the text will output directly to the clipboard.

2743
02:45:59,400 --> 02:46:15,400
With the end result, if you run a certain program, your screen reader will say any text that copies to the clipboard.

2744
02:46:15,400 --> 02:46:26,400
So now we actually have a mainstream game that is fully voiced with all of the text.

2745
02:46:26,400 --> 02:46:28,400
That's super useful.

2746
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:29,400
Everything.

2747
02:46:29,400 --> 02:46:30,400
Everything.

2748
02:46:30,400 --> 02:46:45,400
Menu, story, like a group of us actually yesterday, we set up a Skullgirls team talk channel, and we're just hanging out.

2749
02:46:45,400 --> 02:46:49,400
Like five of us just doing Queen of the Hill is fucking awesome.

2750
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:54,400
Wait, so this is really the first game on Steam that has that kind of accessibility option?

2751
02:46:54,400 --> 02:46:56,400
This is the first game, period.

2752
02:46:56,400 --> 02:46:58,400
That kind of shocks me.

2753
02:46:58,400 --> 02:47:00,400
And not in a good way.

2754
02:47:00,400 --> 02:47:02,400
Like, I'm really surprised that...

2755
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:03,400
Sorry.

2756
02:47:03,400 --> 02:47:06,400
Uh oh, get the phone. Somebody knows you're on the line.

2757
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:10,400
Is this just the first one that copies the clipboard?

2758
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:14,400
Because I know there's other games that will talk through the subtitles for you, right?

2759
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:15,400
And things like that.

2760
02:47:15,400 --> 02:47:26,400
But this is the first game where the developer has actively just gone out of their way to make things easier for us.

2761
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:28,400
Well actually, that's not entirely true.

2762
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:37,400
Because Injustice did something similar last year with the interactable objects.

2763
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:49,400
But to this level, I now can do anything that anybody else would do.

2764
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:54,400
I can go online, I can set up a lobby with no trouble whatsoever.

2765
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:56,400
It's amazing.

2766
02:47:56,400 --> 02:48:01,400
That's awesome news. I'm really happy to hear it.

2767
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:04,400
Especially a game that has such a following like Skullgirls does.

2768
02:48:04,400 --> 02:48:10,400
That's really neat that you can kind of be a part of that officially now, so to speak.

2769
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:12,400
Yeah, so I immediately...

2770
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:17,400
Oh, by the way, for blind, setting up Steam is a fucking pain in the ass.

2771
02:48:17,400 --> 02:48:19,400
So maybe Valve needs to take some cues, huh?

2772
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:22,400
Oh my god. I mean, it's doable, but oh my god.

2773
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:25,400
Let me ask this question. We're a little pressed for time, so I'm going to wrap up here in a minute.

2774
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:31,400
But let me ask this question, because I've got at least one game developer here in the room, and I know we have others that listen.

2775
02:48:31,400 --> 02:48:36,400
What would you say to all the game developers out there of the world and so forth?

2776
02:48:36,400 --> 02:48:42,400
How can they best help you play or experience their stuff?

2777
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:46,400
What can they do to help you out, to help you enjoy video games?

2778
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:48,400
Sound design is a big thing.

2779
02:48:49,400 --> 02:48:52,400
Keeping up in mind, I guess, too.

2780
02:48:52,400 --> 02:48:55,400
Don't forget about me type of thing.

2781
02:48:55,400 --> 02:48:59,400
Not to say people do, just to be clear, but you know, just, you know.

2782
02:48:59,400 --> 02:49:05,400
Yeah, but like, I don't know. I think if you're going to...

2783
02:49:05,400 --> 02:49:12,400
I think it's really important to have, and I know this isn't really possible in a lot of cases, but...

2784
02:49:13,400 --> 02:49:20,400
With the Skullgirls thing, they were basically chatting on like IRC, and were having just an open dialogue.

2785
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:26,400
It was like, how can we do this kind of thing? What would be the easiest way?

2786
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:29,400
Right. Start a dialogue. Talk about it. Sounds good.

2787
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:34,400
And it was really easy for him to set up, apparently, too. It only took like a couple days.

2788
02:49:34,400 --> 02:49:36,400
Oh, that's awesome.

2789
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:41,400
Oh, by the way, is not... Oh, um...

2790
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:45,400
I'll have to kick your ass in Skullgirls at some point, Jamie.

2791
02:49:45,400 --> 02:49:46,400
We'll see if that happens.

2792
02:49:46,400 --> 02:49:49,400
I don't know. Bring it. I think we'll bring it.

2793
02:49:49,400 --> 02:49:55,400
Also, I wanted to give you a link to a good Mortal Kombat video.

2794
02:49:55,400 --> 02:49:56,400
Okay.

2795
02:49:56,400 --> 02:50:00,400
If you search for Tato Salad, finish him.

2796
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:02,400
I'm afraid of what I'm going to see.

2797
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:05,400
Oh my god, it is the funniest shit ever.

2798
02:50:06,400 --> 02:50:07,400
Uh-oh.

2799
02:50:07,400 --> 02:50:09,400
I don't know. Five dollar foot long thing.

2800
02:50:09,400 --> 02:50:10,400
Five dollar foot long was pretty good.

2801
02:50:10,400 --> 02:50:11,400
Yeah.

2802
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:12,400
Alright.

2803
02:50:12,400 --> 02:50:13,400
This is great.

2804
02:50:13,400 --> 02:50:19,400
Alright, let me... Tato Salad, finish him. I'm looking it up right now. Let's see what happens.

2805
02:50:19,400 --> 02:50:20,400
This looks scary.

2806
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:22,400
It's by GoPotatoTV.

2807
02:50:22,400 --> 02:50:25,400
Yep, I see it. I see it. Let's see. I'm trying to see if there's an ad or something.

2808
02:50:25,400 --> 02:50:29,400
Okay, no. Here we go. I'm going to play a little bit. If this is awful, I'm holding you responsible.

2809
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:31,400
It's epic.

2810
02:50:32,400 --> 02:50:34,400
It's like fake animation or something.

2811
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:38,400
You've seen this game?

2812
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:39,400
Finish him.

2813
02:50:39,400 --> 02:50:40,400
Wait.

2814
02:50:40,400 --> 02:50:44,400
Before you do that, massage him.

2815
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:47,400
Massage him?

2816
02:50:47,400 --> 02:50:50,400
You dare defy the great Shao Kahn?

2817
02:50:50,400 --> 02:50:51,400
You gotta play this whole thing.

2818
02:50:51,400 --> 02:50:54,400
Oh, this is too long. It's three minutes. I can't play the whole thing.

2819
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:55,400
I'll watch it when I get home.

2820
02:50:55,400 --> 02:50:56,400
Yeah, maybe.

2821
02:50:56,400 --> 02:50:57,400
We'll have to look at it later.

2822
02:50:57,400 --> 02:50:58,400
Massage him.

2823
02:50:58,400 --> 02:51:00,400
Alright. Alright, fine.

2824
02:51:00,400 --> 02:51:03,400
And then what? Then it's make out with him? Kiss him?

2825
02:51:03,400 --> 02:51:04,400
Is this good?

2826
02:51:04,400 --> 02:51:05,400
Yep.

2827
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:06,400
Oh, gosh.

2828
02:51:06,400 --> 02:51:08,400
Loosen up those muscles. Oh, you're so tense.

2829
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:11,400
Alright, alright, alright, alright. I gotta go wrap up the show.

2830
02:51:11,400 --> 02:51:12,400
Maybe we'll make this a fortune cookie later.

2831
02:51:12,400 --> 02:51:13,400
You're turning this into pornography.

2832
02:51:13,400 --> 02:51:16,400
Yes, that is definitely fortune cookie material.

2833
02:51:16,400 --> 02:51:18,400
Didn't even take Extrovert to do that.

2834
02:51:18,400 --> 02:51:21,400
Alright, take care, buddy. Thanks for letting us know about that. That's a really cool change.

2835
02:51:21,400 --> 02:51:22,400
Yeah, alright. Thanks.

2836
02:51:22,400 --> 02:51:23,400
Alright, take care.

2837
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:24,400
Yeah, you too.

2838
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:25,400
Bye.

2839
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:26,400
Bye.

2840
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:29,400
Alright, sadly, I think that is going to do it for calls tonight.

2841
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:35,400
I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through, but we are trying to wrap up here about midnight, East Coast time, nine o'clock, West Coast tonight.

2842
02:51:35,400 --> 02:51:40,400
So, we're going to wrap up. That's about it for the show tonight.

2843
02:51:40,400 --> 02:51:43,400
I do want to ask real quick, are there any last minute stories?

2844
02:51:43,400 --> 02:51:47,400
I don't know if Dark Sakura has anything or... Oh, I know what I'll ask about.

2845
02:51:47,400 --> 02:51:53,400
Before the show, Matt, you were telling me something about EVE Online that we never brought up, and I thought it was really funny.

2846
02:51:53,400 --> 02:52:00,400
Well, I don't know the exact details, but I was just reading on through the news, and they apparently had a really huge epic battle.

2847
02:52:00,400 --> 02:52:02,400
I heard about this, yeah.

2848
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:19,400
In EVE, and since EVE has an exchange rate where you could buy in-game currency with real dollars, you could actually calculate how much monies, how much real value worth of stuff have been destroyed in that gigantic war.

2849
02:52:19,400 --> 02:52:22,400
And I think it was like priced over $200,000.

2850
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:24,400
Damn.

2851
02:52:24,400 --> 02:52:31,400
That's a lot. I can't believe there's that much money sunk into that game. I don't hear about a lot of people playing EVE, but I guess so.

2852
02:52:31,400 --> 02:52:40,400
Alright, quickly, I do want to mention this, because TigerClaud messaged me this, and I thought it was worth mentioning, because a lot of you guys like your Sony franchises.

2853
02:52:40,400 --> 02:52:47,400
There's a new Sly Cooper movie being made, and it's being directed by Kevin Munro, who made the TD Mutant Ninja Turtles CGI movie, for better or worse.

2854
02:52:47,400 --> 02:52:49,400
Hey, I like that.

2855
02:52:49,400 --> 02:52:55,400
Yeah, alright, well then maybe you'll like the Sly Cooper. They did announce that. They've got a little teaser trailer out there on the internet.

2856
02:52:55,400 --> 02:53:00,400
And yeah, it's being made, and it's slated for release in 2016, and in 3D.

2857
02:53:00,400 --> 02:53:05,400
So, very cool. There's a teaser trailer out there on Twitter, and all that if you want to check it out.

2858
02:53:05,400 --> 02:53:12,400
I'm gonna see real quick if we have Twitter topics.

2859
02:53:15,400 --> 02:53:18,400
I know this is really interesting radio.

2860
02:53:19,400 --> 02:53:25,400
Well, in the meanwhile, I will serenade our listeners with... actually, I'm not gonna.

2861
02:53:25,400 --> 02:53:32,400
That's actually really it. I don't really see a lot of tweets tonight, so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up. That's it. No tweets.

2862
02:53:32,400 --> 02:53:33,400
Ribbons and bows?

2863
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:43,400
Yeah. BlackWolf does want to clarify, though, there isn't that much money sunk into EVE. That's if you converted all the in-game money into how much it would cost to buy a Plex.

2864
02:53:43,400 --> 02:53:48,400
Not all that money that was lost was once real money. Some was earned in-game.

2865
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:52,400
Anyhow, so we're gonna go ahead and wrap up and get on out of here for the night.

2866
02:53:52,400 --> 02:53:55,400
DarkSoccer, I know you're trying to leave because you've got work in the morning, but...

2867
02:53:55,400 --> 02:53:57,400
Yeah, but this will change in two weeks when I'm on my other schedule.

2868
02:53:57,400 --> 02:54:00,400
Woohoo! So, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2869
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:02,400
I wish I could have ramen.

2870
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:04,400
Ramen sounds good, doesn't it?

2871
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:05,400
Yeah, but I can't.

2872
02:54:05,400 --> 02:54:07,400
We might not end up having that tonight anyway, so we'll see.

2873
02:54:07,400 --> 02:54:08,400
Okay.

2874
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:09,400
We'll see.

2875
02:54:09,400 --> 02:54:10,400
Bye!

2876
02:54:11,400 --> 02:54:16,400
I'm gonna say, as always, thank you very much for downloading our show. Thank you for tuning in. Really appreciate it.

2877
02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:23,400
All we ask, you know, we don't charge for the show, so just tell a friend or five or twenty about the show. Help spread the word.

2878
02:54:23,400 --> 02:54:33,400
Reviews go a long way as well. If you wouldn't mind leaving us a nice review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio's website, those go an awful, awful long way and we really, really appreciate it.

2879
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:38,400
Going around and saying goodbye to our guests. Shane, thanks for coming all the way from Kansas to be here.

2880
02:54:38,400 --> 02:54:39,400
You're welcome.

2881
02:54:39,400 --> 02:54:42,400
We didn't really say a whole lot besides one really tasteless thing, but that's okay.

2882
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:46,400
What? There was nothing tasteless about talking about Power Rangers.

2883
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:48,400
Um, we'll come back sometime.

2884
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:49,400
Maybe.

2885
02:54:49,400 --> 02:54:52,400
Alright. And do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

2886
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:53,400
Go away.

2887
02:54:53,400 --> 02:54:58,400
Why would you s- How rude! You go away.

2888
02:54:58,400 --> 02:55:00,400
I'm about to once we end the show.

2889
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:01,400
You go away for five years.

2890
02:55:01,400 --> 02:55:02,400
We can go eat.

2891
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:06,400
Alright. Uh, Xtafer, I hope you had fun. You've been wanting to crush the show for a while.

2892
02:55:06,400 --> 02:55:08,400
I did. I had a lot of fun. It's been fun.

2893
02:55:08,400 --> 02:55:11,400
It's been a long time. Do you have final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2894
02:55:11,400 --> 02:55:19,400
Uh, I want to have raw men.

2895
02:55:19,400 --> 02:55:21,400
You're so weird.

2896
02:55:21,400 --> 02:55:24,400
That's great. That's great, Xtafer. I know, thanks.

2897
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:26,400
Listen to Hoard House. Thank you, Shane.

2898
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:28,400
Alright. Because Ra-Ma made that sticker.

2899
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:29,400
What?

2900
02:55:29,400 --> 02:55:31,400
Because Ra-Ma made that sticker. I forget. Alright.

2901
02:55:31,400 --> 02:55:34,400
Alright. Uh, Matt, thank you very much for being here.

2902
02:55:34,400 --> 02:55:39,400
And, uh, I apologize for the behavior of the other two guests you had to be on the show with tonight.

2903
02:55:39,400 --> 02:55:41,400
I've just really been awful. I'm sorry.

2904
02:55:41,400 --> 02:55:44,400
He loves me no matter what.

2905
02:55:44,400 --> 02:55:46,400
But you were a lot of fun to have on the show.

2906
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:47,400
Oh, thank you.

2907
02:55:47,400 --> 02:55:52,400
Thank you for, um, some of the, um, candid discussion earlier about development and everything. Appreciate it.

2908
02:55:52,400 --> 02:55:54,400
All you need is a piece of paper and a dream.

2909
02:55:54,400 --> 02:55:59,400
Yeah. I mean, I encourage anyone to continue to pursue game design if that's your dream.

2910
02:55:59,400 --> 02:56:00,400
Awesome.

2911
02:56:01,400 --> 02:56:04,400
I must be doing really well because I have a Moleskine book in my purse.

2912
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:06,400
A big imagination. No, I'm kidding.

2913
02:56:06,400 --> 02:56:09,400
Alright, uh, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2914
02:56:09,400 --> 02:56:11,400
Just play some Rocksmith 2014.

2915
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:14,400
Sounds good. Will do.

2916
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:16,400
Alright, that's gonna do it for our show tonight.

2917
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:18,400
Thank you everybody for tuning in.

2918
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:20,400
Uh, we're out of here until next week.

2919
02:56:20,400 --> 02:56:22,400
Loki's tentatively back next week.

2920
02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:25,400
Uh, Jason might be back for one more week next week.

2921
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:27,400
So it'll be kind of the usual suspects.

2922
02:56:27,400 --> 02:56:30,400
And we'll have fun with whatever should come up in the news.

2923
02:56:30,400 --> 02:56:34,400
In the meantime, have a lot of fun gaming and, uh, don't be a jerk to each other.

2924
02:56:34,400 --> 02:56:37,400
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.

2925
02:56:57,400 --> 02:56:59,400
See you next week.

2926
02:57:27,400 --> 02:57:30,400
Thanks for watching!
