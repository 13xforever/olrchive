7000	12000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week, a new challenger has arrived as Amazon enters the gaming arena and they're not coming alone.
18000	22000	Sonic has been rebooted again, but this time exclusively by the West for the West.
22000	26000	We've heard the uproar from the internet, but we'll take your comments on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 539, February 9th, 2014.
44000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you guys over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.
51000	55000	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
55000	59000	Sup bitches? How you doing? Is that your new tagline? You said that last week too.
59000	62000	I didn't say that last week, I said that week before. I said sup bitches in chat though.
62000	66000	After 539 episodes, they start to blur together a little bit.
66000	69000	It's because you're old. Yeah, a little bit. And I'm older.
69000	75000	Yeah, I had that realization. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
75000	79000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
79000	83000	And I had the realization that I'm getting old listening to last week's Bobby Black Wolf show.
83000	86000	He had a great interview where they were talking about BBS door games.
86000	92000	And they were talking about this whole tech history. And I'm just thinking in the back of my mind, like, I was there dude.
92000	96000	I called all those BBS's too. I played those door games dude.
96000	102000	And it was so weird kind of hearing them talk about it. Like it was like, you know, this was the best.
102000	109000	They described it, one of them, the guest he had was describing it like, well, it was kind of like Facebook but you dial into it.
109000	113000	And I just did this thing where it's like, no, I mean, I get it. Like I wasn't, I wasn't like making fun of it or whatever.
113000	118000	But it was just one of those things where I was just like, oh my God, like he's having to explain it.
118000	126000	Because most of the listeners we have are, you know, teenagers and young 20-somethings that literally were too young to remember calling into BBS's.
126000	131000	And I'm just thinking like, Rob, you're too old. You're never too old, dang it.
131000	132000	Mudds.
132000	136000	Oh yeah, Mudds were fun too. I got into those in college. Yeah, they are still around.
136000	140000	No, no, no, no. It was all about AOL in 1994 and playing Gemstone.
140000	146000	Going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see.
146000	154000	Shoot, somebody had said something about the, oh, there it is. Havoc978 said, old lounge radio.
154000	157000	Yes, that is, that is probably appropriate for tonight.
157000	164000	Well, speaking of old familiar faces, guess what? A face we've been missing for the past couple of weeks is back with us tonight.
164000	166000	Say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki.
166000	172000	Yeah, sadly I'm not there in the face to face, but over Skype still.
172000	174000	That's right. Loki is still joining us via the Skype line.
174000	181000	And yes, I know, you know, we, part of our whole shtick is that we're all in the same room and we will get back to that soon.
181000	186000	But Loki, obviously, you just, you know, your wife just had the baby, what, two weeks ago at this point.
186000	190000	So there's still, there's still a lot of adjustment going on.
190000	192000	And so it'll be another couple weeks before you're back, right?
192000	201000	Yeah, I wanted to come back this week, but you know, she's still not healed enough to be able to lift the car carrier and the baby at the same time, so.
201000	202000	Fair enough, fair enough.
202000	204000	I have to be here to lift the baby out of the car.
204000	208000	So when we told Loki he needs to take all the time he needs for the baby, we meant it.
208000	213000	So we will take Loki over Skype over no Loki at all.
213000	215000	And he can't see us make faces at him here in studio.
215000	220000	Making a face at Loki right now, say hello everybody to Jay, I'm just kidding, I'm just starting crap.
220000	221000	Say hello everybody to Jason.
226000	227000	I'm sitting in your chair.
228000	229000	How you doing, Jason?
229000	230000	I'm doing pretty good.
230000	237000	And you guys, actually, we say welcome back Loki, but this week we actually say goodbye for now, Jason.
238000	239000	I know, it's sad, right?
239000	245000	It's been, it's been a very interesting three and a half months or however long it's been, I can't even remember at this point.
246000	254000	Yeah, you've been out, so those of you guys that haven't been following, Jason has been out here for, he was, he was in San Francisco for work for about the past three months.
254000	257000	But you are now going on your way back home to Colorado.
257000	259000	I have to go say hello to the snow.
260000	261000	Yeah, I figured.
261000	263000	But I'd say this rain this week is a pretty proper send off.
263000	264000	Yeah, we finally got...
264000	265000	We've been so overcast this week.
265000	271000	Finally got some stinking rain, I'm glad you could see what it looks like when it rains here, because literally the entire time you've been here it has not rained.
271000	283000	It's funny, it actually really reminds me of, I realized this on the drive up here, it's crazy to think that my first time coming back to California as an adult was in, for my interview in 2012.
284000	285000	How old was I in 2004?
286000	288000	What does adulthood count as, 18?
289000	291000	You know, when I first met you, you were only like 19 or 20.
292000	294000	Okay, so I guess, I guess I was just barely adult for E3.
295000	297000	Take your age now and subtract 10, that was 10 years ago.
298000	300000	Uh, 18, so yeah, just on the cusp.
300000	304000	Well, no, it was in June, so it was a month before my birthday.
305000	306000	You were 17 when you were here the first time?
307000	308000	That sounds really strange.
308000	309000	That does sound really strange.
310000	311000	Oh, no, no, no, I was 18 turning 19.
312000	313000	So anyways, the first time...
313000	314000	You don't even know your own age?
315000	316000	That's a sign of getting old.
317000	322000	I base it off, I base it for my birthday forward instead of my age backward, even though it literally was 10 years ago, whatever.
323000	328000	So, I was out in California for 2004 for E3 and all the other festivities that happened that week.
328000	339000	I had not been back to California since then, of course, and so 2012 when I come back for my interview, the conditions that it was on the drive today was actually very, very similar.
340000	349000	More intense, more intense, more rain, the entirety of, at least, you know, from San Francisco, from the Bay Area north.
350000	355000	The quick version of the story, because I don't think I've ever told it on the show, is that I don't fly.
355000	360000	So, not anymore, so I came to California via bus.
361000	364000	The bus made it, we had a bunch of trouble getting over the Sierra Nevadas.
365000	372000	We made it into Sacramento and on the way to San Francisco, the window on the door was flapping out of place.
373000	374000	Oh, yeah.
375000	383000	And so we got as far as Vacaville and they were going to turn the bus around and have us just be stuck in Sacramento, at least as far as our final destinations were concerned.
383000	398000	My only regret is that since we stopped at a Home Depot to get duct tape and they taped up the window to the door in three places, my only, my only unfortunate coincidence there is that I did not get a picture of it.
399000	407000	Because my phone was dying and I was keeping in touch with my now employers that I was going out there for an interview with, and yeah, that was a pretty crazy response.
408000	409000	That was dying for a tweet to corporate.
410000	411000	It was.
411000	418000	We will get to video games in just a moment, but since it is a bit of a sentimental show of sorts with Jason saying goodbye for now.
419000	423000	Tigerclaw in chat says, watch Jason be back for next week's OLR via Skype.
424000	428000	Well, I'll be driving this time next week, so not so much.
429000	433000	Syal says, Jason will get snowed in and have to stay. Well, it won't snow here, but maybe up the mountain.
434000	435000	That's not an impossibility either.
436000	437000	That happened to you once.
438000	439000	Oh, yes. It's happened a number of times.
439000	446000	Well, you are more than welcome to crash and co-host any time. I don't know about the Skype thing because we're actually trying to get away from that.
447000	450000	Babies are a special circumstance, but you are more than welcome to the studio any time.
451000	455000	I can always call in towards the end, and of course I will be back for any, for numerous occasions, I hope.
456000	460000	So, Jason always has a place here at the table, and quite a huge compliment here from Tigerclaw.
461000	465000	If there is enough demand, VX JasonXV should be a recurring co-host on OLR.
466000	470000	I'd like that whole, if there is enough demand. No, you know you're always welcome here, so...
471000	478000	I have interesting ideas, and it's really just a matter of time and also being able to do it regularly, reliably, and correctly.
479000	487000	Yes, ideally we would take Jason's very, you know, dulcet tones and have him head up a new show for potentially The Voice Geek Network.
488000	490000	Stop spoiling it, Rob!
491000	492000	I won't. Stop, I'll stop.
492000	501000	Alright, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic. We gotta take it back to video games here, and we're gonna start off with a whopper.
502000	508000	And I'm gonna just give this disclaimer in advance. I know some of you guys out there are probably sick to death of hearing about this game.
509000	517000	But it's very rare when a video game goes all the way to CNN and the national news and makes these types of headlines.
517000	527000	And we've really gotta get into the what the heck is going on. Dark Soccer, if you wouldn't mind starting us off tonight with a little discussion on a mobile game that's gone insane.
528000	529000	Fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap.
530000	534000	Fappy bird. I mean, flappy bird. I mean, whatever the hell bird that is.
535000	540000	So yeah. And I'm sure everyone already knows, but I don't care. I'm gonna tell you again.
540000	548000	Basically the developer, Dong Nguyen, basically said that he's done no more. He can't take it anymore.
549000	555000	And so, as of now, flappy bird is off of the iOS store. Off the app store. You can't get it anymore.
556000	561000	And so I got it before it went down, but I'm not gonna play it. I just happened to get it so that I could have it. In case.
562000	564000	And so you kinda contributed to the problem.
565000	568000	Yeah, but they're not getting any ad revenue off of me.
568000	569000	Fair enough.
570000	571000	No ad revenue off of this girl.
572000	579000	Okay, before we get into the why did he stop, let's go back even further because flappy bird isn't a game that just came out last week.
580000	589000	This game's been out for months and then all of a sudden for some unexplainable reason, I mean this is the going viral on the internet and the truest sense of the word.
590000	595000	It's just people tell other people and so on and this game just catches wildfire. It is everywhere. Literally everywhere.
595000	605000	And why? Flappy bird isn't exactly that great. I mean, but to be fair, to be fair, I've downloaded flappy bird. I've played it.
606000	610000	It does have that certain addictive quality, that frustrating, just one more. I can go just one more.
611000	615000	It is that nice little bite sized game that makes for a decent mobile experience.
616000	626000	I see a lot of people razzing the heck out of flappy bird for its possible ripoff ideas and so forth and I'm not gonna try to defend that.
627000	632000	But I will say this. But it doesn't even really play like Mario.
633000	642000	But anyway, here's the thing. 98% of the things on iTunes and Google Play and all the stuff that's available for mobile phones, 98% of it's garbage.
642000	650000	Most mobile phone games are garbage. There's very few games that are borderline decent, that are decent gaming experiences.
651000	662000	And I think some of us are getting sick and tired of them trying to shove gaming experiences into the iPhone or the Android devices that aren't working like Final Fantasy 6.
663000	664000	Stop!
665000	673000	At least in the manner that you did it and not like Final Fantasy 4 DS which was, well, not a mobile phone game but done correctly in my opinion.
674000	682000	So the only games that are really working for me as mobile phone games are little short bite sized games like this, I guess, even though its quality is questionable.
683000	691000	And like social games. I think the DS and the Vita as far as portable gaming go, neither one of them do the social elements particularly well.
691000	695000	I mean they both have their things. DS has street passing that's getting more and more and so forth.
696000	704000	But, you know, neither one has the behemoth that is word with friends or Quiz Up which I think is a fun little trivia app that's pretty dumbly simple.
705000	709000	It's not bad. It's like a free little trivia app. It's trivia with friends basically.
710000	711000	You mean like what I go to the pub for?
712000	720000	Yeah. I mean don't take these things seriously. They're mobile phone games. There's very few creme de la creme games.
721000	731000	For every Infinity Blade, there's a hundred million thousand needles. You know, like rip off types of things or something. You know what I mean?
732000	738000	Yeah. Loki, you're awfully quiet over there. Surely you have an opinion on Flappy Bird and this whole thing.
738000	743000	I just tried it this week just to see what the hell it was and I was like, okay, this is stupid.
744000	751000	And, you know, just hearing about the ad revenue and stuff. I don't know if it's necessarily that people are getting on him.
752000	756000	Because, let me put it this way, even if he takes his game off flying, people are not going to stop bothering this guy.
757000	767000	So that doesn't seem like the reason to me. It's more like, I guess we're going to go the conspiracy theory route that he's getting a cease and desist for some sort of copying of the game.
768000	775000	Or he's just taking it down for the whole sense that people are going to want it more because they can't have it.
776000	784000	And so people will go seek it out in hell with an APK for Android. You can just go download that off the internet. You don't need to have it off of the Google Play Store.
785000	793000	He's still going to collect ad revenue on every single copy that's out there for that. So, I don't know. It's just ridiculous, I think.
793000	802000	Here's the thing about the whole, the pipes look like they're from Mario Brothers to me. Like, I'm not going to defend it. Like, yes, they look like they're from Mario Brothers.
803000	811000	But, again, on 98% of mobile phone games, something was stolen from something else. And the assets are very heavily inspired by other games.
811000	825000	That's not news. And when a news website, like say a particular favorite gaming blog of mine that starts with a K, goes to write a big article about, did Flappy Bird steal its assets from Super Mario Brothers?
826000	836000	What about the other, they showed another game, there's a Flash game that basically is the very same premise and almost the same, you know, not assets, but like the way they had everything laid out.
836000	849000	Whether he did or not, like 98% of the mobile phone games do, and I feel like they're just stealing this guy's success for hits. Nothing abnormal for them.
849000	858000	So, Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, Wham! My game is popular. I'm taking my ball and going home.
859000	868000	You know, again, if this was a big corporation like Zynga or something like that that was pulling this stunt, then I'd be like, yeah, it's all for publicity.
868000	882000	But it's not. It's one guy who lives in Vietnam who probably was not expecting this to happen and maybe would even admit that the game is somewhat heavily inspired by all these other games.
883000	891000	I mean, when people go to make games for the first time, they usually make games that are very, very similar to other games like board games, card games, and so on.
892000	901000	Maybe the guy just, I mean, it's not that he probably doesn't like say no to the money, but I imagine his family's probably getting harassed by the media.
902000	912000	Especially there in Vietnam, probably, because, you know, it's probably a pretty big deal that, hey, this guy in your backyard made this game that's all the rage in the U.S. right now.
912000	921000	Like, you know, and what's he going to be able to say about it? There's not a lot to say about it, right? It's a stupidly simple game.
922000	929000	So, I don't know. I don't think, I don't really believe the conspiracy theories. I really think the guy is cracking under pressure, to be honest, for better or for worse.
929000	937000	But again, I mean, you can haze on Flappy Bird all you want, but I just think most of the stuff on the mobile phones are just like it.
938000	946000	So, why are we picking on this even more so because it got popular, you know what I mean? Like, most stuff that's on iTunes is garbage.
947000	960000	If you guys, if anybody thinks, like, the media alone, people that, you know, can find people's personal information, companies that can find people's personal information, they know the name, they look at the individual and get in touch,
961000	969000	that can be bad enough on its own if you're not a particularly public person, just dealing with media in general, locally, internationally, God knows from other fronts.
969000	982000	But if you think that he's overreacting to this, go to Twitter, go to Twitter Search, and search for, I'll give one example, but feel free to substitute your own creative words because they probably all exist.
983000	992000	But in Twitter Search, just plug in the individual's username, dongatory, at D-O-N-G-A-T-O-R-Y, and in this case, add the words, fuck you, and press enter.
992000	1007000	And look at all the Twitter search results. I'm not surprised at this amount of vitriol because that's the internet echo chamber at large, but it's kind of completely horrifying. And by kind of, I mean very much.
1010000	1016000	I don't know what to say. I mean, this is such a weird situation.
1017000	1026000	It's funny because there's so many other details that add to this. Right as we started this topic, apparently people are thinking that they're going to lose the game or it's going to stop working.
1027000	1038000	That's not going to happen. But until iOS compatibility breaks the game, it will still continue to work. I went to my purchased section, I played the game a little bit, I'm terrible at it, whatever, I don't care, I deleted it.
1039000	1042000	I went back and redownloaded it at the start of the show. I have it again.
1042000	1050000	Xbox Live, same thing you can do there. Even though they've delisted things like Mortal Kombat trilogy and things like that, you can still download those games if you bought them in the past.
1051000	1062000	That will not always be the case, and also service shutdowns are a big one, but in terms of this kind of media, it's funny the people that play it and protest and also just hurl these insults at them.
1062000	1077000	The other weird, sorry, I got train derailed there because I was trying to re-chat at the same time there. Yes, my thought derailed there. Anyway, alright, sorry, live radio.
1078000	1087000	Dungeon Buster says, imagine the response the guy who came up with Pet Rocks a few decades ago and made millions off of it would get today if Twitter were around.
1088000	1096000	Ooh, that is a good example. That's a really good analogy. That's a scary good example. That's why I got derailed, I was thinking one thing and then I read that and I was like, oh, that's a good thought.
1097000	1104000	Oh, Pet Rocks, wow. Yeah, right? I'm already sure they have a Pet Rock app out there for that type of thing. Oh, they have a Chia Pet app, I'm sure.
1104000	1115000	But yeah, people are really mean on the internet, and you know, another thing I was thinking of is that you could search Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, and put fuck you after it and you'd probably get tons of tweets.
1116000	1129000	That's that whole celebrity culture that we live in. Or in the case of Miley Cyrus offers. But it makes me think, Jimmy Kimmel does this hilarious segment on his show and it's all over YouTube, the whole celebrities reading me tweets.
1130000	1141000	It's great. It's great. And yeah, they actually read the tweets and, you know, they'll respond back. Just depending on who the celebrity is, like, you know, I think there was one with Cate Blanchett, and you know, she's got that, you know, British voice, whatever.
1142000	1145000	And she reads the tweet and she goes, well, now that's not very nice.
1146000	1151000	Some of them will find a way to turn it around and make it sound like a compliment. Those are really good.
1151000	1158000	Yeah, it's really funny. So I don't know. I said, but not, not everybody can let it roll off their back like that. Like not everybody's ready for that.
1159000	1168000	And you know, if this is a pretty simple guy who just coded games in his spare time, whether it was inspired by heavily other stuff or not, he probably just wasn't ready for it.
1169000	1174000	It's funny because it's one of those things where there is one good thing about the game. It reached critical acclaim for everybody to play it.
1174000	1180000	But everything else, like nitpicking is a thing, but everything else people can complain about.
1181000	1190000	The concept is stolen from previous games and there's the, the P.O.P.O., I want to say Chinese something or other game from 2010 that people said it was a ripoff of.
1191000	1199000	The Super Mario Brothers assets ripoff, the extreme, like despite liking the game, people go crazy about the extreme difficulty of it.
1199000	1213000	So you, you have this one good thing that brings things together well enough for it to take hold, but then everybody finds everything to complain about and it, it, it escalates dramatically.
1214000	1222000	Well, I guess this is good news because I put your theory to the test and I went to Twitter and I searched for orange lounge radio in quotes and I put sucks and I didn't get anything.
1223000	1226000	So I'm hoping that just means we're not famous or something.
1226000	1227000	There's probably just about me.
1228000	1229000	We just haven't made it yet.
1230000	1237000	Well, it was funny that you mentioned this because, and I responded to him, although I didn't check for an answer, the guy who did Potter Puppet Pals, I'm following him on Tumblr.
1238000	1250000	And he was, he's posted a whole bunch of really positive messages that he got and he said, yeah, I get a whole lot of, you know, crap from people too, you know, but I guess that's just the side part of being moderately famous on the internet.
1251000	1252000	And I was like, yeah.
1252000	1263000	It's, you said that under your breath a minute ago, the whole like, well, I'm surprised you didn't see anything about me, but you know, in, in all seriousness, you have taken some heat being a host of the show before, because sometimes...
1264000	1265000	Because I'm a woman.
1266000	1267000	Because I'm a woman.
1268000	1273000	Which, you know, possibly, and you do, you do have strong opinions, which is part of why we have you on the show.
1273000	1281000	Strong opinions make for good discussions, right? But you take heat sometimes for that. And you had to learn in the beginning to let it roll off your back.
1282000	1283000	Because in the beginning it was hard, right?
1284000	1285000	Yeah. It's, it's, and I keep bringing it up because...
1286000	1287000	Not to put you on the spot, but...
1288000	1297000	Because I think it's absolutely hilarious now being told on a, what was it? Dig response to, uh, get back in the, in the kitchen and stop talking.
1298000	1299000	Fuck you.
1300000	1307000	You just need to have your tongue cut out and never talk again and your fingers cut off and never type again, because that type of behavior is unacceptable.
1308000	1309000	Your parents should be ashamed of you.
1310000	1314000	Well, I mean, let's, that was a dig comment. I mean, that dates it right there.
1315000	1317000	I know. Yeah. It was like in our second year.
1318000	1326000	But yeah, but I mean, but in all seriousness, you know, you had to kind of like be able to let that roll off your back and this guy's probably still trying to get used to that too.
1327000	1328000	So...
1329000	1339000	Yeah. After a while you just don't care. I mean, oh God, I hate to just put it that way, but it's like, if I see anything negative about me now, I'm just like, you don't know who I am. Fuck you.
1340000	1341000	Uh, and Loki, Loki's...
1342000	1343000	Who are you?
1344000	1348000	Loki's got some of it too. Loki gets the heat too. I haven't taken as much, I mean, certainly there's been negative things written about me on the internet.
1349000	1356000	I, I, I will say this. I get the emails in private. Uh, the I'm going to pray for you emails. I've gotten two of those in the past.
1357000	1359000	So I'm going to pray for you, but I'm going to pray for an intervention.
1360000	1372000	So, I mean, we all, and the first time I was kind of like, I was actually kind of flattered because I was like, wow, somebody really took the time out of their day to like put this, like they must, they must really believe in what they're saying.
1373000	1383000	But then I was just like, Hmm, interesting. And then, you know, delete, you know, like, what can, what can you do? Like, I didn't really want to respond and engage in a dialogue or what have you, but it was just interesting as all so.
1384000	1391000	Yeah. And, and by, by the way, guys, I don't really give a shit about whoever that asshole was before. I really don't care.
1392000	1393000	Yeah.
1394000	1395000	Fucking people.
1396000	1400000	Black Wolf found an account that I was going to bring up. There is a twitter.com slash OLR sucks.
1401000	1402000	Is there really? There is really.
1403000	1408000	Get out. It hasn't been updated in three years and it's for a private, uh, religious school.
1409000	1411000	Oh, I thought it was actually about the damn show.
1411000	1418000	No, no, no, no, but I did search. I did, you did orange Laundrio sucks. I did at OLR sucks and a Ronnie Talbot said it.
1419000	1422000	Our good friend Ronnie from big brother.
1423000	1433000	Oh, January 26th. And I quote, he's sending it to your, to yourself and OLR. The thing that the tweet that it matched says they never consider the concept of everyone sucks in the beginning.
1434000	1438000	They expect auto awesomeness from the MMO from the MMO a couple of weeks ago.
1438000	1439000	Yeah. He was thinking about League of Legends.
1440000	1442000	And also tech 2030 would like to say orange Laundrio sucks.
1443000	1448000	He just did that cause I opened my big mouth and now we're going to get like five tweets this week to say orange Laundrio sucks. Yeah.
1449000	1450000	You know what? You know what sucks?
1451000	1452000	Your attitude sucks.
1453000	1454000	No, no, no, no, no. You know what sucks?
1455000	1456000	What?
1457000	1458000	Vacuum.
1459000	1460000	That was like a dad joke.
1460000	1465000	Um, so as far as flappy bird goes, uh, just to put, to bring this conversation.
1466000	1469000	Play the game or don't and stop, stop freaking out.
1470000	1472000	I give it as much clout as any mobile phone game.
1473000	1475000	And your 53 point high score speaks to that.
1476000	1483000	Well, you know, if you're going to do something, be good at it. Um, do you think flappy bird will come back?
1485000	1486000	Jason?
1486000	1496000	I have no idea. I don't know enough of the detail. I didn't keep up on the news enough to go all pundit on it.
1497000	1503000	I have no idea. I hope, um, I hope he makes the correct, the right decisions for himself.
1504000	1509000	And he does, he does what works out best for him. And otherwise I don't know. And I don't care.
1510000	1512000	Loki, will flappy bird be back?
1513000	1518000	It's never, it's not gone. At least on Android. You can just go download it on the internet.
1519000	1520000	Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet.
1521000	1522000	That's true.
1523000	1527000	Except for episodes of, uh, being Bobby Brown, which I, I don't know about that.
1528000	1532000	Um, and my thought is it will absolutely come back in probably a few weeks time.
1533000	1537000	He just updated it like two days ago before he had his breakdown. So I, it'll be back.
1537000	1542000	Here's my response. Why do we care? It's a fucking game.
1543000	1550000	There are much bigger things in the world going on to worry about than some guy having an emo fest and taking his game off of the iApp store.
1551000	1554000	Well, yet here we are with a video game podcast. It is relevant.
1555000	1562000	But, but, but, I'm talking when you're seeing this shit on CNN, you know, isn't there, aren't there revolts going on in the Ukraine right now?
1562000	1568000	Don't we have people being abused in Russia right now because of something they were born, you know?
1569000	1572000	We have bigger things to worry about than CNN reporting on a fucking game.
1573000	1574000	They have to pad those 24 hours somehow.
1575000	1582000	Well, the CNN is just kind of like your grandparents going, hey, look, I found something cool on the internet that you guys have never heard of before.
1583000	1585000	Unless your grandparents are Southern, then it's all Fox News.
1586000	1590000	Have you heard of this thing called Twitter? There are celebrities tweeting each other.
1590000	1596000	I'm sure like in a decade or so they'll figure out about, you know, they'll find out about Reddit and then, you know, we'll hear stories about that.
1597000	1598000	It's just a little slow and that kind of stuff.
1599000	1602000	Oh God, I almost choked at the thought of grandparents on Reddit. That's scary.
1603000	1604000	That would be hilarious.
1605000	1613000	My television is for my PlayStation 4. I don't use it for television. Oh, unless, unless RuPaul's Drag Race is on. That's the only thing I watch. I swear.
1614000	1615000	All right. Maybe Survivor once in a while.
1615000	1623000	For the record, I don't see, you know what? BBC reported on it, so I am gravely disappointed with the BBC.
1624000	1626000	Your tax dollars at work. All right.
1627000	1629000	That's BBC. They're not our tax dollars.
1630000	1638000	Anyhow, let's move on. Let's talk about the games that maybe do deserve a little more attention. The types of games that we have been playing this week.
1639000	1642000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? What types of video games have you been playing?
1642000	1652000	I played Final Fantasy 14 a couple of times this week. I actually finished my Summoner, whatever the crap it was.
1653000	1664000	And I've been playing Animal Crossing and I've been playing with my work computer because that's fun. It's practically a game.
1665000	1674000	For the record, I no longer, while it's still a cool job, I will be referring to it as low cat land of cubicles and technology.
1675000	1679000	Because that narrows it down. For all the homestucks. Which is the point, of course. Yes.
1679000	1692000	Yeah, I was playing a little bit more Zelda. Link Between Worlds. I'm thinking about buying a Triforce necklace. I'm also thinking about getting a Triforce tattoo. In white ink.
1693000	1695000	So it will glow under a blacklight.
1696000	1699000	Is that just an inherent thing of tattoo ink or is it a special...
1700000	1702000	Anything that's white will glow under a blacklight.
1703000	1705000	Oh, of course. Disregard.
1709000	1711000	Is that it for your gaming week? Yes.
1712000	1714000	Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1715000	1720000	I actually played a bunch of different stuff. Well, not entirely different stuff, but some different stuff.
1721000	1727000	Let's see. I actually got to play a little big planet karting.
1728000	1738000	Because I've had that from Playstation Plus for the longest time and my son was trying to... he wanted to play Mario Kart or something, but I was in the middle of playing Call of Duty at the time.
1739000	1743000	So I was like, alright, let's see what other games are on here. I'm all, hey, you wanna play this one?
1744000	1748000	He's like, no, I'll watch you play. So I got to check that out and it's pretty cool.
1748000	1757000	I like how you can reskin all the weapons and everything. So they have a bunch of Mario Kart maps that actually have Mario Kart weapons.
1758000	1768000	I don't know. It's a lot better than I thought it was gonna be. Because I heard ModNation racers have terrible load times and just everything was really buggy and slow.
1769000	1772000	It actually turned out pretty cool. So I'm kind of digging that.
1772000	1783000	And then I played Call of Duty 4 because it kind of went back to that. My friends got us all together on Playstation 3 to play that game.
1784000	1791000	So I've been trying to level up because there's no real easy way to do that because we normally play private games.
1791000	1802000	So I was doing that and then, what else? A little bit of Minecraft and a little bit of, very little bit of Super Mario Galaxy.
1803000	1811000	I bust the Wii on and unfortunately my disc for Mario Kart doesn't work anymore because that was what we were originally gonna play.
1812000	1818000	I was just gonna try to teach Josh how to play that game, but he didn't want to learn. It didn't matter because the disc didn't work.
1818000	1828000	That's it. And actually I'm hoping to be able to play it this week. I just bought Jazzpunk, which looks hilarious.
1829000	1834000	So I'm gonna try that and also have a copy of the Lego Movie Game waiting for me at my work.
1835000	1840000	So I should be playing that later this week because I saw the movie and it's fucking awesome. It's seriously amazing.
1840000	1845000	Tons of people have been talking about the movie and I've been hearing a lot of really good reviews about it.
1846000	1850000	So I'll have to see it at some point. This week is gonna be crazy for me because I have a show this weekend.
1851000	1857000	But yeah, I want to check that out at some point. And then apparently the game is not half bad for a movie tie-in game anyway.
1858000	1867000	Yeah, it's supposed to be pretty good. It's done by Traveler Tales and they've done all the Lego games, but this one's supposed to be a lot better because it doesn't really stick to a certain story.
1867000	1876000	They kind of can do whatever they want. And I gotta say though, the movie, I knew it was gonna be good because I was really excited about the whole thing.
1877000	1884000	But then, not to spoil anything, at the end it kind of takes a different tone and it's just kind of like, whoa, I was not expecting that.
1885000	1891000	I had to go play Legos the day after. Seriously, I've been playing Legos this week and that's what I was doing with my son.
1892000	1899000	Success. Tigerclaw says, Lego movie made a lot of money this weekend. $69 million. Wow, I didn't realize that.
1900000	1903000	And it's Rotten Tomatoes rating is through the roof. 95 last night.
1904000	1911000	Well, good for them. It wasn't really on my radar. And it's interesting we bring up the games too because those Lego games, they all do pretty well.
1911000	1918000	And they're all pretty good. None of them are really great, but they're all good and most people seem satisfied with their purchases.
1919000	1924000	So it's kind of been a long running game series. It's always kind of been there that a lot of people are playing, not a lot of people are talking about.
1925000	1930000	They don't always get critically acclaimed, but it's kind of nice to see that they're still doing a good job with it.
1931000	1940000	And the other thing, before the movie came out, I was over at Barnes and Noble and they had all the toy sets from the movie. Damn, do I want those toys.
1941000	1946000	They had some really crazy sets and all that stuff was in the movie and I was like, oh man.
1947000	1962000	And you would love, both Rob and Jamie would love Cuckoo Cloudland in there. Seriously, it's almost like straight out of Wreck-It Ralph with the whole...
1963000	1974000	Well, you're being a super consumer whore, but I don't blame you. I love Legos too, so I have to see the movie at some point. Excellent.
1975000	1978000	Alright, well, Jason, why don't we go to you and I'll go last.
1979000	1989000	I wanted to play something else this weekend, this week, other than Forza, last two weeks actually, other than Forza and FIFA, so I bought Peggle 2.
1990000	1996000	Because that was the only thing in the Xbox One marketplace that looked remotely interesting and what can I say? Well, it's Peggle 2.
1997000	2008000	If you've played Peggle, it's Peggle 2. It's cute. The art style is a little bit more zany, cartoony that kind of throws me off guard.
2009000	2020000	And I was very, very... I had a shock reflex. So, let me change topics a little bit. I was playing a lot with the extra things of the Xbox One this weekend.
2020000	2025000	Smart Glass for the Xbox One specifically, SkyDrive and Upload Studio, all of that kind of stuff.
2026000	2035000	Can I say that I am so glad that the uploads export in MP4 and not WMV and it's kind of crazy how ubiquitous MP4 is everywhere.
2036000	2043000	So anyways, I took all of my clips that were actually remotely interesting, uploaded them so I can do fancy things with them now, download them, all that kind of stuff.
2043000	2053000	So, I was playing Peggle and the third level, the third scene, you know, the first is a unicorn whose name I always forget, the second one is a troll under a bridge.
2054000	2066000	The third level is a winter wonderland with a sasquatch and, or yeti, I forget which one it is, and when you get the extreme fever, when the level wraps up, he turns around and his butt is censored.
2067000	2078000	I was, I had a shock, it's like, did PopCap really just do that? Oh, it's a bare-ass joke. So, I saw that and I have video of it and I can upload it and it's silly.
2079000	2085000	What puts the two in Peggle 2? Because I really don't know, like, what did they change?
2086000	2095000	The abilities are different, the characters are, the three that I've gotten, two of the three that have been different, the unicorn is still there, but the troll and the sasquatch are new.
2096000	2103000	Um, the game is still the same formula. Playability-wise, besides power-ups, like I said, there's nothing different to speak of.
2104000	2106000	I still like the owl, the zen owl best of everybody.
2107000	2114000	I, yeah, they were all incredibly cute. I loved everything in the version of Peggle that I've played before, rather.
2115000	2117000	I like that one in which everyone gives you the pinball power.
2117000	2128000	Um, it's not different. It's very much Peggle. A couple of coworkers and also people that have been visiting the office ask me what I'm playing, what the game is about, whatever it is like that.
2129000	2137000	And I look at them and I go, you know The Price is Right? Do you remember Plinko? It's basically that. And I think that's a very accurate statement.
2138000	2143000	It's more random and diverse for obvious gaming reasons, but I think it's a pretty good description.
2144000	2149000	So I've played a lot of that, basically just kind of pick up and go and stop in between doing things, all that kind of stuff.
2150000	2155000	While I was exporting the video last night, I went over and played Peggle. Like an hour and a half of it.
2156000	2162000	I think I've come to the conclusion that my first system... I don't know exactly when I'm gonna get a Wii U.
2163000	2170000	Again, this is all financially dependent. But I think this generation, I'm gonna get a PS4 before an Xbox One.
2170000	2176000	Again, as always, this has very much to do more with the library than anything else.
2177000	2181000	But as it stands right now, there is nothing compelling for me to buy an Xbox One for.
2182000	2188000	I have already played Dead Rising four times, and to do it a fifth time seems silly and excessive.
2189000	2194000	Not to mention I'm still very jaded by that demo, like I was talking about before.
2194000	2201000	And I just, like, whatever. Don't get me wrong, I love Dead Rising, but a fifth time without actually having an investment in it yet.
2202000	2205000	Not to mention making a literally financial investment to be able to play it. Eh, whatever.
2206000	2213000	And I was thinking about it, the more and more I thought about it about the last couple of years, I missed a lot of really good shit last generation.
2214000	2223000	Because my PS3 library is all of five games. I missed Infamous. I missed Prototype. I missed Tomb Raider. I missed Uncharted. I missed Last of Us.
2224000	2233000	My PS3 has been horribly completely neglected, which I will be correcting thanks to PlayStation Plus and the revolving door of excellent games.
2234000	2241000	But I missed a lot of really good games that I never played whatsoever. Not at friends' houses, not at anything like that.
2242000	2251000	So this generation, I'm gonna change that. PS4 or Wii U will be my first console of choice probably sometime this year. I have to imagine sometime this year.
2251000	2262000	Not to mention, I really like the PS4 camera abilities and just Playroom in general. The PS4 camera seems so much better than the Kinect.
2263000	2273000	Because it has something more tactile and more controllable in the sense of the controller camera. The controller, did they even have a name for that?
2273000	2275000	The move in the controller? Whatever.
2276000	2277000	Six axis? Still?
2278000	2279000	That's probably true.
2280000	2281000	The thing that does stuff.
2282000	2291000	The glowy light in the back of the controller. The Kinect, I love the voice commands and it'll be interesting to see how the PS4 holds up against the Xbox One in that regard.
2292000	2296000	But as far as interactivity is concerned, the Kinect control still really sucks.
2297000	2303000	The other thing, I don't know if, I don't remember if this was a thing in the Xbox console or if you could only do it with games.
2304000	2312000	But with the original Xbox 360, you could hold your hand in place to select an item. With the Kinect, with the Xbox One, you have to push forward.
2313000	2320000	That's terrible. I don't know what it is, but I cannot do it. And so on some of those smaller pins on the Xbox One's interface, fucking impossible for me.
2321000	2329000	I don't have the most steady hands in the first place, but the slowness to maintain smooth motion for the icon on screen, I just don't like it.
2330000	2334000	I'm horribly inaccurate with it, which has been a complaint against Kinect the whole time.
2335000	2345000	But yeah, it's unfortunate because I love what they, everything else that Microsoft has been doing, the fact that they have good online communities looks fun.
2345000	2351000	But I missed a really good library in Sony, and so I think I'll change that this year.
2352000	2355000	I think Xbox One's library is going to be very compelling at the end of the year.
2356000	2357000	Absolutely.
2358000	2363000	It's going to be very interesting to see what it has versus Sony, but yeah. Right now I'm totally happy with my PlayStation 4.
2364000	2369000	Xbox One will come eventually, especially if they get some of those games out this year.
2370000	2378000	If it's true, some of the rumors we were talking about last week with Forza Horizon, that'll sell me a console right there, and Halo 2 Anniversary would be great.
2379000	2380000	Quantum Break looks great.
2381000	2386000	A lot of it is more a reflection of the fact that my game plane really took a nosedive over the last five years.
2387000	2396000	And so that's more, not that aspect of it, I'm not knocking one system or another, but I think there is already enough on the PlayStation 4 now to get started.
2396000	2400000	And there will continue to be as will happen with any console.
2401000	2409000	But, just saying, that's the direction right now that I'm leaning on, and if I can swing it in a couple of months, that's more than likely going to be my choice.
2410000	2411000	Alright, well anything else for your gaming week this week?
2412000	2418000	I did play Flappy Bird, I got 15 or 16 I want to say. I deleted it, I don't give a shit.
2419000	2420000	Alright, fair enough.
2420000	2426000	Okay, my gaming week has been almost predominantly one game. I did do a few other games together.
2427000	2428000	Final Fantasy XIV!
2429000	2431000	Well, that's a given. That's every week.
2432000	2441000	I did watch Extifer play a little bit of Outlast, which is on PlayStation 4, so I got to see a little bit of that, because I haven't played it in Steam, but I haven't played a whole, whole lot.
2442000	2444000	And I definitely was having that whole, like I hear my mom in the back of my head,
2444000	2448000	Rob, that is gross! Why are those corpses hanging? That is disgusting!
2449000	2451000	Please tell me that you marked it for download, at least, on PlayStation Plus.
2452000	2456000	Oh yeah, I already have it on my PlayStation 4, I just, I keep looking at it going, should I play it?
2457000	2458000	And then I go, no, I'm going to play more Tomb Raider.
2459000	2470000	And despite, as we've said a number of times now, despite not having a PlayStation 4, if you have a PlayStation Plus account, buy those games from the website, so you have them as soon as you have the system.
2470000	2476000	And Alan has trolled me at least three times this week, he goes, so, you should go play the scary game, and you should stream it for your people.
2477000	2478000	Yes.
2479000	2480000	And I'm like, no.
2481000	2482000	Yes! Do it!
2483000	2484000	When I finally get a stinking camera, maybe, but those things are still hard to find.
2485000	2486000	October 31st, maybe? Anyway.
2487000	2495000	Maybe. Here's the thing, here's the thing, I would love to play more Outlast and Tomb Raider and all that stuff, but my life has been consumed with a particular title on the 3DS this week.
2495000	2503000	And, of course, this is Shane's fault, because y'all know he was here visiting last week, and Shane has this ability to really sell you on a video game.
2504000	2505000	He's really, I don't know why-
2506000	2507000	He's like, I'm even trying.
2508000	2516000	I don't know why he isn't like a video game salesman for like a major company trying to, well, in a way he kind of is, but he needs to be like even higher up in that.
2517000	2521000	He needs to be selling like the big stuff towards, you know, big chains and stuff, because he's really good at selling that stuff.
2521000	2530000	So, anyway, the game he convinced me to get the demo for was a game called Bravely Default, which is on the 3DS, and I know there's been a lot of chatter about the game this week.
2531000	2539000	And, like, you know, Shane, one of my closest friends, first time I'd seen him in three years, he was here on the show Sunday, and then Monday, what do we do?
2540000	2543000	We sat here and we just played the Bravely Default demo in the same room for like most of the day.
2543000	2555000	I sunk five hours into the demo, and then the game itself was released on Friday, so I realized after a couple hours of the demo that I was going to buy this game, so I bought it so it would be delivered by Friday.
2556000	2566000	And since Friday to now, I've already sunk eight hours into the game, which might not sound like a lot, but for somebody who has like gamer ADD as bad as I do and everything else that I have going on,
2566000	2573000	pretty much every moment that I haven't been doing something for the show next week or what have you, I've been playing Stink and Bravely Default.
2574000	2582000	If you don't know what the game is, it's basically the Final Fantasy 3DS remake.
2583000	2592000	I mean, the art style is very similar, this one has all the voice acting though, but it is a classic Final Fantasy game.
2592000	2605000	If people are pissed at the direction Final Fantasy has been taking with XIII and some of the more recent titles, then maybe this is the game that they really want, because this game takes a lot of its nods from a classic Final Fantasy game.
2606000	2617000	Now obviously it's not Final Fantasy Bravely Default, it is a new series that Square Enix is trying, but they've come out and pretty much said this was originally going to be a sequel to the Warriors of Light, the original DS title.
2617000	2623000	You know, we're doing some different things with it. I mean, the only thing, you know, it's not chocobos and mogs, it's some different stuff.
2624000	2633000	A lot of the jobs are very similar, the job system is straight out of Final Fantasy V, so why do I like this game so much if I kind of have this whole been there, done that attitude about it?
2633000	2649000	Because there's something very familiar yet inviting about the game, where yes, it's an all new story, but it feels kind of like I'm picking up this favorite TV series that was on 20 years ago that hasn't really been on in a very long time.
2650000	2658000	It's like, oh, they're out with a new season, and it's a little bit different, or it's a spinoff, but it's kind of like that old show that you miss, and that's kind of where I'm at with Bravely Default.
2658000	2668000	They do some interesting things with street passes and friends lists too, which they have this whole little like, rebuild the town, and you can open new shops and things like that.
2669000	2677000	And you, kind of this very Facebook-y, apply the workers, and you can, you know, and if you street pass people, you get more workers. There's that whole thing in it.
2678000	2692000	And also, the game does an interesting thing where you can actually send moves to friends. Like, let's say for whatever reason I have a friend who's not leveling a white mage in their party, but I have a white mage in mine.
2693000	2702000	I could send a protect spell through the internet, and then my friend could actually use it in their game one time. And then if they need it again, I could send it again or whatever.
2702000	2715000	And you can do street passes and send all those. That was kind of neat. It's something a little different for street passing, and it gives a certain competitive and cooperative element too to playing this game at the same time with your friends.
2716000	2721000	Like, I have an awful lot of 3DS friends who are playing this game right now, and it makes it kind of fun.
2722000	2731000	So, yeah, that's all great. Now, I do have to razz the game for at least one thing, and the game is infamous for this, and I know we've talked about it on this show in the past.
2732000	2742000	The game has one, only one, but it's a microtransaction. And it's a microtransaction that some could argue makes it pay to win.
2743000	2752000	I don't know why this is, well I know why it's in there, because some people are gonna buy it and it's gonna, you know, hey, it's more money in Square Enix's pocket.
2753000	2757000	And Square Enix has done a lot of questionable things when it comes to microtransactions in the land of mobile lately.
2757000	2762000	Like that Final Fantasy All, the bravest game from last year, that was utter garbage that came out.
2763000	2768000	And then there was the, you know, the recent Final Fantasy VI remake that came out that has some questionable art choices in it.
2769000	2780000	So they're doing some very weird things, and one of the things, what it is, the one microtransaction is, you can buy this thing called a, I think it's a second potion or a second default or something like that.
2780000	2787000	It's a, it's a sleep potion, I don't know what it is, what it's called. But you use it in the middle of battle and you get to do an extra move.
2788000	2794000	That's kind of like the big thing about it. And it can help you if you have a lot of them, because I think when you spend 99 cents you get three of them.
2795000	2798000	So you could really turn the tide of a boss battle by using these.
2799000	2808000	Now it is important to say, you do get these SP points on your own if you leave your DS sleeping, every eight hours you'll get one.
2808000	2819000	Like a typical Facebook game. But this element is in there, and it, it, I, some people are going to question me for thinking this way, but I don't really care, it's my honest gut.
2820000	2828000	It puts a tarnish, it puts a little poo smear on the game. I mean literally, it's a little poo smear on what is otherwise a great game.
2829000	2835000	You kind of look at that and go, that is fucking cheap, that is tacky, that is a tacky ass color they chose for that.
2835000	2844000	I, I can't help but feel that way. Is that I go, gosh this game is such a great, man I remember those classic Final Fantasy games.
2845000	2855000	I was, I'm so excited to play another classic Final Fantasy game, but then oh, there's this poo stain of the modern, you know, microtransactions and how that has filth up some of our games.
2855000	2864000	And so that to me, I didn't like that. But I'm just ignoring it. I'm just pretending it's not there and I'm not, I'm not accessing it. I'm not going to give them my money for that future.
2865000	2878000	I hope you guys out there won't spend your money on it either, not even to check it out. We have to send the message that JRPGs in America, yes, microtransactions in them, no. Very important.
2879000	2883000	Bravely Default is not the game we want, but the game we need.
2883000	2896000	I also just want to say quickly, now I see some folks in the chat, I see actdeft in chat at live.vognetware.com. Bravely Default's demo didn't solve me into the game, therefore I'm going to skip it.
2897000	2903000	Granted, I need to, oh sorry, oh here it is, Skye, what you're saying about the game that sold you into it is what turned me off of it.
2903000	2913000	Which is fine, but go check out, the demo is very robust, I will say this, the demo doesn't even scratch the surface of the story and doesn't have any of the voice acting or any of that.
2914000	2921000	But as far as the mechanics go, it does a pretty good job teaching you the whole Brave and Default mechanics, which in a nutshell, I've talked too long about this game, I'm trying to wrap up.
2921000	2928000	But Default is like defend, but instead of just defending, you stock up an action point to use later.
2929000	2933000	So you could defend for two rounds and then unleash three attacks in a certain round.
2934000	2939000	But sometimes, as you know, you want to defend against big attacks, it's kind of like a battery, that's the whole Brave-Default system.
2940000	2945000	You can get a sense for how that system works in the demo, and even the Streetpass feature and all that is in the demo.
2945000	2955000	And the other one last cool thing, I thought that was pretty cool, if you play the demo and there's like seven different unlocks you can get, depending on how far you get, for things that carry over into the regular game.
2956000	2959000	And it is quite a nice little kick in the pants boost to start the game.
2960000	2968000	So they are particularly notable, and even if you buy the game before you play the demo, would it still be worth it to play the demo even if you bought the retail game to start with?
2968000	2978000	Sure. Why not? I think so. All it's going to give you is it's going to give you very basic items that level one characters would have to start, that otherwise you'd just grind to get the money to buy it.
2979000	2983000	Like it's going to give you a rod and a hat. It's going to give you two potions and a phoenix down.
2984000	2987000	Those are the types of things your basic Final Fantasy characters get in the beginning, right?
2988000	2993000	So it's not going to change the tide of the game, but it'll start you off a little better.
2994000	2995000	It'll bump the bottom line a little bit higher.
2995000	3006000	Exactly. There you go. That's interesting. I see a lot of comments in chat, not fans. Rama said, played Bravely default demo, thought it sucked.
3007000	3012000	Tech 2030 says, yeah, I played it too, wasn't feeling it. So not everybody's into it.
3013000	3018000	I have at least eight friends on 3DS who are playing this right now, which out of my list of 30 people is quite a bit.
3018000	3025000	So I don't know. If you like the classic Final Fantasy games, at least check out the demo. If it's not up your alley, then more for me.
3026000	3035000	But yeah, I do hope the game does well enough that they'll want to release more Japanese RPGs in America because I do feel like this is the type of game we keep asking for.
3036000	3045000	And here it is. And so I really hope that whole micro transaction thing doesn't fuck it all up and then they're going to, people reject the game and then people go,
3045000	3051000	oh, well, Americans didn't want the JRPG. It's like, no, we didn't want this other bullshit that you put in there. Anyway.
3052000	3058000	Um, Loki, do you, have you been following Bravely default at all? Do you have any opinions on this whole thing?
3059000	3064000	No, honestly, I mean, it looked like a Final Fantasy game, but other than that, I haven't really followed much of it.
3064000	3071000	Gotcha. All right. Well, we're going to get into some news stories here real quick. Some housekeeping. Um, I don't have a lot tonight.
3072000	3085000	Just twitter.com slash O L R and facebook.com slash orange launch radio. If you want to follow us on social media, there's also google.com slash plus orange lounge radio is our, uh, uh, Google plus page, which we'll get to the, uh, question of the week there.
3086000	3090000	We do get quite a few responses. So somebody's using Google plus there's at least a handful of people there.
3090000	3091000	There's at least three.
3092000	3099000	That's why I keep giving out the URL. There's somebody's on it. Plus the more Google kind of forces you on it. I think some people just kind of accept, all right, I might as well use this.
3100000	3106000	All right. Um, let's get into some gaming news. We've got quite a bit tonight, so let's get into it. Loki.
3107000	3115000	Okay. So, um, in March we're going to be having the first kind of installment of the Melger solid five series starting with ground zeros.
3116000	3132000	And, uh, it is coming out at more of a budget price, kind of like, um, you know, 29 99 I think for, uh, the physical copies on, uh, uh, PlayStation three and Xbox three 60 and, uh, 49 99 and Xbox one, um, something like that.
3132000	3141000	And, uh, the kind of bad thing about it though, aside from, you know, the fact that it's not the full Melger solid five game, it's only two hours long.
3142000	3149000	And that's if you actually do the standalone, you know, campaign and everything, I guess there's some side stuff you can do, but it doesn't really add a whole ton of extra.
3150000	3157000	So it's almost like you're paying for like a glorified demo, if you will, and, uh, kind of, um, you know, add insult to injury there.
3158000	3171000	The full game might not even be out this year. In fact, the window right now for, uh, Melger solid five, the Phantom pain is anywhere between October, 2014 through December, 2015.
3172000	3180000	So I guess maybe, you know, the incentive that, Oh, it's only two hours long as well. It may be the only two hours of the game you get to play this year.
3181000	3186000	Didn't Gran Turismo five have something like this where before they released the game, there was the whole prologue or whatever that was.
3187000	3195000	They do that with Gran Turismo five. And even if you remember, um, like Dead Rising two had that kind of prologue Xbox live arcade game.
3196000	3198000	Yeah, but that was like a $10 game and it was more than two hours, wasn't it?
3199000	3200000	Uh, it was about two hours.
3201000	3207000	I was going to say it certainly wasn't longer. It certainly wasn't as much as four. I think I probably finished it close to the same time frame.
3208000	3215000	But at least it was a lot cheaper. Whereas, you know, you're talking about now it was arcade priced instead of half, three fourths retail price.
3215000	3219000	I love that whole, it's a budget price at $49 on Xbox one. What?
3220000	3225000	Nope. It's $10 less than any normal game release. Ooh, that's a, that's a, that's a massive savings right there.
3226000	3230000	I get that video games carry a bit of a premium for the, you know, type of entertainment they provide.
3231000	3240000	And like, you know, it wouldn't be out of question to pay $30 for a Blu-ray movie that's only two hours, right? But this is, right? But this is starting to push it.
3241000	3243000	That's a funny comparison considering the movies are rarely longer than two hours.
3243000	3249000	Well, some of them are epics though. Rarely. Rarely. Rarely.
3250000	3255000	Okay. But anyway, my point is still that, you know, that's a lot of money to drop on a two hour experience.
3256000	3265000	Yes. And it really does feel like this is something to try and boost Konami's bottom line because the game isn't coming out in a particular financial year that they need it to.
3266000	3267000	So this is just a little like.
3268000	3287000	Well, and Konami, I mean, they don't really have a whole ton of stuff coming out. I mean, they have Castlevania, Lords of Shadows 2, and I know Phantom Pains, and Ground Zeroes, and Pro Evo is really the only stuff I know on the slate so far aside from, you know, the rumored maybe reboot of Silent Hill or another entry into that.
3288000	3299000	Konami's kind of lost me with a lot of that stuff too. Like, I used to love Castlevania and now this new one, I forgot. I just don't care. I didn't even really like the last one that was out on PlayStation 3 and stuff.
3300000	3301000	Talking about the Lords of Shadows.
3302000	3312000	Yeah, I just don't like the direction those games have ended up going. They're not what they used to be, you know? So it's kind of like I'm just like, eh, don't care. Some people will disagree with me, but that's fine. That's opinion.
3313000	3327000	I remember when I first saw this article that I thought the swing was from December this year to October next year, which a 10 month swing is pretty bad, but a 15, 14, 15 month swing is a little bit crazier.
3328000	3338000	It could, it may come out at the end of this year or it could be out sometime in the entirety of next year. Yeah, that's a, that's a real good target date to provide anybody with.
3339000	3346000	Anybody here planning on dropping the $40 on the Metal Gear Solid 2 hour side story demo-y thing?
3347000	3357000	I might, to be honest, just because I really do love the Metal Gear series and I need to start playing more than just the core series, even though this is technically part of the core series.
3358000	3367000	I'm assuming I have a PS4 by the time it comes out. That's a good milestone to be against. Get a PS4 before any part of Metal Gear Solid 5 drops.
3368000	3375000	Or rather Phantom Pain, not any part of it. Anyways, I might, or we'll just wait for PlayStation Plus to give it to you in like five months after it comes out.
3376000	3379000	Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's exactly where I'm at. I'm gonna wait for the bargain bin or the PlayStation Plus.
3380000	3381000	That's the steam sale mentality now, unfortunately.
3382000	3391000	Well, I mean, well, I'll drop full price. I bought Bravely Default at full price and there's a lot of games I still buy at full price because I want to play them right away, but not this.
3392000	3395000	Going to the chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, Dartetsuya says,
3396000	3402000	Yeah, I wasn't really feeling it with Lords of Shadow. The 3DS ones seem cool, but the PlayStation 3, 360 ones just seem like a God of War-ish ripoff.
3403000	3404000	Also, Shadow of the Colossus.
3405000	3406000	Dungeonbuster says,
3407000	3412000	Weird that they would do a release like this. It's not like fans wouldn't wait for a complete version of the game to get back into Metal Gear Solid again.
3412000	3413000	Alan Alchemy says,
3414000	3425000	They need to keep Castlevania on handhelds and keep making clones of Symphony of the Night with slightly new mechanics to each game. If the art style and music keeps with the pedigree, they will sell. Don't give me that Castlevania God of War crap.
3426000	3438000	Hey, real quick, since I'm about to put him down. Hey, since I normally don't get to see him and, you know, because I'm at the show normally, my son's right here next to me.
3439000	3440000	I was wondering if you want to say hi. Josh, you want to say hi?
3441000	3442000	No.
3445000	3446000	Hi, Josh.
3447000	3448000	Say hi.
3450000	3451000	What?
3452000	3453000	He's tossing his pants up in the air.
3454000	3455000	You're a silly boy.
3456000	3457000	Yeah.
3458000	3463000	Josh, you're going to have to keep this show going into its 40th year when you're our age.
3464000	3467000	Are you going to do the radio show with Daddy when you get older?
3467000	3468000	Can you get older?
3470000	3471000	No?
3472000	3473000	He'll have to stop being so shy.
3474000	3475000	Alright, he's being shy.
3476000	3482000	That's fine, that's fine. I was shy at that age, too. Alright, let's move on with some more news, Jason.
3483000	3485000	That is very strange to think about. A shy Rob.
3486000	3487000	I know, right?
3488000	3489000	Scary thought.
3490000	3495000	To rigid our participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, police.
3496000	3504000	Amazon has entered into the gaming arena in a big way rather than just being a retailer and, you know, dealmaker and everything else.
3505000	3514000	Amazon has acquired Double Helix, which you may know as the people that have most notably, most recently, been working on Killer Instinct for the Xbox One.
3514000	3525000	It was an intellectual property and talent acquisition, so reportedly all 75 employees will continue working from home base in Orange County, I think it was?
3526000	3527000	Irvine? Orange County.
3528000	3536000	75 people on staff all will be retained through the transition as Double Helix becomes under the wing of Amazon.
3537000	3543000	This has furthered the theory that Amazon is going to expand their hardware division to include a gaming console.
3544000	3549000	Obviously they already make Kindles, they already make the Kindle Fires more specifically, more interestingly.
3550000	3562000	But there have been rumors with the fact that Amazon controls its own little Android ecosystem that should they decide to ramp up production of a lower-cost, competitive gaming console,
3562000	3581000	that now they have somebody to presumably guarantee solid first-party titles in addition to being able to take up other retailers, other Android devs that want to sign on to the Amazon App Store and join in the ever-growing ecosystem that Amazon.com entails.
3582000	3586000	Didn't we have a rumor a few months ago that Amazon was doing an Ouya, basically?
3587000	3589000	That Amazon was going to make their own Ouya console, like an Android console?
3590000	3591000	Probably at some point.
3592000	3597000	And I think Amazon is looking at, gee, where did Ouya fuck up? Oh yeah, Ouya, like they don't have any games.
3598000	3603000	So by having their own in-house to make exclusive titles for this device, they're going to guarantee a few more sales.
3604000	3611000	Plus, you know they're going to throw in some deals for Amazon Prime. They'll have a frickin' thing fly to your house and drop the console on your doorstep.
3612000	3624000	I mean, there was something last year, maybe late 2012, that long-time subscribers to Amazon Prime just, if they didn't already have a Kindle on their account, would just have a Kindle sent to them.
3625000	3628000	So yeah, Amazon's method for getting...
3629000	3630000	That was weird.
3631000	3633000	Sorry, we lost Loki for a minute, but he's back. Sorry, Jason.
3633000	3646000	Amazon's method for making money, they sell everything at cost, and they make their money back in interest by paying vendors back well before license terms, well before payback terms, and accrue the interest from that.
3647000	3649000	That's where all of most of their money comes from.
3650000	3661000	And then everything else, the fact that they're getting into same-day delivery, local delivery for vegetables is obviously a big deal, but as soon as they can be their own courier, get trucks to your house?
3661000	3663000	Amazon's gonna be a force to be reckoned with.
3664000	3669000	Or those frickin' drones! Not that I think that's actually gonna happen, because it'll get tied up in government red tape for 20 years.
3670000	3671000	And power lines, but that's a dumb joke.
3672000	3678000	But, I mean, that is literally what they're trying to do, is have little aliens drop them at your door. That is their dream.
3679000	3680000	Absolutely.
3681000	3682000	And I think most of us are like...
3683000	3684000	I'm gonna order a car and have them drop a car off.
3685000	3689000	I think most of us are like, yes please, send the robot army over, I want my video game right now.
3689000	3703000	I'm... I... I know the amount of abuse, and it's kind of scary to think about the viability in metropolitans, like, oh, I don't know, New York and San Francisco and places with high-rises where navigating it may be a little bit more difficult.
3704000	3708000	As if it's hard to avoid a solid object in, you know, a couple hundred feet up, but...
3709000	3713000	If they could drive around in the fifth element, they could figure out how to use that airspace.
3714000	3715000	That's an apt comparison.
3715000	3723000	Just go look at future movies where they all drive around, and Star Wars, the planets, come on, they'll figure it out.
3724000	3728000	Something interesting that I didn't even realize was who Double Helix is actually composed of.
3729000	3742000	I did not... I forgot that they were born out of SHINee and the Collective, so these are the people that have Earthworm Jim, Sacrifice, MDK, Star Wars Episode III to the extent...
3742000	3751000	I don't remember how good Episode III was. The prequel Star Wars games were really hit or miss in the various incarnations they had, but there's a lot of talent there.
3752000	3757000	And, like I've said a couple of times now over the last couple shows, Killer Instinct is fucking amazing!
3758000	3765000	It is a gorgeous game with detail for four fighting game buffs or not.
3765000	3772000	The game is incredibly attractive and so well built to the extent that I actually understand fighting games.
3773000	3781000	Terrible at it, but I understand it. There's a lot of talent there, and for Amazon to keep them all on board, anything they want to do to be able to provide a compelling product...
3782000	3789000	This is a good choice. It's gonna be a pretty interesting one to two years to see what Amazon's gonna do with them.
3790000	3794000	C. Allen in our chat room says, I for one welcome our robot Amazon overlords.
3795000	3804000	Let's see, Tech 2030 says, I got a really awesome deal from Amazon using my Amazon Visa and got a Kindle for $30. Did you get paid for that statement? Did I just read a commercial? I think I did.
3805000	3813000	I always, whenever I buy stuff, I see the $50 gift card thing for applying for an Amazon Visa.
3814000	3817000	Moving on to less commercially sponsored stories.
3817000	3819000	I don't know, this is pretty commercially crap.
3820000	3821000	Well, let's hear it.
3822000	3835000	EA has a free to play game called Dungeon Keeper, and it's very heavy on the transactions. I refuse to call them microtransactions because a transaction is a transaction and everyone drop your damn prefixes.
3835000	3845000	But now there is new accusation coming out against Electronic Arts saying that they've been manipulating the ratings on the game.
3846000	3861000	But one of the, the guy who's behind the Dungeon Keeper studio, that's EA Mythic, said that basically it's people just remembering the original game with fondness and pulling the whole nostalgia thing.
3861000	3874000	But apparently it's going because of the way the Android works for giving a game less than five.
3875000	3884000	It asks you to leave feedback as a sort of misdirection thing. So that's where that's coming from.
3884000	3894000	I don't, I actually wouldn't put it past EA for this, but they're still, you don't manipulate a ratings of your game to make it look better because then that just makes you look like crap.
3895000	3901000	Well, this also goes back to the fact I said earlier that 98% of the stuff that you get on the mobile phone marketplaces are garbage.
3902000	3919000	And the reason why they're so highly rated is because of stuff like this. Or, you know, they give a little kickback to their five-star reviewers such as an in-game item or a, you know, something to, like a little average, like one game I play actually displays five-star reviews in the game with the names in them.
3920000	3926000	So it's like you're famous for, you know, for a minute. So it's just, I don't know, like this kind of stuff is ridiculous.
3926000	3940000	Well, this game was just ridiculous in the first place. I mean, I don't know if you saw like some of the coverage of it, but I mean, it's taking the whole, you know, free-to-play kind of structure and just really exploiting it.
3941000	3949000	For example, you know, to break certain blocks to create dungeons literally takes hours if not days unless you want to pay real money to speed it up.
3949000	3964000	And I'm just gonna, I'm gonna keep it real here. This EA Mythic, like they did Warhammer Online, which was, that was a cool little MMO, you know, it was, it didn't ultimately end up working out because it just didn't work as a premium game in a very competitive marketplace.
3965000	3973000	But ever since then, EA Mythic's done this and they did Ultima Forever Quest for the Avatar, which was also a mobile phone game that I found to be offensive.
3974000	3991000	As an Ultima fan, I was like, what garbage has this sunk into? Like, sorry, that's just my opinion, you know, as somebody who kind of grew up on the Ultima series on PC, I was like, oh my gosh, Lord British would like take a chainsaw to this if he could, which he's not in the game.
3992000	4005000	What are you talking about, man? Lord British is making fucking crappy Facebook games. Remember the crappy YouTube shit? I had the yard sale thing that I had to play through for that stupid Ready Player One contest? Yeah, that was Lord British. Thank you!
4006000	4016000	I guess he hasn't fared much better, to be honest. He also made Tabula Rasa, which wasn't a very good MMO either, so I guess things like Ultima and Lord British were best in the 80s, sorry to say.
4017000	4026000	I do believe the meme is ratings fuckery. John Gruber, Daring Fireball. Wow, Daring Fireball. Way to go, Jason.
4027000	4044000	Daring Fireball, written by Gruber, had a big stint, and it's still a reasonably perpetual thing about people that will take examples of ratings nag screens and a bunch of other really nonsense stuff in-app and send it to them, and so he's pinned a couple articles about it.
4044000	4064000	It's kind of like the Metacritic argument, that when ratings are everything because it's some aspect of something being quantifiable, people do whatever they can to make it as good as possible, because there is legitimate benefit tied to this kind of stuff, unfortunately.
4065000	4070000	Hey, I always ask people that enjoy this show to go give it a nice rating on the various websites.
4071000	4078000	You know, I actually got feedback about that from somebody, that being suggested to rate something a certain way makes them not want to rate it at all.
4079000	4090000	Well, you say it once, you say it as a part of habit in the closing, you don't browbeat it.
4091000	4102000	I'm also very transparent in my reason for saying it. I'm just like, you know, we do this show, we don't ask for your money or any of this stuff, we just want you to help spread the word, so either tell a friend or two.
4103000	4110000	That's what I told him. He's like, oh, well, okay. Just some people, I don't know what it is.
4111000	4117000	There's definitely that whole, no, I don't want to do something because somebody told me to do it. It's not an uncommon reaction.
4117000	4121000	And the third example was going to be, whenever we talk about things like this, it comes up a second time in the show.
4122000	4129000	Well, my other thought is, fine, don't do it. I'm not going to cry or I'm not going to come to your house and berate you. If you don't want to do it, don't do it.
4130000	4132000	But I'm just kind of like, it would mean a lot if you would.
4133000	4134000	Please.
4135000	4145000	Alright, anyway, well, it's interesting that this story is out there, because now, I would say it's backfiring, but it's also giving the game publicity.
4146000	4152000	Because I'm sure there's a lot of people that are like, well, now I just have to see how bad this game is, or now I want to download this game just so I can give it a one-star review.
4153000	4158000	So, I don't know. I'm sure it's, you know what they say, press is press and still exposure.
4159000	4160000	Alright, let's move on. Loki?
4161000	4171000	Well, just to kind of go back to what you were just saying, they were justifying the structure of the game and all the in-app purchases or we'll see all these five-star reviews. People like it.
4172000	4181000	Yeah. Dungeon Buster, by the way, follows up saying, British is also working on Shroud of the Avatar, a spiritual successor to Ultimo with MMOish stuff.
4182000	4188000	Oh yes, I remember that Kickstarter. It was, because that's where a lot of those folks are now to fund their games is on Kickstarter.
4188000	4192000	Well, best of luck. I hope it doesn't suck like this Ultimo game on iPad did.
4193000	4212000	Yeah. Alright, so Call of Duty, you know, it's been coming out annually every November and so far they've had a few studios kind of juggling development on it with both Infinity Ward and Treyarch kind of putting out the games each year, although it's not necessarily just them.
4212000	4227000	They have other studios working on different aspects including multiplayer and DLC and stuff. And one of those companies is actually Sledgehammer Games, which is now going to be taking up the main development of one of these games each three years now.
4227000	4236000	They're going to have a three-year development cycle instead of, you know, Infinity Ward and Treyarch, it's now going to be Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games and so on and so forth.
4237000	4249000	Hopefully they'll make them better because they've been kind of, I don't know, they definitely went down this year, I think, with Ghost. A lot of people were disappointed. Black Ops 2 was pretty great.
4250000	4253000	To see that they were losing steam, right?
4253000	4263000	Well, it's just that the Ghost didn't have a really good hook to it. It was just kind of like, okay, something happened and now it's post-apocalyptic, yay!
4264000	4272000	So I think just putting a little bit more effort into it is going to help in the extra development time. Hopefully it'll polish up the game a bit.
4272000	4286000	It'll be interesting to see what they do because each kind of studio brings a little different type of gameplay into it. You have a lot of the zombie stuff with Treyarch and they did some different things with multiplayer and things.
4286000	4298000	I don't know, it'll be interesting. I mean, I think that they need to do something to kind of freshen up the series because, especially, you know, going out, they were like the number one franchise each year and now they're not.
4299000	4306000	And, you know, people are starting to realize it's getting stale. So it'll be interesting to see how next year turns out.
4307000	4314000	I'm going to say something crazy right now. I have never, ever played a Call of Duty game.
4314000	4315000	Me either.
4316000	4317000	Maybe not too crazy, but...
4318000	4329000	Well, there's a lot of people out there who have never, ever played Dead Rising or Pagle 2 or the things you talk about. I mean, there's just, you know, there's people that don't watch certain movies. There's people that don't read certain books or watch certain TV stations.
4330000	4336000	It just seems strange to me because there are so many of them and I have literally missed every single one of them.
4337000	4350000	So, there's so many things about the series that I don't know. And some of the things I'm curious about is how coherent, how, like, as a whole product are the games in a particular series?
4351000	4358000	In the original, you know, like, unsubtitled Call of Duty, in the Ghost series, in the Modern Warfare series.
4359000	4367000	I know Modern Warfare has followed a storyline, but do the other series actually follow a coherent storyline from type to type?
4368000	4380000	They do. At least I can speak for Modern Warfare, Black Ops, well, Ghost, I don't know because there's only one game in that franchise, but I know those two have had a storyline that's kind of progressed through the whole thing.
4381000	4385000	And what's, though, the inter-story relationship between the different types?
4385000	4396000	Well, as far as the campaign goes, it's literally just the events and the story tie into each other. Like, there's literally a narrative from one game to the next.
4397000	4408000	Although, you know, with, like, Black Ops 2, it's more of, like, flashbacks and stuff, but there is an actual narrative to it. And Modern Warfare, actually, it was just straight through, like, it was a progressive storyline through the whole series.
4409000	4429000	It is shocking to me that they could do this coherently enough with three overlapping studios with their own direction, but also, like, you guys know the thing about how Pixar always refers to an old series and a new series in a current movie.
4429000	4448000	It, that's proof that it can be done, but it's literally, like, the equivalent of name-dropping. You do it once and it's over. For anybody to be, for any studio to be able to do this coherently across multiple years, across multiple franchises, across multiple games, while overlapping things are happening, that's stunning.
4449000	4454000	It sounds incredibly interesting, and I should play a game or two because I'm interested in them, but...
4455000	4475000	I'm not sure on, like, Call of Duty 1, 2, and 3, if those were a World of War even, I guess, might tie into all that stuff. I don't know if those had actually, you know, a coherent storyline between them, but 2 and 3 were good. I don't know if it necessarily has a tie into each other, but they're fun.
4476000	4479000	Let me ask this ignorant question, too, since I don't really follow the series either.
4480000	4482000	Since we're all airing out our lack of Call of Duty experience on the show.
4482000	4494000	Well, here's the thing, is that I understand, you know, they have to do this because the games haven't been selling as well or whatever, and I hear that there's been a lot of competition with the Battlefield series, but my understanding is that Battlefield 4 was kind of ass.
4495000	4503000	Or at least the, I mean, that's just my understanding. I could be completely off base, but all I see is bitching about how the online is just broken to hell and EA fucked it again and all this stuff.
4504000	4510000	Did you wind up following DICE? Because that'll, that'll, uh, that'll tilt your mental image of Battlefield 4 quite a bit.
4510000	4524000	Well, they're also a little bit different. I mean, like I'd say comparing Battlefield and, you know, Call of Duty is kind of like comparing, you know, Forza, or Gran Turismo and Forza Horizon.
4525000	4530000	I mean, definitely Call of Duty is a lot less realistic and more all about just like kind of scripted action events and stuff like that.
4531000	4539000	And Battlefield even kind of went that route, but they're also trying to be a little bit more realistic, although you watch any of the gameplay and multiplayer and you're just like, what?
4540000	4550000	You just bail out of an aircraft in air and just kill the other guy with a rocket launcher and then take over the plane that was pursuing you. Yeah, that's not exactly realistic in my book.
4551000	4559000	You know, I don't play a lot of first person shooters, but WhatUpG's comment here in the chat room makes me think of this. WhatUpG says, I am looking forward to Titanfall and I kind of go, me too.
4560000	4563000	Actually, I really want to play Titanfall and I really want to play Destiny. And those are usually...
4564000	4569000	Well, Titanfall is pretty much just like Call of Duty, but with Max. I mean, it's literally...
4570000	4571000	The gameplay is pretty much... Yeah.
4572000	4573000	I like Max. I'm on board.
4574000	4579000	Sign me up. I wasn't interested in your series until you put Max in it. Now I'm here. Yes. Sign me up, please.
4580000	4582000	I hate it. Remember, they tried that with Battlefield and that didn't turn out too well.
4583000	4584000	Battlefield 2142.
4585000	4589000	Let's not talk about that. All right, let's keep it moving. We got more stories to get to here.
4590000	4602000	Over this week, there was a bit of an interesting kerfuffle because Ubisoft made a request to the government, to the US Patent Office, Patent and Trademark Office, to drop the trademark on Watch Dogs.
4603000	4611000	The message was sent to the USPTO and signed by Yves Guillemont. I probably butchered that because my French, lol.
4612000	4622000	But it was a request for express abandonment that was filed with application serial number 85642398, better known as Watch Dogs, the trademark.
4623000	4638000	And what I didn't realize was that it actually was passed. Ubisoft lost. They lost by nature of the fact that the trademark for Watch Dogs was ended, was released, was deleted, removed. Pick your word.
4638000	4651000	This was a fraudulent request. I don't know enough about the application process to know if it was a mere spoofed email address, which is really trivially easy to do.
4652000	4657000	That's why you get emails from CustomerCare at PayPal.com when it ain't.
4657000	4666000	Anyways, there was a period of time that Ubisoft still to this moment, Watch Dogs, the Watch Dogs trademark is not active.
4667000	4677000	They responded saying that this was a fraudulent request. They will be reapplying for it. They will invariably get it because this is one of those special circumstances that is absolutely ridiculous.
4678000	4688000	There was various wank about whether they did it wrong and they have to redo it because the logo style for the release cover art has an underscore between the words.
4689000	4698000	And part of the trademark application is in addition to the terms, you also come up with a mark, a visual representation, and that hadn't been included in the original trademark.
4699000	4708000	But this, I don't know that I can come up with any other example where somebody, you know, usually we hear about patent and trademark challenges and this kind of stuff.
4709000	4718000	But this was that somebody deliberately falsified documents and sent a, you know, certified request to the government to drop somebody's legal property.
4719000	4727000	That's kind of unprecedented. And I'm not sure what to make of this. But Ubisoft will be working with the Patent and Trademark Office to get it back.
4728000	4735000	Any thoughts on this, guys? Anybody?
4736000	4748000	I don't even know what else to say. I mean, obviously, I don't want to just repeat what Bobby Blackwolf said. That said, for anybody who's listening to this and hasn't listened to Bobby Blackwolf, please check out vognetwork.com and listen to Bobby's show where he goes into a little bit more detail about this.
4749000	4757000	Various theories and other things, not to mention the hilarious tie-in for real life imitating art once again.
4758000	4781000	I, we'll see how this story develops. And that's really all I can say because I just don't, it happened. Everybody was shocked because this is also on the heels of the news two to three weeks ago about the Wii U port being canceled, which apparently they still didn't comment on this time, even with this trademark kerfuffle patent.
4782000	4783000	Yeah, trademark kerfuffle.
4784000	4785000	Do you think it could be angry Nintendo fans?
4786000	4787000	Oh, God. That would be...
4788000	4792000	There are some Nintendo fans that are not to be messed with out there. I'll tell you.
4793000	4816000	Anybody that wants to stand up for a cause, which I think might also be the story of Watch Dogs. Anyways, this is shocking. This is incredibly interesting. And I just, if this is a PR stunt, I don't get it. I get it, but I don't understand it. I understand it, but I don't. Words are really hard to pick correctly to describe what this may actually result in.
4816000	4821000	It's an unfathomable action that's logically understood, but not emotionally, perhaps?
4822000	4823000	Yeah. That's a, that's a good way of putting it.
4824000	4839000	My honest opinion on all this is that this is a whole lot of to do about nothing because I mean, and I get why people are talking about it, but it's one of those, we all know the trademark laws in this country are all screwed up anyway. So why is this such a big deal that this is such a fricking hassle, like surprise.
4840000	4844000	Because it's everybody saying, look, look, see, this is what we're talking about. This is what we mean. Everything's broken.
4844000	4864000	People have been faking shit for many, many, many years. It's, it, it will be interesting to see if something else happens as a part of this. I can't imagine it did. I think somebody just straight up fucked with Ubisoft because the news has, people have been pissed at Ubisoft for a lot of things for, you know, at least a year and a half now.
4865000	4876000	Wii U not withstanding the Rayman situation, not withstanding, um, somebody, somebody tried to hassle them and completed to whatever extent it's actually going to make a lasting impact.
4878000	4882000	All right. Uh, let's move on dark soccer and then we'll get to release dates.
4883000	4896000	Well, just in response to that, fuckery is afoot. That's it. It's all fuckery. But how about something that isn't quite fuckery? There is a game, a classic game, if you will, called Myst.
4898000	4899000	Who remembers playing Myst?
4900000	4904000	Me. I remember being pissed off at it and I have a parody of it called P.I.S.T.
4905000	4906000	I remember the parody too.
4906000	4919000	Yep. Well, anyway, um, it was remade in 1990, actually in 2000, the original was in 1993, sorry. In 2000, it was remade as Real Myst, which was a 3D restoration that you could walk around however you want to.
4919000	4938000	It was, you know, fully explorable and, um, it got cleaned up for an iOS release and, uh, now the developer, uh, Cyan, um, actually is going to be doing the Real Myst Masterpiece Edition, uh, on PC and Mac via Steam.
4938000	4960000	It's, uh, well, for UK it's, uh, $12.99 and US it's $17.99, um, and if you already own Real Myst, uh, if you already own Real Myst, you get a, uh, discount of 33% and, um, it's going to basically enhance all the models, the textures, the lighting, everything.
4960000	4964000	So it's really just a beautiful cleanup of the original.
4965000	4972000	That's a nice way to kind of modernize it for, you know, people that are the age we were when this game first came out.
4972000	4975000	Do we know Cyan is still responsible for this, aren't they?
4975000	4976000	Yeah.
4976000	4983000	They're taking on for, you know, a release every couple of years, like they were doing post Myst, post Riven, post everything else.
4983000	4993000	Uh, it's really interesting that Cyan is taking on as much of this as they are, uh, not to mention their Kickstarter for, uh, Abduction, not Abduction, but Abduction.
4993000	4998000	They're, they're really ramping up to do a lot of amazing things over the next couple of years.
4998000	5010000	Well, there's a little note here about the original creators. Robin Miller, um, is now a filmmaker, and, um, Augustus Gladstone is, uh, let's see.
5010000	5020000	Uh, the Immortal Augustus Gladstone is the movie, I'm sorry, that was just made by Robin Miller, and, uh, Cyan is being run by Rand Miller, who was the other co-creator.
5020000	5022000	And brother.
5022000	5023000	Yes.
5023000	5031000	CEO and co-founder of Cyan Worlds, originally near Lucianne, he and brother Robin Miller became famous due to Myst, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
5031000	5032000	And they did stuff.
5032000	5033000	Yeah.
5033000	5034000	And stuff happened. The end.
5034000	5038000	Rageinator in chat says, so Dark Sakura played Myst but got pissed?
5038000	5044000	I, I didn't really get into it the first time I played it. I've played it since, you know, but...
5044000	5047000	I played Myst online for a little bit. That game was kind of creepy.
5047000	5049000	I just got irritated, that's all.
5049000	5050000	Yeah.
5050000	5053000	You know, and then I, and then I discovered Phantasmagoria.
5053000	5054000	Oh yeah.
5054000	5055000	Which has been a classic game.
5055000	5056000	That game was rad.
5056000	5058000	That game was creepy as fuck.
5058000	5068000	Alright. Well, uh, we'll, uh, step away from classic PC games for a minute and talk about what is coming out soon. Maybe classics for a future generation, we'll see.
5068000	5070000	Uh, Loki, what's coming out in the US this week?
5070000	5078000	Uh, well this week I'm sure you're anticipating Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5078000	5082000	I'm not now because I'm too busy with this fucking Bravely default.
5083000	5084000	It'll have to wait.
5085000	5087000	But all the costumes, Rob. All the costumes.
5087000	5091000	I know, I know. We got another one coming up later in the show. I'm sure some of you heard about.
5092000	5100000	Uh, the Far Cry compilation on PlayStation 3 with, uh, Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3, and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.
5100000	5106000	And they just announced, of course, that, you know, the HD Far Cry is supposed to be coming out at some point.
5106000	5112000	Which, in the European version, they get that for free. So I was like, well, thanks a lot, US.
5112000	5119000	Um, let's see, uh, Tokidin, The Age of Demons for Vita is gonna be coming out.
5119000	5123000	It's supposed to be, like, I think the number one Vita game right now in Japan.
5123000	5128000	Uh, Danganronpa, Trigger Happy Havoc on the Vita.
5129000	5135000	And, uh, also a re-release of The Witcher 2, Assassin of the Kings, the silver edition.
5135000	5137000	That's on 360.
5137000	5141000	Um, Civ 5, the complete edition on PC.
5141000	5144000	And that's it.
5145000	5148000	Alright, well, traveling to Japan, uh, looking at the releases there this week.
5148000	5150000	Things are pretty quiet on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5150000	5154000	That's probably because of the impending release of the PlayStation 4 on the 22nd.
5154000	5158000	Uh, but as far as this week goes, there are some things to look forward to on other systems.
5158000	5163000	Um, such as the PlayStation Vita has Phantom Breaker Battlegrounds in a limited edition.
5163000	5165000	That is out this week.
5165000	5169000	Um, then you go to the Wii U actually has a release this week and it's kind of a big one.
5169000	5173000	Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze gets its release in Japan this week.
5173000	5175000	So look out for that.
5175000	5179000	Uh, on the 3DS this week, you get, uh, Magi.
5179000	5183000	Um, Aratanaru Sekai comes out this week from Bandai Namco.
5183000	5185000	That is invariably Magi.
5185000	5191000	As well as, uh, a Resha de Iku 3D comes out this week.
5191000	5193000	I was looking to see what this Magi game is.
5193000	5196000	If it's a, uh, anime game or what.
5196000	5197000	It looks like, um,
5197000	5198000	It's an RPG.
5198000	5202000	Yeah, it looks a little RPG as maybe with some action elements because I see, like, six hits and stuff.
5202000	5204000	So, probably another action RPG.
5204000	5210000	Um, let me quickly look at the PSP because they still get releases once in a while.
5210000	5219000	Yes, um, Akaya Akashia Ayakashino comes out in regular and limited editions on the PSP this week.
5219000	5222000	I don't know if, is that a movie release?
5222000	5224000	No? Just a very cartoony looking game.
5224000	5226000	Catboys or Foxboys?
5226000	5227000	Mm-hmm.
5227000	5228000	There you go.
5228000	5230000	That's pretty much it for Japanese releases.
5230000	5233000	PlayStation 4 is very soon so it's slowing down a little bit before that's out.
5234000	5235000	Everyone's pissing themselves.
5235000	5236000	22nd?
5236000	5237000	Well, of course, not Nintendo though.
5237000	5239000	Things are, you know, with Donkey Kong is a pretty big deal, so.
5239000	5241000	Well, how about, how about the UK?
5241000	5242000	How about it?
5242000	5249000	On the 12th of February, there's Far Cry Classic for PC and PS3 and World of Tanks, Xbox 360.
5249000	5262000	And then on the 14th, we have Inazuma 11.3, Team Ogre Attacks, Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII, Loco Cycle for PC, and Tolkien, Age of Demons for Vita.
5263000	5265000	That's it.
5265000	5266000	Alright.
5266000	5268000	Just a few more stories for you guys.
5268000	5269000	And nothing happened there.
5269000	5273000	Just a few more new stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5273000	5274000	But first, Loki.
5274000	5280000	Alright, so real quick, Ubisoft, they're doing something kind of unique.
5280000	5282000	They have this brand new game that's coming out.
5282000	5284000	Oh, sorry again.
5284000	5285000	Uh-oh.
5285000	5286000	Hi, baby.
5286000	5288000	Sorry.
5288000	5291000	This is, this is why Loki's still at home, guys.
5291000	5294000	And now the debut of baby number two.
5294000	5297000	Okay, what I'm gonna do while Loki takes care of that, I'm gonna go ahead.
5297000	5298000	No, no, I'm good, I'm good.
5298000	5299000	Oh, good, okay.
5299000	5301000	We, uh, we plugged them up.
5301000	5305000	Alright, anyways, um, I'm sorry, Nellie plugged them up.
5305000	5318000	Uh, anyways, so, um, there's some devs, I guess, they have this game called, uh, Reroll, which is, um, this, I'm not sure if it's actually gonna be like middleware.
5318000	5326000	It's supposed to be in their game, they're using this thing called reality sync, which is basically they're scanning the landscape of Earth.
5326000	5339000	Um, and they're gonna take that, um, using, I guess, um, these, like, drones, um, to basically create really accurate maps of the world and landscape and stuff.
5339000	5346000	And then they're actually gonna put it into their game and sync it with, you know, real time environmental data and that kind of stuff.
5346000	5351000	So, sounds really cool, and the game itself, I have no clue what it is.
5351000	5360000	But, I mean, that kind of, uh, you know, data that they have in there and, you know, the environments that they kind of were showing off some of the 3D models and stuff were actually pretty cool.
5360000	5362000	Okay, it's supposed to be a survival action RPG.
5362000	5369000	So basically, like every single other, um, roguelike type game, it sounds like.
5369000	5371000	Hmm.
5371000	5376000	But basically letting you play in the entire world, almost.
5376000	5383000	I'm trying to think if we've seen these types of games before. I feel like we have. Like, the things that try to kind of mix in the reality and so forth.
5383000	5386000	Maybe not something on the scale that Loki's talking about, but...
5386000	5392000	I don't think it's ever able to be particularly as up to date as they're trying to do with this.
5392000	5396000	Um, this blurb, uh, where was it?
5396000	5404000	If it's snowing in Chicago, Reroll's virtual rendition of the Windy City will likewise be blanketed in fluffy white flakes.
5404000	5410000	Um, certainly nothing. It's one of two things. If we've ever seen this in the past, it's one of two things.
5410000	5416000	One, it's never been up to date and it's never actually taking advantage of true conditions in a region of the world.
5416000	5421000	Yeah, they can get the weather report, oh, it's snowing right now, and add snow and maybe a thin layer.
5421000	5427000	It's either not truly as live, as close to live as this will be, or it won't be a game.
5427000	5434000	It'll just be, hey, look at these characters dancing in a particular area that you can point your phone at and use the camera.
5434000	5446000	Um, this sounds interesting. I wonder why it can't scale because it costs a hell of a lot of money to get those drones in the air and get the data off of them like this.
5446000	5450000	And so they will have to fall back to generated conditions based off weather reports.
5450000	5455000	Um, give it a look as more information becomes available.
5455000	5462000	Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. There's really no comments on this article that Loki's talking about, but they are talking about the baby.
5462000	5466000	Act F says, plugging the baby, there's your next mobile game hit.
5466000	5471000	And Seattle wants to know, does the baby use standard USB or micro?
5471000	5474000	I said Thunderbolt. It's faster.
5474000	5480000	I was down in Cupertino for a work event at Apple, of course.
5480000	5487000	And we went to the Apple company store and all of the adult shirts were normal.
5487000	5490000	Just Apple logo in the middle.
5490000	5497000	But all of like the onesies and whatnot had cute little words that had cute little sentences inscriptions on them.
5497000	5508000	And the one that I remember, if I remember the wording correctly was, um, I'm, I'm like, I'm, I'm a Mac mini or I'm Mac compatible and a bunch of silly little stuff like that.
5508000	5512000	So the fact that they're making these jokes just kind of amuses me because I literally saw it a week ago.
5512000	5520000	According to Loki's Twitter, he is on the hunt for the next big mobile hit because if the flappy bird guy can do it, Loki can do it, right?
5520000	5526000	Yeah, I should be able to. I mean, literally it looks like it takes 10 minutes to kind of make something like that.
5526000	5532000	I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit more complicated, but it's not that hard.
5532000	5540000	And I mean, even if you give fraction of that, like a 10th of what the guy's making, anything's better than nothing.
5540000	5547000	All right, Loki. Well, we look forward to seeing what zany game you come up with. You have a whole OLR dream game list to start with. All right.
5547000	5551000	That's too big. That's too big concept. We need to think stupider.
5551000	5555000	All right. Well, plugging the baby. There's a free one for Mac Devs. All right.
5555000	5560000	Just don't do shake the baby because Apple bans that stuff because it gets banned.
5560000	5566000	All right. Going to our next story here is a story about Nintendo.
5566000	5574000	And it's some more comments from Iwata who's been doing a lot of talking lately since a lot of people are questioning if Nintendo is going to be profitable in the future.
5574000	5586000	But anyway, some interesting comments from Satoru Iwata this week saying that the next already talk about the next cycle of what the next console and the next DS are going to look like.
5586000	5595000	Quote, Last year, Nintendo reorganizes R&D divisions and integrated the handheld device and home console development teams into one division under Mr. Takeda.
5595000	5602000	Also, as technological advances took place at such a dramatic rate and we were forced to choose the best technologies for video games under cost restriction,
5602000	5607000	each time we developed a new platform, we always ended up developing a system that was completely different from its predecessor.
5607000	5610000	The only exception was when we went from the GameCube to the Wii.
5610000	5618000	In this perspective, while we're only going to be able to start this with the next system, it will become important for us to accurately take advantage of what we have done with the Wii U architecture.
5618000	5626000	It, of course, does not mean we are going to use exactly the same architecture as the Wii U, but we're going to create a system that can absorb the Wii U architecture adequately.
5626000	5634000	When this happens, home consoles and handheld devices will no longer be completely different and they will become like brothers in a family of systems.
5634000	5643000	Now, why this quote is gaining some traction this week is think back to last week when we had that crazy rumor about that whole fusion thing, which talked about something.
5643000	5654000	So these these I mean, granted, you can read a person's comments 10 different ways, and especially if you are trying to look to make it fit in the puzzle a certain way, you can do it.
5654000	5662000	But it's just an interesting statement in light of the fusion idea that came up as a rumor last week or the week before.
5662000	5670000	I don't find this particularly surprising at all, and the one and only reason for that is the Wii U gamepad.
5671000	5684000	It's finally, I say finally despite its limited nature, but it is a portable device for use with a fair amount of functions of the Wii U anywhere in your house.
5684000	5691000	It's limited to that. You can't, you can't take the gamepad away from the console, what, 300 feet and still be able to do it.
5691000	5694000	I actually don't know what the range is of that thing.
5694000	5705000	But the fact that they're doing this middle ground where you have something that you can pick up and walk away from your TV with and that they'll take that and their portable knowledge and their console knowledge.
5705000	5707000	This isn't that much of a surprise.
5707000	5712000	Well, and it's also worth noting that the technology in the pocket is getting closer and closer to what's available on the TV.
5712000	5717000	Like I when I played Bravely Default, I was like, oh, wow, there's like full voice acting in this game.
5717000	5720000	I didn't realize they crammed all that on carts now.
5720000	5725000	Are you kidding me? These, these things that, these things that line the table are even better than the 3DS already.
5725000	5726000	That's been the case for like four years.
5726000	5731000	Well, no, no, and no, it was really, it was really one of those things where I was like, oh, yeah, duh, of course technology is there.
5731000	5732000	They can fit gigabytes in those cartridges.
5732000	5734000	And if you think about it, Rob, that really isn't the first game that did that.
5734000	5740000	But I just, it's been so long since I've really sat down with a 3DS game and most of the Nintendo games don't use voice acting.
5740000	5741000	Yeah, yeah.
5741000	5746000	So when I kind of was hearing all that, I was like, oh, wow, yeah, they can fit all that in the cartridge now.
5746000	5747000	Yeah, absolutely.
5747000	5749000	So it's just interesting.
5749000	5762000	The fact that I can have 128 gigs in something that amounts to the size of my fingernail, that's, you know, that's even more capacity than a Blu-ray disc, a double layer for crying out loud.
5762000	5773000	Now, one other comment from Iwata this week that also is, you know, getting some notice is because it has to do with third parties, which is Nintendo's weak area right now, especially in the US.
5773000	5776000	But, you know, Iwata had something to say about it.
5776000	5792000	And it goes like this, quote, finally, in terms of third party support, while many point out that Nintendo has traditionally been weak in terms of acquiring it, if you consider the Japanese market, it's fair to say that the number one dedicated video game system that Japanese third party publishers are focusing on is Nintendo 3DS.
5793000	5803000	So he sidesteps the Wii U and says, but we do have third party people with DS and talks about, you know, the 3DS has sold 10 million and so on.
5803000	5805000	Okay, so no real surprise there.
5805000	5808000	The 3DS has the support, but he continues.
5808000	5812000	As for Wii U, opinions significantly differ among third party publishers.
5812000	5822000	Software publishers that develop content that has great affinity with audiences that Nintendo has historically been strong with, namely children and families, are still very active supporters of Wii U.
5822000	5825000	I'm assuming that's a Sega compliment, but anyway.
5825000	5832000	And their enthusiasm for Wii U can also be seen from the fact that they have even reached out to us to help people upgrade from Wii to Wii U.
5832000	5840000	On the other hand, software publishers are not necessarily keen on making games and genres that have weaker affinity with audiences that Nintendo has not been as strong with.
5840000	5843000	Where making a huge investment does not guarantee a sufficient return.
5843000	5850000	With regard to Wii U, we first need to create a strong foundation in areas Nintendo excels at and achieve a sufficient sales volume.
5850000	5859000	If we manage to do so, those publishers in the overseas market who are currently not interested in Wii U will be attracted to the Wii U platform as they were to Nintendo 3DS.
5859000	5861000	This is going to be our approach in the near future.
5861000	5863000	There's those words again.
5864000	5875000	Software publishers that develop content that has great affinity with audiences that Nintendo has historically been strong with, namely children and families.
5875000	5879000	Right. And the big budget shooter games don't do as well in Nintendo.
5879000	5885000	And that's the other half of the statement there is that they don't want to spend all the money to develop for our platform because we don't have those people.
5885000	5890000	It's literally every argument that we make ever summed up by Iwata himself.
5890000	5895000	It's refreshing at the same time to actually see this.
5895000	5900000	You made the argument about Nintendo's online communities need to be stronger.
5900000	5903000	Yes, I agree, but it's never going to happen because children and family.
5903000	5910000	I was going to say the only reason that they don't have those people on the platform is because they don't have those types of games.
5910000	5918000	So you can't expect someone that's a fan of first person shooters that's going to buy a platform that doesn't have the type of games that they're looking for.
5918000	5923000	I would love to see Nintendo do something absolutely batshit crazy and make that game.
5924000	5930000	And thus begins Nintendo's chicken and the egg again. Somebody needs to take the first step and it's a huge investment.
5930000	5941000	It's a huge risk, but imagine if Nintendo put out Mario Killers on the Wii U, which is a first person shooter starring Mario and Luigi.
5941000	5946000	I can see more of Mario Paintball or something like that, but do it Call of Duty style.
5946000	5956000	No, that's not the game we need. Mario Paintball is too family friendly. I need blood, guts, gore, and all that stuff.
5956000	5964000	Obviously I'm being a little silly. Nintendo's not going to make that game. Loki's absolutely right. If they make that game, it's going to be Mario Paintball.
5964000	5969000	Pikachu fainted.
5970000	5980000	Exactly. Alright, anyhow, let's go back to a much simpler time. We could talk this topic to death, but let's go back to a much simpler time.
5980000	5984000	What do you mean? It's not like we've done that four times in the last month.
5984000	5989000	I don't want to talk Nintendo anymore. Is that so wrong? There's so much else going on in News this Week.
5989000	5993000	Alright, let's travel back to a different time. Let's talk about classics for a minute.
5994000	6003000	Perhaps Nintendo Classic. Perhaps not. Either way, Dark Soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you know, maybe you should consider playing this game.
6003000	6009000	I already told you what it was. You did? I did. By the way, just real quick before you do this, Seattle does have a good point.
6009000	6016000	Metroid first person shooter. There was that. And many people say those were like the best GameCube games too.
6016000	6021000	And F-Zero as well. Alright, I promise no more Nintendo. I'm sorry, Dark Soccer.
6021000	6030000	So the game is Myst, which is a graphic adventure puzzle video game that came out by Cyan, as I said in my last story that I read.
6030000	6034000	Deja vu. I feel like we've talked about this game already at some point.
6034000	6036000	You know what, Rob? What?
6036000	6048000	It was originally released for Mac OS on September 24th, 1993, and has been ported and reported and ported some more and remade.
6048000	6061000	We've had releases on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation 3DO, Windows, Atari Jaguar CD, CDi, Amiga, OS, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, iOS, and Nintendo 3DS.
6061000	6066000	So you play as The Stranger, who uses a book to travel to the island of Myst.
6066000	6074000	And then you find other books, and you basically just follow the clues and beat the game.
6074000	6081000	It was really kind of a weird game, and it's actually really neat of a game. Yes.
6081000	6094000	So basically, it is a first-person wander, and although you click a location on the screen, and it drags you there, or it pulls you around, or certain things happen on the screen.
6094000	6100000	And then it had a zip feature. Do you remember the zip?
6100000	6109000	What it's saying is that it's an option. Basically, when a lightning bolt cursor appears, you can click and skip frames to another location.
6109000	6114000	So it lets you travel quickly, but you miss important items and clues.
6114000	6122000	Basically, imagine playing Mass Effect 3 in story mode, where you skip all the fighting scenes and you miss stuff.
6122000	6125000	Which is also something I can't do.
6125000	6127000	Okay.
6127000	6128000	Continue.
6128000	6130000	Okay.
6130000	6140000	So you have to basically search the island, find the linking books to the ages, and each of them are their own little mini-worlds.
6140000	6148000	They're named Solenitic, Stoneship, Mechanical, and Channelwood.
6148000	6153000	And you basically have to work on these little puzzles through each one, and solve the game.
6153000	6160000	So it started development in 1991, and as I said, it came out on Mac OS.
6160000	6164000	So people who say there aren't games on Mac, shut up. It came out on this first.
6164000	6175000	And basically, their whole point is that they wanted to have a very detailed environment, but with a basic terrain itself.
6175000	6181000	The textures were painted onto color maps, and so it was the point that they were using the textures to add the depth.
6181000	6189000	Of course, now, actually, when it originally came out, it was on the Mac Quadras. Who remembers those?
6189000	6196000	They were modeled and rendered in Stratovision 3D, and also used Macromodel.
6196000	6199000	And editing was done in Photoshop 1.
6199000	6201000	Ooh.
6201000	6203000	Wow.
6203000	6205000	Photoshop 1.0.
6205000	6212000	The original version was constructed in HyperCard. Each age was a HyperCard stack.
6212000	6222000	So the game itself really, I think, took advantage of the technology at the time, and really, I think, pushed the envelope for something that came out in 1993.
6222000	6227000	That was when anyone who was running Windows was still running 3.1 on a 486.
6227000	6232000	So that gives you an idea of what the tech of the day was like.
6233000	6238000	And of course, it has lots of really gorgeous music.
6238000	6246000	It had really ambient sounds in the background. It just was...
6246000	6251000	And they were also improvising a lot of the sounds so that it would sound more like what you expected it to.
6251000	6254000	For example, I like this example here.
6254000	6263000	The noise of fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning.
6263000	6271000	The Chime Clock Tower were used, were simulated using a wrench and lowered in pitch.
6271000	6275000	Which to me basically is what they do in movies anyway. So I think it was hilarious.
6276000	6291000	The soundtrack was available over mail-in and then Virgin Records got the rights to release the soundtrack which was released on April 21st, 1998 after Riven was out.
6291000	6302000	It was basically just a really, really great game. It was very popular, which was, as far as I understand, a really surprise popularity.
6302000	6307000	So it did have sequels. It had Riven. They came out on October 29th, 1997.
6307000	6317000	And then Myst III Exile came out on Mac and PC on May 7th, 2001 and was later ported to the PS2 and Xbox.
6317000	6323000	Exile, however, was not done by Cyan. It was done by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft.
6323000	6331000	So the fourth one was Myst IV Revelation. It came out September 10th, 2004 and was entirely done by Ubisoft.
6331000	6335000	With music done by Jack Wall and Peter Gabriel.
6335000	6341000	And then we had Myst V End of Ages that was done by Cyan Worlds and it came out on September 19th, 2005.
6341000	6347000	There were also other games that Cyan developed. There was Uru Ages Beyond Myst that came out in 2003.
6347000	6351000	And you could customize your avatar and render the graphics in real time.
6351000	6354000	However, the multiplayer component was cancelled.
6354000	6360000	But GameTap brought it back as Myst Online Uru Live on February 15th, 2007.
6360000	6366000	And it went through some changes and it actually was shut down after 60 days.
6366000	6369000	But it has been since brought back up and it's free to play.
6369000	6378000	We had the different novels. There was the book of Atrus Myst, the book of Tiana, the book of Denis.
6378000	6380000	So all kinds of stuff happened.
6380000	6387000	And it's also stated that Matt Damon wanted the Bourne Conspiracy video game to be like Myst.
6387000	6389000	Instead of a shooter.
6389000	6393000	So yeah, there were the remakes.
6393000	6401000	Now we had the Real Myst Masterpiece Edition that came out in 2000 that had the graphics actually rendered.
6401000	6411000	And then there was the Interactive 3D Edition that was the remake for PC and for Mac.
6411000	6415000	And then it was a free roaming real time 3D game.
6415000	6424000	And then now we've got the enhanced version that's going to be running on Unity Engine and has the graphics from the original Myst.
6424000	6427000	And that came out on Steam on February 5th.
6428000	6431000	We also have, like I said, different console remakes that I mentioned at the beginning of the show.
6431000	6433000	It's been on various handhelds.
6433000	6436000	So yeah, this game has a super crazy legacy.
6436000	6438000	And that's Myst.
6438000	6440000	And don't forget about the parody, P.I.S.T.
6443000	6445000	AkumaJP in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
6445000	6448000	This is the game that all guys my age wanted to play so badly.
6448000	6450000	Some even buy the Saturn just for this game.
6452000	6454000	There were better games to get the Saturn for.
6454000	6457000	But here in this area, everybody just kind of had it on PC or Mac.
6457000	6459000	So it was just interesting.
6459000	6461000	DungeonBuster says,
6461000	6463000	This is still during the golden age of adventure games.
6463000	6467000	LucasArts was still at the height of its powers back then along with Sierra and Legend.
6467000	6470000	So yeah, this is definitely some of the gaming.
6470000	6473000	That was a great sentence, but what a downer.
6473000	6477000	Well, I kind of truncated another thought he had there just for time.
6477000	6480000	Because it is about that time for us to take a break.
6480000	6482000	Here it is, your Classic Game of the Week.
6482000	6483000	Missed everybody.
6483000	6484000	But now it's break time.
6484000	6485000	We're going to take a quick break.
6485000	6487000	And we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6487000	6489000	Including your Fugu Question of the Week.
6489000	6491000	Some news on Batman Arkham Origins.
6491000	6493000	And some other games as well, Disney Infinity.
6493000	6496000	And your calls at 1877 Game O.L.R.
6496000	6498000	Or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
6498000	6501000	All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6508000	6511000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6511000	6513000	Live on this Sunday evening.
6513000	6518000	February the 9th of 2014 with episode number 539 of our show.
6518000	6521000	Jason's here with us in studio.
6521000	6526000	And sadly we're celebrating, though that doesn't seem like the right word to use.
6526000	6530000	His last night for now on the show.
6530000	6533000	Before he heads back over to Colorado and so forth.
6533000	6535000	But you're still going to be able to do the YouTubes and all that stuff, right?
6535000	6536000	Absolutely.
6536000	6538000	And hopefully more, well.
6539000	6541000	You alright over there?
6541000	6543000	Wrong pipe temporarily.
6543000	6545000	Happens. Live radio.
6545000	6555000	Hopefully minutely more timely just because since I've been out here my nights and everything else are just taken up.
6555000	6559000	Mostly by social events because I actually have co-workers in the vicinity out here.
6559000	6565000	And I say more timely but it's still going to be released on Saturday for reasons we've already covered previously.
6566000	6570000	But it would still be nice to have it done early in the week.
6570000	6573000	Schedule it for Saturday and then not be like,
6573000	6577000	Fuck it's 9 o'clock on Saturday night! I didn't finish this off! I didn't upload it! I need to get it out before Sunday!
6577000	6580000	Or at least before the show. I don't need to keep procrastinating.
6580000	6582000	So, you know.
6582000	6589000	And once I'm at home and I have my stuff, I have my setup, I have my, you know, I have the things that I'm used to.
6589000	6592000	I can get back into the groove and be able to just do that.
6592000	6595000	It's a great way to check out the show.
6595000	6598000	Especially, you know, like old, excuse me, now I'm getting hiccups.
6598000	6601000	Especially like older episodes and like things you might have missed.
6601000	6606000	Like I'm sure a lot of you missed the Super Bowl episode last week because you all were, you know, occupied with all that stuff.
6606000	6610000	So, you know, and you made a really hilarious intro and all this stuff.
6610000	6615000	So you kind of do, even though, yes, 98% of it is just the show over a static picture.
6615000	6617000	You do kind of do some fun little things with it.
6617000	6622000	Make it worth like, I would really envision like somebody wanting to go back and listen to older episodes.
6622000	6625000	Like listening on their TV or listening on their Vita.
6625000	6629000	You know, because YouTube is like super accessible to get the file.
6629000	6631000	You know, kind of like and be able to stream it.
6631000	6633000	So that's the nice thing about it.
6633000	6637000	It's really easy as opposed to like having to go download the podcast or having it up in your browser.
6637000	6641000	So, yeah, I would really recommend like just, you know, bring it up on your TV, check it out.
6641000	6645000	And I admire Jason's work, what he does do to the show.
6645000	6647000	I add all of the episodes to a playlist.
6647000	6649000	There's an episodes of Orange Lounge Radio playlist.
6649000	6655000	You can start from 528 and go forward with all ten of them so far.
6655000	6657000	Eleven after I finish the show off.
6657000	6664000	Chapter'd, you know, I have more things in store and things that I want to be able to do when I have more time.
6664000	6670000	More than just the, I don't know, I probably take, I probably take about five hours to do a show.
6670000	6675000	Because it's literally listening to the entire show for timing's sake.
6675000	6677000	And then also I do things like Skype line callers.
6677000	6679000	I grab an icon if available.
6679000	6682000	If we talk about, oh, that looks interesting.
6682000	6685000	Sorry podcast listeners, sorry live show listeners.
6685000	6691000	But, you know, with video I can show what we're talking about.
6691000	6695000	So when we were talking about Prism Drop, when you guys were talking about Prism Drop last week.
6695000	6699000	I threw up the iPad screenshots when Jamie was first looking at it.
6699000	6700000	Oh, right.
6700000	6702000	Well, this is a game picture, okay.
6702000	6705000	And then you said, oh god, the phone pictures.
6705000	6707000	So I take those and started throwing them on.
6707000	6708000	Okay, cool.
6708000	6711000	It's expressive and it's really, really interesting.
6711000	6714000	It takes, it's a solid chunk of time.
6714000	6716000	It might even be more than five hours.
6716000	6720000	It's at least three because I re-listen to the entirety of the show.
6720000	6724000	We really appreciate it and although I know there's not a huge audience on YouTube.
6724000	6727000	The nice thing about it, and this is what I told you would probably happen.
6727000	6730000	It's been kind of a slow burn because it's discoverability.
6730000	6735000	And we see that people are accessing the older episodes because they find it through, you know, other things and check out the show.
6735000	6737000	So it works out.
6737000	6738000	It's fun. I'm enjoying it.
6738000	6740000	And more and more I want to do.
6740000	6743000	It's teaching me things I've wanted to learn for a long time.
6743000	6747000	It's getting my mind running with things that I want to be able to do differently and do better.
6747000	6752000	I've gotten a lot of really good suggestions for things that I would love to be able to do regularly.
6753000	6754000	Here's hoping for the better.
6754000	6758000	And here's hoping for a better routine, better workflow, and all of the improvements that come with.
6758000	6759000	Alright, fair enough.
6759000	6764000	Alrighty, we are going to move on with some rapid fire news here.
6764000	6766000	Loki, hopefully Loki's back.
6766000	6767000	Yeah.
6767000	6770000	Hooray! And he can lead us through some rapid fire news.
6770000	6775000	Alright, so, you know, Humble Bundles had some pretty good deals lately.
6775000	6792000	And this, I guess, week or so, they've had the Sid Meier's Bundle, which includes everything from Civ III Complete, Civ IV Complete, Civ V if you pay enough money, and then Ace Patrol, Ace Patrol Pacific Skies, and Railroads.
6793000	6801000	And so I believe if you beat the average, you can get a Civ V and the Civ V Gods and Kings DLC.
6801000	6808000	And if you pay more than $15, you get everything plus the Civ V Brave New World DLC.
6808000	6810000	So it's a pretty good deal.
6810000	6816000	I haven't bought it yet because my backlog.
6816000	6821000	Yeah. You know what though? If you have any remote interest in Civ V at all, you really got to check out this pack.
6821000	6824000	I mean, y'all know I love Civilization.
6824000	6828000	Just get it for at least Civ IV, which is a really good entry into the series too.
6828000	6832000	Civ III, eh, not so much, but Civ IV and Civ V are great.
6832000	6835000	Civ III is probably the weakest out of the entire Civ series.
6835000	6837000	And then there's like other stuff too.
6837000	6844000	But the funny thing is, I was looking at the bundle and I'm like, wow, I own everything in this except for one game already.
6845000	6852000	But yet I still feel the need to support it because charity and good things and, you know, you want to support that.
6852000	6855000	So I think this is great.
6855000	6858000	I'm just worried of how much of a time sink Civ V is going to be.
6858000	6861000	Huge. Huge.
6861000	6866000	Just have it in your library for a very, very, very rainy day.
6866000	6869000	I have a lot of stuff for rainy days.
6869000	6872000	The average in the screenshot was about five and a half bucks.
6872000	6880000	And right now the average, which again gets you Civ V base and Civ V Gods and Kings DLC, is $9.14.
6880000	6883000	And it runs for the next week or so. It's eight days right now.
6883000	6888000	A lot of people are dropping the 15 to get that extra expansion, which, you know, is still worth it for all those games.
6888000	6890000	That expansion's not that old.
6890000	6896000	15 bucks with a good split for charity and developer, if you so desire, and that's a whole bunch of good stuff.
6896000	6899000	So in other words, you're going to get two rounds in.
6899000	6902000	Yeah, right. Just one more turn. One more turn.
6902000	6904000	Anyway.
6904000	6910000	And then this is kind of cool. This was actually a Kickstarter game that definitely passed.
6910000	6914000	And it was a game called 90s Arcade Racer.
6914000	6920000	And it's based off of, like, you know, Daytona and Super GT and all those games.
6920000	6922000	It's really bright and colorful.
6922000	6929000	And he says he has it running at 60 frames per second, 720p, for the Wii U.
6929000	6932000	And it's supposed to be out later this year.
6932000	6939000	Also coming out on Windows, Mac, Linux, and iOS and Android later this year as well.
6939000	6943000	And it's being published this time by Nintendo.
6943000	6945000	The guys do Cave Story.
6945000	6947000	Looks sweet.
6947000	6952000	I can't wait to see some actual gameplay, though, of it. Like, actual moving gameplay.
6952000	6959000	And then last but not least, Pinball Arcade are actually looking to develop some original tables for their pinball games,
6959000	6962000	as opposed to all the licensed pinball games.
6962000	6966000	And they're actually looking to develop some original tables for their pinball games,
6966000	6969000	as opposed to all the licensed pinball games.
6969000	6973000	Some original tables for their pinball games, as opposed to all the licensed stuff.
6973000	6977000	And they have a hell of a lot of licensed stuff, that's for sure.
6977000	6980000	It'll be interesting to see what kind of tables they have.
6980000	6985000	I'd be more interested to see them adapt some of the custom-made tables,
6985000	6990000	like the Bill Paxton table from Ben Hecker.
6990000	6993000	Actually, even his Ghostbusters one he did.
6993000	7001000	Or, not Ghostbusters, it's like some sort of ghost-haunting table or something. That'd be pretty cool.
7001000	7004000	I'm really bummed out they're having licensing issues with the Addams Family table,
7004000	7008000	because I know they were going after that, and they're running into some licensing issues.
7008000	7010000	It's just...
7010000	7015000	Because it was based on a movie, so there's a lot of actors whose pictures are in it.
7015000	7018000	Eh, someday.
7018000	7024000	I like Pinball Arcade, though. It's a fun little way to play some pinball games you remember from years ago,
7024000	7026000	when there's not a lot of tables around.
7026000	7029000	Of course, if you're Dark Soccer, you have your favorite tables already.
7029000	7036000	It would be fucking amazing to develop a digital pinball table that was also holographic.
7036000	7042000	I thought, at first, when I saw that the Attack from Mars table was in Pinball Arcade,
7042000	7045000	I was like, oh, it's that hologram table's in there.
7045000	7048000	No, it's the original Attack from Mars from way back when.
7048000	7049000	Oh, lame.
7049000	7050000	Yeah, lame.
7050000	7053000	All right, anyway, moving on to some other Nintendo news.
7053000	7060000	Nintendo UK has noted that Dr. Mario is one of the games that's headed to the Wii U Virtual Console at some point.
7060000	7064000	They don't say when exactly, but it's just slated for release.
7064000	7066000	What's interesting, though, is that even though it's coming out in Europe,
7066000	7069000	the product description says it's the US version of the game.
7069000	7073000	But I suppose in this day and age, a high definition, where we don't have the different TV specs anymore,
7073000	7076000	I don't think that's as big of an issue, but whatevs.
7076000	7082000	Dr. Mario, of course, this is an interesting choice because we just had Dr. Luigi not that long ago come out.
7082000	7085000	Maybe you forgot, but that was out at the end of last year.
7085000	7087000	I forgot to buy it.
7087000	7088000	I did.
7088000	7090000	That reminds me, maybe I should.
7090000	7095000	Something else you can do on the Wii U, which, by the way, you can also actually do on the Xbox One,
7095000	7099000	or you can do on the PlayStation 4, is you can play browser games, HTML5 games,
7099000	7107000	lots of them available thanks to a site called Playboxie, which, yeah, I guess this is helping them out with a little bit of a free ad.
7107000	7114000	But they do have some games you might remember, like Pac-Man and some newer games like Cut the Rope and Doodle Jump.
7114000	7119000	And they call it Chris Mines, but it's just frickin' Minesweeper.
7119000	7121000	So a lot of clones, a lot of cloney games in there.
7121000	7123000	And you all say Flappy Bird's a ripoff.
7123000	7126000	Look at that, Chris. That's just frickin' Minesweeper right there.
7127000	7130000	Anyway, you can check that out with Playboxie.com.
7130000	7136000	And, yeah, it works on all those systems thanks to HTML5.
7136000	7142000	I will also note that is Playboxie, P-L-A-Y-B-O-X-I-E.com.
7142000	7144000	Thank you. Yes, not the other type of box.
7144000	7146000	What is the other one, porn?
7146000	7152000	There's Boxie, that's double E, that was a Roku-like, it was a TV-attached box.
7152000	7153000	I own one of those.
7153000	7154000	Wow.
7154000	7158000	Yeah, Boxie with a Y, with a double E, there's a whole bunch of them.
7158000	7164000	Playboxie.com.
7164000	7167000	It's funny that we can only just now do that with console browsers.
7167000	7169000	I mean, the Xbox 360 didn't even have one.
7169000	7172000	The PS3's was terrible.
7172000	7176000	Nice to see that finally exists this time around.
7176000	7179000	And lastly but not leastly, earlier in the show,
7179000	7182000	it was brought up that I'm gonna be really excited about all the costume changes
7182000	7185000	in Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.
7185000	7188000	But I have to admit, my eyes did roll a little bit in the back of my head
7188000	7190000	where I could see my brain a little bit
7190000	7194000	when I saw the commercial for the Lara Croft costume
7194000	7197000	coming to Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.
7197000	7198000	Do you wanna see what this looks like, Dark Soccer?
7198000	7199000	Have you not seen this?
7199000	7202000	There's actually like a little preview video out there.
7202000	7203000	Well, here's the important question.
7203000	7204000	What?
7204000	7207000	Have I bothered?
7207000	7208000	Let me show you.
7208000	7209000	Because I didn't even finish the first one.
7209000	7211000	You took yours back, remember?
7211000	7213000	Oh, yeah, that's right.
7213000	7216000	Well, you just need to watch the little retrospective that's out there, too.
7216000	7218000	Okay, that's actually kinda cute.
7218000	7219000	Yeah, it's a little...
7219000	7221000	It doesn't fit the aesthetic of the game.
7221000	7222000	Yeah, it's a little weird,
7222000	7224000	like the way she's like carrying the pickaxe and everything.
7224000	7227000	Like, her shield even has Tomb Raider written on it,
7227000	7229000	which is kinda funny.
7229000	7231000	But...
7231000	7233000	And then, of course, you can be in that outfit
7233000	7234000	for all the different cut scenes.
7234000	7235000	So there you go.
7235000	7239000	I wanna see the DLC costume for Hitman,
7239000	7241000	where she's bald.
7241000	7245000	But can she swan dive off a cliffside?
7245000	7249000	It is interesting seeing that whole little synergy within Square Enix,
7249000	7251000	where they have all those different costumes,
7251000	7254000	but I was just like, okay, whatever.
7254000	7256000	I just literally had that ready, whatever.
7256000	7262000	Or since, you know, Square Enix also happens to publish Deep Silver titles,
7262000	7264000	we could have her holding a dildo bat.
7264000	7267000	Let's pray, let's pray.
7267000	7268000	Here's the thing.
7268000	7269000	Love Tomb Raider.
7269000	7272000	I'm excited about Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.
7272000	7273000	I wanna check it out.
7273000	7275000	I like the demo, but it's just kinda like the world's colliding.
7275000	7279000	I'm just like, no, they can be separate things that I enjoy.
7279000	7282000	Separately, separately, and not together for an extra cost.
7282000	7283000	I don't really need that.
7283000	7285000	I want the N7 armor.
7285000	7286000	That was in 13, too, yes.
7286000	7287000	I know.
7287000	7289000	I need to actually play that.
7289000	7290000	I need to play...
7290000	7291000	Finish the first one,
7291000	7294000	because someone took it back before I was done with it.
7294000	7296000	You make it sound like I...
7296000	7298000	Sorry, I took my game back.
7298000	7302000	I'm such an asshole for wanting my borrowed copy of something back
7302000	7304000	so I could play it.
7304000	7306000	I was just giving you a hard time.
7306000	7307000	Mm-hmm.
7307000	7308000	Mm-hmm.
7308000	7310000	Especially since I can buy it for three bucks now.
7310000	7311000	That's true.
7311000	7314000	They were all really cheap on PlayStation recently.
7314000	7317000	Anyway, what do you have for us, DarkStalker and RapidFireNews?
7317000	7319000	I have a few things.
7319000	7322000	Actually, this one's very happy news about Strider.
7322000	7325000	It's supposed to be on PS4 and PS3 on February 18th,
7325000	7327000	and you know we're getting that one.
7327000	7330000	But it's also coming out on Steam, and that makes me super happy.
7330000	7334000	And it came out courtesy of Double Helix.
7334000	7337000	And also, there's going to be two challenge modes
7337000	7339000	in addition to the main story.
7339000	7343000	There's Beacon Run that's the sort of hack and slash speed run,
7343000	7347000	and Survival that sends you harder and harder waves of enemies to beat.
7347000	7349000	And they both have leaderboards.
7349000	7351000	So super excited.
7351000	7352000	I love Strider.
7352000	7355000	And then, you know, my husband,
7355000	7358000	for people who have been on the internet for a long time,
7358000	7361000	used to run Neo Strider's Strider Zone.
7361000	7363000	Just saying.
7363000	7365000	That was my damn.
7365000	7371000	So now Assassin's Creed 4 has a Freedom Cry DLC
7371000	7374000	that's supposed to be standalone.
7374000	7377000	However, it is not on Xbox.
7377000	7379000	It's going to be released.
7379000	7381000	I mean, is your mic off? They're having a hard time.
7381000	7383000	No, my mic isn't off.
7383000	7384000	Phew.
7384000	7390000	So basically, Freedom Cry is going to be released as a standalone.
7390000	7398000	So you basically play as Edward Kenway's first mate, Adawale, I guess.
7398000	7401000	I don't know. I didn't play the game.
7401000	7404000	But it's supposed to come out on February 18th in North America
7404000	7408000	and February 19th in Europe and worldwide on the 25th for PC.
7408000	7412000	Those 18th releases, by the way, are for PS4 and PS3.
7412000	7415000	And Valve.
7415000	7417000	Oh, Valve.
7417000	7422000	There was a lawsuit going on with a law firm, Osborne Clark,
7422000	7427000	regarding a German court case for Valve not allowing Steam accounts
7427000	7433000	to be transferred or the ability to sell used games via Steam.
7433000	7435000	I refuse to use pre-owned. They're used.
7435000	7437000	Sorry.
7438000	7450000	The German Consumer Advocacy Group, VZBV, sued and then in 2012,
7450000	7456000	there was ruling from the European opinion
7456000	7461000	said that the doctrine of exhaustion was applied to digitally distributed computer software.
7461000	7467000	They tried again and basically they lost.
7467000	7470000	The German courts were like, dude, no.
7470000	7472000	So yeah, they were shut down.
7472000	7475000	So Valve wins. Yay, Valve.
7475000	7478000	Well, depending on where your thoughts are with the issue,
7478000	7480000	you may not necessarily be saying yay, Valve.
7480000	7483000	I like the idea of being able to have to use games digitally,
7483000	7488000	but it would encourage me to buy more games digitally.
7488000	7490000	I think we've had this discussion before.
7490000	7493000	Where's the incentive to go to digital distribution?
7493000	7495000	If the games are cheaper, then that's the incentive.
7495000	7499000	Hence why most of us are using Steam are those insane sales.
7499000	7501000	That's why most of us use Steam, not everybody.
7501000	7503000	But that's why a lot of people kind of get sucked into it
7503000	7507000	is because they're giving away a game for free or it's like $0.39.
7507000	7508000	That's digital distribution.
7508000	7513000	But asking me to pay $60 for something where I don't get that tangible everything,
7513000	7515000	I don't really do that.
7515000	7518000	It would be nice if those games I bought digital had a little equity.
7518000	7521000	That would be some incentive.
7521000	7526000	Tell me how many collector's editions of MMOs you've purchased digitally.
7526000	7531000	Oh, digitally? Collector's editions? Probably zero.
7531000	7533000	I bought 14 collector's editions.
7533000	7536000	Oh, no, because I didn't even buy Mists of Pandaria.
7536000	7539000	I refused to get the collector's edition. I thought it was dumb.
7539000	7544000	I got the collector's edition, but I also managed to price match it fries.
7544000	7548000	But I was like, tangible? There's my Final Fantasy XIV over there behind the Hello Kitty bag.
7548000	7553000	But think about it in that way. There are people who are willing to buy collector's editions
7553000	7556000	who don't want to have to go to the store and get it.
7556000	7558000	These people are also antisocial, and I know this for sure.
7558000	7560000	No, I'm kidding.
7560000	7562000	No, no, no, no, no.
7562000	7568000	All right. If that's it for rapid fire news, then let's get to the Google Question of the Week.
7568000	7571000	And every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7571000	7574000	You slam those words together, you get FOOGLE.
7582000	7586000	Well, not a lot of mention yet tonight of Valentine's Day, but that is a holiday.
7586000	7590000	I use that term like holiday with my little quotey fingers.
7590000	7592000	It ain't no bank holiday.
7592000	7597000	Yeah, I know, right? But it's a day that a lot of people do things on.
7597000	7603000	So I thought in the spirit of Valentine's Day, I would ask a very simple question for the FOOGLE Question of the Week this week.
7603000	7609000	And the question is, what video game do you think would make a really great game to play on a date?
7609000	7614000	I'm not going to be able to read all the answers tonight, but I'm going to read some of these, especially some of the shorter ones here.
7614000	7617000	I encourage you to read all of the answers on our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
7617000	7620000	But for time, I'm only going to read a handful of them.
7620000	7624000	Unfolded Raptor says, Flower, nuff said.
7624000	7629000	That's a nice, that's a nice peaceful game. Would you want to play Flower on a date, Dark Sakura?
7629000	7633000	Fuck no, we're going to play Virtual On.
7633000	7636000	Nice. Fucking nice.
7636000	7639000	I've got twin sticks. Why the fuck not?
7639000	7647000	Let's see. Ian, one of our buddies from Koopa Club, says, four swords or any Mario platformers.
7647000	7653000	I don't know, dude. That new Mario game can get people very competitive, just saying. You might want to watch out for that.
7653000	7661000	Let's see. Liam C. replied and said, Outlast, you could be that scared that you're in the other person's arms within minutes.
7661000	7668000	Sin, I hope I'm saying that name right. It's S-I-N-H. I think it's Sin T.
7668000	7674000	Says, my boyfriend and I have murder dates on Call of Duty, Black Ops 2 or Ghosts.
7674000	7680000	He's in St. Louis and I'm in Philadelphia. So for Valentine's Day, we're doing one versus ones on the new maps.
7680000	7683000	Those that slay together, stay together.
7683000	7687000	Would you go on a murder date with Dan, Dark Sakura?
7687000	7690000	I think most of them might already feel that way.
7690000	7696000	You know, the murder dates usually happen after we've been playing fighting games together.
7696000	7704000	For the Fallen Dreams replies, it says, Ilo Milo, which is a neat little puzzle-y game that's on PlayStation 3.
7704000	7710000	You can control it one, but it can also be a co-op game. So that's working together for puzzles.
7710000	7715000	Let's see. Strudels89 says, I think any fighting games are a great date game.
7715000	7720000	My husband and I played Tekken 2 at a movie arcade on our first date.
7720000	7724000	Tekken 2, Dark Sakura. That's right up your alley.
7724000	7729000	When I worked at my job at the arcade, Tekken 3 had just come out.
7730000	7734000	All right. Let's see. And Degenerate Johnny replied and said,
7734000	7739000	Normally I would say Mass Effect, but Garrus would probably charm my date away from me.
7739000	7743000	Therefore, I would have to say Saints Road the Third or Four.
7743000	7747000	Nothing says I'm interesting like a dildo bat to the face.
7747000	7751000	It also gives my date something to look forward to in the sack.
7751000	7754000	Dildos?
7754000	7758000	A slow clap for you, sir, for that answer.
7758000	7762000	Jason, can you remove your palm from your face for a minute there?
7766000	7774000	Let's see. Eddie K says, Considering I met my last girlfriend playing Left 4 Dead on Xbox Live, I'll go for that one.
7774000	7784000	What? You actually had a success story where you made a positive friendship via Xbox Live?
7784000	7786000	It's not League of Legends.
7786000	7792000	Most of my interactions on Xbox Live are negative. Did you buy a lottery ticket after that?
7792000	7795000	Keep in mind, Rob, how did Dan and I meet?
7795000	7798000	AOL.
7798000	7803000	That's still different, though. Even the AOL chat rooms of yesterday year weren't as toxic as Xbox Live.
7803000	7807000	I would disagree with that in a big way.
7807000	7809000	You didn't hang out in the same chat rooms I did.
7809000	7812000	I had Prodigy. I guess we were just smarter.
7812000	7814000	I used CompuServe.
7814000	7820000	Every so often, we'd just get a flock of us and troll some of the dating rooms.
7820000	7825000	Oh, boy. All right. Moving on. Some other answers here.
7825000	7833000	Awesome Unicorn replies and says, I'd probably sit the guy down, turn on Catherine, put the controller in his hand, and glare at him until he was finished playing.
7833000	7837000	Kidding. Probably something cute and low stress like Kirby's epic yarn.
7837000	7840000	Those that troll together roll together?
7840000	7846000	Lastly, Xenolith on Facebook says, I think depending on your partner, but any Mario multiplayer game.
7846000	7850000	Also, if your date likes to be scared, then survival horror it is.
7850000	7851000	Yay.
7851000	7853000	See, that's what I miss Shane being around for.
7853000	7858000	When we'd get a group of people in the room and say, okay, Shane, play Silent Hill.
7858000	7859000	Silent Hill 2.
7859000	7860000	Friend date.
7860000	7862000	Yeah, friend date. Friend dates are the best dates, I think.
7862000	7865000	All right. We have six answers on Google+. Did you know there's six people?
7865000	7866000	There's six people?
7866000	7867000	All right.
7867000	7871000	Shout out to Google+. All right. Again, I can't read all of these because I don't want to be unfair.
7871000	7874000	I only read about half the Facebook answers, so I'll read about half of these.
7874000	7882000	Colin M says, Portal 2 co-op. It shouldn't take long to find out how compatible you are and how well you two work together.
7882000	7885000	And how well you can put up with frustrations with each other.
7885000	7886000	Wow.
7886000	7888000	No, move. Portal. No, the other one. No, you just lost it.
7888000	7889000	Wow.
7889000	7890000	Damn it, we have to start over.
7890000	7895000	Colin's going all in on that date. Either this is going to work or it's not.
7895000	7897000	This is the true trust test.
7897000	7902000	This is the test right here. Let's see. Travis H says, LittleBigPlanet.
7902000	7908000	Although funny enough, me and my fiance met four years ago and put many hours into heavy rain and got a platinum.
7908000	7914000	She's been a gamer with me ever since. Since actdeft gave me a haiku, I can't resist.
7914000	7920000	Co-op and story. Make for a great gaming date. Kirby Superstar.
7920000	7922000	And no one's surprised.
7922000	7923000	That's a really good answer.
7923000	7924000	That is a good answer.
7924000	7928000	There was more to it too, but haiku.
7928000	7929000	Well done.
7929000	7931000	If you're going to give me a haiku, I'm sorry. I'm going to ignore the rest of it.
7931000	7932000	Actdeft wins one internet.
7932000	7935000	All right. Here you go. Complimentary internet.
7935000	7936000	All right.
7936000	7937000	Read the last one.
7937000	7943000	Last one from Flaco Jones. And I like this answer because it kind of touches me here too.
7943000	7944000	In a special place?
7944000	7947000	Well, no, it's just my answer is almost the exact same thing.
7947000	7951000	But Flaco Jones says, When my wife and I were first starting off dating over a long distance,
7951000	7955000	World of Warcraft was a great way to spend time together while still gaming.
7955000	7959000	MMOs are great for dating couples who can't always go out together.
7959000	7963000	And I co-signed that answer. Alan and I were long distance.
7963000	7966000	You know, we were about 100 miles apart for the first year, year and a half of our relationship.
7966000	7969000	And we played WoW a lot. And it was the same thing.
7969000	7972000	And now we still play MMOs. It's just we moved on to a different one.
7972000	7976000	And we don't always play together. He likes to stay up late and do all the different fights.
7976000	7979000	Whereas I'm like, I maxed out on tomes for the week. I'm over it.
7979000	7982000	I'm going to go play more Bravely Default.
7982000	7986000	That might have been a conversation that happened this week.
7986000	7992000	But anyway, anything anybody wants to add to the speaking is super nerdy.
7992000	7995000	Alan and I met for the first time, saw each other.
7995000	7998000	We knew each other online for years and years, kind of like you and Nan a little bit.
7998000	8003000	But we met for the very first time at a video games live concert.
8003000	8008000	Oh, shut up.
8009000	8010000	Katamari.
8010000	8012000	Katamari? Really? Why that?
8012000	8019000	Because it's incredibly cute, has really good music, has drop dead cymbal controls.
8019000	8023000	And just fun and attractive.
8023000	8029000	I think I want to be really angry at Dan, so maybe we'll play the Saturn instead and do X-Men vs. Street Fighter.
8029000	8035000	Loki, I'm dying to know. What's a great date game for you and Nellie?
8036000	8038000	Plug the Baby.
8038000	8043000	She doesn't like games, so I guess, let's see.
8043000	8045000	Excite Truck.
8045000	8048000	Yeah, Excite Truck's pretty good.
8048000	8052000	See, I was just going to say the guy game, but you know, because she doesn't like trivia.
8052000	8054000	Oh God, that's right.
8054000	8059000	I remember when you got the guy game, when it was on, like, you had it on PlayStation 2 or GameCube or something,
8059000	8062000	and Nellie was laughing harder than anybody at that game.
8062000	8064000	It was PlayStation 2.
8064000	8066000	BMX Triple X.
8066000	8068000	That's a fun game.
8068000	8075000	Alright, that's good. I love that Mrs. Loki is probably more into the porn games than Loki is.
8075000	8079000	But that's awesome. That's why she's great. Part of why she's great.
8079000	8081000	Alright.
8081000	8084000	I made it sound like that's the only reason. That's not the only reason.
8084000	8090000	Alright. Anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news. Back over to Loki.
8090000	8093000	Oh, by the way, just real quick again, I didn't read all the answers.
8093000	8095000	Thank you to everybody who did take the time to answer.
8095000	8101000	Please support everybody and go check out the answers in full over at facebook.com slash orange launch radio
8101000	8103000	and google.com slash plus orange launch radio.
8103000	8105000	Okay, now back to Loki.
8105000	8109000	Alright, so the first tweaks to the Xbox One are going to be happening in March,
8109000	8111000	just before the launch of Titanfall.
8111000	8116000	Of course, you know, they want everything to be nice and perfect before that, you know, game comes out.
8116000	8122000	So there's going to be some updates to the party and multiplayer options,
8122000	8126000	including, I guess, some significant overhauls on that.
8126000	8132000	They didn't really say some of the specifics, but it's supposed to be pretty good.
8132000	8137000	And then, of course, some of the things that I'm like, why weren't these in there in the first place?
8137000	8144000	But I guess a battery life indicator, you know, something that's just, I don't know, on every single other system out there.
8144000	8151000	And then also an indicator of showing how much space apps are taking up.
8151000	8154000	Why was that not in there in the first place?
8154000	8156000	That doesn't make any sense.
8156000	8161000	And also, I guess, you're going to be able to use a USB keyboard to, you know, type for chat
8161000	8167000	or I would assume on the internet and Internet Explorer and that kind of stuff.
8167000	8173000	So all features that were, I don't know, part of the last generation of systems
8173000	8177000	that they're now adding as new to next gen systems.
8177000	8181000	Can we say rushed?
8181000	8190000	Well, I think we kind of knew that that was the case is that, you know, especially when Microsoft reversed all of their policies after E3
8190000	8196000	and kind of had to quickly, you know, make their new OS or whatever you want to call it,
8196000	8198000	the back end software that runs on the system.
8198000	8201000	Hence why there was a day one update, right?
8201000	8206000	So this isn't really a huge surprise that they've got to still do all these different enhancements.
8206000	8208000	And PlayStation is in a similar spot.
8208000	8212000	I don't want to make it sound like I'm dogging to Microsoft because PlayStation keeps enhancing things too.
8212000	8217000	They just put out a patch not that long ago that enabled...
8217000	8223000	I just don't understand why they're being added in now like a battery life indicator
8223000	8228000	or, hey, let's see how much storage is on the hard drive, how much apps are taking up.
8228000	8230000	That was something that was in the original Xbox.
8230000	8233000	I know. And that's true. Those are things that were silly and overlooked.
8233000	8237000	But to be fair, like PlayStation, they finally patched in the ability to mute your camera.
8237000	8239000	That's kind of a big one too.
8239000	8244000	I've been sitting on this for a while and it has to be said because this was brought up.
8244000	8248000	Software development is not progressive like that.
8248000	8253000	Just because it was in a previous version does not mean it's automatically going to be there the next time.
8253000	8257000	The tools improve, the libraries improve, the features improve, the power improves.
8257000	8261000	But just because something was there in the past does not mean it will be there in the future.
8261000	8266000	But that would imply that all those guys at Microsoft who sat there and developed it,
8266000	8270000	not one of them said, you know, it would be nice to know how much battery life is left in this controller.
8270000	8275000	You know what they spent their time on? Big, huge, time-consuming, meaningful shit.
8275000	8278000	A battery indicator is not meaningful?
8278000	8283000	No, they spent their time trying to shoehorn Windows 8 into fucking Xbox One is what they did.
8283000	8286000	That's a whole other argument that I'm not going to disagree with.
8286000	8290000	But a battery indicator is a resolvable process.
8290000	8293000	Oh fuck, my controller's not on and it won't turn back on.
8293000	8295000	Let me switch the batteries out or plug the controller in.
8295000	8299000	It's totally cool that I don't know how much space I have left in my hard drive that I can't swap out.
8299000	8306000	If you have a space problem with a hard drive in the first two months, you're a special kind of person.
8306000	8310000	I'm not going to say anything at all about that.
8310000	8313000	I totally didn't buy a 3TB hard drive just for that.
8313000	8317000	I get where you're going with that because you're basically saying Microsoft had to pick and choose their battles.
8317000	8320000	They had to work fast, they had to pick and choose what absolutely has to be there.
8320000	8322000	As does every development studio ever.
8322000	8327000	But you would think that if their original plan was that it was going to be where you have to install everything in the first place,
8327000	8332000	that the indicator of how much space you have left in your hard drive would have been something that would have been kind of top of their list.
8332000	8337000	You know what though? I can actually, believe it or not, I actually really get Jason's point where it's like,
8337000	8340000	you're not going to be able to fill it up in the first two months.
8340000	8342000	So that's something that can roll out in the next quarter.
8342000	8343000	Unless you have seen.
8343000	8345000	I can see that huge project.
8345000	8351000	I can see that huge Microsoft project plan with everything that they want to put in.
8351000	8353000	And some of these are like, do we absolutely need this right now?
8353000	8359000	No, we don't need a space indicator because it's not humanly possible to fill the thing up the first couple months.
8359000	8363000	But that's not true though because even their updates were like several gigs in size.
8363000	8367000	And the games themselves are like, you know, 50 gigabytes.
8367000	8371000	But that doesn't, but the whole disk is not copied to disk.
8371000	8375000	Forza was only 11 gigs installed, 12 gigs installed.
8375000	8386000	And yeah, we heard, I reported on the Dead Rising 3 being 10 gigs out the gate and 13 gigs for the compatibility plus DLC, whatever the fuck preload update that they had two months ago.
8386000	8388000	But that's if you bought it physical, not digital.
8388000	8389000	Sure, absolutely.
8389000	8392000	Good point. That's a very legitimate point.
8392000	8398000	If you buy everything through the store, you will have greater space use than if you have disk.
8398000	8410000	But people, I doubt, unless something went really wrong with the hard drive space and you lost space to disk errors because it was a DOA drive or what have you.
8410000	8414000	You were not going to fill up 500 in the first two months of the system.
8414000	8421000	Our good pal Bobby Black Wolf brings up this point saying, Loki, the indicator isn't necessary because they're going to silently delete things you don't use to make room.
8421000	8425000	You will never fill up your hard drive because it will automatically delete things you don't use.
8425000	8426000	That's their excuse.
8426000	8429000	I think it's stupid myself, but that's their excuse.
8429000	8431000	That's terrible.
8431000	8435000	They'll delete, they delete old game DVR footage.
8435000	8437000	Not the porn, not the porn.
8437000	8442000	They delete installed game data that you don't play.
8442000	8445000	They delete apps that you downloaded that you didn't use.
8445000	8452000	It's a fucking inconvenience and people are going to scream bloody murder when they have to redownload something or reinstall something.
8452000	8455000	But it's a recoverable problem.
8455000	8457000	Like I made the point with the controller.
8457000	8459000	Oh fuck, my controller's dead. Let me switch my batteries.
8459000	8462000	And you stop caring.
8462000	8468000	It's actually kind of funny that we say this because my controller was being kind of flaky a couple days ago.
8468000	8471000	And I wasn't sure if there was a battery indicator.
8471000	8476000	And I did hit the home button and think to myself, where the fuck is the indicator?
8476000	8478000	But I didn't care. You know what I did?
8478000	8483000	I went and I grabbed my USB cable, I plugged it into the system and I was done.
8483000	8485000	Whatever.
8487000	8490000	Alright, well in the interest of time I'm going to move on to the next story.
8490000	8492000	Was there more for that?
8492000	8493000	Nope.
8493000	8496000	Okay, let me quickly move on to the next story which is about,
8496000	8501000	Oh, this is about a game that maybe many of you were playing and maybe your Xbox has already deleted it.
8501000	8503000	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
8503000	8507000	But Batman Arkham Origins was one of the big titles at the end of last year.
8507000	8511000	And apparently the support page for the game is full of players who are complaining.
8511000	8522000	Because community manager Mercury wrote that Origins development team is going to focus on completing the story DLC instead of fixing the bugs that are breaking the game.
8522000	8530000	So, the team is currently working hard on the upcoming story DLC and there are currently no plans for releasing another patch to address the issues that have been reported on the forums.
8530000	8538000	If we do move forward with creating a new patch, it will try to address the progression blocking bugs for players, not the minor glitches that do not prevent one from continuing to play.
8538000	8543000	The issues that are not progression blockers will unfortunately no longer be addressed.
8543000	8545000	Wow.
8545000	8549000	So again, there's that project plan and we have this much resources.
8549000	8553000	This is going to make us money, this is going to shut people up, this is going to do nothing.
8553000	8557000	And that's how it works, folks.
8557000	8561000	Resources are finite. Time is finite. Money is limited.
8561000	8563000	I'm not saying I necessarily agree with it.
8563000	8567000	General sense, that's all I'm saying. There's a trade-off in everything.
8567000	8574000	Also of note, Warner Brothers Entertainment is going to adapt Batman Arkham, that whole series, which is now a trilogy.
8574000	8579000	It should be an animated film and should be released later this year. That's according to a report from The Hollywood Reporter.
8579000	8586000	Don't know what all the game will entail, but we do know the name is Batman, or excuse me, what the movie will entail from the games.
8586000	8589000	But we do know the name of the movie is Batman Assault on Arkham.
8589000	8595000	So they're not just like porting a game into a movie, but it's going to just basically be in the universe there.
8595000	8602000	So, there you go. J. Olivia, who, sorry, Olivia, excuse me, I read that name too quick.
8602000	8610000	Olivia, who directed Justice League War is set to be the director of that film.
8610000	8614000	Mark Hamill will not be Joker, but Kevin Conroy will be Batman.
8614000	8617000	I imagine they're going to get, what's his name that does all the voice, Troy Baker.
8617000	8622000	Troy Baker, right, who does everything for video games. I imagine he's going to do it.
8622000	8627000	Could you imagine if EA stopped patching Battlefield 4 and focused on new content?
8627000	8630000	I thought that's what they did.
8630000	8632000	People still didn't shut up about it.
8632000	8634000	That's what people still think.
8634000	8636000	Alright, moving on.
8636000	8642000	And Tigerclaw clarifies in the chat they are using the same voices from Origins in the movie, so that would imply new guy.
8642000	8643000	Dark Sakura.
8643000	8645000	I don't know how I feel about this.
8645000	8648000	There's a lot of people on the internet saying that about this story.
8648000	8652000	Oh, they're not saying they don't know how they feel. They're making their feelings very well known.
8652000	8654000	There's a lot of unhappy people.
8654000	8661000	Basically, there is going to be a starting over of the Sonic series.
8661000	8667000	It was revealed by Sega in New York City on Thursday this past week.
8667000	8669000	Sonic Boom.
8669000	8678000	Which is the name of the new animated series debuting with the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games as a new franchise.
8678000	8682000	Sonic Boom. Sonic Boom. Sonic Boom.
8682000	8685000	It's supposed to be the modern Sonic.
8685000	8690000	On top of that though, from what I understand, it's being completely US developed.
8690000	8699000	So we don't have any original, or I would say the Japanese development behind it.
8699000	8704000	Who we've identified as the core Sonic team back in Japan.
8704000	8707000	And the art style just looks completely wrong.
8707000	8711000	What is up with Knuckles looking roided out, please?
8711000	8714000	This is just, no.
8714000	8720000	Sonic is wearing a scarf.
8720000	8722000	Why is Sonic wearing a scarf?
8722000	8723000	Why not?
8723000	8725000	Is he hipster Sonic now?
8725000	8731000	Rama in chat says, you don't like Knuckles' new look? Go blame Cartoon Network.
8731000	8734000	Fine. I will blame Cartoon Network. I don't know.
8734000	8737000	At least he doesn't eat stuff with snot like a real echidna.
8737000	8740000	I'm gonna be honest. I'm gonna be completely blunt with this.
8740000	8743000	I have a huge sense of apathy about this.
8743000	8747000	I mean, really. I kinda look at this and I go, okay.
8747000	8750000	My question is, are the games still gonna be good?
8750000	8754000	Because I don't really care. I never was into the cartoons or any of that stuff. I don't care.
8754000	8758000	The litmus test for the new Sonic. Is it better than Sonic 06?
8759000	8761000	Is it better than Sonic Unleashed?
8761000	8765000	I should sure as fuck hope so. How can anything be worse than Sonic 06?
8765000	8766000	You'd be surprised.
8766000	8771000	Here's the thing. They said, I understand that they're making this exclusively for Nintendo.
8771000	8774000	So is this what they're gonna try to sell systems with?
8774000	8781000	Because the last Sonic game only sold about 600,000 units overall.
8781000	8785000	Well, go back to Awata's comment about where the install bases are.
8785000	8792000	Obviously this whole Sonic reboot on Cartoon Network is kinda geared towards kids and people that would gravitate towards Wii U.
8792000	8796000	I mean, it's the reverse of what y'all were saying about first person shooters.
8796000	8803000	The whole point is you wanna gravitate people that don't already have a Wii U to the Wii U.
8803000	8808000	Not kids that would probably already have a 3DS or Wii U.
8808000	8813000	Well, not that many kids have a Wii U or we wouldn't be having this problem that we're having.
8813000	8816000	Well, certainly a lot more that can join the ranks.
8817000	8820000	Are you excited about Sonic Boom, Loki?
8820000	8826000	I've been different about it because I honestly am not a big Sonic fan at all.
8826000	8831000	So, I mean, it wasn't as terrible as the cartoon.
8831000	8837000	Like, I watched the little trailer for the cartoon and it didn't seem bad. I mean, it looked alright.
8837000	8839000	Knuckles is too big.
8839000	8840000	Who cares?
8840000	8841000	I do.
8842000	8843000	It doesn't matter.
8843000	8850000	I think my favorite comment that I read about this is that both Tails and Amy are crotch height to Knuckles.
8852000	8854000	Sonic's friends were all a little dumb anyway.
8854000	8855000	Like, I mean...
8855000	8860000	Well, that was supposed to be his girlfriend. Well, Sonic's girlfriend anyway.
8860000	8862000	His robbing the cradle girlfriend.
8862000	8863000	Uh...
8863000	8866000	She's 8. No, she's 13. No, they're all underage anyways.
8866000	8867000	They're animals. It doesn't matter.
8867000	8869000	Oh, so it's a dog ears argument?
8869000	8871000	Yes, they're all actually 70.
8872000	8875000	Dark Sakura, the final word on Sonic Boom?
8878000	8880000	Can I give the last word to SSJ100, Matt?
8880000	8881000	You sure.
8881000	8887000	Breaking news! Knuckles A-Rod Akinda has been suspended from Smash Brothers because he tested positive for performance enhancing drugs.
8888000	8889000	That's nice. That's nice. I like that.
8889000	8890000	That's a good joke.
8890000	8893000	Can we get a Commander Guile cameo in there somewhere?
8893000	8894000	Sonic Boom!
8894000	8898000	That's it. We need Sonic Boom set to Guile's music.
8899000	8901000	I'm sure it's already been done.
8903000	8906000	Alright, let's go to Loki with another story.
8907000	8909000	Alright, so this is kind of cool.
8909000	8911000	You know, with the whole...
8912000	8914000	What is it? The Oculus Rift stuff?
8914000	8919000	They're actually now developing games exclusively for the Oculus Rift.
8920000	8928000	And this includes now a brand new game called E-Valkyrie, which looks like a space shooter game and looks pretty awesome.
8928000	8931000	And it's going to be exclusively on the Oculus Rift in...
8933000	8934000	I don't know.
8935000	8936000	Cool.
8938000	8942000	Is this the first MMO that supports Oculus Rift?
8943000	8944000	I don't know.
8944000	8951000	Well, I think other MMOs, like Define Support, because I know they've got drivers for other MMOs, but like...
8951000	8957000	First party and designed for depth and not just bolted on with the existing engine.
8957000	8960000	I believe so, although Bobby will correct me in a heartbeat if I'm wrong.
8960000	8965000	But I believe so, although I think somebody else had said they were exploring it.
8965000	8969000	I want to say EverQuest with the giant question mark, the landmark and all that.
8969000	8970000	That would make sense.
8970000	8977000	But, yeah, the thing is though, I think you can play things like World of Warcraft and stuff in the Rift with drivers and all that, but...
8977000	8979000	You can play Metroid Prime with the Rift!
8979000	8987000	You can't read the text, because the way the development kits are right now, the resolution's not quite there.
8987000	8990000	And even if it was there, it would still be really hard to read.
8990000	8996000	So a game that they're going to do that could be MMO based or whatever is going to have to be designed with the Rift in mind.
8996000	9002000	The text is going to have to be large and it probably shouldn't even really rely on that text experience to begin with.
9004000	9005000	Jamie's freaking out.
9005000	9007000	I just looked at something from one of the emails and oh my god.
9008000	9009000	Oh my god.
9009000	9010000	Don't get ahead of us.
9010000	9011000	I'm not.
9011000	9012000	Don't get ahead of yourself.
9012000	9016000	Black Wolf is saying too, it's not an MMO, this game, it's a Wing Commander clone in the Eve universe.
9016000	9017000	Oh.
9017000	9019000	So it's like a side story type thing.
9019000	9034000	I seem to recall CCP Games tried something like this with the Playstation 3 arcade and that whole, like the dust or whatever, was sort of like a side game that wasn't an MMO, but it influenced the MMO, if you will.
9034000	9049000	This is going to make a good precursor to Star Citizen because as one of the stretch goals, Star Citizen intends to include Oculus Rift support, whatever form that takes in the year as soon as that game is actually going to be out.
9049000	9052000	Which is going to be amazing because Star Citizen, oh god, that game looks so good.
9052000	9058000	I need to overhaul my joystick, flight stick setup arrangements.
9059000	9065000	I'm very curious to see when the Oculus is a little more readily available commercially, when it's like finished and stuff.
9065000	9066000	I'm really curious to see how...
9066000	9068000	Well, actually readily available commercially to be completely honest.
9068000	9069000	Right.
9069000	9070000	Dan mentioned he might want one.
9070000	9073000	Yeah, I'm very curious to see kind of where that goes.
9073000	9074000	It would be pretty cool.
9074000	9075000	I mean, I love the technology.
9075000	9083000	I'm just very curious to see like, okay, what happens now when this isn't just like a niche dev thing now and it really starts to, you know, get out there commercially.
9083000	9085000	It's going to be very interesting.
9085000	9088000	Alright, one more story and then we're going to go to the email bag.
9088000	9091000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
9091000	9093000	But until then, my turn.
9093000	9102000	There was a game that I crossed paths with on Twitter that I thought was really interesting and would love to talk about for a minute.
9102000	9104000	The game is not out. It is previewed.
9104000	9112000	If you go to Necrodancer.com, you can see the teaser trailer that I believe is really the extent of their media that's out so far.
9112000	9119000	It will be available this year on all computer platforms, PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam.
9119000	9130000	Necrodancer, Curse of the Necro, Crypt, sorry, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike slash dungeon crawler that adds in rhythm elements.
9130000	9138000	So whether that means for attacking or moving with bonuses, that remains to be seen.
9139000	9144000	So it's a roguelike, it's a dungeon crawler, and it's a rhythm game.
9144000	9149000	So if it was also an MMO, it would be my perfect game, right?
9149000	9152000	Somebody's trying to target the Rob market.
9152000	9155000	And if you could sing to the rhythm, it would be SingStar Abba Rogue.
9155000	9160000	SingStar Rogue Abba Rogue Abba Rogue...
9160000	9163000	Anyways...
9163000	9167000	Yeah, you know I'm back on the show and I even take the words out of Rob's mouth.
9168000	9176000	Pretty standard affair game, simple graphics, but one of the kickers is that because it is rhythm oriented,
9176000	9181000	you have the ability of putting your own library, your own music library to use to influence...
9181000	9187000	I don't think it's randomly generated, but it is the movement structure of the game.
9187000	9193000	So not only can you put your own library to use, but you can also use a DDR pad to play it.
9193000	9198000	So not only did they take this concept, but they actually ran with it, they actually implemented it,
9198000	9204000	they actually know a way that, well, you can put an accessory that may not be getting enough love anymore to use.
9206000	9209000	So dust off them DDR pads if they still work.
9209000	9216000	It is available for pre-order now, $13... $14 pre-order in $15 when it releases.
9216000	9218000	Like I said, gonna be on Steam.
9218000	9222000	I already bought it, I got the soundtrack, I'm so looking forward to it.
9222000	9224000	I'm curious.
9224000	9226000	Watch the trailer, throw the trailer up.
9226000	9229000	Alright, I will look at this right now.
9229000	9233000	This is from Necrodancer.com, let's take a little look-see.
9233000	9234000	That's just an awesome name.
9235000	9237000	They told me I was too young.
9238000	9240000	They told me I needed more training.
9240000	9242000	She looks like Link, but with a shovel.
9243000	9245000	I told them to drop dead.
9247000	9249000	How ironic.
9249000	9251000	She just dropped dead.
9252000	9254000	I don't know how I survived that fall.
9254000	9256000	You know Lara Croft had a worse day.
9260000	9262000	Heck yes, cheesy techno music.
9263000	9267000	But my pulse is beating like a drum, but my blood is running cold.
9268000	9271000	I'm not sure what's going on, but I came here with a question.
9272000	9274000	And I'm gonna find the answer if it kills me.
9274000	9275000	Can I dance?
9281000	9282000	Yes.
9285000	9287000	I swear I played a game like this on Ouya.
9288000	9289000	Yes, Ouya.
9290000	9293000	It wasn't this same 8-bit graphic-y thing.
9293000	9296000	It had more Ouya-style graphics.
9296000	9300000	But it was something like you would move around and hit the buttons and attack to the beat.
9300000	9303000	I swear at Ouya's E3 booth I played something like that.
9303000	9306000	I'm a sucker for this stuff, I completely admit it.
9306000	9307000	It looks so much fun.
9307000	9309000	Alright, I'll check it out.
9309000	9313000	I also have to dust off an old dance pad, so I fully intend to play it that way.
9313000	9315000	Quick, cash in. Just add 8-bit graphics.
9315000	9316000	Yay!
9316000	9317000	Worked for Flappy Bird.
9318000	9319000	Alright.
9319000	9321000	Too soon, Rob. Too soon.
9321000	9323000	Rest in peace, Flappy. I miss you.
9324000	9325000	No, I don't. I don't miss you.
9327000	9329000	No, you keep hitting that pipe.
9332000	9335000	Well, Bobby did have episode 420 tonight.
9335000	9336000	Alright.
9337000	9339000	Alright, let's get to the email bag.
9339000	9342000	Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
9342000	9346000	Although, we are going to change that email very soon.
9346000	9347000	Yes.
9347000	9352000	So you can still email us, but this is probably about the last week you're going to be able to send us this email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
9352000	9355000	We will give you the new email address soon.
9355000	9357000	Yes, I have plans.
9357000	9360000	Alright, well maybe I have plans. Maybe Jason has plans.
9360000	9361000	I have planners.
9361000	9363000	You know what? Read an email.
9363000	9364000	I'm a planist.
9364000	9365000	Are you a planist?
9365000	9366000	Planist Hollywood. No.
9367000	9369000	So, that was stupid.
9369000	9370000	Wow.
9370000	9374000	So, um, wow, um, Robert M. sent me an email.
9374000	9377000	My recent mailings have been way too long. So, Duffy Bus.
9379000	9382000	And it says Dark Soccer isn't off tonight, I hope.
9382000	9384000	So, I had to look up Duffy Bus.
9385000	9389000	And, oh my God, it's a furry bus that's all Duffy.
9389000	9394000	And it has Duffy's face on the front and the seats have Duffy on them and there's Duffy.
9394000	9396000	So much Duffy. Oh my fucking God.
9396000	9401000	If you don't know Duffy, it's Disney's form of a Build-A-Bear.
9401000	9403000	No, no, no, it's not like a Build-A-Bear.
9403000	9406000	It's, um, Dan calls it Focus Group Bear.
9406000	9413000	So, I am copying this and posting it in the chatroom right now so everyone can see the glory.
9413000	9416000	I want this in my life. This has to be in my life, Hob.
9416000	9418000	I want it for reasons.
9419000	9420000	Fair enough.
9421000	9422000	So, um...
9422000	9425000	Thank you for making her squee, Robert M.
9425000	9429000	Maybe we squee way too early. Okay, we got another long one from RossdellU2.
9430000	9433000	Alright, well, you know, we've talked about his emails before.
9433000	9437000	He brings up sometimes uncomfortable but necessary points.
9437000	9438000	I know. I'm reading it.
9438000	9442000	Greetings, guys. Your discussion about the Wii U is perhaps a bit weighted in Nintendo's favor.
9442000	9444000	Perhaps due to not having Loki on the show.
9444000	9446000	I thought I'd inject...
9446000	9447000	Oh, here we go.
9447000	9451000	Didn't I say earlier I don't want Nintendo Doc? I'm done. Alright, fine. Fine.
9452000	9454000	A bit of the other side in this message.
9454000	9463000	I picked up the Wii U despite having been thoroughly turned off by the Wii in April of last year while we were still worried about the PS4 following, um, the DRM path.
9463000	9470000	After catching up on the games I'd missed in the past month's Monster Hunter SMMBU et al.,
9470000	9480000	I found myself in the familiar Nintendo drought and came to realize why Nintendo home consoles will never be relevant to the core gaming market.
9480000	9486000	While the Wii U went months without content of any sort, the PS3 and 360 were spoiled for games just everywhere.
9486000	9488000	See, the issue with Nintendo is twofold.
9488000	9492000	They've saddled the system with a stupid hook that they've failed to explain to consumers,
9492000	9496000	and since they're clearly focused on the 3DS, which I can't blame the company for,
9496000	9504000	there's just not going to be the attention needed to make Wii U games at a fast enough rate to be appealing to the people outside of the Nintendo Defense Force.
9504000	9514000	Already I've got just under half as many games for the PS4 as I do on the Wii U, and I expect my PS4 collection to blow past my Wii U collection pretty fast.
9514000	9522000	I'll admit that part of this is that I abhor the gamepad with the passion of a thousand burning suns, but more importantly the games just aren't there,
9522000	9528000	and the ones that do come are extremely conservative entries into their perennial franchises.
9528000	9534000	Put bluntly, Nintendo cannot support two consoles without third-party support, at least not as they are.
9534000	9540000	And I have to go back to the chatroom because it times out on me. Sorry.
9540000	9548000	God damn. Okay. I'm not going to say anything about this product. It's a very good product.
9549000	9552000	Where was I?
9552000	9556000	Unless they're willing to back off the 3DS Forbidden Focus on-
9556000	9562000	No, for all their talk Nintendo knows exactly where its bread is buttered, and unless they're willing to back off on the 3DS Forbidden Focus on the Wii U,
9562000	9571000	it's going to be another 4-5 years of nothing but your Mario, Zelda, and Wii franchises, with the only breaks in sight being X and Bayonetta 2,
9571000	9574000	neither of which have release dates in sight.
9574000	9579000	Put short, Nintendo's games are too few and far between to support a system without third-parties,
9579000	9586000	and that will down them to security in the home space until they start investing heavily in internal Wii U development.
9586000	9590000	Anyway, I look forward to the inevitable Nintendo defense that Rob will mount.
9590000	9593000	Seriously guys, have a good one and have a great week.
9593000	9596000	Regards, RossdielUT, who is apparently disgusting for being a brony.
9596000	9603000	P.S. Shane and Exifer were painful to listen to. I'm not going to say anything about that.
9604000	9608000	You know what, I love Exifer and I love Shane, so they were awesome.
9608000	9612000	Um, different strokes for different folks.
9612000	9615000	I apparently have a high-pitched voice.
9615000	9616000	Do you?
9616000	9620000	I don't know, do I?
9620000	9622000	That's really good.
9622000	9629000	I don't know what to say to that email, I mean to be honest it's kind of the same shtick I'm hearing about Nintendo.
9629000	9639000	I'm going to be honest, although, and please don't take this as disrespectful, I just feel like what he's saying is nothing I haven't heard like a hundred times already.
9639000	9641000	Yeah.
9641000	9645000	Maybe that's why it didn't come up on the show that Loki wasn't here, it's just kind of like it's the same.
9645000	9647000	But they were good points.
9647000	9651000	It's fine, but also some of them, some of them, I could apply to Xbox One.
9651000	9656000	Just saying, unnecessary gimmick we're all forced to buy, that's an Xbox One.
9656000	9658000	Drought of Games, Xbox One.
9658000	9660000	I'd second that for now.
9660000	9664000	Now I'm not here to sing the doom and gloom praises of Xbox One.
9664000	9669000	But I just will say this, since you are expecting me to be the Nintendo defendant, I will say this much.
9669000	9676000	Yeah, Wii U is hurting. Wii U needs to attract third party people back.
9676000	9681000	Wii U does not have the online experience that can hold a candle to the other consoles.
9681000	9684000	Wii U is far from perfect.
9684000	9686000	That's for sure.
9686000	9692000	But, sure, Wii U only gets those one or two or three Nintendo games a year right now.
9692000	9695000	But they are quality fucking games.
9695000	9700000	It's a little bit of irony that we won't sing the doom and gloom at the Xbox division,
9700000	9708000	but there are large swaths of Microsoft, of which the Xbox One is related to by nature of the online services division,
9708000	9710000	that isn't making a whole bunch of money.
9710000	9715000	And considering the loss that Microsoft takes on the console itself for so long,
9715000	9720000	that they have to recoup in, you know, licensing for purchases and all that kind of stuff, game publishing,
9720000	9729000	they make a hell of a lot of money, but they're not always above water in the strict division-specific financial sense.
9729000	9737000	Here's the thing, at the end of the day, I'm not delusional where I think the Wii U is gonna overtake the PlayStation 4 on the Xbox One at this point.
9737000	9739000	Fuck no, that's not happening.
9739000	9747000	At this point, it is to try and minimalize the loss of money that they're getting on Wii U right now.
9747000	9751000	And hopefully some quality games will bring that up and get people excited again.
9751000	9758000	But honestly, at this point, I'm not dissatisfied with my purchase of the Wii U,
9758000	9762000	because how else would I have gotten to play as some of the great games that are on it?
9762000	9770000	But it's just kinda like, as far as its success everywhere, Wii-style large thing, it's just not gonna happen with this console.
9770000	9773000	Maybe the next time. You know what, the GameCube wasn't a big hit either,
9773000	9779000	but Nintendo didn't go under and have to make games for, you know, Apple and Android and all this.
9779000	9786000	So, I just don't think, I don't think Nintendo's going bankrupt tomorrow or anything like that.
9786000	9787000	It's not gonna happen.
9787000	9789000	Far from it, honestly.
9792000	9794000	So anyway, how about we move forward?
9794000	9797000	Hi, OLR, this is KZ Borat.
9797000	9801000	I just wanted to say I love the show, as I have for the last nine years.
9801000	9802000	Thanks for being long-term.
9802000	9803000	Holy crap.
9803000	9809000	Also, I wanted to inform you that there is a Wikipedia page that includes your show about a game.
9809000	9813000	The wiki page for Guitar Hero, Rock of the 80s, under the History tab,
9813000	9820000	it says that OLR was the only source to announce its release on a particular date, and that you guys were right.
9820000	9825000	Just thought it was interesting, and also I wanted to donate some microphones, mic stands, and some nice cables.
9825000	9827000	Please let me know if you'd be interested in that.
9827000	9830000	I have a surplus and I'm always looking for a way to support the show.
9830000	9834000	Yeah, actually the mic stands especially would be pretty phenomenal.
9834000	9839000	And you know what's funny? Somebody else was messaging me on Facebook about that too.
9839000	9844000	And these mics we're using now were donated by the fantastic people over at PodCulture.
9844000	9846000	You guys' generosity is amazing.
9846000	9853000	I want to ask you, dude, did you actually do this as a voice recording? Like voice-to-text?
9853000	9854000	Oh, maybe.
9854000	9859000	Just because, I mean, you know I have an eye for grammar and stuff.
9859000	9864000	I can figure it out because the last thing listed is Boar Hot Out.
9864000	9866000	And I guess that's supposed to be Boar At.
9866000	9871000	But that's the same type of stuff that, you know, the stuff that goes in is like usual.
9871000	9875000	I'd really like to know. Actually, that sounds like you're using a fairly decent voice-to-text program.
9875000	9877000	I'd really like to know what you're using.
9877000	9881000	And I will just say quickly, yes, I actually did know about the Wikipedia thing.
9881000	9885000	Because Orange Dance Radio used to have an article on Wikipedia some time ago.
9885000	9887000	We should, someone remake our thing.
9887000	9893000	Well, it was taken down because it didn't establish nobility or whatever and didn't have enough outside resources or whatever.
9893000	9898000	But I'm just, I don't know. It's kind of one of those things where I don't want to sound like,
9898000	9900000	You know, we deserve a Wikipedia page.
9900000	9902000	But we did.
9902000	9903000	History.
9903000	9908000	We are the longest running weekly podcast about games.
9908000	9916000	Okay. Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s was initially announced by EGM in January 2007 as Guitar Hero 1980s Edition.
9916000	9922000	Orange Lounge Radio claimed that the game would be released in June 2007 based on an Activision announcement.
9922000	9924000	And no other source has cited this announcement.
9924000	9928000	Activision officially revealed the first details of the game May 11, 2007.
9928000	9932000	In addition to changing the game's title to Guitar Hero Rock the 80s.
9932000	9934000	I just, I remember that. Loki figured that out.
9934000	9937000	Loki had like a presentation at his work or something.
9937000	9939000	And that's why it wasn't out, because it wasn't a media thing.
9939000	9943000	It was an internal. Right, Loki? Do you remember that?
9943000	9945000	Vaguely.
9945000	9949000	I'm almost positive it was a distribution announcement, not a media announcement.
9949000	9950000	And that's why we had it before.
9950000	9953000	Yeah, I say a lot of things before they come out, but no one ever knows this.
9954000	9960000	Of all games to get noticed for, Loki, Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s.
9960000	9966000	I want to quickly on Wikipedia, just because I, you know, yes, I like to see where this show is having an impact.
9966000	9968000	I think a lot of you would too.
9968000	9970000	I think we're referenced on the Ultramix 4 article.
9970000	9977000	And I think we're referenced on the beautiful Katamari article, which will not go there.
9977000	9982000	But that should come as no surprise if you've been listening to OLR for nine years.
9982000	9983000	That's all I'll say.
9983000	9986000	I would actually really like for our Wikipedia page to come back.
9986000	9993000	Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s, beautiful Katamari, Dance Sense Revolution Ultramix 4, and Podcast Awards.
9994000	9997000	That's right. Sorry, I was just laughing, because it's like, oh, hey, yeah.
9997000	10002000	A whole breakdown of all of the nominations and winners per category and everything.
10002000	10007000	Yeah, and a ton of those shows have pages. How come we don't get a page? We're not notable enough.
10007000	10013000	2005. This is actually a really nice table. Quick overview, since we're running over it.
10013000	10019000	Podcast Awards, 2005 until 2013 in the gaming category. These are the winners, naturally.
10019000	10022000	As of 2005, going forward. Orange Lounge Radio.
10022000	10026000	You can just stop there. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm such an asshole.
10026000	10027000	How about the last email?
10027000	10029000	Go ahead and let Jason have his moment.
10029000	10031000	Orange Lounge Radio, pause.
10031000	10033000	It's his last show for a while.
10033000	10034000	Oh, I'm sorry.
10034000	10035000	Jason's stopping you in your face.
10035000	10036000	I didn't realize I was interrupting. Sorry.
10036000	10040000	Gaming, 2005, and each successive name will be a year forward.
10040000	10050000	Orange Lounge Radio, Podtacular, Cagcast, The Instance, 4-Player Podcast, 4-Player Podcast, 4-Player Podcast, Rooster Teeth Podcast, Rooster Teeth Podcast.
10050000	10055000	You know what's interesting, though, about all that? All of those shows still going. Every single one of them.
10055000	10056000	Is Podtacular still going?
10056000	10057000	Except us. We're gone.
10057000	10060000	We are out of here. Bye, bitches. No, I'm just kidding.
10060000	10061000	Also interesting.
10061000	10062000	That's really cool.
10063000	10069000	Orange Lounge Radio in that list is linked, but it's red, meaning there's no source article that it's linked to.
10069000	10071000	It was probably linked to when we actually had our article.
10071000	10073000	Sure. It's obviously been around for a couple years.
10073000	10074000	In 2005, we...
10074000	10075000	Okay, that's all.
10076000	10077000	Get to work, someone.
10077000	10081000	Raginator says we're referenced in Namco Museum Essentials on PSN, too.
10081000	10084000	Well, I know we are in the game.
10084000	10086000	You mentioned that, but I didn't realize that.
10086000	10088000	If we're in the wiki, I had no idea.
10088000	10090000	I did a full text search in Wikipedia.
10090000	10092000	We've also got the President Cat thing.
10092000	10094000	That wasn't a wiki either, was it?
10094000	10096000	No, but they're talking about source elsewhere.
10096000	10099000	Black Wolf says Podtacular is off.
10099000	10101000	Oh, I thought they were still doing Halo stuff.
10101000	10103000	All right. Well, sorry to hear.
10103000	10105000	Then I forget what I said. Sorry.
10105000	10106000	Bring back the wiki.
10107000	10116000	Hi, OLR. I just really wanted to respond to Sky's so-called fan wink about Sega being potentially acquired slash emerged by Nintendo or Sony or Microsoft.
10116000	10124000	Big reason this won't happen, Sega just recently took over Index Corporation, which Atlus is a big part of, and Atlus makes Shin Megami Tensei.
10124000	10132000	If Sega were acquired by any of the big three, then Shin Megami Tensei and Persona fandoms would go nuclear.
10132000	10134000	Probably some of Sega's fans, too.
10134000	10142000	More recently, Sega reported increased revenues for PC and digital games, so they're not going to go console exclusive anytime soon.
10142000	10147000	I know it's a, I know it's wank, but we've got to wake up with a sore neck every once in a while, too.
10147000	10149000	The nasty canasta.
10149000	10155000	P.S. Why isn't hashtag press X to VX JasonXV trending on VOG?
10155000	10157000	That's a good question.
10157000	10159000	The world may never know.
10159000	10160000	Oh, boy.
10160000	10163000	Because I haven't heard this.
10163000	10168000	There's a, there's a coworker of mine that lives in the East, and every time she comes into town for events,
10169000	10174000	I look forward to one very specific, wonderful reference that she's usually the first one to make,
10174000	10177000	and then everybody else that gets the joke joins in, so, you know.
10177000	10186000	So, to totally derail the show right now, because I love doing that, and I just saw on Facebook, someone linked to an article saying,
10186000	10190000	Pepsi is reintroducing limited edition Crystal Pepsi.
10190000	10191000	What?
10191000	10195000	Nope, nope, nope, stop, put the brakes on, satire website, go to the About Us page.
10195000	10197000	Wall Street Sentinel, sorry.
10197000	10203000	Wildfire, because people, people don't think it's, I know, I was like, but then I was like, wait a minute, I have never heard of this site.
10203000	10208000	This is not coming from CNN, or, you know, something that you've heard of, it's coming from, yeah.
10208000	10212000	But in good news, there is a fundraiser for Clearly Canadian to bring that back.
10212000	10219000	There's a, there's a fucking, there's a gaming press website that does that, and it's not clear that they're a satire site,
10219000	10225000	and people share their shit all the time, and you know they're over there cackling, that people keep sharing their shit like it's fact.
10225000	10232000	I can't, something like, I don't even want to say the name, because I hate it when I see those articles on Facebook, people think they're true,
10232000	10238000	but it's something like, I actually, I just thought of the name of it, I'm not going to say it.
10238000	10242000	This actually doesn't sound any bit familiar, so, if you're interested, watch Twitter for a couple days.
10242000	10245000	It's P something something, I'll say.
10245000	10251000	Alright, moving on, that was it for Mailbag, right?
10251000	10252000	Yes it was.
10252000	10258000	Then you should email us, this is your last, literally your last chance to email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
10258000	10260000	This is your last chance to email us.
10260000	10262000	To email that address.
10262000	10264000	Alright, more information on that coming next week.
10264000	10270000	Here we go to the, that email address will still be good though through at least the next show, because we know some people are behind,
10270000	10274000	we're not going to just shutter the mailbag right away, and we'll put an announcement out on Facebook and Twitter.
10274000	10277000	And at the very least we can set up a redirect.
10277000	10279000	Eh, no, no, trust me.
10279000	10280000	Alright, alright.
10280000	10281000	I have means.
10281000	10283000	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
10283000	10285000	Every week we get angsty.
10285000	10286000	Why?
10286000	10288000	Because that's what we do.
10304000	10306000	FU to having to get up at six in the morning.
10307000	10312000	However, this will be the last week for a while that I'll have to do it.
10312000	10317000	So next Saturday, I'm sorry next Sunday, I will be on my late schedule.
10321000	10323000	I like sleep, I like sleep a lot.
10324000	10334000	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I have so much to do before this weekend, and in the rainy weather all I really want to do is just sit and play Bravely Default all day,
10334000	10339000	but I can't because I have so much to do, like, I just, I'm gonna die.
10339000	10341000	I might not be here next week because I might be dead.
10341000	10344000	So I just want to say, not allowed.
10344000	10346000	I really appreciate all of your support over the years.
10348000	10350000	And thanks, and peace out.
10350000	10351000	Alright.
10353000	10355000	Next up, Loki.
10356000	10366000	As I go along with what DarkSucker said, yeah, FU having to wake up at midnight, two in the morning, four in the morning, six in the morning.
10369000	10371000	That pays only last several years, don't worry.
10373000	10375000	Hashtag baby problem.
10377000	10378000	Jason.
10379000	10386000	It's funny, I was gonna say, I'm happy, I don't have FUs, but no, I'm gonna third, basically fourth what everybody else has said.
10386000	10389000	I got woken up three times over the course of the morning this morning.
10389000	10393000	One, time zone conflict, and just the fact that I like sleeping in.
10393000	10398000	I got woken up a lot today, and it kind of pissed me off, but whatever, I'm here, I managed, whatever.
10398000	10402000	Yeah, sleep is wonderful, FU'd everything that prevents it in any way, shape, or form.
10403000	10408000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.
10408000	10411000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, Loki.
10412000	10421000	Alright, so Steam, you know, trying to be a little bit more legit with their Steam OS, is launching yet another beta.
10421000	10433000	This is Steam Music, and it's gonna be a limited beta, it basically allows you to stream music into your games from stuff that you have on your PC.
10433000	10445000	And just some more features that they're adding in there, probably, I'm guessing at some point, gonna start doing other apps, like Netflix and that kind of stuff.
10445000	10451000	But, it's neat to see how Steam OS is kind of evolving into an actual operating system.
10456000	10463000	How long until you can run Netflix through Steam? Cause that's when it's truly, truly its own system.
10463000	10465000	Yeah, that would be pretty awesome.
10466000	10482000	Not sure, but they're saying that they're, well this is gonna go on through, I guess, mid-January, or I guess they announced this at mid-January that they're gonna be doing some more beta tests for different things.
10482000	10491000	And, not sure when the final Steam OS is supposed to be coming out, or if it'll ever be final, because, you know, a lot of these companies like keeping things in beta forever.
10492000	10498000	So I guess we'll have to find out, but I'm assuming later this year, cause I know some of the Steam boxes were due out, I think, later this year.
10500000	10513000	Alright, it's weird though that this music service is only like your local file, which, you know, is fine, that's like what Playstation 3 and stuff do too, but it's interesting they're not trying to push their own little streaming music service thing.
10513000	10522000	Well, well, that's because Steam has been just integrated into an OS, and now they actually have a way to actually play music.
10522000	10529000	That's a prerequisite to being able to sell you stuff, at least on their own OS that has to have some kind of facility for doing that.
10530000	10531000	Just saying.
10533000	10538000	Alright, fair enough. I do have one more story for you guys, but I forgot to set up the Skype line.
10538000	10542000	Jason, would you be so kind, not to put you on the spot, but would you do the next story?
10543000	10544000	Sorry, Jason.
10544000	10549000	I hope I actually... Go figure, it's the one that I didn't pay too much attention to, so let's see how well we can win this.
10549000	10552000	Live radio, it's super fun. Just fake it, that's what I do.
10552000	10556000	See, the irony here is that I should have just shut my mouth, I should have just...
10556000	10565000	We can take calls! 1-8-7-7-Game-O-L-R, username on Skype is OrangeLunchRadio, and I would have like looked at Rob, I think we're missing the prerequisite.
10565000	10571000	That's alright, young padawan, you're still learning, you've been doing this for a few months, we've been doing it for twelve years, you'll learn to fake it like me someday.
10572000	10575000	Sometimes I do feel like that.
10576000	10583000	So this article, I'm just gonna apologize right now, this is literally one article that I did not read at all in this list.
10583000	10588000	Disney Infinity sequel could feature Marvel and Star Wars characters.
10588000	10595000	Disney Interactive Studios may be planning the sequel to the hit title Disney Infinity, which could feature a Marvel superhero and Star Wars characters.
10595000	10604000	According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, which is the biggest credible source for all of the gaming news, they get it right with media, I don't know why I'm being snarky about that.
10604000	10620000	Disney has posted a job listing for a games tester at Avalanche Software, which is giving weight to the sequel, and it is also listing requirements for familiarity with the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Wii U, obviously the whole swath.
10621000	10636000	There has been no official confirmation from Disney Interactive, the leaks are coming just as the corporation is due to post their quarterly financial results, and will be laying off several hundred people according to said results.
10637000	10642000	Yeah, I actually asked them that very question, whether they were gonna do Star Wars characters.
10642000	10648000	It was even before that launch when we had like a conference call with them, and they said it was something they were working on, so.
10648000	10665000	I mean, why not? With all of these franchises under their wing, and the ramp up that they're trying to do, why would you not put these properties in something, like, like, like, granted it wasn't a Nintendo title, but um, uh, frickin' Kingdom Hearts?
10665000	10676000	Why, with the success that that has truly brought, why would you not rely on all of your properties to bring them together and make something far better than we've seen so far?
10676000	10690000	Yeah, absolutely, they're going to. I mean, they've made a ton of money off of it, so I'm interested to see if they do a sequel to the game this year. I think they are, because they're almost out of DLC, well, not DLC, but characters.
10690000	10696000	They're almost out of characters, I think April is when they finally run out through all the stuff that they had planned.
10698000	10701000	Well, I'm sure E3 will show us a lot this year.
10701000	10703000	Yeah, just a couple months away.
10703000	10714000	Alright, I know there's going to be a sequel. Good job. Alright, let's go ahead, and now we will open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10714000	10722000	Uh, if you'd like to give us a call, and we can talk about whatever you'd like to talk about from tonight's topics, or maybe there's something we missed, I don't know.
10722000	10728000	But, uh, oh, the phone is already ringing, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10728000	10729000	It's Shane.
10729000	10730000	Hey, Shane, what's up?
10730000	10740000	Nothing much. First of all, I'm glad that I was able to get you to love Bravely Default. I am, like, 10 hours into it, almost 11.
10740000	10741000	Congratulations.
10741000	10747000	It's so good. Um, secondly, that raw Steel UT guy, kind of a douche.
10747000	10749000	Why do you say that?
10749000	10759000	I don't know, because me and Extfer had a good time, and then I told Extfer what he started to say about us, because I think Jamie censored it, and we both think it's hilarious.
10759000	10760000	Well, it's-
10760000	10764000	I hope, I hope somebody finds him in an apartment with a needle in his arm.
10764000	10771000	Stop it! That is not- don't say that. Oh my god, I'm gonna have to write an apology email. That's your opinion, not mine.
10771000	10779000	Mhm. Um, and then also, I wanted to answer the frugal question of the week, because it's topical for me this coming weekend.
10779000	10780000	Oh.
10780000	10781000	So, we-
10781000	10782000	Details, please.
10782000	10797000	We, through some, what is the word, compromise, uh, we are going to be playing Slender Man, Slender Man The Arrival, and Amnesia this weekend, for our date stuff. So I think that's gonna be awesome.
10797000	10800000	So, why horror video games?
10800000	10809000	Because, just talking about them gets him really scared. So, that's fantastic. If I can just say the word Slender Man, and he freaks out.
10809000	10813000	It's because it's an excuse to cuddle when you get really scared, huh?
10813000	10815000	Or to laugh really hard.
10815000	10818000	Both valid.
10818000	10822000	I thought you guys were gonna play Final Fantasy 14.
10822000	10825000	One day, maybe.
10825000	10827000	Maybe. Fair enough.
10827000	10829000	Between all the sex.
10829000	10833000	I can't believe you just said that.
10834000	10837000	Well, checking on the video is hilarious.
10837000	10840000	This week and last, we learned the difference between Shane's filter and Rob's filter.
10840000	10842000	Is he listening?
10842000	10843000	No.
10843000	10846000	Oh, okay. Well, we'll be sure to send him a copy of the recording.
10846000	10848000	Um, um, well, how-
10848000	10850000	Which recording are you talking about, Rob?
10850000	10852000	How was your trip back, by the way?
10852000	10854000	It was to where? To Kansas?
10854000	10855000	Yeah.
10855000	10862000	Full of snow. Snow out of nowhere. Like, my street I live on still hasn't been plowed. It is not fun to drive on.
10863000	10868000	Well, that's what you get for living in Kansas. California misses you. Come back.
10868000	10871000	All right. Goodbye. I guess I'll leave right now.
10871000	10874000	All right. Start walking. Bye.
10874000	10875000	Bye.
10875000	10877000	All right. There's, uh, Shane, everybody.
10877000	10881000	The views and opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect those of Orange Lounge Radio-
10881000	10883000	Why do you have to go and say that?
10883000	10886000	All right. 1877 Game O-L-R.
10886000	10889000	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10890000	10893000	Uh, we got time for about one or two other quick calls here.
10893000	10898000	Uh, I did see some other people trying to get through, so I'm hoping we can get at least one of them here on the air.
10898000	10903000	But there is a little bit of a delay between when I give the information and when people actually hear it.
10903000	10909000	Uh, I should actually pull up Twitter real quick, because I know we had a couple of, uh, Twitter topics.
10909000	10911000	I actually queued up a bunch of topics.
10912000	10918000	All right. Let me, um, I hate Skype on the iPad, by the way.
10918000	10921000	Just, just so you know, I really hate Skype on the iPad.
10921000	10923000	But there we go. Oh, hey, it's another video call. Woohoo!
10923000	10925000	What's up? Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10925000	10928000	Hey, it's Dave. I called in last week. What's going on, guys?
10928000	10930000	Hey, not much. How you doing, Dave?
10930000	10934000	Good, good. And I now see what you guys mean when you're talking about those hand mics.
10934000	10936000	There you go. Right? Now you got a visual to it.
10936000	10939000	Yeah, exactly. Now we can see what Dave looks like. What's up?
10939000	10941000	Not much. How you doing?
10941000	10943000	Pretty good. Pretty good. How about you guys?
10943000	10945000	Good. What's on your mind, buddy?
10945000	10948000	Uh, well, today's actually just kind of a random call.
10948000	10954000	Uh, I got a late birthday present from a friend of mine, so I've got 20 bucks to blow on Steam.
10954000	10957000	And I wanted to know from you guys what you would blow $20 on right now.
10957000	10958000	Typing of the Dead.
10958000	10959000	Drunken Robot Pornography.
10959000	10961000	Uh, Rogue Legacy.
10961000	10962000	FTL.
10962000	10968000	Well, are there things that I don't already own or things that you ought to own that you already have?
10968000	10969000	Things I should own.
10969000	10970000	That's what I thought. Um...
10970000	10971000	Drunken Robot Pornography.
10971000	10975000	Civ V. The entire collection is a lot of fun. I love Civ V.
10975000	10982000	Um, actually, there's also legitimately a part of me that's like, hold on to the money until the summer sale,
10982000	10984000	because you could probably get like four times the games.
10984000	10987000	But that's a long time to wait. It's a very long time to wait.
10987000	10990000	Um, are you pulling up your Steam collection right now?
10990000	10997000	No, I was actually queuing Twitter topics, but it will be interesting to see if Steam also does a spring sale.
10997000	11003000	Or if that was just the fact that what's winter in America, it would be spring in the Eastern Hemisphere.
11003000	11004000	Guacamelee.
11004000	11005000	Whatever.
11005000	11008000	Guacamelee is a game I've been spending an awful lot of time on lately.
11008000	11010000	What kind of games do you like?
11010000	11017000	Um, I mean, I've been searching for probably the last eight months for a good RPG.
11017000	11020000	And Skyrim just didn't do it for me.
11020000	11025000	They've got Baldur's Gate 2 on there, but I'm like, cool, I played that when I was 15.
11025000	11030000	So, are you more like into the Final Fantasy type RPGs?
11030000	11035000	Ish. Ish. I actually just picked up my brother's Bravely Default pre-order today.
11035000	11040000	I was just gonna say, go return your Steam card and put the money towards Bravely Default.
11040000	11045000	See, maybe I'm alone on this one. I had no idea that the game was gonna be that big.
11045000	11049000	I walked into the GameStop and said like, hey, I'm here to pick up this pre-order.
11049000	11054000	And all of the employees in the store kind of collectively just went, oh, thanks.
11054000	11058000	Now people can stop calling us about whether or not we have this game in stock.
11058000	11061000	Because this is literally the last copy in the region.
11061000	11063000	Oh my gosh.
11063000	11064000	Yeah, it was intense.
11064000	11066000	Wow, I didn't know it was gonna be that big of a deal either.
11066000	11070000	Um, let's see, ActDeaf suggests get the Ys games.
11070000	11071000	And yes, the, if you like...
11071000	11072000	Ys.
11072000	11074000	Ys? I always wanted the Ys. E-A-S-E.
11074000	11075000	Ys.
11075000	11077000	Alright, well, um...
11077000	11078000	Trust me.
11078000	11081000	Whatever it is, I think that's a pretty fun series.
11081000	11083000	Although, I don't know, the attacking is a little weird.
11083000	11084000	It takes some getting used to.
11084000	11086000	That's more like a Zelda-esque kind of game.
11086000	11087000	Yeah, bump, bump, bump.
11087000	11088000	This is kind of how it works.
11088000	11089000	You kind of collide.
11089000	11090000	Pump them until they're dead.
11090000	11091000	Yeah, exactly.
11091000	11095000	Let's see, I'm trying to think of like a straight up JRPG style game.
11095000	11098000	I was gonna say, if you're not necessarily so much JRPG,
11098000	11101000	but you're interested in more action RPG, then Borderlands.
11101000	11103000	Ooh, that's a really good one.
11103000	11105000	If you can be okay with the first person shooter element,
11105000	11107000	Borderlands is actually not a bad choice at all.
11107000	11108000	It's a very good meld of the two.
11108000	11110000	The entire Mass Effect series.
11110000	11111000	Good call.
11111000	11115000	Raginator reminds that Final Fantasy VII is a good RPG on Steam,
11115000	11118000	so if you miss the classic somehow, Final Fantasy VII and VIII are there.
11118000	11119000	I don't know why.
11119000	11120000	I didn't think about that.
11120000	11121000	That's still in my queue to be able to play.
11121000	11122000	Right? Exactly.
11122000	11124000	I just thought the same thing.
11124000	11125000	You can skip VIII, though.
11125000	11126000	Um, Alan...
11126000	11129000	Hey, they fixed the crap from the third desk.
11129000	11130000	...shaded every chance I can.
11130000	11132000	Alan Alcomb used to just Hotline Miami.
11132000	11134000	That's not an RPG, but that's a really good game.
11134000	11136000	You can shoot a lot of people and dogs.
11136000	11138000	So, alright.
11138000	11140000	I think we've given you about 25 suggestions.
11140000	11142000	You have. You've given me plenty of suggestions.
11142000	11143000	And that's...
11143000	11148000	And the very last thing is, so I'm still waiting with microphones,
11148000	11151000	trying to figure out how to get you guys set up.
11151000	11153000	Well, it sounds like you might...
11153000	11155000	Which we're very lucky to be in that position.
11155000	11157000	We had our emailer earlier who also was...
11157000	11160000	So maybe like we get one guy to get the stands and one...
11160000	11162000	Because Dave was talking to messages about maybe like a USB
11162000	11164000	that could pick us all up or something, so...
11164000	11166000	And some people to make a down payment on a new house for me
11166000	11167000	so we can build a studio in the backyard.
11167000	11168000	Yeah, right.
11168000	11169000	I'm gonna be...
11169000	11171000	We're trying to switch studios next month.
11171000	11174000	It may or may not happen at this point, but we'll see.
11174000	11177000	It'll be a good chance for us to really think about some of that stuff, so...
11177000	11178000	I really appreciate it.
11178000	11179000	Yeah, I really appreciate it.
11179000	11180000	So, we'll be in touch.
11180000	11181000	But thanks for listening.
11181000	11186000	Also, Dave, sorry not sorry about my voice, how it sounds in your car.
11186000	11189000	No, see, I love his voice.
11189000	11191000	His voice is just so deep and it's so booming.
11191000	11192000	Isn't it?
11192000	11193000	That's why he's the announcer.
11193000	11195000	That's why I got fired.
11195000	11199000	Alright, well, I might be out in LA at the end of the month for a photography project of mine.
11199000	11201000	We are nowhere near LA.
11201000	11203000	Ah, well, I'll be in the same state.
11203000	11204000	Alright, close.
11204000	11205000	But we like Disneyland.
11205000	11206000	We do love Disneyland.
11206000	11207000	We give that recommendation.
11207000	11211000	And I would say this, we want to know, follow up with us what you bought on Steam and what you thought of it.
11211000	11212000	Will do.
11212000	11213000	Alright.
11213000	11214000	Thanks, guys.
11214000	11215000	Take care, buddy.
11215000	11216000	You too, bye.
11216000	11217000	Alright, bye.
11217000	11218000	Alright, can we squeeze in...
11218000	11219000	Oops.
11219000	11220000	That's what I get for not muting it.
11220000	11221000	We need one more squeeze in one more car.
11221000	11222000	Okay, bye.
11222000	11223000	I know you gotta go soon.
11223000	11224000	I do need to go.
11224000	11225000	Alright.
11225000	11228000	Because it's already past a quarter after and I need to be in bed in 40 minutes.
11228000	11229000	That's fine.
11229000	11230000	I understand.
11230000	11233000	Dar Sakura, before you take off, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11233000	11235000	Fuck 6 a.m.
11235000	11236000	No, I'm kidding.
11236000	11238000	I'm grateful to have a job.
11238000	11241000	I love my job working at Lokat.
11241000	11242000	Cool job, Lokat.
11242000	11243000	Cool job, Lokat.
11243000	11245000	You're not kidding about 6 a.m., though.
11245000	11246000	No.
11246000	11247000	Fuck 6 a.m.
11247000	11248000	No, but you know what?
11248000	11250000	It's good because I'll start my regular schedule next week.
11251000	11252000	This is our...
11252000	11253000	We call it nesting.
11253000	11257000	So I'm going to be learning a whole lot and I'm looking forward to getting a start on
11257000	11258000	my career.
11258000	11259000	So she won't be cutting out early every time.
11259000	11261000	This is like the last time for a little bit.
11261000	11262000	For a little bit.
11262000	11264000	And hopefully I'll be able to keep on with late schedules.
11264000	11265000	Alright.
11265000	11266000	Sounds good.
11266000	11267000	Alright.
11267000	11268000	Alright.
11268000	11269000	Bye.
11269000	11270000	Bye.
11270000	11271000	Drive safe.
11271000	11273000	Alright, I just saw somebody calling in but Dar Sakura was talking and I didn't want to
11273000	11274000	cut her off with a call.
11274000	11275000	So try again.
11275000	11279000	1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11279000	11282000	San Fran Boy on Twitter, username SFRedHead.
11282000	11284000	Oh, are you on top of the tweets for me?
11284000	11285000	Thank you.
11285000	11286000	Sends us an image from a Tumblr post.
11286000	11291000	WalkingMyHellHound says, if I've learned anything from video games, it is that when you meet
11291000	11294000	enemies, it means that you're going in the right direction.
11294000	11298000	And the re-blogs and quotes and everything talk about, wow, that's incredibly profound.
11298000	11299000	It was.
11299000	11300000	It was a good quote.
11300000	11302000	Alright, we do have that call coming in.
11302000	11303000	So let me get to it.
11303000	11304000	This will be our last call tonight.
11304000	11305000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11305000	11306000	Who's this?
11306000	11307000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
11307000	11308000	Hey, Akdeft.
11309000	11311000	Pretty good, pretty good.
11311000	11318000	I wanted to talk about something, you know, you're already tired of it, but it's something
11318000	11325000	really curious that I saw today while out doing stuff.
11325000	11333000	I saw a copy of FIFA 14 for the Wii, the original Wii.
11333000	11334000	Right.
11334000	11343000	And I was thinking, didn't EA say that they didn't want to make the Wii U version because
11343000	11348000	they didn't have the resources and they didn't want to do it basically?
11348000	11358000	Meanwhile, here in Mexico, I can find FIFA 14 for every console, even old ones like the PS2.
11358000	11363000	The PS2, the PlayStation 2 has a version of FIFA 14.
11363000	11364000	I'm not kidding.
11364000	11368000	I thought PlayStation 2 games were officially done with the, I thought the Final Fantasy
11368000	11370000	11 expansion was last time.
11370000	11374000	Technically, yes, but all they did was just reskin the last year's, well I should say
11374000	11378000	by now it's probably like FIFA 12 and FIFA 11 that they're reskinning, but that's all
11378000	11379000	it is.
11379000	11380000	Same with the Wii version.
11380000	11385000	In fact, they even have a call out now I think on the P, the Vita version.
11385000	11391000	It's like the Legacy Edition or something like that, which is basically just a reskin.
11391000	11395000	Yeah, so Loki is basically saying they just changed the 13 to a 14.
11395000	11396000	That's a fair point.
11396000	11400000	Yeah, that's basically, sorry, that's basically what they did.
11400000	11408000	They have, I took a picture of the box art and yeah, it has a label that says Legacy
11409000	11412000	Edition or Elisiana Legado in Spanish.
11412000	11419000	But, it's something that struck me like curious because they didn't want to make the FIFA
11419000	11424000	14 version for the Wii U, but they did make the other ones.
11424000	11432000	Even though, and especially like Loki said, they just reskinned the previous versions
11432000	11433000	to a new one.
11433000	11434000	Just a roster update.
11434000	11439000	Why didn't they do the same with FIFA 13 on the Wii U?
11439000	11444000	It's something that I'm seriously trying to understand, but I don't know.
11444000	11447000	Well technically they did that way I think with the Wii U version.
11447000	11451000	It was like a, it was a port of something else I think.
11451000	11455000	EA is definitely doing the shots fired type of thing with the Wii U I think.
11455000	11458000	I just, I do a double take at the picture of your box art.
11458000	11459000	I saw you link it in chat there.
11459000	11462000	When it says $799 I'm like, what?
11462000	11465000	Then I have to remember, oh wait, that's not our money.
11465000	11467000	That's a different country's money.
11467000	11469000	Yeah, that's Tesla's.
11469000	11472000	It's just around $60 I think.
11472000	11475000	Yeah, Matt's in chat said $60, yeah.
11475000	11480000	It boils down to the fact that on systems that have already had a FIFA release, the
11480000	11482000	assets already exist, the engine already exists.
11482000	11486000	They may fix bugs, maybe, but they also might not.
11486000	11490000	They might just leave it to, you know, whatever's going to wind up happening.
11490000	11498000	It's trivial to change a game's text and get close enough body models and, you know,
11498000	11501000	put them in place of new talent that may look different.
11501000	11505000	Just pick the right race and get the face close enough and whatever.
11505000	11507000	It's detailed enough as it is already.
11507000	11509000	The Wii U is different from the Wii.
11509000	11515000	It requires different work and it requires additional work to perform.
11515000	11520000	That's, unfortunately, that's their justification and that's where this is coming from.
11520000	11527000	Yeah, I do understand that, but seriously, they're doing the, I still gather the Wii
11527000	11535000	is still selling some games or releasing on a minimal amount, but the PlayStation 2, seriously.
11535000	11540000	They released FIFA 13 and now 14 for the PS2.
11540000	11544000	It's the only game that's getting released on that console.
11544000	11550000	It's something that if they're going to put resources on something, why not the Wii U?
11550000	11552000	It's my question, basically.
11552000	11554000	There's still a lot of PS2s out.
11554000	11557000	There's more PS2s out in circulation than there is Wii U.
11557000	11560000	So it's very true.
11560000	11561000	That's true.
11561000	11569000	It is a strange call, but EA's clearly having a hissy fit with Nintendo, so it is what it is.
11569000	11572000	All right, Act Def, I gotta let you go so we wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.
11572000	11573000	Appreciate it.
11573000	11574000	Thanks for having me.
11574000	11575000	Of course.
11575000	11576000	Anytime, buddy.
11576000	11577000	Take care.
11577000	11578000	All right.
11578000	11579000	There we go.
11579000	11580000	Bye bye.
11580000	11582000	And thank you very much to all those that called tonight.
11582000	11583000	I'm sorry if you didn't get through.
11583000	11590000	We are going to close up the Skype line for now, but try again next week or send us an
11590000	11591000	email.
11591000	11596000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us an email as well.
11596000	11597000	Do we have other tweets?
11597000	11599000	The quick, quick, quick Twitter topics.
11600000	11604000	Tigerclaw sent us into Sony Pictures Entertainment and is negotiating with Seth Gordon to direct
11604000	11610000	Uncharted, the movie all up in the air, of course, but obviously a lot of excitement
11610000	11612000	coming around for that.
11612000	11618000	A protest game puts Russian President Vladimir Putin in gay-friendly Sochi Winter Olympics
11618000	11619000	competition.
11619000	11621000	I'm sure I don't need to go too much into the backstory of this.
11621000	11624000	Russia had a big anti-gay...
11624000	11628000	I don't remember to what extent it was out in the media, but they had a big kerfuffle
11628000	11629000	months ago.
11629000	11633000	Flash forward to Sochi Olympics and it's kind of a big deal.
11633000	11634000	That's related to this.
11634000	11641000	That's also why Google has their, for lack of a better term, pride doodle still in place.
11641000	11644000	I expect it probably will be throughout the entirety of the Olympics.
11644000	11648000	If you actually go to Google.com or use any of the Google apps, you can see it right there
11648000	11649000	front and center.
11649000	11651000	It's very resounding.
11651000	11653000	It's very good of them.
11654000	11660000	And then I already read the Twitter, the Tumblr, rather, the Tumblr post.
11660000	11665000	One other thing that I really, really wanted to get out is that I read an op-ed this morning
11665000	11671000	on IndieGamerChick.com, written by an individual named Kathy, who's apparently been doing this
11671000	11673000	for about two and a half years.
11673000	11676000	And she basically, this article is called The Indie Ego.
11676000	11681000	It's still the most recent one on the site, again, IndieGamerChick.com.
11681000	11687000	And she really breaks down the indie community, how things have been portrayed by the very
11687000	11690000	prominent and vocal members that people may know.
11690000	11693000	Such hate naming names, but let's be completely honest.
11693000	11697000	Team Meat, Jonathan Blow, Phil Fish, i.e.
11697000	11702000	Indie Game the Movie, and a lot of other developers that you just see.
11702000	11705000	Notch, Magnus, Peterson, Peterson?
11705000	11707000	Crap, I forgot his last name.
11707000	11708000	Notch.
11708000	11709000	These...
11709000	11710000	Magnus Pearson.
11710000	11711000	Yeah, there you go.
11711000	11712000	Thank you.
11713000	11720000	She really, really takes the indie mentality, the good side and the bad side, and again,
11720000	11727000	this article named The Indie Ego, really breaks down why you should not be insular
11727000	11732000	and exclusive as an indie, because it does a really big disservice to you.
11732000	11733000	It's a great article.
11733000	11734000	Please go give it a read.
11734000	11736000	It was incredibly well written.
11736000	11738000	Kathy, well done.
11739000	11741000	It came across in a retweet on Twitter.
11741000	11742000	I sat down, I read the whole thing.
11742000	11744000	It was absolutely fantastic.
11745000	11746000	Alright.
11747000	11749000	Is that it for Twitter topics?
11749000	11754000	Not at all related to anything, but a couple of my coworkers have retweeted this thing,
11754000	11756000	San Francisco Emergency Scanner.
11756000	11760000	San Francisco Police Department responding to reports of a homeless man operating a cherry
11760000	11761000	picker on the sidewalk.
11762000	11764000	In the rain and all of the weather that's frick-
11765000	11767000	He just, he needs some cherries.
11767000	11771000	I chuckled, and I was very sad at chuckling, and yeah, I just had to get that out there.
11771000	11776000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us a tweet for next week, but unfortunately
11776000	11778000	Jason will not be here to read it.
11778000	11782000	Before we get to the end of the show here, and I go around and hear everybody's final
11782000	11785000	thought and so forth, I just really want to thank you, Jason, for all you've done for
11785000	11786000	Orange Launch Radio.
11786000	11787000	Absolutely.
11787000	11790000	I mean, God, I'm making it sound like you're leaving, which you are and you aren't.
11790000	11795000	We all know that, but again, we would not have a website if not for Jason.
11795000	11799000	We would not have the YouTube thing if not for Jason, and I know you guys have only really
11799000	11804000	heard him for the past three months, but there's a lot of soul to this show that is thanks
11804000	11808000	to Jason, so I just, I really, really thank you for your efforts to help make O-L-R what
11808000	11809000	it is.
11809000	11811000	It's been a good decade, and it's been even better last year.
11811000	11812000	All right.
11812000	11813000	Amazing.
11813000	11814000	You are welcome back anytime.
11814000	11817000	There's always a chair here for you, even though this studio might not be here.
11817000	11823000	Wherever we are, you can just drive that cherry picker on over and have a seat at the table
11823000	11824000	with us.
11824000	11826000	That's when I drove in here today.
11826000	11828000	Because you won't fly, so you have to drive something.
11828000	11829000	All right.
11829000	11832000	In all seriousness, Jason, thank you, thank you for being here.
11832000	11836000	Anything you want to promote of your own self-worth or what have you before I get your final
11836000	11837000	thought and all that?
11837000	11840000	I'm on Twitter, and I tweet way too much random shit.
11840000	11841000	Sometimes it's meaningful.
11841000	11844000	Once out of every, like, 100 maybe, twitter.com slash VX Jason XV.
11844000	11846000	Easy to find.
11846000	11847000	Say hi.
11847000	11848000	You know, whatever.
11848000	11849000	All right.
11849000	11852000	And you'll still be able to do calls and other things, so it's not the last of Jason.
11852000	11853000	I call.
11853000	11856000	I interject my opinion into the video from time to time.
11856000	11857000	You'll be back in, like, a month.
11857000	11858000	I'm back.
11858000	11859000	Oh, I got snowed in.
11859000	11860000	Sorry.
11860000	11861000	Can I be here for another episode?
11861000	11862000	Yeah.
11862000	11863000	Any time.
11863000	11864000	Any time.
11864000	11865000	It'll be funny.
11865000	11866000	It'll actually be hilarious at this point.
11866000	11867000	We give you this big fanfare goodbye, and then, like, in two weeks, you're back.
11867000	11868000	What's up, guys?
11868000	11872000	You come back before Loki's able to get back.
11872000	11875000	That would be some kind of irony.
11875000	11877000	All right.
11877000	11879000	Last final thought for our listeners tonight?
11879000	11880000	Keep warm.
11880000	11881000	Stay safe.
11881000	11882000	It's been a great three months.
11882000	11884000	I hope everybody else agrees, just in general.
11884000	11885000	Have fun.
11885000	11886000	Enjoy your games.
11886000	11891000	This is a good point for me to always say what I do every week, as much as I'm begging,
11891000	11894000	but for real, we don't ask for any money to do this show.
11894000	11896000	If you like Orange on the Radio, please help spread the word.
11896000	11897000	Help grow our family.
11897000	11899000	Tell a friend or two about the show.
11899000	11904000	A nice review on iTunes or Stitcher goes a real long way, and we just really appreciate it.
11904000	11908000	I know we said a lot about reviews, but no, seriously, because of that culture we're in,
11909000	11913000	those help get the promotion and the exposure, and it goes a long way.
11913000	11919000	Yeah, it helps us stand out amongst all the other corporate-based shows that are out there
11919000	11923000	that have a lot of money and built-in hits to be able to fund that stuff.
11923000	11924000	Thank you very much.
11924000	11925000	I appreciate it.
11925000	11929000	Thank you all for being here and listening and staying with the show all night.
11929000	11931000	Loki, I haven't forgotten about you.
11931000	11935000	I can't wait for you to be back in studio, but again, take all the time you need with the new baby.
11935000	11937000	I'm glad to hear things are going well.
11937000	11940000	Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11940000	11945000	No, I'll try to be working a little bit more on the Minecraft server this week,
11945000	11949000	although we haven't had a lot of people commenting in threads and stuff, but I've been doing a lot of tweaks.
11949000	11955000	I haven't been on in a while, honestly, but I did finish my underground tunnel thing I was building,
11955000	11957000	so I've got to find another project to do.
11957000	11964000	Well, I'm working on, I may test out trying to do, was it Bucket Forge or whatever,
11964000	11971000	it was MCPC Plus or something, and that basically allows you to add Forge mods,
11971000	11976000	which are new graphics and stuff, so it's a little bit more complicated,
11976000	11982000	but you can have totally new mobs, totally new blocks, totally new things that aren't normally in there.
11982000	11985000	So it'll be interesting if I can get that to work.
11985000	11987000	Well, come join us on the VOG Minecraft server.
11987000	11990000	All the details are at vognetwork.com in the forums.
11990000	11992000	Some kind words for Jason as well.
11992000	11995000	I don't know if you saw that in chat, but act-def says,
11995000	11999000	Jason shall not be missed, considering he now does the intro voiceovers.
11999000	12000000	Oh yeah, I missed the most important part.
12000000	12001000	And the outro.
12001000	12002000	And the passphrase.
12002000	12004000	Yeah, and the passphrase for the podcast folks.
12004000	12008000	Ray Genator says, VX JasonXV needs his own VOG show.
12008000	12012000	Well, I hope he will find something he's passionate about and send us a pitch.
12012000	12014000	Ideas. Ideas are a-brewin'.
12014000	12016000	Alright, cook them up. Let them simmer. Let's hear it.
12016000	12017000	Let's hear it.
12017000	12018000	Alright.
12018000	12022000	Loki, we'll see you next week, although it might be via Skype again, but have a good week, okay?
12022000	12023000	Yeah, you too.
12023000	12029000	Alright, and I guess my final thought is, again, I could be dead next week.
12029000	12034000	So, just, oh god, wouldn't that be sick if something really did happen?
12034000	12035000	No.
12035000	12040000	Here's the thing, I'm just, I am stressed like so much right now, but it'll be good.
12040000	12044000	Things will be good, and then there's so much to look forward to this year.
12044000	12051000	There's a lot of great things in store, and yeah, I'm in a happy place, and I hope you guys are all in a happy place as well.
12051000	12054000	Thank you guys all for your support. It means so much.
12054000	12056000	We'll be back here to do it again next week.
