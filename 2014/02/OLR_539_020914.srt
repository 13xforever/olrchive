Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This week, a new challenger has arrived as Amazon enters the gaming arena and they're not coming alone.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Sonic has been rebooted again, but this time exclusively by the West for the West.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We've heard the uproar from the internet, but we'll take your comments on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 539, February 9th, 2014.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you guys over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sup bitches? How you doing? Is that your new tagline? You said that last week too.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I didn't say that last week, I said that week before. I said sup bitches in chat though.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
After 539 episodes, they start to blur together a little bit.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's because you're old. Yeah, a little bit. And I'm older.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, I had that realization. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And I had the realization that I'm getting old listening to last week's Bobby Black Wolf show.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He had a great interview where they were talking about BBS door games.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And they were talking about this whole tech history. And I'm just thinking in the back of my mind, like, I was there dude.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I called all those BBS's too. I played those door games dude.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And it was so weird kind of hearing them talk about it. Like it was like, you know, this was the best.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They described it, one of them, the guest he had was describing it like, well, it was kind of like Facebook but you dial into it.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I just did this thing where it's like, no, I mean, I get it. Like I wasn't, I wasn't like making fun of it or whatever.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But it was just one of those things where I was just like, oh my God, like he's having to explain it.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Because most of the listeners we have are, you know, teenagers and young 20-somethings that literally were too young to remember calling into BBS's.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I'm just thinking like, Rob, you're too old. You're never too old, dang it.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mudds.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh yeah, Mudds were fun too. I got into those in college. Yeah, they are still around.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, no, no, no. It was all about AOL in 1994 and playing Gemstone.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Shoot, somebody had said something about the, oh, there it is. Havoc978 said, old lounge radio.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, that is, that is probably appropriate for tonight.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, speaking of old familiar faces, guess what? A face we've been missing for the past couple of weeks is back with us tonight.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, sadly I'm not there in the face to face, but over Skype still.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right. Loki is still joining us via the Skype line.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And yes, I know, you know, we, part of our whole shtick is that we're all in the same room and we will get back to that soon.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But Loki, obviously, you just, you know, your wife just had the baby, what, two weeks ago at this point.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So there's still, there's still a lot of adjustment going on.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And so it'll be another couple weeks before you're back, right?

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, I wanted to come back this week, but you know, she's still not healed enough to be able to lift the car carrier and the baby at the same time, so.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Fair enough, fair enough.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I have to be here to lift the baby out of the car.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So when we told Loki he needs to take all the time he needs for the baby, we meant it.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So we will take Loki over Skype over no Loki at all.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And he can't see us make faces at him here in studio.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Making a face at Loki right now, say hello everybody to Jay, I'm just kidding, I'm just starting crap.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Say hello everybody to Jason.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sitting in your chair.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How you doing, Jason?

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm doing pretty good.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And you guys, actually, we say welcome back Loki, but this week we actually say goodbye for now, Jason.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I know, it's sad, right?

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's been, it's been a very interesting three and a half months or however long it's been, I can't even remember at this point.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, you've been out, so those of you guys that haven't been following, Jason has been out here for, he was, he was in San Francisco for work for about the past three months.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But you are now going on your way back home to Colorado.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I have to go say hello to the snow.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, I figured.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But I'd say this rain this week is a pretty proper send off.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, we finally got...

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We've been so overcast this week.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Finally got some stinking rain, I'm glad you could see what it looks like when it rains here, because literally the entire time you've been here it has not rained.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's funny, it actually really reminds me of, I realized this on the drive up here, it's crazy to think that my first time coming back to California as an adult was in, for my interview in 2012.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How old was I in 2004?

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What does adulthood count as, 18?

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You know, when I first met you, you were only like 19 or 20.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, so I guess, I guess I was just barely adult for E3.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Take your age now and subtract 10, that was 10 years ago.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Uh, 18, so yeah, just on the cusp.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, no, it was in June, so it was a month before my birthday.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You were 17 when you were here the first time?

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That sounds really strange.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That does sound really strange.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh, no, no, no, I was 18 turning 19.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So anyways, the first time...

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You don't even know your own age?

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's a sign of getting old.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I base it off, I base it for my birthday forward instead of my age backward, even though it literally was 10 years ago, whatever.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So, I was out in California for 2004 for E3 and all the other festivities that happened that week.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I had not been back to California since then, of course, and so 2012 when I come back for my interview, the conditions that it was on the drive today was actually very, very similar.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,000
More intense, more intense, more rain, the entirety of, at least, you know, from San Francisco, from the Bay Area north.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The quick version of the story, because I don't think I've ever told it on the show, is that I don't fly.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So, not anymore, so I came to California via bus.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The bus made it, we had a bunch of trouble getting over the Sierra Nevadas.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We made it into Sacramento and on the way to San Francisco, the window on the door was flapping out of place.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, yeah.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And so we got as far as Vacaville and they were going to turn the bus around and have us just be stuck in Sacramento, at least as far as our final destinations were concerned.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:38,000
My only regret is that since we stopped at a Home Depot to get duct tape and they taped up the window to the door in three places, my only, my only unfortunate coincidence there is that I did not get a picture of it.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because my phone was dying and I was keeping in touch with my now employers that I was going out there for an interview with, and yeah, that was a pretty crazy response.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That was dying for a tweet to corporate.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We will get to video games in just a moment, but since it is a bit of a sentimental show of sorts with Jason saying goodbye for now.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, watch Jason be back for next week's OLR via Skype.

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, I'll be driving this time next week, so not so much.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Syal says, Jason will get snowed in and have to stay. Well, it won't snow here, but maybe up the mountain.

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's not an impossibility either.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That happened to you once.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, yes. It's happened a number of times.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, you are more than welcome to crash and co-host any time. I don't know about the Skype thing because we're actually trying to get away from that.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Babies are a special circumstance, but you are more than welcome to the studio any time.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can always call in towards the end, and of course I will be back for any, for numerous occasions, I hope.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So, Jason always has a place here at the table, and quite a huge compliment here from Tigerclaw.

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If there is enough demand, VX JasonXV should be a recurring co-host on OLR.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'd like that whole, if there is enough demand. No, you know you're always welcome here, so...

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I have interesting ideas, and it's really just a matter of time and also being able to do it regularly, reliably, and correctly.

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes, ideally we would take Jason's very, you know, dulcet tones and have him head up a new show for potentially The Voice Geek Network.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Stop spoiling it, Rob!

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I won't. Stop, I'll stop.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Alright, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic. We gotta take it back to video games here, and we're gonna start off with a whopper.

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And I'm gonna just give this disclaimer in advance. I know some of you guys out there are probably sick to death of hearing about this game.

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But it's very rare when a video game goes all the way to CNN and the national news and makes these types of headlines.

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And we've really gotta get into the what the heck is going on. Dark Soccer, if you wouldn't mind starting us off tonight with a little discussion on a mobile game that's gone insane.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Fappy bird. I mean, flappy bird. I mean, whatever the hell bird that is.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So yeah. And I'm sure everyone already knows, but I don't care. I'm gonna tell you again.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Basically the developer, Dong Nguyen, basically said that he's done no more. He can't take it anymore.

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And so, as of now, flappy bird is off of the iOS store. Off the app store. You can't get it anymore.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And so I got it before it went down, but I'm not gonna play it. I just happened to get it so that I could have it. In case.

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And so you kinda contributed to the problem.

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, but they're not getting any ad revenue off of me.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Fair enough.

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No ad revenue off of this girl.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay, before we get into the why did he stop, let's go back even further because flappy bird isn't a game that just came out last week.

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This game's been out for months and then all of a sudden for some unexplainable reason, I mean this is the going viral on the internet and the truest sense of the word.

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's just people tell other people and so on and this game just catches wildfire. It is everywhere. Literally everywhere.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And why? Flappy bird isn't exactly that great. I mean, but to be fair, to be fair, I've downloaded flappy bird. I've played it.

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It does have that certain addictive quality, that frustrating, just one more. I can go just one more.

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It is that nice little bite sized game that makes for a decent mobile experience.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I see a lot of people razzing the heck out of flappy bird for its possible ripoff ideas and so forth and I'm not gonna try to defend that.

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But I will say this. But it doesn't even really play like Mario.

131
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But anyway, here's the thing. 98% of the things on iTunes and Google Play and all the stuff that's available for mobile phones, 98% of it's garbage.

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Most mobile phone games are garbage. There's very few games that are borderline decent, that are decent gaming experiences.

133
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And I think some of us are getting sick and tired of them trying to shove gaming experiences into the iPhone or the Android devices that aren't working like Final Fantasy 6.

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Stop!

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
At least in the manner that you did it and not like Final Fantasy 4 DS which was, well, not a mobile phone game but done correctly in my opinion.

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So the only games that are really working for me as mobile phone games are little short bite sized games like this, I guess, even though its quality is questionable.

137
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And like social games. I think the DS and the Vita as far as portable gaming go, neither one of them do the social elements particularly well.

138
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I mean they both have their things. DS has street passing that's getting more and more and so forth.

139
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But, you know, neither one has the behemoth that is word with friends or Quiz Up which I think is a fun little trivia app that's pretty dumbly simple.

140
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's not bad. It's like a free little trivia app. It's trivia with friends basically.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You mean like what I go to the pub for?

142
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah. I mean don't take these things seriously. They're mobile phone games. There's very few creme de la creme games.

143
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
For every Infinity Blade, there's a hundred million thousand needles. You know, like rip off types of things or something. You know what I mean?

144
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah. Loki, you're awfully quiet over there. Surely you have an opinion on Flappy Bird and this whole thing.

145
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I just tried it this week just to see what the hell it was and I was like, okay, this is stupid.

146
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And, you know, just hearing about the ad revenue and stuff. I don't know if it's necessarily that people are getting on him.

147
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Because, let me put it this way, even if he takes his game off flying, people are not going to stop bothering this guy.

148
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So that doesn't seem like the reason to me. It's more like, I guess we're going to go the conspiracy theory route that he's getting a cease and desist for some sort of copying of the game.

149
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Or he's just taking it down for the whole sense that people are going to want it more because they can't have it.

150
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And so people will go seek it out in hell with an APK for Android. You can just go download that off the internet. You don't need to have it off of the Google Play Store.

151
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He's still going to collect ad revenue on every single copy that's out there for that. So, I don't know. It's just ridiculous, I think.

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Here's the thing about the whole, the pipes look like they're from Mario Brothers to me. Like, I'm not going to defend it. Like, yes, they look like they're from Mario Brothers.

153
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But, again, on 98% of mobile phone games, something was stolen from something else. And the assets are very heavily inspired by other games.

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's not news. And when a news website, like say a particular favorite gaming blog of mine that starts with a K, goes to write a big article about, did Flappy Bird steal its assets from Super Mario Brothers?

155
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What about the other, they showed another game, there's a Flash game that basically is the very same premise and almost the same, you know, not assets, but like the way they had everything laid out.

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Whether he did or not, like 98% of the mobile phone games do, and I feel like they're just stealing this guy's success for hits. Nothing abnormal for them.

157
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So, Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, Wham! My game is popular. I'm taking my ball and going home.

158
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You know, again, if this was a big corporation like Zynga or something like that that was pulling this stunt, then I'd be like, yeah, it's all for publicity.

159
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But it's not. It's one guy who lives in Vietnam who probably was not expecting this to happen and maybe would even admit that the game is somewhat heavily inspired by all these other games.

160
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I mean, when people go to make games for the first time, they usually make games that are very, very similar to other games like board games, card games, and so on.

161
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Maybe the guy just, I mean, it's not that he probably doesn't like say no to the money, but I imagine his family's probably getting harassed by the media.

162
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Especially there in Vietnam, probably, because, you know, it's probably a pretty big deal that, hey, this guy in your backyard made this game that's all the rage in the U.S. right now.

163
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Like, you know, and what's he going to be able to say about it? There's not a lot to say about it, right? It's a stupidly simple game.

164
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So, I don't know. I don't think, I don't really believe the conspiracy theories. I really think the guy is cracking under pressure, to be honest, for better or for worse.

165
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But again, I mean, you can haze on Flappy Bird all you want, but I just think most of the stuff on the mobile phones are just like it.

166
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So, why are we picking on this even more so because it got popular, you know what I mean? Like, most stuff that's on iTunes is garbage.

167
00:15:47,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If you guys, if anybody thinks, like, the media alone, people that, you know, can find people's personal information, companies that can find people's personal information, they know the name, they look at the individual and get in touch,

168
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,000
that can be bad enough on its own if you're not a particularly public person, just dealing with media in general, locally, internationally, God knows from other fronts.

169
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But if you think that he's overreacting to this, go to Twitter, go to Twitter Search, and search for, I'll give one example, but feel free to substitute your own creative words because they probably all exist.

170
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But in Twitter Search, just plug in the individual's username, dongatory, at D-O-N-G-A-T-O-R-Y, and in this case, add the words, fuck you, and press enter.

171
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And look at all the Twitter search results. I'm not surprised at this amount of vitriol because that's the internet echo chamber at large, but it's kind of completely horrifying. And by kind of, I mean very much.

172
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know what to say. I mean, this is such a weird situation.

173
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's funny because there's so many other details that add to this. Right as we started this topic, apparently people are thinking that they're going to lose the game or it's going to stop working.

174
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's not going to happen. But until iOS compatibility breaks the game, it will still continue to work. I went to my purchased section, I played the game a little bit, I'm terrible at it, whatever, I don't care, I deleted it.

175
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I went back and redownloaded it at the start of the show. I have it again.

176
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Xbox Live, same thing you can do there. Even though they've delisted things like Mortal Kombat trilogy and things like that, you can still download those games if you bought them in the past.

177
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That will not always be the case, and also service shutdowns are a big one, but in terms of this kind of media, it's funny the people that play it and protest and also just hurl these insults at them.

178
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The other weird, sorry, I got train derailed there because I was trying to re-chat at the same time there. Yes, my thought derailed there. Anyway, alright, sorry, live radio.

179
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Dungeon Buster says, imagine the response the guy who came up with Pet Rocks a few decades ago and made millions off of it would get today if Twitter were around.

180
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Ooh, that is a good example. That's a really good analogy. That's a scary good example. That's why I got derailed, I was thinking one thing and then I read that and I was like, oh, that's a good thought.

181
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, Pet Rocks, wow. Yeah, right? I'm already sure they have a Pet Rock app out there for that type of thing. Oh, they have a Chia Pet app, I'm sure.

182
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But yeah, people are really mean on the internet, and you know, another thing I was thinking of is that you could search Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, and put fuck you after it and you'd probably get tons of tweets.

183
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's that whole celebrity culture that we live in. Or in the case of Miley Cyrus offers. But it makes me think, Jimmy Kimmel does this hilarious segment on his show and it's all over YouTube, the whole celebrities reading me tweets.

184
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's great. It's great. And yeah, they actually read the tweets and, you know, they'll respond back. Just depending on who the celebrity is, like, you know, I think there was one with Cate Blanchett, and you know, she's got that, you know, British voice, whatever.

185
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And she reads the tweet and she goes, well, now that's not very nice.

186
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Some of them will find a way to turn it around and make it sound like a compliment. Those are really good.

187
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, it's really funny. So I don't know. I said, but not, not everybody can let it roll off their back like that. Like not everybody's ready for that.

188
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And you know, if this is a pretty simple guy who just coded games in his spare time, whether it was inspired by heavily other stuff or not, he probably just wasn't ready for it.

189
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's funny because it's one of those things where there is one good thing about the game. It reached critical acclaim for everybody to play it.

190
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But everything else, like nitpicking is a thing, but everything else people can complain about.

191
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The concept is stolen from previous games and there's the, the P.O.P.O., I want to say Chinese something or other game from 2010 that people said it was a ripoff of.

192
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The Super Mario Brothers assets ripoff, the extreme, like despite liking the game, people go crazy about the extreme difficulty of it.

193
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So you, you have this one good thing that brings things together well enough for it to take hold, but then everybody finds everything to complain about and it, it, it escalates dramatically.

194
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Well, I guess this is good news because I put your theory to the test and I went to Twitter and I searched for orange lounge radio in quotes and I put sucks and I didn't get anything.

195
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So I'm hoping that just means we're not famous or something.

196
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There's probably just about me.

197
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We just haven't made it yet.

198
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well, it was funny that you mentioned this because, and I responded to him, although I didn't check for an answer, the guy who did Potter Puppet Pals, I'm following him on Tumblr.

199
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And he was, he's posted a whole bunch of really positive messages that he got and he said, yeah, I get a whole lot of, you know, crap from people too, you know, but I guess that's just the side part of being moderately famous on the internet.

200
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And I was like, yeah.

201
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's, you said that under your breath a minute ago, the whole like, well, I'm surprised you didn't see anything about me, but you know, in, in all seriousness, you have taken some heat being a host of the show before, because sometimes...

202
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Because I'm a woman.

203
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Because I'm a woman.

204
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Which, you know, possibly, and you do, you do have strong opinions, which is part of why we have you on the show.

205
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Strong opinions make for good discussions, right? But you take heat sometimes for that. And you had to learn in the beginning to let it roll off your back.

206
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Because in the beginning it was hard, right?

207
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah. It's, it's, and I keep bringing it up because...

208
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Not to put you on the spot, but...

209
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Because I think it's absolutely hilarious now being told on a, what was it? Dig response to, uh, get back in the, in the kitchen and stop talking.

210
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Fuck you.

211
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You just need to have your tongue cut out and never talk again and your fingers cut off and never type again, because that type of behavior is unacceptable.

212
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Your parents should be ashamed of you.

213
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, I mean, let's, that was a dig comment. I mean, that dates it right there.

214
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I know. Yeah. It was like in our second year.

215
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But yeah, but I mean, but in all seriousness, you know, you had to kind of like be able to let that roll off your back and this guy's probably still trying to get used to that too.

216
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So...

217
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yeah. After a while you just don't care. I mean, oh God, I hate to just put it that way, but it's like, if I see anything negative about me now, I'm just like, you don't know who I am. Fuck you.

218
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Uh, and Loki, Loki's...

219
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Who are you?

220
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Loki's got some of it too. Loki gets the heat too. I haven't taken as much, I mean, certainly there's been negative things written about me on the internet.

221
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I, I, I will say this. I get the emails in private. Uh, the I'm going to pray for you emails. I've gotten two of those in the past.

222
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So I'm going to pray for you, but I'm going to pray for an intervention.

223
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So, I mean, we all, and the first time I was kind of like, I was actually kind of flattered because I was like, wow, somebody really took the time out of their day to like put this, like they must, they must really believe in what they're saying.

224
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But then I was just like, Hmm, interesting. And then, you know, delete, you know, like, what can, what can you do? Like, I didn't really want to respond and engage in a dialogue or what have you, but it was just interesting as all so.

225
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah. And, and by, by the way, guys, I don't really give a shit about whoever that asshole was before. I really don't care.

226
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah.

227
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Fucking people.

228
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Black Wolf found an account that I was going to bring up. There is a twitter.com slash OLR sucks.

229
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is there really? There is really.

230
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Get out. It hasn't been updated in three years and it's for a private, uh, religious school.

231
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, I thought it was actually about the damn show.

232
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
No, no, no, no, but I did search. I did, you did orange Laundrio sucks. I did at OLR sucks and a Ronnie Talbot said it.

233
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Our good friend Ronnie from big brother.

234
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh, January 26th. And I quote, he's sending it to your, to yourself and OLR. The thing that the tweet that it matched says they never consider the concept of everyone sucks in the beginning.

235
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
They expect auto awesomeness from the MMO from the MMO a couple of weeks ago.

236
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah. He was thinking about League of Legends.

237
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And also tech 2030 would like to say orange Laundrio sucks.

238
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He just did that cause I opened my big mouth and now we're going to get like five tweets this week to say orange Laundrio sucks. Yeah.

239
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You know what? You know what sucks?

240
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Your attitude sucks.

241
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
No, no, no, no, no. You know what sucks?

242
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What?

243
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Vacuum.

244
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That was like a dad joke.

245
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Um, so as far as flappy bird goes, uh, just to put, to bring this conversation.

246
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Play the game or don't and stop, stop freaking out.

247
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I give it as much clout as any mobile phone game.

248
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And your 53 point high score speaks to that.

249
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Well, you know, if you're going to do something, be good at it. Um, do you think flappy bird will come back?

250
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Jason?

251
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I have no idea. I don't know enough of the detail. I didn't keep up on the news enough to go all pundit on it.

252
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I have no idea. I hope, um, I hope he makes the correct, the right decisions for himself.

253
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And he does, he does what works out best for him. And otherwise I don't know. And I don't care.

254
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Loki, will flappy bird be back?

255
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's never, it's not gone. At least on Android. You can just go download it on the internet.

256
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet.

257
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That's true.

258
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Except for episodes of, uh, being Bobby Brown, which I, I don't know about that.

259
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Um, and my thought is it will absolutely come back in probably a few weeks time.

260
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
He just updated it like two days ago before he had his breakdown. So I, it'll be back.

261
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Here's my response. Why do we care? It's a fucking game.

262
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
There are much bigger things in the world going on to worry about than some guy having an emo fest and taking his game off of the iApp store.

263
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Well, yet here we are with a video game podcast. It is relevant.

264
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But, but, but, I'm talking when you're seeing this shit on CNN, you know, isn't there, aren't there revolts going on in the Ukraine right now?

265
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Don't we have people being abused in Russia right now because of something they were born, you know?

266
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We have bigger things to worry about than CNN reporting on a fucking game.

267
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
They have to pad those 24 hours somehow.

268
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Well, the CNN is just kind of like your grandparents going, hey, look, I found something cool on the internet that you guys have never heard of before.

269
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Unless your grandparents are Southern, then it's all Fox News.

270
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Have you heard of this thing called Twitter? There are celebrities tweeting each other.

271
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm sure like in a decade or so they'll figure out about, you know, they'll find out about Reddit and then, you know, we'll hear stories about that.

272
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's just a little slow and that kind of stuff.

273
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh God, I almost choked at the thought of grandparents on Reddit. That's scary.

274
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That would be hilarious.

275
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,000
My television is for my PlayStation 4. I don't use it for television. Oh, unless, unless RuPaul's Drag Race is on. That's the only thing I watch. I swear.

276
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
All right. Maybe Survivor once in a while.

277
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
For the record, I don't see, you know what? BBC reported on it, so I am gravely disappointed with the BBC.

278
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Your tax dollars at work. All right.

279
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That's BBC. They're not our tax dollars.

280
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Anyhow, let's move on. Let's talk about the games that maybe do deserve a little more attention. The types of games that we have been playing this week.

281
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? What types of video games have you been playing?

282
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I played Final Fantasy 14 a couple of times this week. I actually finished my Summoner, whatever the crap it was.

283
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And I've been playing Animal Crossing and I've been playing with my work computer because that's fun. It's practically a game.

284
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,000
For the record, I no longer, while it's still a cool job, I will be referring to it as low cat land of cubicles and technology.

285
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Because that narrows it down. For all the homestucks. Which is the point, of course. Yes.

286
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah, I was playing a little bit more Zelda. Link Between Worlds. I'm thinking about buying a Triforce necklace. I'm also thinking about getting a Triforce tattoo. In white ink.

287
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So it will glow under a blacklight.

288
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Is that just an inherent thing of tattoo ink or is it a special...

289
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Anything that's white will glow under a blacklight.

290
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh, of course. Disregard.

291
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Is that it for your gaming week? Yes.

292
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?

293
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I actually played a bunch of different stuff. Well, not entirely different stuff, but some different stuff.

294
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Let's see. I actually got to play a little big planet karting.

295
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Because I've had that from Playstation Plus for the longest time and my son was trying to... he wanted to play Mario Kart or something, but I was in the middle of playing Call of Duty at the time.

296
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So I was like, alright, let's see what other games are on here. I'm all, hey, you wanna play this one?

297
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He's like, no, I'll watch you play. So I got to check that out and it's pretty cool.

298
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I like how you can reskin all the weapons and everything. So they have a bunch of Mario Kart maps that actually have Mario Kart weapons.

299
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't know. It's a lot better than I thought it was gonna be. Because I heard ModNation racers have terrible load times and just everything was really buggy and slow.

300
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It actually turned out pretty cool. So I'm kind of digging that.

301
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And then I played Call of Duty 4 because it kind of went back to that. My friends got us all together on Playstation 3 to play that game.

302
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So I've been trying to level up because there's no real easy way to do that because we normally play private games.

303
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So I was doing that and then, what else? A little bit of Minecraft and a little bit of, very little bit of Super Mario Galaxy.

304
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I bust the Wii on and unfortunately my disc for Mario Kart doesn't work anymore because that was what we were originally gonna play.

305
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I was just gonna try to teach Josh how to play that game, but he didn't want to learn. It didn't matter because the disc didn't work.

306
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That's it. And actually I'm hoping to be able to play it this week. I just bought Jazzpunk, which looks hilarious.

307
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So I'm gonna try that and also have a copy of the Lego Movie Game waiting for me at my work.

308
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So I should be playing that later this week because I saw the movie and it's fucking awesome. It's seriously amazing.

309
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Tons of people have been talking about the movie and I've been hearing a lot of really good reviews about it.

310
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So I'll have to see it at some point. This week is gonna be crazy for me because I have a show this weekend.

311
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But yeah, I want to check that out at some point. And then apparently the game is not half bad for a movie tie-in game anyway.

312
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah, it's supposed to be pretty good. It's done by Traveler Tales and they've done all the Lego games, but this one's supposed to be a lot better because it doesn't really stick to a certain story.

313
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,000
They kind of can do whatever they want. And I gotta say though, the movie, I knew it was gonna be good because I was really excited about the whole thing.

314
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But then, not to spoil anything, at the end it kind of takes a different tone and it's just kind of like, whoa, I was not expecting that.

315
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I had to go play Legos the day after. Seriously, I've been playing Legos this week and that's what I was doing with my son.

316
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Success. Tigerclaw says, Lego movie made a lot of money this weekend. $69 million. Wow, I didn't realize that.

317
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And it's Rotten Tomatoes rating is through the roof. 95 last night.

318
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Well, good for them. It wasn't really on my radar. And it's interesting we bring up the games too because those Lego games, they all do pretty well.

319
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And they're all pretty good. None of them are really great, but they're all good and most people seem satisfied with their purchases.

320
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So it's kind of been a long running game series. It's always kind of been there that a lot of people are playing, not a lot of people are talking about.

321
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
They don't always get critically acclaimed, but it's kind of nice to see that they're still doing a good job with it.

322
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And the other thing, before the movie came out, I was over at Barnes and Noble and they had all the toy sets from the movie. Damn, do I want those toys.

323
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
They had some really crazy sets and all that stuff was in the movie and I was like, oh man.

324
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And you would love, both Rob and Jamie would love Cuckoo Cloudland in there. Seriously, it's almost like straight out of Wreck-It Ralph with the whole...

325
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Well, you're being a super consumer whore, but I don't blame you. I love Legos too, so I have to see the movie at some point. Excellent.

326
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Alright, well, Jason, why don't we go to you and I'll go last.

327
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I wanted to play something else this weekend, this week, other than Forza, last two weeks actually, other than Forza and FIFA, so I bought Peggle 2.

328
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Because that was the only thing in the Xbox One marketplace that looked remotely interesting and what can I say? Well, it's Peggle 2.

329
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:28,000
If you've played Peggle, it's Peggle 2. It's cute. The art style is a little bit more zany, cartoony that kind of throws me off guard.

330
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And I was very, very... I had a shock reflex. So, let me change topics a little bit. I was playing a lot with the extra things of the Xbox One this weekend.

331
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Smart Glass for the Xbox One specifically, SkyDrive and Upload Studio, all of that kind of stuff.

332
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Can I say that I am so glad that the uploads export in MP4 and not WMV and it's kind of crazy how ubiquitous MP4 is everywhere.

333
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So anyways, I took all of my clips that were actually remotely interesting, uploaded them so I can do fancy things with them now, download them, all that kind of stuff.

334
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So, I was playing Peggle and the third level, the third scene, you know, the first is a unicorn whose name I always forget, the second one is a troll under a bridge.

335
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The third level is a winter wonderland with a sasquatch and, or yeti, I forget which one it is, and when you get the extreme fever, when the level wraps up, he turns around and his butt is censored.

336
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I was, I had a shock, it's like, did PopCap really just do that? Oh, it's a bare-ass joke. So, I saw that and I have video of it and I can upload it and it's silly.

337
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
What puts the two in Peggle 2? Because I really don't know, like, what did they change?

338
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The abilities are different, the characters are, the three that I've gotten, two of the three that have been different, the unicorn is still there, but the troll and the sasquatch are new.

339
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Um, the game is still the same formula. Playability-wise, besides power-ups, like I said, there's nothing different to speak of.

340
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I still like the owl, the zen owl best of everybody.

341
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I, yeah, they were all incredibly cute. I loved everything in the version of Peggle that I've played before, rather.

342
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I like that one in which everyone gives you the pinball power.

343
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Um, it's not different. It's very much Peggle. A couple of coworkers and also people that have been visiting the office ask me what I'm playing, what the game is about, whatever it is like that.

344
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And I look at them and I go, you know The Price is Right? Do you remember Plinko? It's basically that. And I think that's a very accurate statement.

345
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's more random and diverse for obvious gaming reasons, but I think it's a pretty good description.

346
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So I've played a lot of that, basically just kind of pick up and go and stop in between doing things, all that kind of stuff.

347
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
While I was exporting the video last night, I went over and played Peggle. Like an hour and a half of it.

348
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I think I've come to the conclusion that my first system... I don't know exactly when I'm gonna get a Wii U.

349
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Again, this is all financially dependent. But I think this generation, I'm gonna get a PS4 before an Xbox One.

350
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Again, as always, this has very much to do more with the library than anything else.

351
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But as it stands right now, there is nothing compelling for me to buy an Xbox One for.

352
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I have already played Dead Rising four times, and to do it a fifth time seems silly and excessive.

353
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Not to mention I'm still very jaded by that demo, like I was talking about before.

354
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And I just, like, whatever. Don't get me wrong, I love Dead Rising, but a fifth time without actually having an investment in it yet.

355
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Not to mention making a literally financial investment to be able to play it. Eh, whatever.

356
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And I was thinking about it, the more and more I thought about it about the last couple of years, I missed a lot of really good shit last generation.

357
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Because my PS3 library is all of five games. I missed Infamous. I missed Prototype. I missed Tomb Raider. I missed Uncharted. I missed Last of Us.

358
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:13,000
My PS3 has been horribly completely neglected, which I will be correcting thanks to PlayStation Plus and the revolving door of excellent games.

359
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But I missed a lot of really good games that I never played whatsoever. Not at friends' houses, not at anything like that.

360
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So this generation, I'm gonna change that. PS4 or Wii U will be my first console of choice probably sometime this year. I have to imagine sometime this year.

361
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Not to mention, I really like the PS4 camera abilities and just Playroom in general. The PS4 camera seems so much better than the Kinect.

362
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Because it has something more tactile and more controllable in the sense of the controller camera. The controller, did they even have a name for that?

363
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The move in the controller? Whatever.

364
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Six axis? Still?

365
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That's probably true.

366
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The thing that does stuff.

367
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:11,000
The glowy light in the back of the controller. The Kinect, I love the voice commands and it'll be interesting to see how the PS4 holds up against the Xbox One in that regard.

368
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But as far as interactivity is concerned, the Kinect control still really sucks.

369
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The other thing, I don't know if, I don't remember if this was a thing in the Xbox console or if you could only do it with games.

370
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But with the original Xbox 360, you could hold your hand in place to select an item. With the Kinect, with the Xbox One, you have to push forward.

371
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's terrible. I don't know what it is, but I cannot do it. And so on some of those smaller pins on the Xbox One's interface, fucking impossible for me.

372
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I don't have the most steady hands in the first place, but the slowness to maintain smooth motion for the icon on screen, I just don't like it.

373
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm horribly inaccurate with it, which has been a complaint against Kinect the whole time.

374
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:05,000
But yeah, it's unfortunate because I love what they, everything else that Microsoft has been doing, the fact that they have good online communities looks fun.

375
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But I missed a really good library in Sony, and so I think I'll change that this year.

376
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I think Xbox One's library is going to be very compelling at the end of the year.

377
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Absolutely.

378
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's going to be very interesting to see what it has versus Sony, but yeah. Right now I'm totally happy with my PlayStation 4.

379
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Xbox One will come eventually, especially if they get some of those games out this year.

380
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
If it's true, some of the rumors we were talking about last week with Forza Horizon, that'll sell me a console right there, and Halo 2 Anniversary would be great.

381
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Quantum Break looks great.

382
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
A lot of it is more a reflection of the fact that my game plane really took a nosedive over the last five years.

383
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And so that's more, not that aspect of it, I'm not knocking one system or another, but I think there is already enough on the PlayStation 4 now to get started.

384
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And there will continue to be as will happen with any console.

385
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But, just saying, that's the direction right now that I'm leaning on, and if I can swing it in a couple of months, that's more than likely going to be my choice.

386
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Alright, well anything else for your gaming week this week?

387
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I did play Flappy Bird, I got 15 or 16 I want to say. I deleted it, I don't give a shit.

388
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Alright, fair enough.

389
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay, my gaming week has been almost predominantly one game. I did do a few other games together.

390
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Final Fantasy XIV!

391
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Well, that's a given. That's every week.

392
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I did watch Extifer play a little bit of Outlast, which is on PlayStation 4, so I got to see a little bit of that, because I haven't played it in Steam, but I haven't played a whole, whole lot.

393
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And I definitely was having that whole, like I hear my mom in the back of my head,

394
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Rob, that is gross! Why are those corpses hanging? That is disgusting!

395
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Please tell me that you marked it for download, at least, on PlayStation Plus.

396
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Oh yeah, I already have it on my PlayStation 4, I just, I keep looking at it going, should I play it?

397
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And then I go, no, I'm going to play more Tomb Raider.

398
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And despite, as we've said a number of times now, despite not having a PlayStation 4, if you have a PlayStation Plus account, buy those games from the website, so you have them as soon as you have the system.

399
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And Alan has trolled me at least three times this week, he goes, so, you should go play the scary game, and you should stream it for your people.

400
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yes.

401
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And I'm like, no.

402
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yes! Do it!

403
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
When I finally get a stinking camera, maybe, but those things are still hard to find.

404
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
October 31st, maybe? Anyway.

405
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Maybe. Here's the thing, here's the thing, I would love to play more Outlast and Tomb Raider and all that stuff, but my life has been consumed with a particular title on the 3DS this week.

406
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And, of course, this is Shane's fault, because y'all know he was here visiting last week, and Shane has this ability to really sell you on a video game.

407
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
He's really, I don't know why-

408
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
He's like, I'm even trying.

409
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I don't know why he isn't like a video game salesman for like a major company trying to, well, in a way he kind of is, but he needs to be like even higher up in that.

410
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
He needs to be selling like the big stuff towards, you know, big chains and stuff, because he's really good at selling that stuff.

411
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So, anyway, the game he convinced me to get the demo for was a game called Bravely Default, which is on the 3DS, and I know there's been a lot of chatter about the game this week.

412
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And, like, you know, Shane, one of my closest friends, first time I'd seen him in three years, he was here on the show Sunday, and then Monday, what do we do?

413
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
We sat here and we just played the Bravely Default demo in the same room for like most of the day.

414
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I sunk five hours into the demo, and then the game itself was released on Friday, so I realized after a couple hours of the demo that I was going to buy this game, so I bought it so it would be delivered by Friday.

415
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And since Friday to now, I've already sunk eight hours into the game, which might not sound like a lot, but for somebody who has like gamer ADD as bad as I do and everything else that I have going on,

416
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,000
pretty much every moment that I haven't been doing something for the show next week or what have you, I've been playing Stink and Bravely Default.

417
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,000
If you don't know what the game is, it's basically the Final Fantasy 3DS remake.

418
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I mean, the art style is very similar, this one has all the voice acting though, but it is a classic Final Fantasy game.

419
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:25,000
If people are pissed at the direction Final Fantasy has been taking with XIII and some of the more recent titles, then maybe this is the game that they really want, because this game takes a lot of its nods from a classic Final Fantasy game.

420
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Now obviously it's not Final Fantasy Bravely Default, it is a new series that Square Enix is trying, but they've come out and pretty much said this was originally going to be a sequel to the Warriors of Light, the original DS title.

421
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
You know, we're doing some different things with it. I mean, the only thing, you know, it's not chocobos and mogs, it's some different stuff.

422
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:53,000
A lot of the jobs are very similar, the job system is straight out of Final Fantasy V, so why do I like this game so much if I kind of have this whole been there, done that attitude about it?

423
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Because there's something very familiar yet inviting about the game, where yes, it's an all new story, but it feels kind of like I'm picking up this favorite TV series that was on 20 years ago that hasn't really been on in a very long time.

424
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's like, oh, they're out with a new season, and it's a little bit different, or it's a spinoff, but it's kind of like that old show that you miss, and that's kind of where I'm at with Bravely Default.

425
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:28,000
They do some interesting things with street passes and friends lists too, which they have this whole little like, rebuild the town, and you can open new shops and things like that.

426
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And you, kind of this very Facebook-y, apply the workers, and you can, you know, and if you street pass people, you get more workers. There's that whole thing in it.

427
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And also, the game does an interesting thing where you can actually send moves to friends. Like, let's say for whatever reason I have a friend who's not leveling a white mage in their party, but I have a white mage in mine.

428
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I could send a protect spell through the internet, and then my friend could actually use it in their game one time. And then if they need it again, I could send it again or whatever.

429
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And you can do street passes and send all those. That was kind of neat. It's something a little different for street passing, and it gives a certain competitive and cooperative element too to playing this game at the same time with your friends.

430
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Like, I have an awful lot of 3DS friends who are playing this game right now, and it makes it kind of fun.

431
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So, yeah, that's all great. Now, I do have to razz the game for at least one thing, and the game is infamous for this, and I know we've talked about it on this show in the past.

432
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:42,000
The game has one, only one, but it's a microtransaction. And it's a microtransaction that some could argue makes it pay to win.

433
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I don't know why this is, well I know why it's in there, because some people are gonna buy it and it's gonna, you know, hey, it's more money in Square Enix's pocket.

434
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And Square Enix has done a lot of questionable things when it comes to microtransactions in the land of mobile lately.

435
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Like that Final Fantasy All, the bravest game from last year, that was utter garbage that came out.

436
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And then there was the, you know, the recent Final Fantasy VI remake that came out that has some questionable art choices in it.

437
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So they're doing some very weird things, and one of the things, what it is, the one microtransaction is, you can buy this thing called a, I think it's a second potion or a second default or something like that.

438
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's a, it's a sleep potion, I don't know what it is, what it's called. But you use it in the middle of battle and you get to do an extra move.

439
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That's kind of like the big thing about it. And it can help you if you have a lot of them, because I think when you spend 99 cents you get three of them.

440
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So you could really turn the tide of a boss battle by using these.

441
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Now it is important to say, you do get these SP points on your own if you leave your DS sleeping, every eight hours you'll get one.

442
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Like a typical Facebook game. But this element is in there, and it, it, I, some people are going to question me for thinking this way, but I don't really care, it's my honest gut.

443
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It puts a tarnish, it puts a little poo smear on the game. I mean literally, it's a little poo smear on what is otherwise a great game.

444
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You kind of look at that and go, that is fucking cheap, that is tacky, that is a tacky ass color they chose for that.

445
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I, I can't help but feel that way. Is that I go, gosh this game is such a great, man I remember those classic Final Fantasy games.

446
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I was, I'm so excited to play another classic Final Fantasy game, but then oh, there's this poo stain of the modern, you know, microtransactions and how that has filth up some of our games.

447
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And so that to me, I didn't like that. But I'm just ignoring it. I'm just pretending it's not there and I'm not, I'm not accessing it. I'm not going to give them my money for that future.

448
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I hope you guys out there won't spend your money on it either, not even to check it out. We have to send the message that JRPGs in America, yes, microtransactions in them, no. Very important.

449
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Bravely Default is not the game we want, but the game we need.

450
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I also just want to say quickly, now I see some folks in the chat, I see actdeft in chat at live.vognetware.com. Bravely Default's demo didn't solve me into the game, therefore I'm going to skip it.

451
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Granted, I need to, oh sorry, oh here it is, Skye, what you're saying about the game that sold you into it is what turned me off of it.

452
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Which is fine, but go check out, the demo is very robust, I will say this, the demo doesn't even scratch the surface of the story and doesn't have any of the voice acting or any of that.

453
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But as far as the mechanics go, it does a pretty good job teaching you the whole Brave and Default mechanics, which in a nutshell, I've talked too long about this game, I'm trying to wrap up.

454
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But Default is like defend, but instead of just defending, you stock up an action point to use later.

455
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So you could defend for two rounds and then unleash three attacks in a certain round.

456
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But sometimes, as you know, you want to defend against big attacks, it's kind of like a battery, that's the whole Brave-Default system.

457
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You can get a sense for how that system works in the demo, and even the Streetpass feature and all that is in the demo.

458
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And the other one last cool thing, I thought that was pretty cool, if you play the demo and there's like seven different unlocks you can get, depending on how far you get, for things that carry over into the regular game.

459
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And it is quite a nice little kick in the pants boost to start the game.

460
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So they are particularly notable, and even if you buy the game before you play the demo, would it still be worth it to play the demo even if you bought the retail game to start with?

461
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Sure. Why not? I think so. All it's going to give you is it's going to give you very basic items that level one characters would have to start, that otherwise you'd just grind to get the money to buy it.

462
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Like it's going to give you a rod and a hat. It's going to give you two potions and a phoenix down.

463
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Those are the types of things your basic Final Fantasy characters get in the beginning, right?

464
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So it's not going to change the tide of the game, but it'll start you off a little better.

465
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It'll bump the bottom line a little bit higher.

466
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Exactly. There you go. That's interesting. I see a lot of comments in chat, not fans. Rama said, played Bravely default demo, thought it sucked.

467
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Tech 2030 says, yeah, I played it too, wasn't feeling it. So not everybody's into it.

468
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I have at least eight friends on 3DS who are playing this right now, which out of my list of 30 people is quite a bit.

469
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So I don't know. If you like the classic Final Fantasy games, at least check out the demo. If it's not up your alley, then more for me.

470
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But yeah, I do hope the game does well enough that they'll want to release more Japanese RPGs in America because I do feel like this is the type of game we keep asking for.

471
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And here it is. And so I really hope that whole micro transaction thing doesn't fuck it all up and then they're going to, people reject the game and then people go,

472
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
oh, well, Americans didn't want the JRPG. It's like, no, we didn't want this other bullshit that you put in there. Anyway.

473
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Um, Loki, do you, have you been following Bravely default at all? Do you have any opinions on this whole thing?

474
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
No, honestly, I mean, it looked like a Final Fantasy game, but other than that, I haven't really followed much of it.

475
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Gotcha. All right. Well, we're going to get into some news stories here real quick. Some housekeeping. Um, I don't have a lot tonight.

476
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Just twitter.com slash O L R and facebook.com slash orange launch radio. If you want to follow us on social media, there's also google.com slash plus orange lounge radio is our, uh, uh, Google plus page, which we'll get to the, uh, question of the week there.

477
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
We do get quite a few responses. So somebody's using Google plus there's at least a handful of people there.

478
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
There's at least three.

479
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,000
That's why I keep giving out the URL. There's somebody's on it. Plus the more Google kind of forces you on it. I think some people just kind of accept, all right, I might as well use this.

480
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
All right. Um, let's get into some gaming news. We've got quite a bit tonight, so let's get into it. Loki.

481
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Okay. So, um, in March we're going to be having the first kind of installment of the Melger solid five series starting with ground zeros.

482
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And, uh, it is coming out at more of a budget price, kind of like, um, you know, 29 99 I think for, uh, the physical copies on, uh, uh, PlayStation three and Xbox three 60 and, uh, 49 99 and Xbox one, um, something like that.

483
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And, uh, the kind of bad thing about it though, aside from, you know, the fact that it's not the full Melger solid five game, it's only two hours long.

484
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And that's if you actually do the standalone, you know, campaign and everything, I guess there's some side stuff you can do, but it doesn't really add a whole ton of extra.

485
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So it's almost like you're paying for like a glorified demo, if you will, and, uh, kind of, um, you know, add insult to injury there.

486
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:51,000
The full game might not even be out this year. In fact, the window right now for, uh, Melger solid five, the Phantom pain is anywhere between October, 2014 through December, 2015.

487
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So I guess maybe, you know, the incentive that, Oh, it's only two hours long as well. It may be the only two hours of the game you get to play this year.

488
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Didn't Gran Turismo five have something like this where before they released the game, there was the whole prologue or whatever that was.

489
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
They do that with Gran Turismo five. And even if you remember, um, like Dead Rising two had that kind of prologue Xbox live arcade game.

490
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yeah, but that was like a $10 game and it was more than two hours, wasn't it?

491
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Uh, it was about two hours.

492
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I was going to say it certainly wasn't longer. It certainly wasn't as much as four. I think I probably finished it close to the same time frame.

493
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But at least it was a lot cheaper. Whereas, you know, you're talking about now it was arcade priced instead of half, three fourths retail price.

494
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I love that whole, it's a budget price at $49 on Xbox one. What?

495
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Nope. It's $10 less than any normal game release. Ooh, that's a, that's a, that's a massive savings right there.

496
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I get that video games carry a bit of a premium for the, you know, type of entertainment they provide.

497
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And like, you know, it wouldn't be out of question to pay $30 for a Blu-ray movie that's only two hours, right? But this is, right? But this is starting to push it.

498
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
That's a funny comparison considering the movies are rarely longer than two hours.

499
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Well, some of them are epics though. Rarely. Rarely. Rarely.

500
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Okay. But anyway, my point is still that, you know, that's a lot of money to drop on a two hour experience.

501
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yes. And it really does feel like this is something to try and boost Konami's bottom line because the game isn't coming out in a particular financial year that they need it to.

502
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So this is just a little like.

503
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Well, and Konami, I mean, they don't really have a whole ton of stuff coming out. I mean, they have Castlevania, Lords of Shadows 2, and I know Phantom Pains, and Ground Zeroes, and Pro Evo is really the only stuff I know on the slate so far aside from, you know, the rumored maybe reboot of Silent Hill or another entry into that.

504
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Konami's kind of lost me with a lot of that stuff too. Like, I used to love Castlevania and now this new one, I forgot. I just don't care. I didn't even really like the last one that was out on PlayStation 3 and stuff.

505
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Talking about the Lords of Shadows.

506
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah, I just don't like the direction those games have ended up going. They're not what they used to be, you know? So it's kind of like I'm just like, eh, don't care. Some people will disagree with me, but that's fine. That's opinion.

507
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I remember when I first saw this article that I thought the swing was from December this year to October next year, which a 10 month swing is pretty bad, but a 15, 14, 15 month swing is a little bit crazier.

508
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It could, it may come out at the end of this year or it could be out sometime in the entirety of next year. Yeah, that's a, that's a real good target date to provide anybody with.

509
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Anybody here planning on dropping the $40 on the Metal Gear Solid 2 hour side story demo-y thing?

510
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I might, to be honest, just because I really do love the Metal Gear series and I need to start playing more than just the core series, even though this is technically part of the core series.

511
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm assuming I have a PS4 by the time it comes out. That's a good milestone to be against. Get a PS4 before any part of Metal Gear Solid 5 drops.

512
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Or rather Phantom Pain, not any part of it. Anyways, I might, or we'll just wait for PlayStation Plus to give it to you in like five months after it comes out.

513
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's exactly where I'm at. I'm gonna wait for the bargain bin or the PlayStation Plus.

514
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
That's the steam sale mentality now, unfortunately.

515
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Well, I mean, well, I'll drop full price. I bought Bravely Default at full price and there's a lot of games I still buy at full price because I want to play them right away, but not this.

516
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Going to the chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, Dartetsuya says,

517
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, I wasn't really feeling it with Lords of Shadow. The 3DS ones seem cool, but the PlayStation 3, 360 ones just seem like a God of War-ish ripoff.

518
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Also, Shadow of the Colossus.

519
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Dungeonbuster says,

520
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Weird that they would do a release like this. It's not like fans wouldn't wait for a complete version of the game to get back into Metal Gear Solid again.

521
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Alan Alchemy says,

522
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:05,000
They need to keep Castlevania on handhelds and keep making clones of Symphony of the Night with slightly new mechanics to each game. If the art style and music keeps with the pedigree, they will sell. Don't give me that Castlevania God of War crap.

523
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Hey, real quick, since I'm about to put him down. Hey, since I normally don't get to see him and, you know, because I'm at the show normally, my son's right here next to me.

524
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I was wondering if you want to say hi. Josh, you want to say hi?

525
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
No.

526
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Hi, Josh.

527
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Say hi.

528
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
What?

529
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
He's tossing his pants up in the air.

530
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
You're a silly boy.

531
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Yeah.

532
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Josh, you're going to have to keep this show going into its 40th year when you're our age.

533
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Are you going to do the radio show with Daddy when you get older?

534
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Can you get older?

535
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
No?

536
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
He'll have to stop being so shy.

537
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Alright, he's being shy.

538
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
That's fine, that's fine. I was shy at that age, too. Alright, let's move on with some more news, Jason.

539
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
That is very strange to think about. A shy Rob.

540
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I know, right?

541
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Scary thought.

542
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
To rigid our participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, police.

543
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Amazon has entered into the gaming arena in a big way rather than just being a retailer and, you know, dealmaker and everything else.

544
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Amazon has acquired Double Helix, which you may know as the people that have most notably, most recently, been working on Killer Instinct for the Xbox One.

545
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It was an intellectual property and talent acquisition, so reportedly all 75 employees will continue working from home base in Orange County, I think it was?

546
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Irvine? Orange County.

547
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:56,000
75 people on staff all will be retained through the transition as Double Helix becomes under the wing of Amazon.

548
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
This has furthered the theory that Amazon is going to expand their hardware division to include a gaming console.

549
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Obviously they already make Kindles, they already make the Kindle Fires more specifically, more interestingly.

550
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But there have been rumors with the fact that Amazon controls its own little Android ecosystem that should they decide to ramp up production of a lower-cost, competitive gaming console,

551
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:41,000
that now they have somebody to presumably guarantee solid first-party titles in addition to being able to take up other retailers, other Android devs that want to sign on to the Amazon App Store and join in the ever-growing ecosystem that Amazon.com entails.

552
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Didn't we have a rumor a few months ago that Amazon was doing an Ouya, basically?

553
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
That Amazon was going to make their own Ouya console, like an Android console?

554
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Probably at some point.

555
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And I think Amazon is looking at, gee, where did Ouya fuck up? Oh yeah, Ouya, like they don't have any games.

556
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So by having their own in-house to make exclusive titles for this device, they're going to guarantee a few more sales.

557
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Plus, you know they're going to throw in some deals for Amazon Prime. They'll have a frickin' thing fly to your house and drop the console on your doorstep.

558
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I mean, there was something last year, maybe late 2012, that long-time subscribers to Amazon Prime just, if they didn't already have a Kindle on their account, would just have a Kindle sent to them.

559
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
So yeah, Amazon's method for getting...

560
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That was weird.

561
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Sorry, we lost Loki for a minute, but he's back. Sorry, Jason.

562
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Amazon's method for making money, they sell everything at cost, and they make their money back in interest by paying vendors back well before license terms, well before payback terms, and accrue the interest from that.

563
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
That's where all of most of their money comes from.

564
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And then everything else, the fact that they're getting into same-day delivery, local delivery for vegetables is obviously a big deal, but as soon as they can be their own courier, get trucks to your house?

565
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Amazon's gonna be a force to be reckoned with.

566
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Or those frickin' drones! Not that I think that's actually gonna happen, because it'll get tied up in government red tape for 20 years.

567
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And power lines, but that's a dumb joke.

568
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But, I mean, that is literally what they're trying to do, is have little aliens drop them at your door. That is their dream.

569
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Absolutely.

570
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And I think most of us are like...

571
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I'm gonna order a car and have them drop a car off.

572
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I think most of us are like, yes please, send the robot army over, I want my video game right now.

573
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I'm... I... I know the amount of abuse, and it's kind of scary to think about the viability in metropolitans, like, oh, I don't know, New York and San Francisco and places with high-rises where navigating it may be a little bit more difficult.

574
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
As if it's hard to avoid a solid object in, you know, a couple hundred feet up, but...

575
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
If they could drive around in the fifth element, they could figure out how to use that airspace.

576
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
That's an apt comparison.

577
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Just go look at future movies where they all drive around, and Star Wars, the planets, come on, they'll figure it out.

578
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Something interesting that I didn't even realize was who Double Helix is actually composed of.

579
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I did not... I forgot that they were born out of SHINee and the Collective, so these are the people that have Earthworm Jim, Sacrifice, MDK, Star Wars Episode III to the extent...

580
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I don't remember how good Episode III was. The prequel Star Wars games were really hit or miss in the various incarnations they had, but there's a lot of talent there.

581
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And, like I've said a couple of times now over the last couple shows, Killer Instinct is fucking amazing!

582
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It is a gorgeous game with detail for four fighting game buffs or not.

583
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:52,000
The game is incredibly attractive and so well built to the extent that I actually understand fighting games.

584
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Terrible at it, but I understand it. There's a lot of talent there, and for Amazon to keep them all on board, anything they want to do to be able to provide a compelling product...

585
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:09,000
This is a good choice. It's gonna be a pretty interesting one to two years to see what Amazon's gonna do with them.

586
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
C. Allen in our chat room says, I for one welcome our robot Amazon overlords.

587
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Let's see, Tech 2030 says, I got a really awesome deal from Amazon using my Amazon Visa and got a Kindle for $30. Did you get paid for that statement? Did I just read a commercial? I think I did.

588
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I always, whenever I buy stuff, I see the $50 gift card thing for applying for an Amazon Visa.

589
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Moving on to less commercially sponsored stories.

590
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I don't know, this is pretty commercially crap.

591
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Well, let's hear it.

592
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:55,000
EA has a free to play game called Dungeon Keeper, and it's very heavy on the transactions. I refuse to call them microtransactions because a transaction is a transaction and everyone drop your damn prefixes.

593
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But now there is new accusation coming out against Electronic Arts saying that they've been manipulating the ratings on the game.

594
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:21,000
But one of the, the guy who's behind the Dungeon Keeper studio, that's EA Mythic, said that basically it's people just remembering the original game with fondness and pulling the whole nostalgia thing.

595
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:34,000
But apparently it's going because of the way the Android works for giving a game less than five.

596
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:44,000
It asks you to leave feedback as a sort of misdirection thing. So that's where that's coming from.

597
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I don't, I actually wouldn't put it past EA for this, but they're still, you don't manipulate a ratings of your game to make it look better because then that just makes you look like crap.

598
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Well, this also goes back to the fact I said earlier that 98% of the stuff that you get on the mobile phone marketplaces are garbage.

599
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And the reason why they're so highly rated is because of stuff like this. Or, you know, they give a little kickback to their five-star reviewers such as an in-game item or a, you know, something to, like a little average, like one game I play actually displays five-star reviews in the game with the names in them.

600
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So it's like you're famous for, you know, for a minute. So it's just, I don't know, like this kind of stuff is ridiculous.

601
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Well, this game was just ridiculous in the first place. I mean, I don't know if you saw like some of the coverage of it, but I mean, it's taking the whole, you know, free-to-play kind of structure and just really exploiting it.

602
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:49,000
For example, you know, to break certain blocks to create dungeons literally takes hours if not days unless you want to pay real money to speed it up.

603
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And I'm just gonna, I'm gonna keep it real here. This EA Mythic, like they did Warhammer Online, which was, that was a cool little MMO, you know, it was, it didn't ultimately end up working out because it just didn't work as a premium game in a very competitive marketplace.

604
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:13,000
But ever since then, EA Mythic's done this and they did Ultima Forever Quest for the Avatar, which was also a mobile phone game that I found to be offensive.

605
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:31,000
As an Ultima fan, I was like, what garbage has this sunk into? Like, sorry, that's just my opinion, you know, as somebody who kind of grew up on the Ultima series on PC, I was like, oh my gosh, Lord British would like take a chainsaw to this if he could, which he's not in the game.

606
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:45,000
What are you talking about, man? Lord British is making fucking crappy Facebook games. Remember the crappy YouTube shit? I had the yard sale thing that I had to play through for that stupid Ready Player One contest? Yeah, that was Lord British. Thank you!

607
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I guess he hasn't fared much better, to be honest. He also made Tabula Rasa, which wasn't a very good MMO either, so I guess things like Ultima and Lord British were best in the 80s, sorry to say.

608
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I do believe the meme is ratings fuckery. John Gruber, Daring Fireball. Wow, Daring Fireball. Way to go, Jason.

609
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Daring Fireball, written by Gruber, had a big stint, and it's still a reasonably perpetual thing about people that will take examples of ratings nag screens and a bunch of other really nonsense stuff in-app and send it to them, and so he's pinned a couple articles about it.

610
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:44,000
It's kind of like the Metacritic argument, that when ratings are everything because it's some aspect of something being quantifiable, people do whatever they can to make it as good as possible, because there is legitimate benefit tied to this kind of stuff, unfortunately.

611
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Hey, I always ask people that enjoy this show to go give it a nice rating on the various websites.

612
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,000
You know, I actually got feedback about that from somebody, that being suggested to rate something a certain way makes them not want to rate it at all.

613
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Well, you say it once, you say it as a part of habit in the closing, you don't browbeat it.

614
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I'm also very transparent in my reason for saying it. I'm just like, you know, we do this show, we don't ask for your money or any of this stuff, we just want you to help spread the word, so either tell a friend or two.

615
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:30,000
That's what I told him. He's like, oh, well, okay. Just some people, I don't know what it is.

616
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,000
There's definitely that whole, no, I don't want to do something because somebody told me to do it. It's not an uncommon reaction.

617
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And the third example was going to be, whenever we talk about things like this, it comes up a second time in the show.

618
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Well, my other thought is, fine, don't do it. I'm not going to cry or I'm not going to come to your house and berate you. If you don't want to do it, don't do it.

619
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But I'm just kind of like, it would mean a lot if you would.

620
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Please.

621
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Alright, anyway, well, it's interesting that this story is out there, because now, I would say it's backfiring, but it's also giving the game publicity.

622
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Because I'm sure there's a lot of people that are like, well, now I just have to see how bad this game is, or now I want to download this game just so I can give it a one-star review.

623
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So, I don't know. I'm sure it's, you know what they say, press is press and still exposure.

624
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Alright, let's move on. Loki?

625
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Well, just to kind of go back to what you were just saying, they were justifying the structure of the game and all the in-app purchases or we'll see all these five-star reviews. People like it.

626
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Yeah. Dungeon Buster, by the way, follows up saying, British is also working on Shroud of the Avatar, a spiritual successor to Ultimo with MMOish stuff.

627
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Oh yes, I remember that Kickstarter. It was, because that's where a lot of those folks are now to fund their games is on Kickstarter.

628
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Well, best of luck. I hope it doesn't suck like this Ultimo game on iPad did.

629
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Yeah. Alright, so Call of Duty, you know, it's been coming out annually every November and so far they've had a few studios kind of juggling development on it with both Infinity Ward and Treyarch kind of putting out the games each year, although it's not necessarily just them.

630
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:27,000
They have other studios working on different aspects including multiplayer and DLC and stuff. And one of those companies is actually Sledgehammer Games, which is now going to be taking up the main development of one of these games each three years now.

631
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:36,000
They're going to have a three-year development cycle instead of, you know, Infinity Ward and Treyarch, it's now going to be Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games and so on and so forth.

632
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Hopefully they'll make them better because they've been kind of, I don't know, they definitely went down this year, I think, with Ghost. A lot of people were disappointed. Black Ops 2 was pretty great.

633
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
To see that they were losing steam, right?

634
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Well, it's just that the Ghost didn't have a really good hook to it. It was just kind of like, okay, something happened and now it's post-apocalyptic, yay!

635
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So I think just putting a little bit more effort into it is going to help in the extra development time. Hopefully it'll polish up the game a bit.

636
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:26,000
It'll be interesting to see what they do because each kind of studio brings a little different type of gameplay into it. You have a lot of the zombie stuff with Treyarch and they did some different things with multiplayer and things.

637
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I don't know, it'll be interesting. I mean, I think that they need to do something to kind of freshen up the series because, especially, you know, going out, they were like the number one franchise each year and now they're not.

638
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And, you know, people are starting to realize it's getting stale. So it'll be interesting to see how next year turns out.

639
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I'm going to say something crazy right now. I have never, ever played a Call of Duty game.

640
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Me either.

641
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Maybe not too crazy, but...

642
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Well, there's a lot of people out there who have never, ever played Dead Rising or Pagle 2 or the things you talk about. I mean, there's just, you know, there's people that don't watch certain movies. There's people that don't read certain books or watch certain TV stations.

643
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It just seems strange to me because there are so many of them and I have literally missed every single one of them.

644
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:30,000
So, there's so many things about the series that I don't know. And some of the things I'm curious about is how coherent, how, like, as a whole product are the games in a particular series?

645
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:38,000
In the original, you know, like, unsubtitled Call of Duty, in the Ghost series, in the Modern Warfare series.

646
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I know Modern Warfare has followed a storyline, but do the other series actually follow a coherent storyline from type to type?

647
01:12:48,000 --> 01:13:00,000
They do. At least I can speak for Modern Warfare, Black Ops, well, Ghost, I don't know because there's only one game in that franchise, but I know those two have had a storyline that's kind of progressed through the whole thing.

648
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
And what's, though, the inter-story relationship between the different types?

649
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Well, as far as the campaign goes, it's literally just the events and the story tie into each other. Like, there's literally a narrative from one game to the next.

650
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Although, you know, with, like, Black Ops 2, it's more of, like, flashbacks and stuff, but there is an actual narrative to it. And Modern Warfare, actually, it was just straight through, like, it was a progressive storyline through the whole series.

651
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It is shocking to me that they could do this coherently enough with three overlapping studios with their own direction, but also, like, you guys know the thing about how Pixar always refers to an old series and a new series in a current movie.

652
01:13:49,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It, that's proof that it can be done, but it's literally, like, the equivalent of name-dropping. You do it once and it's over. For anybody to be, for any studio to be able to do this coherently across multiple years, across multiple franchises, across multiple games, while overlapping things are happening, that's stunning.

653
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
It sounds incredibly interesting, and I should play a game or two because I'm interested in them, but...

654
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I'm not sure on, like, Call of Duty 1, 2, and 3, if those were a World of War even, I guess, might tie into all that stuff. I don't know if those had actually, you know, a coherent storyline between them, but 2 and 3 were good. I don't know if it necessarily has a tie into each other, but they're fun.

655
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Let me ask this ignorant question, too, since I don't really follow the series either.

656
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Since we're all airing out our lack of Call of Duty experience on the show.

657
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Well, here's the thing, is that I understand, you know, they have to do this because the games haven't been selling as well or whatever, and I hear that there's been a lot of competition with the Battlefield series, but my understanding is that Battlefield 4 was kind of ass.

658
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Or at least the, I mean, that's just my understanding. I could be completely off base, but all I see is bitching about how the online is just broken to hell and EA fucked it again and all this stuff.

659
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Did you wind up following DICE? Because that'll, that'll, uh, that'll tilt your mental image of Battlefield 4 quite a bit.

660
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Well, they're also a little bit different. I mean, like I'd say comparing Battlefield and, you know, Call of Duty is kind of like comparing, you know, Forza, or Gran Turismo and Forza Horizon.

661
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I mean, definitely Call of Duty is a lot less realistic and more all about just like kind of scripted action events and stuff like that.

662
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And Battlefield even kind of went that route, but they're also trying to be a little bit more realistic, although you watch any of the gameplay and multiplayer and you're just like, what?

663
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:50,000
You just bail out of an aircraft in air and just kill the other guy with a rocket launcher and then take over the plane that was pursuing you. Yeah, that's not exactly realistic in my book.

664
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:59,000
You know, I don't play a lot of first person shooters, but WhatUpG's comment here in the chat room makes me think of this. WhatUpG says, I am looking forward to Titanfall and I kind of go, me too.

665
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Actually, I really want to play Titanfall and I really want to play Destiny. And those are usually...

666
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Well, Titanfall is pretty much just like Call of Duty, but with Max. I mean, it's literally...

667
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
The gameplay is pretty much... Yeah.

668
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I like Max. I'm on board.

669
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Sign me up. I wasn't interested in your series until you put Max in it. Now I'm here. Yes. Sign me up, please.

670
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I hate it. Remember, they tried that with Battlefield and that didn't turn out too well.

671
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Battlefield 2142.

672
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Let's not talk about that. All right, let's keep it moving. We got more stories to get to here.

673
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Over this week, there was a bit of an interesting kerfuffle because Ubisoft made a request to the government, to the US Patent Office, Patent and Trademark Office, to drop the trademark on Watch Dogs.

674
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:51,000
The message was sent to the USPTO and signed by Yves Guillemont. I probably butchered that because my French, lol.

675
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:02,000
But it was a request for express abandonment that was filed with application serial number 85642398, better known as Watch Dogs, the trademark.

676
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And what I didn't realize was that it actually was passed. Ubisoft lost. They lost by nature of the fact that the trademark for Watch Dogs was ended, was released, was deleted, removed. Pick your word.

677
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:31,000
This was a fraudulent request. I don't know enough about the application process to know if it was a mere spoofed email address, which is really trivially easy to do.

678
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
That's why you get emails from CustomerCare at PayPal.com when it ain't.

679
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Anyways, there was a period of time that Ubisoft still to this moment, Watch Dogs, the Watch Dogs trademark is not active.

680
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:57,000
They responded saying that this was a fraudulent request. They will be reapplying for it. They will invariably get it because this is one of those special circumstances that is absolutely ridiculous.

681
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:08,000
There was various wank about whether they did it wrong and they have to redo it because the logo style for the release cover art has an underscore between the words.

682
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And part of the trademark application is in addition to the terms, you also come up with a mark, a visual representation, and that hadn't been included in the original trademark.

683
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:28,000
But this, I don't know that I can come up with any other example where somebody, you know, usually we hear about patent and trademark challenges and this kind of stuff.

684
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:38,000
But this was that somebody deliberately falsified documents and sent a, you know, certified request to the government to drop somebody's legal property.

685
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:47,000
That's kind of unprecedented. And I'm not sure what to make of this. But Ubisoft will be working with the Patent and Trademark Office to get it back.

686
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Any thoughts on this, guys? Anybody?

687
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I don't even know what else to say. I mean, obviously, I don't want to just repeat what Bobby Blackwolf said. That said, for anybody who's listening to this and hasn't listened to Bobby Blackwolf, please check out vognetwork.com and listen to Bobby's show where he goes into a little bit more detail about this.

688
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Various theories and other things, not to mention the hilarious tie-in for real life imitating art once again.

689
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I, we'll see how this story develops. And that's really all I can say because I just don't, it happened. Everybody was shocked because this is also on the heels of the news two to three weeks ago about the Wii U port being canceled, which apparently they still didn't comment on this time, even with this trademark kerfuffle patent.

690
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Yeah, trademark kerfuffle.

691
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Do you think it could be angry Nintendo fans?

692
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Oh, God. That would be...

693
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
There are some Nintendo fans that are not to be messed with out there. I'll tell you.

694
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Anybody that wants to stand up for a cause, which I think might also be the story of Watch Dogs. Anyways, this is shocking. This is incredibly interesting. And I just, if this is a PR stunt, I don't get it. I get it, but I don't understand it. I understand it, but I don't. Words are really hard to pick correctly to describe what this may actually result in.

695
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
It's an unfathomable action that's logically understood, but not emotionally, perhaps?

696
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Yeah. That's a, that's a good way of putting it.

697
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:39,000
My honest opinion on all this is that this is a whole lot of to do about nothing because I mean, and I get why people are talking about it, but it's one of those, we all know the trademark laws in this country are all screwed up anyway. So why is this such a big deal that this is such a fricking hassle, like surprise.

698
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Because it's everybody saying, look, look, see, this is what we're talking about. This is what we mean. Everything's broken.

699
01:20:44,000 --> 01:21:04,000
People have been faking shit for many, many, many years. It's, it, it will be interesting to see if something else happens as a part of this. I can't imagine it did. I think somebody just straight up fucked with Ubisoft because the news has, people have been pissed at Ubisoft for a lot of things for, you know, at least a year and a half now.

700
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Wii U not withstanding the Rayman situation, not withstanding, um, somebody, somebody tried to hassle them and completed to whatever extent it's actually going to make a lasting impact.

701
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
All right. Uh, let's move on dark soccer and then we'll get to release dates.

702
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Well, just in response to that, fuckery is afoot. That's it. It's all fuckery. But how about something that isn't quite fuckery? There is a game, a classic game, if you will, called Myst.

703
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Who remembers playing Myst?

704
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Me. I remember being pissed off at it and I have a parody of it called P.I.S.T.

705
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I remember the parody too.

706
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yep. Well, anyway, um, it was remade in 1990, actually in 2000, the original was in 1993, sorry. In 2000, it was remade as Real Myst, which was a 3D restoration that you could walk around however you want to.

707
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It was, you know, fully explorable and, um, it got cleaned up for an iOS release and, uh, now the developer, uh, Cyan, um, actually is going to be doing the Real Myst Masterpiece Edition, uh, on PC and Mac via Steam.

708
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:40,000
It's, uh, well, for UK it's, uh, $12.99 and US it's $17.99, um, and if you already own Real Myst, uh, if you already own Real Myst, you get a, uh, discount of 33% and, um, it's going to basically enhance all the models, the textures, the lighting, everything.

709
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
So it's really just a beautiful cleanup of the original.

710
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:52,000
That's a nice way to kind of modernize it for, you know, people that are the age we were when this game first came out.

711
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Do we know Cyan is still responsible for this, aren't they?

712
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Yeah.

713
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:03,000
They're taking on for, you know, a release every couple of years, like they were doing post Myst, post Riven, post everything else.

714
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Uh, it's really interesting that Cyan is taking on as much of this as they are, uh, not to mention their Kickstarter for, uh, Abduction, not Abduction, but Abduction.

715
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,000
They're, they're really ramping up to do a lot of amazing things over the next couple of years.

716
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Well, there's a little note here about the original creators. Robin Miller, um, is now a filmmaker, and, um, Augustus Gladstone is, uh, let's see.

717
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Uh, the Immortal Augustus Gladstone is the movie, I'm sorry, that was just made by Robin Miller, and, uh, Cyan is being run by Rand Miller, who was the other co-creator.

718
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And brother.

719
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Yes.

720
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:51,000
CEO and co-founder of Cyan Worlds, originally near Lucianne, he and brother Robin Miller became famous due to Myst, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

721
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And they did stuff.

722
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yeah.

723
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And stuff happened. The end.

724
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Rageinator in chat says, so Dark Sakura played Myst but got pissed?

725
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I, I didn't really get into it the first time I played it. I've played it since, you know, but...

726
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I played Myst online for a little bit. That game was kind of creepy.

727
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I just got irritated, that's all.

728
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yeah.

729
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
You know, and then I, and then I discovered Phantasmagoria.

730
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Oh yeah.

731
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Which has been a classic game.

732
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
That game was rad.

733
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
That game was creepy as fuck.

734
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Alright. Well, uh, we'll, uh, step away from classic PC games for a minute and talk about what is coming out soon. Maybe classics for a future generation, we'll see.

735
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Uh, Loki, what's coming out in the US this week?

736
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Uh, well this week I'm sure you're anticipating Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

737
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I'm not now because I'm too busy with this fucking Bravely default.

738
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
It'll have to wait.

739
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
But all the costumes, Rob. All the costumes.

740
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I know, I know. We got another one coming up later in the show. I'm sure some of you heard about.

741
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Uh, the Far Cry compilation on PlayStation 3 with, uh, Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3, and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

742
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:06,000
And they just announced, of course, that, you know, the HD Far Cry is supposed to be coming out at some point.

743
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Which, in the European version, they get that for free. So I was like, well, thanks a lot, US.

744
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Um, let's see, uh, Tokidin, The Age of Demons for Vita is gonna be coming out.

745
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
It's supposed to be, like, I think the number one Vita game right now in Japan.

746
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Uh, Danganronpa, Trigger Happy Havoc on the Vita.

747
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:35,000
And, uh, also a re-release of The Witcher 2, Assassin of the Kings, the silver edition.

748
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
That's on 360.

749
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Um, Civ 5, the complete edition on PC.

750
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And that's it.

751
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Alright, well, traveling to Japan, uh, looking at the releases there this week.

752
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Things are pretty quiet on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

753
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
That's probably because of the impending release of the PlayStation 4 on the 22nd.

754
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Uh, but as far as this week goes, there are some things to look forward to on other systems.

755
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Um, such as the PlayStation Vita has Phantom Breaker Battlegrounds in a limited edition.

756
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
That is out this week.

757
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Um, then you go to the Wii U actually has a release this week and it's kind of a big one.

758
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze gets its release in Japan this week.

759
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
So look out for that.

760
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Uh, on the 3DS this week, you get, uh, Magi.

761
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Um, Aratanaru Sekai comes out this week from Bandai Namco.

762
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
That is invariably Magi.

763
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:31,000
As well as, uh, a Resha de Iku 3D comes out this week.

764
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I was looking to see what this Magi game is.

765
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
If it's a, uh, anime game or what.

766
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It looks like, um,

767
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It's an RPG.

768
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah, it looks a little RPG as maybe with some action elements because I see, like, six hits and stuff.

769
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
So, probably another action RPG.

770
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Um, let me quickly look at the PSP because they still get releases once in a while.

771
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Yes, um, Akaya Akashia Ayakashino comes out in regular and limited editions on the PSP this week.

772
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I don't know if, is that a movie release?

773
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
No? Just a very cartoony looking game.

774
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Catboys or Foxboys?

775
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Mm-hmm.

776
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
There you go.

777
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
That's pretty much it for Japanese releases.

778
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
PlayStation 4 is very soon so it's slowing down a little bit before that's out.

779
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Everyone's pissing themselves.

780
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
22nd?

781
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Well, of course, not Nintendo though.

782
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Things are, you know, with Donkey Kong is a pretty big deal, so.

783
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Well, how about, how about the UK?

784
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
How about it?

785
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:29,000
On the 12th of February, there's Far Cry Classic for PC and PS3 and World of Tanks, Xbox 360.

786
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:42,000
And then on the 14th, we have Inazuma 11.3, Team Ogre Attacks, Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII, Loco Cycle for PC, and Tolkien, Age of Demons for Vita.

787
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
That's it.

788
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Alright.

789
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Just a few more stories for you guys.

790
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
And nothing happened there.

791
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Just a few more new stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

792
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
But first, Loki.

793
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Alright, so real quick, Ubisoft, they're doing something kind of unique.

794
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
They have this brand new game that's coming out.

795
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Oh, sorry again.

796
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Uh-oh.

797
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Hi, baby.

798
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Sorry.

799
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
This is, this is why Loki's still at home, guys.

800
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
And now the debut of baby number two.

801
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Okay, what I'm gonna do while Loki takes care of that, I'm gonna go ahead.

802
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
No, no, I'm good, I'm good.

803
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Oh, good, okay.

804
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
We, uh, we plugged them up.

805
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Alright, anyways, um, I'm sorry, Nellie plugged them up.

806
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Uh, anyways, so, um, there's some devs, I guess, they have this game called, uh, Reroll, which is, um, this, I'm not sure if it's actually gonna be like middleware.

807
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:46,000
It's supposed to be in their game, they're using this thing called reality sync, which is basically they're scanning the landscape of Earth.

808
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Um, and they're gonna take that, um, using, I guess, um, these, like, drones, um, to basically create really accurate maps of the world and landscape and stuff.

809
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And then they're actually gonna put it into their game and sync it with, you know, real time environmental data and that kind of stuff.

810
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
So, sounds really cool, and the game itself, I have no clue what it is.

811
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:20,000
But, I mean, that kind of, uh, you know, data that they have in there and, you know, the environments that they kind of were showing off some of the 3D models and stuff were actually pretty cool.

812
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Okay, it's supposed to be a survival action RPG.

813
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:29,000
So basically, like every single other, um, roguelike type game, it sounds like.

814
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Hmm.

815
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,000
But basically letting you play in the entire world, almost.

816
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I'm trying to think if we've seen these types of games before. I feel like we have. Like, the things that try to kind of mix in the reality and so forth.

817
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Maybe not something on the scale that Loki's talking about, but...

818
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I don't think it's ever able to be particularly as up to date as they're trying to do with this.

819
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Um, this blurb, uh, where was it?

820
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:04,000
If it's snowing in Chicago, Reroll's virtual rendition of the Windy City will likewise be blanketed in fluffy white flakes.

821
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Um, certainly nothing. It's one of two things. If we've ever seen this in the past, it's one of two things.

822
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:16,000
One, it's never been up to date and it's never actually taking advantage of true conditions in a region of the world.

823
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Yeah, they can get the weather report, oh, it's snowing right now, and add snow and maybe a thin layer.

824
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,000
It's either not truly as live, as close to live as this will be, or it won't be a game.

825
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:34,000
It'll just be, hey, look at these characters dancing in a particular area that you can point your phone at and use the camera.

826
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Um, this sounds interesting. I wonder why it can't scale because it costs a hell of a lot of money to get those drones in the air and get the data off of them like this.

827
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
And so they will have to fall back to generated conditions based off weather reports.

828
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Um, give it a look as more information becomes available.

829
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. There's really no comments on this article that Loki's talking about, but they are talking about the baby.

830
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Act F says, plugging the baby, there's your next mobile game hit.

831
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And Seattle wants to know, does the baby use standard USB or micro?

832
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I said Thunderbolt. It's faster.

833
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I was down in Cupertino for a work event at Apple, of course.

834
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:27,000
And we went to the Apple company store and all of the adult shirts were normal.

835
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Just Apple logo in the middle.

836
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:37,000
But all of like the onesies and whatnot had cute little words that had cute little sentences inscriptions on them.

837
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And the one that I remember, if I remember the wording correctly was, um, I'm, I'm like, I'm, I'm a Mac mini or I'm Mac compatible and a bunch of silly little stuff like that.

838
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
So the fact that they're making these jokes just kind of amuses me because I literally saw it a week ago.

839
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:00,000
According to Loki's Twitter, he is on the hunt for the next big mobile hit because if the flappy bird guy can do it, Loki can do it, right?

840
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Yeah, I should be able to. I mean, literally it looks like it takes 10 minutes to kind of make something like that.

841
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit more complicated, but it's not that hard.

842
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:20,000
And I mean, even if you give fraction of that, like a 10th of what the guy's making, anything's better than nothing.

843
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:27,000
All right, Loki. Well, we look forward to seeing what zany game you come up with. You have a whole OLR dream game list to start with. All right.

844
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
That's too big. That's too big concept. We need to think stupider.

845
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
All right. Well, plugging the baby. There's a free one for Mac Devs. All right.

846
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Just don't do shake the baby because Apple bans that stuff because it gets banned.

847
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,000
All right. Going to our next story here is a story about Nintendo.

848
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And it's some more comments from Iwata who's been doing a lot of talking lately since a lot of people are questioning if Nintendo is going to be profitable in the future.

849
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:06,000
But anyway, some interesting comments from Satoru Iwata this week saying that the next already talk about the next cycle of what the next console and the next DS are going to look like.

850
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Quote, Last year, Nintendo reorganizes R&D divisions and integrated the handheld device and home console development teams into one division under Mr. Takeda.

851
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Also, as technological advances took place at such a dramatic rate and we were forced to choose the best technologies for video games under cost restriction,

852
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,000
each time we developed a new platform, we always ended up developing a system that was completely different from its predecessor.

853
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
The only exception was when we went from the GameCube to the Wii.

854
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:38,000
In this perspective, while we're only going to be able to start this with the next system, it will become important for us to accurately take advantage of what we have done with the Wii U architecture.

855
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:46,000
It, of course, does not mean we are going to use exactly the same architecture as the Wii U, but we're going to create a system that can absorb the Wii U architecture adequately.

856
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:54,000
When this happens, home consoles and handheld devices will no longer be completely different and they will become like brothers in a family of systems.

857
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Now, why this quote is gaining some traction this week is think back to last week when we had that crazy rumor about that whole fusion thing, which talked about something.

858
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So these these I mean, granted, you can read a person's comments 10 different ways, and especially if you are trying to look to make it fit in the puzzle a certain way, you can do it.

859
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:22,000
But it's just an interesting statement in light of the fusion idea that came up as a rumor last week or the week before.

860
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I don't find this particularly surprising at all, and the one and only reason for that is the Wii U gamepad.

861
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:44,000
It's finally, I say finally despite its limited nature, but it is a portable device for use with a fair amount of functions of the Wii U anywhere in your house.

862
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It's limited to that. You can't, you can't take the gamepad away from the console, what, 300 feet and still be able to do it.

863
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I actually don't know what the range is of that thing.

864
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:05,000
But the fact that they're doing this middle ground where you have something that you can pick up and walk away from your TV with and that they'll take that and their portable knowledge and their console knowledge.

865
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
This isn't that much of a surprise.

866
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Well, and it's also worth noting that the technology in the pocket is getting closer and closer to what's available on the TV.

867
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Like I when I played Bravely Default, I was like, oh, wow, there's like full voice acting in this game.

868
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I didn't realize they crammed all that on carts now.

869
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Are you kidding me? These, these things that, these things that line the table are even better than the 3DS already.

870
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
That's been the case for like four years.

871
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Well, no, no, and no, it was really, it was really one of those things where I was like, oh, yeah, duh, of course technology is there.

872
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
They can fit gigabytes in those cartridges.

873
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And if you think about it, Rob, that really isn't the first game that did that.

874
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:40,000
But I just, it's been so long since I've really sat down with a 3DS game and most of the Nintendo games don't use voice acting.

875
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

876
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,000
So when I kind of was hearing all that, I was like, oh, wow, yeah, they can fit all that in the cartridge now.

877
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Yeah, absolutely.

878
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
So it's just interesting.

879
01:35:49,000 --> 01:36:02,000
The fact that I can have 128 gigs in something that amounts to the size of my fingernail, that's, you know, that's even more capacity than a Blu-ray disc, a double layer for crying out loud.

880
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Now, one other comment from Iwata this week that also is, you know, getting some notice is because it has to do with third parties, which is Nintendo's weak area right now, especially in the US.

881
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
But, you know, Iwata had something to say about it.

882
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And it goes like this, quote, finally, in terms of third party support, while many point out that Nintendo has traditionally been weak in terms of acquiring it, if you consider the Japanese market, it's fair to say that the number one dedicated video game system that Japanese third party publishers are focusing on is Nintendo 3DS.

883
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:43,000
So he sidesteps the Wii U and says, but we do have third party people with DS and talks about, you know, the 3DS has sold 10 million and so on.

884
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Okay, so no real surprise there.

885
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
The 3DS has the support, but he continues.

886
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
As for Wii U, opinions significantly differ among third party publishers.

887
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Software publishers that develop content that has great affinity with audiences that Nintendo has historically been strong with, namely children and families, are still very active supporters of Wii U.

888
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I'm assuming that's a Sega compliment, but anyway.

889
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And their enthusiasm for Wii U can also be seen from the fact that they have even reached out to us to help people upgrade from Wii to Wii U.

890
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:20,000
On the other hand, software publishers are not necessarily keen on making games and genres that have weaker affinity with audiences that Nintendo has not been as strong with.

891
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Where making a huge investment does not guarantee a sufficient return.

892
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:30,000
With regard to Wii U, we first need to create a strong foundation in areas Nintendo excels at and achieve a sufficient sales volume.

893
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:39,000
If we manage to do so, those publishers in the overseas market who are currently not interested in Wii U will be attracted to the Wii U platform as they were to Nintendo 3DS.

894
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
This is going to be our approach in the near future.

895
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
There's those words again.

896
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Software publishers that develop content that has great affinity with audiences that Nintendo has historically been strong with, namely children and families.

897
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Right. And the big budget shooter games don't do as well in Nintendo.

898
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And that's the other half of the statement there is that they don't want to spend all the money to develop for our platform because we don't have those people.

899
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It's literally every argument that we make ever summed up by Iwata himself.

900
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:15,000
It's refreshing at the same time to actually see this.

901
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,000
You made the argument about Nintendo's online communities need to be stronger.

902
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Yes, I agree, but it's never going to happen because children and family.

903
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I was going to say the only reason that they don't have those people on the platform is because they don't have those types of games.

904
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:38,000
So you can't expect someone that's a fan of first person shooters that's going to buy a platform that doesn't have the type of games that they're looking for.

905
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I would love to see Nintendo do something absolutely batshit crazy and make that game.

906
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,000
And thus begins Nintendo's chicken and the egg again. Somebody needs to take the first step and it's a huge investment.

907
01:38:50,000 --> 01:39:01,000
It's a huge risk, but imagine if Nintendo put out Mario Killers on the Wii U, which is a first person shooter starring Mario and Luigi.

908
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I can see more of Mario Paintball or something like that, but do it Call of Duty style.

909
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:16,000
No, that's not the game we need. Mario Paintball is too family friendly. I need blood, guts, gore, and all that stuff.

910
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Obviously I'm being a little silly. Nintendo's not going to make that game. Loki's absolutely right. If they make that game, it's going to be Mario Paintball.

911
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Pikachu fainted.

912
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Exactly. Alright, anyhow, let's go back to a much simpler time. We could talk this topic to death, but let's go back to a much simpler time.

913
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
What do you mean? It's not like we've done that four times in the last month.

914
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I don't want to talk Nintendo anymore. Is that so wrong? There's so much else going on in News this Week.

915
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Alright, let's travel back to a different time. Let's talk about classics for a minute.

916
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Perhaps Nintendo Classic. Perhaps not. Either way, Dark Soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you know, maybe you should consider playing this game.

917
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I already told you what it was. You did? I did. By the way, just real quick before you do this, Seattle does have a good point.

918
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Metroid first person shooter. There was that. And many people say those were like the best GameCube games too.

919
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,000
And F-Zero as well. Alright, I promise no more Nintendo. I'm sorry, Dark Soccer.

920
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:30,000
So the game is Myst, which is a graphic adventure puzzle video game that came out by Cyan, as I said in my last story that I read.

921
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Deja vu. I feel like we've talked about this game already at some point.

922
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
You know what, Rob? What?

923
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It was originally released for Mac OS on September 24th, 1993, and has been ported and reported and ported some more and remade.

924
01:40:48,000 --> 01:41:01,000
We've had releases on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation 3DO, Windows, Atari Jaguar CD, CDi, Amiga, OS, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, iOS, and Nintendo 3DS.

925
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:06,000
So you play as The Stranger, who uses a book to travel to the island of Myst.

926
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And then you find other books, and you basically just follow the clues and beat the game.

927
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:21,000
It was really kind of a weird game, and it's actually really neat of a game. Yes.

928
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:34,000
So basically, it is a first-person wander, and although you click a location on the screen, and it drags you there, or it pulls you around, or certain things happen on the screen.

929
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And then it had a zip feature. Do you remember the zip?

930
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:49,000
What it's saying is that it's an option. Basically, when a lightning bolt cursor appears, you can click and skip frames to another location.

931
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
So it lets you travel quickly, but you miss important items and clues.

932
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Basically, imagine playing Mass Effect 3 in story mode, where you skip all the fighting scenes and you miss stuff.

933
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Which is also something I can't do.

934
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Okay.

935
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Continue.

936
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Okay.

937
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:20,000
So you have to basically search the island, find the linking books to the ages, and each of them are their own little mini-worlds.

938
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:28,000
They're named Solenitic, Stoneship, Mechanical, and Channelwood.

939
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And you basically have to work on these little puzzles through each one, and solve the game.

940
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:40,000
So it started development in 1991, and as I said, it came out on Mac OS.

941
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So people who say there aren't games on Mac, shut up. It came out on this first.

942
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:55,000
And basically, their whole point is that they wanted to have a very detailed environment, but with a basic terrain itself.

943
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:01,000
The textures were painted onto color maps, and so it was the point that they were using the textures to add the depth.

944
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Of course, now, actually, when it originally came out, it was on the Mac Quadras. Who remembers those?

945
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:16,000
They were modeled and rendered in Stratovision 3D, and also used Macromodel.

946
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
And editing was done in Photoshop 1.

947
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Ooh.

948
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Wow.

949
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Photoshop 1.0.

950
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:32,000
The original version was constructed in HyperCard. Each age was a HyperCard stack.

951
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:42,000
So the game itself really, I think, took advantage of the technology at the time, and really, I think, pushed the envelope for something that came out in 1993.

952
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,000
That was when anyone who was running Windows was still running 3.1 on a 486.

953
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
So that gives you an idea of what the tech of the day was like.

954
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And of course, it has lots of really gorgeous music.

955
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:06,000
It had really ambient sounds in the background. It just was...

956
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,000
And they were also improvising a lot of the sounds so that it would sound more like what you expected it to.

957
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
For example, I like this example here.

958
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:23,000
The noise of fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning.

959
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:31,000
The Chime Clock Tower were used, were simulated using a wrench and lowered in pitch.

960
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Which to me basically is what they do in movies anyway. So I think it was hilarious.

961
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:51,000
The soundtrack was available over mail-in and then Virgin Records got the rights to release the soundtrack which was released on April 21st, 1998 after Riven was out.

962
01:44:51,000 --> 01:45:02,000
It was basically just a really, really great game. It was very popular, which was, as far as I understand, a really surprise popularity.

963
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:07,000
So it did have sequels. It had Riven. They came out on October 29th, 1997.

964
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:17,000
And then Myst III Exile came out on Mac and PC on May 7th, 2001 and was later ported to the PS2 and Xbox.

965
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Exile, however, was not done by Cyan. It was done by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft.

966
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:31,000
So the fourth one was Myst IV Revelation. It came out September 10th, 2004 and was entirely done by Ubisoft.

967
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
With music done by Jack Wall and Peter Gabriel.

968
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:41,000
And then we had Myst V End of Ages that was done by Cyan Worlds and it came out on September 19th, 2005.

969
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:47,000
There were also other games that Cyan developed. There was Uru Ages Beyond Myst that came out in 2003.

970
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,000
And you could customize your avatar and render the graphics in real time.

971
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
However, the multiplayer component was cancelled.

972
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:00,000
But GameTap brought it back as Myst Online Uru Live on February 15th, 2007.

973
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:06,000
And it went through some changes and it actually was shut down after 60 days.

974
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
But it has been since brought back up and it's free to play.

975
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:18,000
We had the different novels. There was the book of Atrus Myst, the book of Tiana, the book of Denis.

976
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
So all kinds of stuff happened.

977
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And it's also stated that Matt Damon wanted the Bourne Conspiracy video game to be like Myst.

978
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Instead of a shooter.

979
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,000
So yeah, there were the remakes.

980
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Now we had the Real Myst Masterpiece Edition that came out in 2000 that had the graphics actually rendered.

981
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:51,000
And then there was the Interactive 3D Edition that was the remake for PC and for Mac.

982
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And then it was a free roaming real time 3D game.

983
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And then now we've got the enhanced version that's going to be running on Unity Engine and has the graphics from the original Myst.

984
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
And that came out on Steam on February 5th.

985
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
We also have, like I said, different console remakes that I mentioned at the beginning of the show.

986
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
It's been on various handhelds.

987
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
So yeah, this game has a super crazy legacy.

988
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
And that's Myst.

989
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
And don't forget about the parody, P.I.S.T.

990
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
AkumaJP in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

991
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
This is the game that all guys my age wanted to play so badly.

992
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Some even buy the Saturn just for this game.

993
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
There were better games to get the Saturn for.

994
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
But here in this area, everybody just kind of had it on PC or Mac.

995
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
So it was just interesting.

996
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
DungeonBuster says,

997
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
This is still during the golden age of adventure games.

998
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,000
LucasArts was still at the height of its powers back then along with Sierra and Legend.

999
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
So yeah, this is definitely some of the gaming.

1000
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
That was a great sentence, but what a downer.

1001
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Well, I kind of truncated another thought he had there just for time.

1002
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Because it is about that time for us to take a break.

1003
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Here it is, your Classic Game of the Week.

1004
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Missed everybody.

1005
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
But now it's break time.

1006
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
We're going to take a quick break.

1007
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
And we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1008
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Including your Fugu Question of the Week.

1009
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Some news on Batman Arkham Origins.

1010
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
And some other games as well, Disney Infinity.

1011
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
And your calls at 1877 Game O.L.R.

1012
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1013
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1014
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1015
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Live on this Sunday evening.

1016
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:38,000
February the 9th of 2014 with episode number 539 of our show.

1017
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Jason's here with us in studio.

1018
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
And sadly we're celebrating, though that doesn't seem like the right word to use.

1019
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,000
His last night for now on the show.

1020
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Before he heads back over to Colorado and so forth.

1021
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
But you're still going to be able to do the YouTubes and all that stuff, right?

1022
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Absolutely.

1023
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
And hopefully more, well.

1024
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
You alright over there?

1025
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Wrong pipe temporarily.

1026
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Happens. Live radio.

1027
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Hopefully minutely more timely just because since I've been out here my nights and everything else are just taken up.

1028
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Mostly by social events because I actually have co-workers in the vicinity out here.

1029
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
And I say more timely but it's still going to be released on Saturday for reasons we've already covered previously.

1030
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
But it would still be nice to have it done early in the week.

1031
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Schedule it for Saturday and then not be like,

1032
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Fuck it's 9 o'clock on Saturday night! I didn't finish this off! I didn't upload it! I need to get it out before Sunday!

1033
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Or at least before the show. I don't need to keep procrastinating.

1034
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
So, you know.

1035
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:49,000
And once I'm at home and I have my stuff, I have my setup, I have my, you know, I have the things that I'm used to.

1036
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I can get back into the groove and be able to just do that.

1037
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
It's a great way to check out the show.

1038
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Especially, you know, like old, excuse me, now I'm getting hiccups.

1039
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Especially like older episodes and like things you might have missed.

1040
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Like I'm sure a lot of you missed the Super Bowl episode last week because you all were, you know, occupied with all that stuff.

1041
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
So, you know, and you made a really hilarious intro and all this stuff.

1042
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,000
So you kind of do, even though, yes, 98% of it is just the show over a static picture.

1043
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
You do kind of do some fun little things with it.

1044
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Make it worth like, I would really envision like somebody wanting to go back and listen to older episodes.

1045
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Like listening on their TV or listening on their Vita.

1046
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
You know, because YouTube is like super accessible to get the file.

1047
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
You know, kind of like and be able to stream it.

1048
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
So that's the nice thing about it.

1049
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
It's really easy as opposed to like having to go download the podcast or having it up in your browser.

1050
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
So, yeah, I would really recommend like just, you know, bring it up on your TV, check it out.

1051
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And I admire Jason's work, what he does do to the show.

1052
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
I add all of the episodes to a playlist.

1053
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
There's an episodes of Orange Lounge Radio playlist.

1054
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:55,000
You can start from 528 and go forward with all ten of them so far.

1055
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Eleven after I finish the show off.

1056
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Chapter'd, you know, I have more things in store and things that I want to be able to do when I have more time.

1057
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,000
More than just the, I don't know, I probably take, I probably take about five hours to do a show.

1058
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Because it's literally listening to the entire show for timing's sake.

1059
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And then also I do things like Skype line callers.

1060
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I grab an icon if available.

1061
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
If we talk about, oh, that looks interesting.

1062
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Sorry podcast listeners, sorry live show listeners.

1063
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:31,000
But, you know, with video I can show what we're talking about.

1064
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
So when we were talking about Prism Drop, when you guys were talking about Prism Drop last week.

1065
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,000
I threw up the iPad screenshots when Jamie was first looking at it.

1066
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Oh, right.

1067
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Well, this is a game picture, okay.

1068
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
And then you said, oh god, the phone pictures.

1069
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
So I take those and started throwing them on.

1070
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Okay, cool.

1071
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
It's expressive and it's really, really interesting.

1072
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
It takes, it's a solid chunk of time.

1073
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
It might even be more than five hours.

1074
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
It's at least three because I re-listen to the entirety of the show.

1075
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
We really appreciate it and although I know there's not a huge audience on YouTube.

1076
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
The nice thing about it, and this is what I told you would probably happen.

1077
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
It's been kind of a slow burn because it's discoverability.

1078
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
And we see that people are accessing the older episodes because they find it through, you know, other things and check out the show.

1079
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
So it works out.

1080
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
It's fun. I'm enjoying it.

1081
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
And more and more I want to do.

1082
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
It's teaching me things I've wanted to learn for a long time.

1083
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:27,000
It's getting my mind running with things that I want to be able to do differently and do better.

1084
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I've gotten a lot of really good suggestions for things that I would love to be able to do regularly.

1085
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Here's hoping for the better.

1086
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
And here's hoping for a better routine, better workflow, and all of the improvements that come with.

1087
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Alright, fair enough.

1088
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Alrighty, we are going to move on with some rapid fire news here.

1089
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Loki, hopefully Loki's back.

1090
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Yeah.

1091
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Hooray! And he can lead us through some rapid fire news.

1092
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Alright, so, you know, Humble Bundles had some pretty good deals lately.

1093
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:12,000
And this, I guess, week or so, they've had the Sid Meier's Bundle, which includes everything from Civ III Complete, Civ IV Complete, Civ V if you pay enough money, and then Ace Patrol, Ace Patrol Pacific Skies, and Railroads.

1094
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:21,000
And so I believe if you beat the average, you can get a Civ V and the Civ V Gods and Kings DLC.

1095
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:28,000
And if you pay more than $15, you get everything plus the Civ V Brave New World DLC.

1096
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
So it's a pretty good deal.

1097
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I haven't bought it yet because my backlog.

1098
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Yeah. You know what though? If you have any remote interest in Civ V at all, you really got to check out this pack.

1099
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I mean, y'all know I love Civilization.

1100
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Just get it for at least Civ IV, which is a really good entry into the series too.

1101
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Civ III, eh, not so much, but Civ IV and Civ V are great.

1102
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Civ III is probably the weakest out of the entire Civ series.

1103
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
And then there's like other stuff too.

1104
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:04,000
But the funny thing is, I was looking at the bundle and I'm like, wow, I own everything in this except for one game already.

1105
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:12,000
But yet I still feel the need to support it because charity and good things and, you know, you want to support that.

1106
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
So I think this is great.

1107
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I'm just worried of how much of a time sink Civ V is going to be.

1108
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Huge. Huge.

1109
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Just have it in your library for a very, very, very rainy day.

1110
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I have a lot of stuff for rainy days.

1111
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
The average in the screenshot was about five and a half bucks.

1112
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:40,000
And right now the average, which again gets you Civ V base and Civ V Gods and Kings DLC, is $9.14.

1113
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
And it runs for the next week or so. It's eight days right now.

1114
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,000
A lot of people are dropping the 15 to get that extra expansion, which, you know, is still worth it for all those games.

1115
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
That expansion's not that old.

1116
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:56,000
15 bucks with a good split for charity and developer, if you so desire, and that's a whole bunch of good stuff.

1117
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
So in other words, you're going to get two rounds in.

1118
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Yeah, right. Just one more turn. One more turn.

1119
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Anyway.

1120
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:10,000
And then this is kind of cool. This was actually a Kickstarter game that definitely passed.

1121
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
And it was a game called 90s Arcade Racer.

1122
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:20,000
And it's based off of, like, you know, Daytona and Super GT and all those games.

1123
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
It's really bright and colorful.

1124
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:29,000
And he says he has it running at 60 frames per second, 720p, for the Wii U.

1125
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,000
And it's supposed to be out later this year.

1126
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Also coming out on Windows, Mac, Linux, and iOS and Android later this year as well.

1127
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
And it's being published this time by Nintendo.

1128
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
The guys do Cave Story.

1129
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Looks sweet.

1130
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I can't wait to see some actual gameplay, though, of it. Like, actual moving gameplay.

1131
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:59,000
And then last but not least, Pinball Arcade are actually looking to develop some original tables for their pinball games,

1132
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
as opposed to all the licensed pinball games.

1133
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,000
And they're actually looking to develop some original tables for their pinball games,

1134
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
as opposed to all the licensed pinball games.

1135
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Some original tables for their pinball games, as opposed to all the licensed stuff.

1136
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,000
And they have a hell of a lot of licensed stuff, that's for sure.

1137
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
It'll be interesting to see what kind of tables they have.

1138
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I'd be more interested to see them adapt some of the custom-made tables,

1139
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
like the Bill Paxton table from Ben Hecker.

1140
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Actually, even his Ghostbusters one he did.

1141
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Or, not Ghostbusters, it's like some sort of ghost-haunting table or something. That'd be pretty cool.

1142
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I'm really bummed out they're having licensing issues with the Addams Family table,

1143
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
because I know they were going after that, and they're running into some licensing issues.

1144
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
It's just...

1145
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Because it was based on a movie, so there's a lot of actors whose pictures are in it.

1146
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Eh, someday.

1147
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:04,000
I like Pinball Arcade, though. It's a fun little way to play some pinball games you remember from years ago,

1148
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
when there's not a lot of tables around.

1149
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Of course, if you're Dark Soccer, you have your favorite tables already.

1150
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:16,000
It would be fucking amazing to develop a digital pinball table that was also holographic.

1151
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:22,000
I thought, at first, when I saw that the Attack from Mars table was in Pinball Arcade,

1152
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I was like, oh, it's that hologram table's in there.

1153
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
No, it's the original Attack from Mars from way back when.

1154
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Oh, lame.

1155
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Yeah, lame.

1156
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
All right, anyway, moving on to some other Nintendo news.

1157
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Nintendo UK has noted that Dr. Mario is one of the games that's headed to the Wii U Virtual Console at some point.

1158
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
They don't say when exactly, but it's just slated for release.

1159
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
What's interesting, though, is that even though it's coming out in Europe,

1160
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
the product description says it's the US version of the game.

1161
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
But I suppose in this day and age, a high definition, where we don't have the different TV specs anymore,

1162
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I don't think that's as big of an issue, but whatevs.

1163
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Dr. Mario, of course, this is an interesting choice because we just had Dr. Luigi not that long ago come out.

1164
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Maybe you forgot, but that was out at the end of last year.

1165
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
I forgot to buy it.

1166
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I did.

1167
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
That reminds me, maybe I should.

1168
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Something else you can do on the Wii U, which, by the way, you can also actually do on the Xbox One,

1169
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,000
or you can do on the PlayStation 4, is you can play browser games, HTML5 games,

1170
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:27,000
lots of them available thanks to a site called Playboxie, which, yeah, I guess this is helping them out with a little bit of a free ad.

1171
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:34,000
But they do have some games you might remember, like Pac-Man and some newer games like Cut the Rope and Doodle Jump.

1172
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:39,000
And they call it Chris Mines, but it's just frickin' Minesweeper.

1173
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
So a lot of clones, a lot of cloney games in there.

1174
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
And you all say Flappy Bird's a ripoff.

1175
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Look at that, Chris. That's just frickin' Minesweeper right there.

1176
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Anyway, you can check that out with Playboxie.com.

1177
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:56,000
And, yeah, it works on all those systems thanks to HTML5.

1178
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I will also note that is Playboxie, P-L-A-Y-B-O-X-I-E.com.

1179
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Thank you. Yes, not the other type of box.

1180
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
What is the other one, porn?

1181
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:12,000
There's Boxie, that's double E, that was a Roku-like, it was a TV-attached box.

1182
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I own one of those.

1183
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Wow.

1184
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Yeah, Boxie with a Y, with a double E, there's a whole bunch of them.

1185
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Playboxie.com.

1186
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
It's funny that we can only just now do that with console browsers.

1187
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I mean, the Xbox 360 didn't even have one.

1188
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
The PS3's was terrible.

1189
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Nice to see that finally exists this time around.

1190
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
And lastly but not leastly, earlier in the show,

1191
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
it was brought up that I'm gonna be really excited about all the costume changes

1192
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
in Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.

1193
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
But I have to admit, my eyes did roll a little bit in the back of my head

1194
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
where I could see my brain a little bit

1195
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
when I saw the commercial for the Lara Croft costume

1196
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
coming to Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.

1197
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Do you wanna see what this looks like, Dark Soccer?

1198
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Have you not seen this?

1199
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:02,000
There's actually like a little preview video out there.

1200
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Well, here's the important question.

1201
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
What?

1202
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Have I bothered?

1203
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Let me show you.

1204
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Because I didn't even finish the first one.

1205
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
You took yours back, remember?

1206
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1207
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Well, you just need to watch the little retrospective that's out there, too.

1208
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Okay, that's actually kinda cute.

1209
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Yeah, it's a little...

1210
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
It doesn't fit the aesthetic of the game.

1211
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Yeah, it's a little weird,

1212
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
like the way she's like carrying the pickaxe and everything.

1213
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Like, her shield even has Tomb Raider written on it,

1214
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
which is kinda funny.

1215
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
But...

1216
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
And then, of course, you can be in that outfit

1217
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
for all the different cut scenes.

1218
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
So there you go.

1219
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:39,000
I wanna see the DLC costume for Hitman,

1220
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
where she's bald.

1221
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,000
But can she swan dive off a cliffside?

1222
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,000
It is interesting seeing that whole little synergy within Square Enix,

1223
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
where they have all those different costumes,

1224
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
but I was just like, okay, whatever.

1225
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I just literally had that ready, whatever.

1226
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Or since, you know, Square Enix also happens to publish Deep Silver titles,

1227
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
we could have her holding a dildo bat.

1228
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Let's pray, let's pray.

1229
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Here's the thing.

1230
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Love Tomb Raider.

1231
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I'm excited about Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.

1232
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I wanna check it out.

1233
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I like the demo, but it's just kinda like the world's colliding.

1234
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I'm just like, no, they can be separate things that I enjoy.

1235
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Separately, separately, and not together for an extra cost.

1236
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
I don't really need that.

1237
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I want the N7 armor.

1238
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
That was in 13, too, yes.

1239
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I know.

1240
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
I need to actually play that.

1241
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I need to play...

1242
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Finish the first one,

1243
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
because someone took it back before I was done with it.

1244
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
You make it sound like I...

1245
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Sorry, I took my game back.

1246
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I'm such an asshole for wanting my borrowed copy of something back

1247
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
so I could play it.

1248
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I was just giving you a hard time.

1249
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Mm-hmm.

1250
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Mm-hmm.

1251
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Especially since I can buy it for three bucks now.

1252
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
That's true.

1253
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
They were all really cheap on PlayStation recently.

1254
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Anyway, what do you have for us, DarkStalker and RapidFireNews?

1255
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
I have a few things.

1256
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Actually, this one's very happy news about Strider.

1257
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
It's supposed to be on PS4 and PS3 on February 18th,

1258
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
and you know we're getting that one.

1259
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
But it's also coming out on Steam, and that makes me super happy.

1260
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,000
And it came out courtesy of Double Helix.

1261
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,000
And also, there's going to be two challenge modes

1262
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
in addition to the main story.

1263
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:23,000
There's Beacon Run that's the sort of hack and slash speed run,

1264
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:27,000
and Survival that sends you harder and harder waves of enemies to beat.

1265
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
And they both have leaderboards.

1266
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
So super excited.

1267
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I love Strider.

1268
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
And then, you know, my husband,

1269
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
for people who have been on the internet for a long time,

1270
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
used to run Neo Strider's Strider Zone.

1271
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Just saying.

1272
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
That was my damn.

1273
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:51,000
So now Assassin's Creed 4 has a Freedom Cry DLC

1274
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
that's supposed to be standalone.

1275
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
However, it is not on Xbox.

1276
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
It's going to be released.

1277
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I mean, is your mic off? They're having a hard time.

1278
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
No, my mic isn't off.

1279
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Phew.

1280
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:10,000
So basically, Freedom Cry is going to be released as a standalone.

1281
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:18,000
So you basically play as Edward Kenway's first mate, Adawale, I guess.

1282
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
I don't know. I didn't play the game.

1283
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
But it's supposed to come out on February 18th in North America

1284
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,000
and February 19th in Europe and worldwide on the 25th for PC.

1285
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Those 18th releases, by the way, are for PS4 and PS3.

1286
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
And Valve.

1287
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Oh, Valve.

1288
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:42,000
There was a lawsuit going on with a law firm, Osborne Clark,

1289
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:47,000
regarding a German court case for Valve not allowing Steam accounts

1290
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:53,000
to be transferred or the ability to sell used games via Steam.

1291
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I refuse to use pre-owned. They're used.

1292
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Sorry.

1293
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:10,000
The German Consumer Advocacy Group, VZBV, sued and then in 2012,

1294
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:16,000
there was ruling from the European opinion

1295
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,000
said that the doctrine of exhaustion was applied to digitally distributed computer software.

1296
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:27,000
They tried again and basically they lost.

1297
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,000
The German courts were like, dude, no.

1298
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
So yeah, they were shut down.

1299
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,000
So Valve wins. Yay, Valve.

1300
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Well, depending on where your thoughts are with the issue,

1301
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
you may not necessarily be saying yay, Valve.

1302
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I like the idea of being able to have to use games digitally,

1303
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,000
but it would encourage me to buy more games digitally.

1304
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I think we've had this discussion before.

1305
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Where's the incentive to go to digital distribution?

1306
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
If the games are cheaper, then that's the incentive.

1307
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Hence why most of us are using Steam are those insane sales.

1308
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
That's why most of us use Steam, not everybody.

1309
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
But that's why a lot of people kind of get sucked into it

1310
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,000
is because they're giving away a game for free or it's like $0.39.

1311
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
That's digital distribution.

1312
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,000
But asking me to pay $60 for something where I don't get that tangible everything,

1313
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I don't really do that.

1314
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
It would be nice if those games I bought digital had a little equity.

1315
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
That would be some incentive.

1316
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Tell me how many collector's editions of MMOs you've purchased digitally.

1317
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Oh, digitally? Collector's editions? Probably zero.

1318
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I bought 14 collector's editions.

1319
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Oh, no, because I didn't even buy Mists of Pandaria.

1320
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
I refused to get the collector's edition. I thought it was dumb.

1321
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000
I got the collector's edition, but I also managed to price match it fries.

1322
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
But I was like, tangible? There's my Final Fantasy XIV over there behind the Hello Kitty bag.

1323
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:53,000
But think about it in that way. There are people who are willing to buy collector's editions

1324
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:56,000
who don't want to have to go to the store and get it.

1325
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
These people are also antisocial, and I know this for sure.

1326
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
No, I'm kidding.

1327
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1328
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:08,000
All right. If that's it for rapid fire news, then let's get to the Google Question of the Week.

1329
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
And every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1330
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,000
You slam those words together, you get FOOGLE.

1331
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Well, not a lot of mention yet tonight of Valentine's Day, but that is a holiday.

1332
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I use that term like holiday with my little quotey fingers.

1333
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
It ain't no bank holiday.

1334
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Yeah, I know, right? But it's a day that a lot of people do things on.

1335
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:43,000
So I thought in the spirit of Valentine's Day, I would ask a very simple question for the FOOGLE Question of the Week this week.

1336
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:49,000
And the question is, what video game do you think would make a really great game to play on a date?

1337
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I'm not going to be able to read all the answers tonight, but I'm going to read some of these, especially some of the shorter ones here.

1338
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I encourage you to read all of the answers on our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

1339
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,000
But for time, I'm only going to read a handful of them.

1340
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Unfolded Raptor says, Flower, nuff said.

1341
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:09,000
That's a nice, that's a nice peaceful game. Would you want to play Flower on a date, Dark Sakura?

1342
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Fuck no, we're going to play Virtual On.

1343
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Nice. Fucking nice.

1344
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,000
I've got twin sticks. Why the fuck not?

1345
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Let's see. Ian, one of our buddies from Koopa Club, says, four swords or any Mario platformers.

1346
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:33,000
I don't know, dude. That new Mario game can get people very competitive, just saying. You might want to watch out for that.

1347
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Let's see. Liam C. replied and said, Outlast, you could be that scared that you're in the other person's arms within minutes.

1348
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Sin, I hope I'm saying that name right. It's S-I-N-H. I think it's Sin T.

1349
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Says, my boyfriend and I have murder dates on Call of Duty, Black Ops 2 or Ghosts.

1350
02:07:54,000 --> 02:08:00,000
He's in St. Louis and I'm in Philadelphia. So for Valentine's Day, we're doing one versus ones on the new maps.

1351
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Those that slay together, stay together.

1352
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Would you go on a murder date with Dan, Dark Sakura?

1353
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I think most of them might already feel that way.

1354
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:16,000
You know, the murder dates usually happen after we've been playing fighting games together.

1355
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:24,000
For the Fallen Dreams replies, it says, Ilo Milo, which is a neat little puzzle-y game that's on PlayStation 3.

1356
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:30,000
You can control it one, but it can also be a co-op game. So that's working together for puzzles.

1357
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Let's see. Strudels89 says, I think any fighting games are a great date game.

1358
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:40,000
My husband and I played Tekken 2 at a movie arcade on our first date.

1359
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Tekken 2, Dark Sakura. That's right up your alley.

1360
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:49,000
When I worked at my job at the arcade, Tekken 3 had just come out.

1361
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
All right. Let's see. And Degenerate Johnny replied and said,

1362
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Normally I would say Mass Effect, but Garrus would probably charm my date away from me.

1363
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Therefore, I would have to say Saints Road the Third or Four.

1364
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Nothing says I'm interesting like a dildo bat to the face.

1365
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
It also gives my date something to look forward to in the sack.

1366
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Dildos?

1367
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
A slow clap for you, sir, for that answer.

1368
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Jason, can you remove your palm from your face for a minute there?

1369
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Let's see. Eddie K says, Considering I met my last girlfriend playing Left 4 Dead on Xbox Live, I'll go for that one.

1370
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:44,000
What? You actually had a success story where you made a positive friendship via Xbox Live?

1371
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
It's not League of Legends.

1372
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Most of my interactions on Xbox Live are negative. Did you buy a lottery ticket after that?

1373
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Keep in mind, Rob, how did Dan and I meet?

1374
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,000
AOL.

1375
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:03,000
That's still different, though. Even the AOL chat rooms of yesterday year weren't as toxic as Xbox Live.

1376
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,000
I would disagree with that in a big way.

1377
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
You didn't hang out in the same chat rooms I did.

1378
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I had Prodigy. I guess we were just smarter.

1379
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I used CompuServe.

1380
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Every so often, we'd just get a flock of us and troll some of the dating rooms.

1381
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Oh, boy. All right. Moving on. Some other answers here.

1382
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Awesome Unicorn replies and says, I'd probably sit the guy down, turn on Catherine, put the controller in his hand, and glare at him until he was finished playing.

1383
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Kidding. Probably something cute and low stress like Kirby's epic yarn.

1384
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Those that troll together roll together?

1385
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Lastly, Xenolith on Facebook says, I think depending on your partner, but any Mario multiplayer game.

1386
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Also, if your date likes to be scared, then survival horror it is.

1387
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Yay.

1388
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
See, that's what I miss Shane being around for.

1389
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:58,000
When we'd get a group of people in the room and say, okay, Shane, play Silent Hill.

1390
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Silent Hill 2.

1391
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Friend date.

1392
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Yeah, friend date. Friend dates are the best dates, I think.

1393
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
All right. We have six answers on Google+. Did you know there's six people?

1394
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
There's six people?

1395
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
All right.

1396
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Shout out to Google+. All right. Again, I can't read all of these because I don't want to be unfair.

1397
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I only read about half the Facebook answers, so I'll read about half of these.

1398
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Colin M says, Portal 2 co-op. It shouldn't take long to find out how compatible you are and how well you two work together.

1399
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:25,000
And how well you can put up with frustrations with each other.

1400
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Wow.

1401
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
No, move. Portal. No, the other one. No, you just lost it.

1402
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Wow.

1403
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Damn it, we have to start over.

1404
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Colin's going all in on that date. Either this is going to work or it's not.

1405
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
This is the true trust test.

1406
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:42,000
This is the test right here. Let's see. Travis H says, LittleBigPlanet.

1407
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Although funny enough, me and my fiance met four years ago and put many hours into heavy rain and got a platinum.

1408
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:54,000
She's been a gamer with me ever since. Since actdeft gave me a haiku, I can't resist.

1409
02:11:54,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Co-op and story. Make for a great gaming date. Kirby Superstar.

1410
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
And no one's surprised.

1411
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
That's a really good answer.

1412
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
That is a good answer.

1413
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:08,000
There was more to it too, but haiku.

1414
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Well done.

1415
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
If you're going to give me a haiku, I'm sorry. I'm going to ignore the rest of it.

1416
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Actdeft wins one internet.

1417
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
All right. Here you go. Complimentary internet.

1418
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
All right.

1419
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Read the last one.

1420
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Last one from Flaco Jones. And I like this answer because it kind of touches me here too.

1421
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
In a special place?

1422
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Well, no, it's just my answer is almost the exact same thing.

1423
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:31,000
But Flaco Jones says, When my wife and I were first starting off dating over a long distance,

1424
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,000
World of Warcraft was a great way to spend time together while still gaming.

1425
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:39,000
MMOs are great for dating couples who can't always go out together.

1426
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:43,000
And I co-signed that answer. Alan and I were long distance.

1427
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
You know, we were about 100 miles apart for the first year, year and a half of our relationship.

1428
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,000
And we played WoW a lot. And it was the same thing.

1429
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
And now we still play MMOs. It's just we moved on to a different one.

1430
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,000
And we don't always play together. He likes to stay up late and do all the different fights.

1431
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Whereas I'm like, I maxed out on tomes for the week. I'm over it.

1432
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
I'm going to go play more Bravely Default.

1433
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,000
That might have been a conversation that happened this week.

1434
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:12,000
But anyway, anything anybody wants to add to the speaking is super nerdy.

1435
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Alan and I met for the first time, saw each other.

1436
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
We knew each other online for years and years, kind of like you and Nan a little bit.

1437
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,000
But we met for the very first time at a video games live concert.

1438
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Oh, shut up.

1439
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Katamari.

1440
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Katamari? Really? Why that?

1441
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Because it's incredibly cute, has really good music, has drop dead cymbal controls.

1442
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:43,000
And just fun and attractive.

1443
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:49,000
I think I want to be really angry at Dan, so maybe we'll play the Saturn instead and do X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

1444
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Loki, I'm dying to know. What's a great date game for you and Nellie?

1445
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Plug the Baby.

1446
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:03,000
She doesn't like games, so I guess, let's see.

1447
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Excite Truck.

1448
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Yeah, Excite Truck's pretty good.

1449
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,000
See, I was just going to say the guy game, but you know, because she doesn't like trivia.

1450
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Oh God, that's right.

1451
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I remember when you got the guy game, when it was on, like, you had it on PlayStation 2 or GameCube or something,

1452
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
and Nellie was laughing harder than anybody at that game.

1453
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
It was PlayStation 2.

1454
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
BMX Triple X.

1455
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
That's a fun game.

1456
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Alright, that's good. I love that Mrs. Loki is probably more into the porn games than Loki is.

1457
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
But that's awesome. That's why she's great. Part of why she's great.

1458
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Alright.

1459
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I made it sound like that's the only reason. That's not the only reason.

1460
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Alright. Anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news. Back over to Loki.

1461
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Oh, by the way, just real quick again, I didn't read all the answers.

1462
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Thank you to everybody who did take the time to answer.

1463
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Please support everybody and go check out the answers in full over at facebook.com slash orange launch radio

1464
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
and google.com slash plus orange launch radio.

1465
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Okay, now back to Loki.

1466
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Alright, so the first tweaks to the Xbox One are going to be happening in March,

1467
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
just before the launch of Titanfall.

1468
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Of course, you know, they want everything to be nice and perfect before that, you know, game comes out.

1469
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So there's going to be some updates to the party and multiplayer options,

1470
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:26,000
including, I guess, some significant overhauls on that.

1471
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:32,000
They didn't really say some of the specifics, but it's supposed to be pretty good.

1472
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:37,000
And then, of course, some of the things that I'm like, why weren't these in there in the first place?

1473
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:44,000
But I guess a battery life indicator, you know, something that's just, I don't know, on every single other system out there.

1474
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:51,000
And then also an indicator of showing how much space apps are taking up.

1475
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Why was that not in there in the first place?

1476
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
That doesn't make any sense.

1477
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,000
And also, I guess, you're going to be able to use a USB keyboard to, you know, type for chat

1478
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:07,000
or I would assume on the internet and Internet Explorer and that kind of stuff.

1479
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:13,000
So all features that were, I don't know, part of the last generation of systems

1480
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,000
that they're now adding as new to next gen systems.

1481
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Can we say rushed?

1482
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Well, I think we kind of knew that that was the case is that, you know, especially when Microsoft reversed all of their policies after E3

1483
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:36,000
and kind of had to quickly, you know, make their new OS or whatever you want to call it,

1484
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
the back end software that runs on the system.

1485
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Hence why there was a day one update, right?

1486
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:46,000
So this isn't really a huge surprise that they've got to still do all these different enhancements.

1487
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
And PlayStation is in a similar spot.

1488
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:52,000
I don't want to make it sound like I'm dogging to Microsoft because PlayStation keeps enhancing things too.

1489
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:57,000
They just put out a patch not that long ago that enabled...

1490
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:03,000
I just don't understand why they're being added in now like a battery life indicator

1491
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:08,000
or, hey, let's see how much storage is on the hard drive, how much apps are taking up.

1492
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
That was something that was in the original Xbox.

1493
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I know. And that's true. Those are things that were silly and overlooked.

1494
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
But to be fair, like PlayStation, they finally patched in the ability to mute your camera.

1495
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
That's kind of a big one too.

1496
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:24,000
I've been sitting on this for a while and it has to be said because this was brought up.

1497
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Software development is not progressive like that.

1498
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Just because it was in a previous version does not mean it's automatically going to be there the next time.

1499
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:37,000
The tools improve, the libraries improve, the features improve, the power improves.

1500
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
But just because something was there in the past does not mean it will be there in the future.

1501
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:46,000
But that would imply that all those guys at Microsoft who sat there and developed it,

1502
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:50,000
not one of them said, you know, it would be nice to know how much battery life is left in this controller.

1503
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:55,000
You know what they spent their time on? Big, huge, time-consuming, meaningful shit.

1504
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
A battery indicator is not meaningful?

1505
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,000
No, they spent their time trying to shoehorn Windows 8 into fucking Xbox One is what they did.

1506
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,000
That's a whole other argument that I'm not going to disagree with.

1507
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,000
But a battery indicator is a resolvable process.

1508
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Oh fuck, my controller's not on and it won't turn back on.

1509
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Let me switch the batteries out or plug the controller in.

1510
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:19,000
It's totally cool that I don't know how much space I have left in my hard drive that I can't swap out.

1511
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:26,000
If you have a space problem with a hard drive in the first two months, you're a special kind of person.

1512
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I'm not going to say anything at all about that.

1513
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
I totally didn't buy a 3TB hard drive just for that.

1514
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I get where you're going with that because you're basically saying Microsoft had to pick and choose their battles.

1515
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:40,000
They had to work fast, they had to pick and choose what absolutely has to be there.

1516
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
As does every development studio ever.

1517
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:47,000
But you would think that if their original plan was that it was going to be where you have to install everything in the first place,

1518
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:52,000
that the indicator of how much space you have left in your hard drive would have been something that would have been kind of top of their list.

1519
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:57,000
You know what though? I can actually, believe it or not, I actually really get Jason's point where it's like,

1520
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,000
you're not going to be able to fill it up in the first two months.

1521
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
So that's something that can roll out in the next quarter.

1522
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Unless you have seen.

1523
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I can see that huge project.

1524
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:11,000
I can see that huge Microsoft project plan with everything that they want to put in.

1525
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
And some of these are like, do we absolutely need this right now?

1526
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:19,000
No, we don't need a space indicator because it's not humanly possible to fill the thing up the first couple months.

1527
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,000
But that's not true though because even their updates were like several gigs in size.

1528
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,000
And the games themselves are like, you know, 50 gigabytes.

1529
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:31,000
But that doesn't, but the whole disk is not copied to disk.

1530
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Forza was only 11 gigs installed, 12 gigs installed.

1531
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:46,000
And yeah, we heard, I reported on the Dead Rising 3 being 10 gigs out the gate and 13 gigs for the compatibility plus DLC, whatever the fuck preload update that they had two months ago.

1532
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
But that's if you bought it physical, not digital.

1533
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Sure, absolutely.

1534
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Good point. That's a very legitimate point.

1535
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:58,000
If you buy everything through the store, you will have greater space use than if you have disk.

1536
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:10,000
But people, I doubt, unless something went really wrong with the hard drive space and you lost space to disk errors because it was a DOA drive or what have you.

1537
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:14,000
You were not going to fill up 500 in the first two months of the system.

1538
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Our good pal Bobby Black Wolf brings up this point saying, Loki, the indicator isn't necessary because they're going to silently delete things you don't use to make room.

1539
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:25,000
You will never fill up your hard drive because it will automatically delete things you don't use.

1540
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
That's their excuse.

1541
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I think it's stupid myself, but that's their excuse.

1542
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
That's terrible.

1543
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,000
They'll delete, they delete old game DVR footage.

1544
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Not the porn, not the porn.

1545
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:42,000
They delete installed game data that you don't play.

1546
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
They delete apps that you downloaded that you didn't use.

1547
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:52,000
It's a fucking inconvenience and people are going to scream bloody murder when they have to redownload something or reinstall something.

1548
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,000
But it's a recoverable problem.

1549
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Like I made the point with the controller.

1550
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Oh fuck, my controller's dead. Let me switch my batteries.

1551
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:02,000
And you stop caring.

1552
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:08,000
It's actually kind of funny that we say this because my controller was being kind of flaky a couple days ago.

1553
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,000
And I wasn't sure if there was a battery indicator.

1554
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:16,000
And I did hit the home button and think to myself, where the fuck is the indicator?

1555
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
But I didn't care. You know what I did?

1556
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
I went and I grabbed my USB cable, I plugged it into the system and I was done.

1557
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Whatever.

1558
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Alright, well in the interest of time I'm going to move on to the next story.

1559
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Was there more for that?

1560
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Nope.

1561
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Okay, let me quickly move on to the next story which is about,

1562
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Oh, this is about a game that maybe many of you were playing and maybe your Xbox has already deleted it.

1563
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1564
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
But Batman Arkham Origins was one of the big titles at the end of last year.

1565
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:51,000
And apparently the support page for the game is full of players who are complaining.

1566
02:21:51,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Because community manager Mercury wrote that Origins development team is going to focus on completing the story DLC instead of fixing the bugs that are breaking the game.

1567
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:10,000
So, the team is currently working hard on the upcoming story DLC and there are currently no plans for releasing another patch to address the issues that have been reported on the forums.

1568
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:18,000
If we do move forward with creating a new patch, it will try to address the progression blocking bugs for players, not the minor glitches that do not prevent one from continuing to play.

1569
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:23,000
The issues that are not progression blockers will unfortunately no longer be addressed.

1570
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Wow.

1571
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:29,000
So again, there's that project plan and we have this much resources.

1572
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,000
This is going to make us money, this is going to shut people up, this is going to do nothing.

1573
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:37,000
And that's how it works, folks.

1574
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Resources are finite. Time is finite. Money is limited.

1575
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
I'm not saying I necessarily agree with it.

1576
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:47,000
General sense, that's all I'm saying. There's a trade-off in everything.

1577
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Also of note, Warner Brothers Entertainment is going to adapt Batman Arkham, that whole series, which is now a trilogy.

1578
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:59,000
It should be an animated film and should be released later this year. That's according to a report from The Hollywood Reporter.

1579
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Don't know what all the game will entail, but we do know the name is Batman, or excuse me, what the movie will entail from the games.

1580
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,000
But we do know the name of the movie is Batman Assault on Arkham.

1581
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:15,000
So they're not just like porting a game into a movie, but it's going to just basically be in the universe there.

1582
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:22,000
So, there you go. J. Olivia, who, sorry, Olivia, excuse me, I read that name too quick.

1583
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Olivia, who directed Justice League War is set to be the director of that film.

1584
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Mark Hamill will not be Joker, but Kevin Conroy will be Batman.

1585
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I imagine they're going to get, what's his name that does all the voice, Troy Baker.

1586
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Troy Baker, right, who does everything for video games. I imagine he's going to do it.

1587
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Could you imagine if EA stopped patching Battlefield 4 and focused on new content?

1588
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:50,000
I thought that's what they did.

1589
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
People still didn't shut up about it.

1590
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
That's what people still think.

1591
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Alright, moving on.

1592
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:02,000
And Tigerclaw clarifies in the chat they are using the same voices from Origins in the movie, so that would imply new guy.

1593
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Dark Sakura.

1594
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
I don't know how I feel about this.

1595
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,000
There's a lot of people on the internet saying that about this story.

1596
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Oh, they're not saying they don't know how they feel. They're making their feelings very well known.

1597
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
There's a lot of unhappy people.

1598
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Basically, there is going to be a starting over of the Sonic series.

1599
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:27,000
It was revealed by Sega in New York City on Thursday this past week.

1600
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Sonic Boom.

1601
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Which is the name of the new animated series debuting with the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games as a new franchise.

1602
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Sonic Boom. Sonic Boom. Sonic Boom.

1603
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,000
It's supposed to be the modern Sonic.

1604
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:50,000
On top of that though, from what I understand, it's being completely US developed.

1605
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:59,000
So we don't have any original, or I would say the Japanese development behind it.

1606
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Who we've identified as the core Sonic team back in Japan.

1607
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,000
And the art style just looks completely wrong.

1608
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:11,000
What is up with Knuckles looking roided out, please?

1609
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
This is just, no.

1610
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Sonic is wearing a scarf.

1611
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Why is Sonic wearing a scarf?

1612
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Why not?

1613
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Is he hipster Sonic now?

1614
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Rama in chat says, you don't like Knuckles' new look? Go blame Cartoon Network.

1615
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Fine. I will blame Cartoon Network. I don't know.

1616
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
At least he doesn't eat stuff with snot like a real echidna.

1617
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I'm gonna be honest. I'm gonna be completely blunt with this.

1618
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:43,000
I have a huge sense of apathy about this.

1619
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:47,000
I mean, really. I kinda look at this and I go, okay.

1620
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
My question is, are the games still gonna be good?

1621
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Because I don't really care. I never was into the cartoons or any of that stuff. I don't care.

1622
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,000
The litmus test for the new Sonic. Is it better than Sonic 06?

1623
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Is it better than Sonic Unleashed?

1624
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I should sure as fuck hope so. How can anything be worse than Sonic 06?

1625
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
You'd be surprised.

1626
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Here's the thing. They said, I understand that they're making this exclusively for Nintendo.

1627
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
So is this what they're gonna try to sell systems with?

1628
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Because the last Sonic game only sold about 600,000 units overall.

1629
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Well, go back to Awata's comment about where the install bases are.

1630
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Obviously this whole Sonic reboot on Cartoon Network is kinda geared towards kids and people that would gravitate towards Wii U.

1631
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
I mean, it's the reverse of what y'all were saying about first person shooters.

1632
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:43,000
The whole point is you wanna gravitate people that don't already have a Wii U to the Wii U.

1633
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Not kids that would probably already have a 3DS or Wii U.

1634
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Well, not that many kids have a Wii U or we wouldn't be having this problem that we're having.

1635
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Well, certainly a lot more that can join the ranks.

1636
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Are you excited about Sonic Boom, Loki?

1637
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I've been different about it because I honestly am not a big Sonic fan at all.

1638
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:11,000
So, I mean, it wasn't as terrible as the cartoon.

1639
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Like, I watched the little trailer for the cartoon and it didn't seem bad. I mean, it looked alright.

1640
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Knuckles is too big.

1641
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Who cares?

1642
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
I do.

1643
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,000
It doesn't matter.

1644
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:30,000
I think my favorite comment that I read about this is that both Tails and Amy are crotch height to Knuckles.

1645
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Sonic's friends were all a little dumb anyway.

1646
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Like, I mean...

1647
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Well, that was supposed to be his girlfriend. Well, Sonic's girlfriend anyway.

1648
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
His robbing the cradle girlfriend.

1649
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Uh...

1650
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,000
She's 8. No, she's 13. No, they're all underage anyways.

1651
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,000
They're animals. It doesn't matter.

1652
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Oh, so it's a dog ears argument?

1653
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Yes, they're all actually 70.

1654
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Dark Sakura, the final word on Sonic Boom?

1655
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Can I give the last word to SSJ100, Matt?

1656
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,000
You sure.

1657
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Breaking news! Knuckles A-Rod Akinda has been suspended from Smash Brothers because he tested positive for performance enhancing drugs.

1658
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
That's nice. That's nice. I like that.

1659
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
That's a good joke.

1660
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Can we get a Commander Guile cameo in there somewhere?

1661
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Sonic Boom!

1662
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:18,000
That's it. We need Sonic Boom set to Guile's music.

1663
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I'm sure it's already been done.

1664
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Alright, let's go to Loki with another story.

1665
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Alright, so this is kind of cool.

1666
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
You know, with the whole...

1667
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
What is it? The Oculus Rift stuff?

1668
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:39,000
They're actually now developing games exclusively for the Oculus Rift.

1669
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:48,000
And this includes now a brand new game called E-Valkyrie, which looks like a space shooter game and looks pretty awesome.

1670
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
And it's going to be exclusively on the Oculus Rift in...

1671
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I don't know.

1672
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Cool.

1673
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Is this the first MMO that supports Oculus Rift?

1674
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
I don't know.

1675
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Well, I think other MMOs, like Define Support, because I know they've got drivers for other MMOs, but like...

1676
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:17,000
First party and designed for depth and not just bolted on with the existing engine.

1677
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,000
I believe so, although Bobby will correct me in a heartbeat if I'm wrong.

1678
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:25,000
But I believe so, although I think somebody else had said they were exploring it.

1679
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I want to say EverQuest with the giant question mark, the landmark and all that.

1680
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
That would make sense.

1681
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:37,000
But, yeah, the thing is though, I think you can play things like World of Warcraft and stuff in the Rift with drivers and all that, but...

1682
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
You can play Metroid Prime with the Rift!

1683
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:47,000
You can't read the text, because the way the development kits are right now, the resolution's not quite there.

1684
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
And even if it was there, it would still be really hard to read.

1685
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:56,000
So a game that they're going to do that could be MMO based or whatever is going to have to be designed with the Rift in mind.

1686
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:02,000
The text is going to have to be large and it probably shouldn't even really rely on that text experience to begin with.

1687
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Jamie's freaking out.

1688
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
I just looked at something from one of the emails and oh my god.

1689
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Oh my god.

1690
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Don't get ahead of us.

1691
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I'm not.

1692
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Don't get ahead of yourself.

1693
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Black Wolf is saying too, it's not an MMO, this game, it's a Wing Commander clone in the Eve universe.

1694
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Oh.

1695
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
So it's like a side story type thing.

1696
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:34,000
I seem to recall CCP Games tried something like this with the Playstation 3 arcade and that whole, like the dust or whatever, was sort of like a side game that wasn't an MMO, but it influenced the MMO, if you will.

1697
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:49,000
This is going to make a good precursor to Star Citizen because as one of the stretch goals, Star Citizen intends to include Oculus Rift support, whatever form that takes in the year as soon as that game is actually going to be out.

1698
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Which is going to be amazing because Star Citizen, oh god, that game looks so good.

1699
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:58,000
I need to overhaul my joystick, flight stick setup arrangements.

1700
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:05,000
I'm very curious to see when the Oculus is a little more readily available commercially, when it's like finished and stuff.

1701
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:06,000
I'm really curious to see how...

1702
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Well, actually readily available commercially to be completely honest.

1703
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Right.

1704
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Dan mentioned he might want one.

1705
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Yeah, I'm very curious to see kind of where that goes.

1706
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,000
It would be pretty cool.

1707
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,000
I mean, I love the technology.

1708
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:23,000
I'm just very curious to see like, okay, what happens now when this isn't just like a niche dev thing now and it really starts to, you know, get out there commercially.

1709
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
It's going to be very interesting.

1710
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Alright, one more story and then we're going to go to the email bag.

1711
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

1712
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
But until then, my turn.

1713
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:42,000
There was a game that I crossed paths with on Twitter that I thought was really interesting and would love to talk about for a minute.

1714
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
The game is not out. It is previewed.

1715
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:52,000
If you go to Necrodancer.com, you can see the teaser trailer that I believe is really the extent of their media that's out so far.

1716
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:59,000
It will be available this year on all computer platforms, PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam.

1717
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Necrodancer, Curse of the Necro, Crypt, sorry, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike slash dungeon crawler that adds in rhythm elements.

1718
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:18,000
So whether that means for attacking or moving with bonuses, that remains to be seen.

1719
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:24,000
So it's a roguelike, it's a dungeon crawler, and it's a rhythm game.

1720
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:29,000
So if it was also an MMO, it would be my perfect game, right?

1721
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Somebody's trying to target the Rob market.

1722
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:35,000
And if you could sing to the rhythm, it would be SingStar Abba Rogue.

1723
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:40,000
SingStar Rogue Abba Rogue Abba Rogue...

1724
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Anyways...

1725
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Yeah, you know I'm back on the show and I even take the words out of Rob's mouth.

1726
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Pretty standard affair game, simple graphics, but one of the kickers is that because it is rhythm oriented,

1727
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:01,000
you have the ability of putting your own library, your own music library to use to influence...

1728
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I don't think it's randomly generated, but it is the movement structure of the game.

1729
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:13,000
So not only can you put your own library to use, but you can also use a DDR pad to play it.

1730
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:18,000
So not only did they take this concept, but they actually ran with it, they actually implemented it,

1731
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:24,000
they actually know a way that, well, you can put an accessory that may not be getting enough love anymore to use.

1732
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,000
So dust off them DDR pads if they still work.

1733
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:36,000
It is available for pre-order now, $13... $14 pre-order in $15 when it releases.

1734
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Like I said, gonna be on Steam.

1735
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I already bought it, I got the soundtrack, I'm so looking forward to it.

1736
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I'm curious.

1737
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Watch the trailer, throw the trailer up.

1738
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Alright, I will look at this right now.

1739
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:53,000
This is from Necrodancer.com, let's take a little look-see.

1740
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,000
That's just an awesome name.

1741
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
They told me I was too young.

1742
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
They told me I needed more training.

1743
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
She looks like Link, but with a shovel.

1744
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
I told them to drop dead.

1745
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
How ironic.

1746
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
She just dropped dead.

1747
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I don't know how I survived that fall.

1748
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
You know Lara Croft had a worse day.

1749
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Heck yes, cheesy techno music.

1750
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:27,000
But my pulse is beating like a drum, but my blood is running cold.

1751
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:31,000
I'm not sure what's going on, but I came here with a question.

1752
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
And I'm gonna find the answer if it kills me.

1753
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Can I dance?

1754
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Yes.

1755
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
I swear I played a game like this on Ouya.

1756
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Yes, Ouya.

1757
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,000
It wasn't this same 8-bit graphic-y thing.

1758
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:56,000
It had more Ouya-style graphics.

1759
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:00,000
But it was something like you would move around and hit the buttons and attack to the beat.

1760
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,000
I swear at Ouya's E3 booth I played something like that.

1761
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I'm a sucker for this stuff, I completely admit it.

1762
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,000
It looks so much fun.

1763
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Alright, I'll check it out.

1764
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:13,000
I also have to dust off an old dance pad, so I fully intend to play it that way.

1765
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Quick, cash in. Just add 8-bit graphics.

1766
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Yay!

1767
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Worked for Flappy Bird.

1768
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Alright.

1769
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Too soon, Rob. Too soon.

1770
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Rest in peace, Flappy. I miss you.

1771
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,000
No, I don't. I don't miss you.

1772
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
No, you keep hitting that pipe.

1773
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Well, Bobby did have episode 420 tonight.

1774
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Alright.

1775
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Alright, let's get to the email bag.

1776
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1777
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Although, we are going to change that email very soon.

1778
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Yes.

1779
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:52,000
So you can still email us, but this is probably about the last week you're going to be able to send us this email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1780
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,000
We will give you the new email address soon.

1781
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Yes, I have plans.

1782
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Alright, well maybe I have plans. Maybe Jason has plans.

1783
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,000
I have planners.

1784
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
You know what? Read an email.

1785
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I'm a planist.

1786
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Are you a planist?

1787
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Planist Hollywood. No.

1788
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
So, that was stupid.

1789
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Wow.

1790
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:14,000
So, um, wow, um, Robert M. sent me an email.

1791
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:17,000
My recent mailings have been way too long. So, Duffy Bus.

1792
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:22,000
And it says Dark Soccer isn't off tonight, I hope.

1793
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
So, I had to look up Duffy Bus.

1794
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:29,000
And, oh my God, it's a furry bus that's all Duffy.

1795
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:34,000
And it has Duffy's face on the front and the seats have Duffy on them and there's Duffy.

1796
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
So much Duffy. Oh my fucking God.

1797
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:41,000
If you don't know Duffy, it's Disney's form of a Build-A-Bear.

1798
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
No, no, no, it's not like a Build-A-Bear.

1799
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:46,000
It's, um, Dan calls it Focus Group Bear.

1800
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:53,000
So, I am copying this and posting it in the chatroom right now so everyone can see the glory.

1801
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I want this in my life. This has to be in my life, Hob.

1802
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
I want it for reasons.

1803
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Fair enough.

1804
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
So, um...

1805
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Thank you for making her squee, Robert M.

1806
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Maybe we squee way too early. Okay, we got another long one from RossdellU2.

1807
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Alright, well, you know, we've talked about his emails before.

1808
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:17,000
He brings up sometimes uncomfortable but necessary points.

1809
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,000
I know. I'm reading it.

1810
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Greetings, guys. Your discussion about the Wii U is perhaps a bit weighted in Nintendo's favor.

1811
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Perhaps due to not having Loki on the show.

1812
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I thought I'd inject...

1813
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Oh, here we go.

1814
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Didn't I say earlier I don't want Nintendo Doc? I'm done. Alright, fine. Fine.

1815
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
A bit of the other side in this message.

1816
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:43,000
I picked up the Wii U despite having been thoroughly turned off by the Wii in April of last year while we were still worried about the PS4 following, um, the DRM path.

1817
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:50,000
After catching up on the games I'd missed in the past month's Monster Hunter SMMBU et al.,

1818
02:37:50,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I found myself in the familiar Nintendo drought and came to realize why Nintendo home consoles will never be relevant to the core gaming market.

1819
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:06,000
While the Wii U went months without content of any sort, the PS3 and 360 were spoiled for games just everywhere.

1820
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
See, the issue with Nintendo is twofold.

1821
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:12,000
They've saddled the system with a stupid hook that they've failed to explain to consumers,

1822
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:16,000
and since they're clearly focused on the 3DS, which I can't blame the company for,

1823
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:24,000
there's just not going to be the attention needed to make Wii U games at a fast enough rate to be appealing to the people outside of the Nintendo Defense Force.

1824
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Already I've got just under half as many games for the PS4 as I do on the Wii U, and I expect my PS4 collection to blow past my Wii U collection pretty fast.

1825
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I'll admit that part of this is that I abhor the gamepad with the passion of a thousand burning suns, but more importantly the games just aren't there,

1826
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:48,000
and the ones that do come are extremely conservative entries into their perennial franchises.

1827
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Put bluntly, Nintendo cannot support two consoles without third-party support, at least not as they are.

1828
02:38:54,000 --> 02:39:00,000
And I have to go back to the chatroom because it times out on me. Sorry.

1829
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:08,000
God damn. Okay. I'm not going to say anything about this product. It's a very good product.

1830
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Where was I?

1831
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Unless they're willing to back off the 3DS Forbidden Focus on-

1832
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:22,000
No, for all their talk Nintendo knows exactly where its bread is buttered, and unless they're willing to back off on the 3DS Forbidden Focus on the Wii U,

1833
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:31,000
it's going to be another 4-5 years of nothing but your Mario, Zelda, and Wii franchises, with the only breaks in sight being X and Bayonetta 2,

1834
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:34,000
neither of which have release dates in sight.

1835
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Put short, Nintendo's games are too few and far between to support a system without third-parties,

1836
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:46,000
and that will down them to security in the home space until they start investing heavily in internal Wii U development.

1837
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Anyway, I look forward to the inevitable Nintendo defense that Rob will mount.

1838
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Seriously guys, have a good one and have a great week.

1839
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Regards, RossdielUT, who is apparently disgusting for being a brony.

1840
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:03,000
P.S. Shane and Exifer were painful to listen to. I'm not going to say anything about that.

1841
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:08,000
You know what, I love Exifer and I love Shane, so they were awesome.

1842
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Um, different strokes for different folks.

1843
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:15,000
I apparently have a high-pitched voice.

1844
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Do you?

1845
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:20,000
I don't know, do I?

1846
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
That's really good.

1847
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I don't know what to say to that email, I mean to be honest it's kind of the same shtick I'm hearing about Nintendo.

1848
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:39,000
I'm going to be honest, although, and please don't take this as disrespectful, I just feel like what he's saying is nothing I haven't heard like a hundred times already.

1849
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Yeah.

1850
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Maybe that's why it didn't come up on the show that Loki wasn't here, it's just kind of like it's the same.

1851
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
But they were good points.

1852
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:51,000
It's fine, but also some of them, some of them, I could apply to Xbox One.

1853
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Just saying, unnecessary gimmick we're all forced to buy, that's an Xbox One.

1854
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Drought of Games, Xbox One.

1855
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
I'd second that for now.

1856
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Now I'm not here to sing the doom and gloom praises of Xbox One.

1857
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:09,000
But I just will say this, since you are expecting me to be the Nintendo defendant, I will say this much.

1858
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Yeah, Wii U is hurting. Wii U needs to attract third party people back.

1859
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Wii U does not have the online experience that can hold a candle to the other consoles.

1860
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Wii U is far from perfect.

1861
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
That's for sure.

1862
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:32,000
But, sure, Wii U only gets those one or two or three Nintendo games a year right now.

1863
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,000
But they are quality fucking games.

1864
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:40,000
It's a little bit of irony that we won't sing the doom and gloom at the Xbox division,

1865
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:48,000
but there are large swaths of Microsoft, of which the Xbox One is related to by nature of the online services division,

1866
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
that isn't making a whole bunch of money.

1867
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:55,000
And considering the loss that Microsoft takes on the console itself for so long,

1868
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:00,000
that they have to recoup in, you know, licensing for purchases and all that kind of stuff, game publishing,

1869
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:09,000
they make a hell of a lot of money, but they're not always above water in the strict division-specific financial sense.

1870
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Here's the thing, at the end of the day, I'm not delusional where I think the Wii U is gonna overtake the PlayStation 4 on the Xbox One at this point.

1871
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Fuck no, that's not happening.

1872
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:27,000
At this point, it is to try and minimalize the loss of money that they're getting on Wii U right now.

1873
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:31,000
And hopefully some quality games will bring that up and get people excited again.

1874
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:38,000
But honestly, at this point, I'm not dissatisfied with my purchase of the Wii U,

1875
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:42,000
because how else would I have gotten to play as some of the great games that are on it?

1876
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:50,000
But it's just kinda like, as far as its success everywhere, Wii-style large thing, it's just not gonna happen with this console.

1877
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Maybe the next time. You know what, the GameCube wasn't a big hit either,

1878
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:59,000
but Nintendo didn't go under and have to make games for, you know, Apple and Android and all this.

1879
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:06,000
So, I just don't think, I don't think Nintendo's going bankrupt tomorrow or anything like that.

1880
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,000
It's not gonna happen.

1881
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Far from it, honestly.

1882
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
So anyway, how about we move forward?

1883
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Hi, OLR, this is KZ Borat.

1884
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:21,000
I just wanted to say I love the show, as I have for the last nine years.

1885
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Thanks for being long-term.

1886
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Holy crap.

1887
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Also, I wanted to inform you that there is a Wikipedia page that includes your show about a game.

1888
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:33,000
The wiki page for Guitar Hero, Rock of the 80s, under the History tab,

1889
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:40,000
it says that OLR was the only source to announce its release on a particular date, and that you guys were right.

1890
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:45,000
Just thought it was interesting, and also I wanted to donate some microphones, mic stands, and some nice cables.

1891
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Please let me know if you'd be interested in that.

1892
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:50,000
I have a surplus and I'm always looking for a way to support the show.

1893
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Yeah, actually the mic stands especially would be pretty phenomenal.

1894
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:59,000
And you know what's funny? Somebody else was messaging me on Facebook about that too.

1895
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:04,000
And these mics we're using now were donated by the fantastic people over at PodCulture.

1896
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
You guys' generosity is amazing.

1897
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:13,000
I want to ask you, dude, did you actually do this as a voice recording? Like voice-to-text?

1898
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Oh, maybe.

1899
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Just because, I mean, you know I have an eye for grammar and stuff.

1900
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I can figure it out because the last thing listed is Boar Hot Out.

1901
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
And I guess that's supposed to be Boar At.

1902
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:31,000
But that's the same type of stuff that, you know, the stuff that goes in is like usual.

1903
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:35,000
I'd really like to know. Actually, that sounds like you're using a fairly decent voice-to-text program.

1904
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
I'd really like to know what you're using.

1905
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:41,000
And I will just say quickly, yes, I actually did know about the Wikipedia thing.

1906
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Because Orange Dance Radio used to have an article on Wikipedia some time ago.

1907
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
We should, someone remake our thing.

1908
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Well, it was taken down because it didn't establish nobility or whatever and didn't have enough outside resources or whatever.

1909
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:58,000
But I'm just, I don't know. It's kind of one of those things where I don't want to sound like,

1910
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
You know, we deserve a Wikipedia page.

1911
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
But we did.

1912
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:03,000
History.

1913
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:08,000
We are the longest running weekly podcast about games.

1914
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Okay. Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s was initially announced by EGM in January 2007 as Guitar Hero 1980s Edition.

1915
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Orange Lounge Radio claimed that the game would be released in June 2007 based on an Activision announcement.

1916
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
And no other source has cited this announcement.

1917
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Activision officially revealed the first details of the game May 11, 2007.

1918
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:32,000
In addition to changing the game's title to Guitar Hero Rock the 80s.

1919
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
I just, I remember that. Loki figured that out.

1920
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Loki had like a presentation at his work or something.

1921
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
And that's why it wasn't out, because it wasn't a media thing.

1922
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:43,000
It was an internal. Right, Loki? Do you remember that?

1923
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Vaguely.

1924
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:49,000
I'm almost positive it was a distribution announcement, not a media announcement.

1925
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:50,000
And that's why we had it before.

1926
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Yeah, I say a lot of things before they come out, but no one ever knows this.

1927
02:45:54,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Of all games to get noticed for, Loki, Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s.

1928
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:06,000
I want to quickly on Wikipedia, just because I, you know, yes, I like to see where this show is having an impact.

1929
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
I think a lot of you would too.

1930
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
I think we're referenced on the Ultramix 4 article.

1931
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:17,000
And I think we're referenced on the beautiful Katamari article, which will not go there.

1932
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:22,000
But that should come as no surprise if you've been listening to OLR for nine years.

1933
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:23,000
That's all I'll say.

1934
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:26,000
I would actually really like for our Wikipedia page to come back.

1935
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s, beautiful Katamari, Dance Sense Revolution Ultramix 4, and Podcast Awards.

1936
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:37,000
That's right. Sorry, I was just laughing, because it's like, oh, hey, yeah.

1937
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:42,000
A whole breakdown of all of the nominations and winners per category and everything.

1938
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Yeah, and a ton of those shows have pages. How come we don't get a page? We're not notable enough.

1939
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:53,000
2005. This is actually a really nice table. Quick overview, since we're running over it.

1940
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Podcast Awards, 2005 until 2013 in the gaming category. These are the winners, naturally.

1941
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:02,000
As of 2005, going forward. Orange Lounge Radio.

1942
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:06,000
You can just stop there. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm such an asshole.

1943
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,000
How about the last email?

1944
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Go ahead and let Jason have his moment.

1945
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
Orange Lounge Radio, pause.

1946
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
It's his last show for a while.

1947
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1948
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:15,000
Jason's stopping you in your face.

1949
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
I didn't realize I was interrupting. Sorry.

1950
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Gaming, 2005, and each successive name will be a year forward.

1951
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio, Podtacular, Cagcast, The Instance, 4-Player Podcast, 4-Player Podcast, 4-Player Podcast, Rooster Teeth Podcast, Rooster Teeth Podcast.

1952
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:35,000
You know what's interesting, though, about all that? All of those shows still going. Every single one of them.

1953
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Is Podtacular still going?

1954
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,000
Except us. We're gone.

1955
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:40,000
We are out of here. Bye, bitches. No, I'm just kidding.

1956
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Also interesting.

1957
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,000
That's really cool.

1958
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:49,000
Orange Lounge Radio in that list is linked, but it's red, meaning there's no source article that it's linked to.

1959
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
It was probably linked to when we actually had our article.

1960
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Sure. It's obviously been around for a couple years.

1961
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:54,000
In 2005, we...

1962
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Okay, that's all.

1963
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Get to work, someone.

1964
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Raginator says we're referenced in Namco Museum Essentials on PSN, too.

1965
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Well, I know we are in the game.

1966
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
You mentioned that, but I didn't realize that.

1967
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
If we're in the wiki, I had no idea.

1968
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
I did a full text search in Wikipedia.

1969
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
We've also got the President Cat thing.

1970
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
That wasn't a wiki either, was it?

1971
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
No, but they're talking about source elsewhere.

1972
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Black Wolf says Podtacular is off.

1973
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Oh, I thought they were still doing Halo stuff.

1974
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
All right. Well, sorry to hear.

1975
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Then I forget what I said. Sorry.

1976
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Bring back the wiki.

1977
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Hi, OLR. I just really wanted to respond to Sky's so-called fan wink about Sega being potentially acquired slash emerged by Nintendo or Sony or Microsoft.

1978
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Big reason this won't happen, Sega just recently took over Index Corporation, which Atlus is a big part of, and Atlus makes Shin Megami Tensei.

1979
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:52,000
If Sega were acquired by any of the big three, then Shin Megami Tensei and Persona fandoms would go nuclear.

1980
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Probably some of Sega's fans, too.

1981
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:02,000
More recently, Sega reported increased revenues for PC and digital games, so they're not going to go console exclusive anytime soon.

1982
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I know it's a, I know it's wank, but we've got to wake up with a sore neck every once in a while, too.

1983
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
The nasty canasta.

1984
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:15,000
P.S. Why isn't hashtag press X to VX JasonXV trending on VOG?

1985
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
That's a good question.

1986
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
The world may never know.

1987
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Oh, boy.

1988
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Because I haven't heard this.

1989
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:28,000
There's a, there's a coworker of mine that lives in the East, and every time she comes into town for events,

1990
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:34,000
I look forward to one very specific, wonderful reference that she's usually the first one to make,

1991
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:37,000
and then everybody else that gets the joke joins in, so, you know.

1992
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:46,000
So, to totally derail the show right now, because I love doing that, and I just saw on Facebook, someone linked to an article saying,

1993
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:50,000
Pepsi is reintroducing limited edition Crystal Pepsi.

1994
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:51,000
What?

1995
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Nope, nope, nope, stop, put the brakes on, satire website, go to the About Us page.

1996
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Wall Street Sentinel, sorry.

1997
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Wildfire, because people, people don't think it's, I know, I was like, but then I was like, wait a minute, I have never heard of this site.

1998
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:08,000
This is not coming from CNN, or, you know, something that you've heard of, it's coming from, yeah.

1999
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:12,000
But in good news, there is a fundraiser for Clearly Canadian to bring that back.

2000
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:19,000
There's a, there's a fucking, there's a gaming press website that does that, and it's not clear that they're a satire site,

2001
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:25,000
and people share their shit all the time, and you know they're over there cackling, that people keep sharing their shit like it's fact.

2002
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:32,000
I can't, something like, I don't even want to say the name, because I hate it when I see those articles on Facebook, people think they're true,

2003
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:38,000
but it's something like, I actually, I just thought of the name of it, I'm not going to say it.

2004
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:42,000
This actually doesn't sound any bit familiar, so, if you're interested, watch Twitter for a couple days.

2005
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:45,000
It's P something something, I'll say.

2006
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Alright, moving on, that was it for Mailbag, right?

2007
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Yes it was.

2008
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Then you should email us, this is your last, literally your last chance to email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

2009
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
This is your last chance to email us.

2010
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
To email that address.

2011
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Alright, more information on that coming next week.

2012
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Here we go to the, that email address will still be good though through at least the next show, because we know some people are behind,

2013
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:14,000
we're not going to just shutter the mailbag right away, and we'll put an announcement out on Facebook and Twitter.

2014
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:17,000
And at the very least we can set up a redirect.

2015
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Eh, no, no, trust me.

2016
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Alright, alright.

2017
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:21,000
I have means.

2018
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2019
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Every week we get angsty.

2020
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Why?

2021
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Because that's what we do.

2022
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
FU to having to get up at six in the morning.

2023
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:52,000
However, this will be the last week for a while that I'll have to do it.

2024
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:57,000
So next Saturday, I'm sorry next Sunday, I will be on my late schedule.

2025
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
I like sleep, I like sleep a lot.

2026
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:14,000
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I have so much to do before this weekend, and in the rainy weather all I really want to do is just sit and play Bravely Default all day,

2027
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:19,000
but I can't because I have so much to do, like, I just, I'm gonna die.

2028
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
I might not be here next week because I might be dead.

2029
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:24,000
So I just want to say, not allowed.

2030
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
I really appreciate all of your support over the years.

2031
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
And thanks, and peace out.

2032
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Alright.

2033
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Next up, Loki.

2034
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:46,000
As I go along with what DarkSucker said, yeah, FU having to wake up at midnight, two in the morning, four in the morning, six in the morning.

2035
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
That pays only last several years, don't worry.

2036
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Hashtag baby problem.

2037
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Jason.

2038
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:06,000
It's funny, I was gonna say, I'm happy, I don't have FUs, but no, I'm gonna third, basically fourth what everybody else has said.

2039
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,000
I got woken up three times over the course of the morning this morning.

2040
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:13,000
One, time zone conflict, and just the fact that I like sleeping in.

2041
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:18,000
I got woken up a lot today, and it kind of pissed me off, but whatever, I'm here, I managed, whatever.

2042
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Yeah, sleep is wonderful, FU'd everything that prevents it in any way, shape, or form.

2043
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.

2044
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, Loki.

2045
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:41,000
Alright, so Steam, you know, trying to be a little bit more legit with their Steam OS, is launching yet another beta.

2046
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:53,000
This is Steam Music, and it's gonna be a limited beta, it basically allows you to stream music into your games from stuff that you have on your PC.

2047
02:53:53,000 --> 02:54:05,000
And just some more features that they're adding in there, probably, I'm guessing at some point, gonna start doing other apps, like Netflix and that kind of stuff.

2048
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:11,000
But, it's neat to see how Steam OS is kind of evolving into an actual operating system.

2049
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:23,000
How long until you can run Netflix through Steam? Cause that's when it's truly, truly its own system.

2050
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Yeah, that would be pretty awesome.

2051
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Not sure, but they're saying that they're, well this is gonna go on through, I guess, mid-January, or I guess they announced this at mid-January that they're gonna be doing some more beta tests for different things.

2052
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:51,000
And, not sure when the final Steam OS is supposed to be coming out, or if it'll ever be final, because, you know, a lot of these companies like keeping things in beta forever.

2053
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:58,000
So I guess we'll have to find out, but I'm assuming later this year, cause I know some of the Steam boxes were due out, I think, later this year.

2054
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Alright, it's weird though that this music service is only like your local file, which, you know, is fine, that's like what Playstation 3 and stuff do too, but it's interesting they're not trying to push their own little streaming music service thing.

2055
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Well, well, that's because Steam has been just integrated into an OS, and now they actually have a way to actually play music.

2056
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:29,000
That's a prerequisite to being able to sell you stuff, at least on their own OS that has to have some kind of facility for doing that.

2057
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Just saying.

2058
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Alright, fair enough. I do have one more story for you guys, but I forgot to set up the Skype line.

2059
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Jason, would you be so kind, not to put you on the spot, but would you do the next story?

2060
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Sorry, Jason.

2061
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:49,000
I hope I actually... Go figure, it's the one that I didn't pay too much attention to, so let's see how well we can win this.

2062
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Live radio, it's super fun. Just fake it, that's what I do.

2063
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:56,000
See, the irony here is that I should have just shut my mouth, I should have just...

2064
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:05,000
We can take calls! 1-8-7-7-Game-O-L-R, username on Skype is OrangeLunchRadio, and I would have like looked at Rob, I think we're missing the prerequisite.

2065
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:11,000
That's alright, young padawan, you're still learning, you've been doing this for a few months, we've been doing it for twelve years, you'll learn to fake it like me someday.

2066
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Sometimes I do feel like that.

2067
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:23,000
So this article, I'm just gonna apologize right now, this is literally one article that I did not read at all in this list.

2068
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Disney Infinity sequel could feature Marvel and Star Wars characters.

2069
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Disney Interactive Studios may be planning the sequel to the hit title Disney Infinity, which could feature a Marvel superhero and Star Wars characters.

2070
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:44,000
According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, which is the biggest credible source for all of the gaming news, they get it right with media, I don't know why I'm being snarky about that.

2071
02:56:44,000 --> 02:57:00,000
Disney has posted a job listing for a games tester at Avalanche Software, which is giving weight to the sequel, and it is also listing requirements for familiarity with the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Wii U, obviously the whole swath.

2072
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:16,000
There has been no official confirmation from Disney Interactive, the leaks are coming just as the corporation is due to post their quarterly financial results, and will be laying off several hundred people according to said results.

2073
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Yeah, I actually asked them that very question, whether they were gonna do Star Wars characters.

2074
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:28,000
It was even before that launch when we had like a conference call with them, and they said it was something they were working on, so.

2075
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:45,000
I mean, why not? With all of these franchises under their wing, and the ramp up that they're trying to do, why would you not put these properties in something, like, like, like, granted it wasn't a Nintendo title, but um, uh, frickin' Kingdom Hearts?

2076
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:56,000
Why, with the success that that has truly brought, why would you not rely on all of your properties to bring them together and make something far better than we've seen so far?

2077
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Yeah, absolutely, they're going to. I mean, they've made a ton of money off of it, so I'm interested to see if they do a sequel to the game this year. I think they are, because they're almost out of DLC, well, not DLC, but characters.

2078
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:16,000
They're almost out of characters, I think April is when they finally run out through all the stuff that they had planned.

2079
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Well, I'm sure E3 will show us a lot this year.

2080
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Yeah, just a couple months away.

2081
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Alright, I know there's going to be a sequel. Good job. Alright, let's go ahead, and now we will open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2082
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Uh, if you'd like to give us a call, and we can talk about whatever you'd like to talk about from tonight's topics, or maybe there's something we missed, I don't know.

2083
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:48,000
But, uh, oh, the phone is already ringing, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2084
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,000
It's Shane.

2085
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Hey, Shane, what's up?

2086
02:58:50,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Nothing much. First of all, I'm glad that I was able to get you to love Bravely Default. I am, like, 10 hours into it, almost 11.

2087
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Congratulations.

2088
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:07,000
It's so good. Um, secondly, that raw Steel UT guy, kind of a douche.

2089
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
Why do you say that?

2090
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:19,000
I don't know, because me and Extfer had a good time, and then I told Extfer what he started to say about us, because I think Jamie censored it, and we both think it's hilarious.

2091
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Well, it's-

2092
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:24,000
I hope, I hope somebody finds him in an apartment with a needle in his arm.

2093
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:31,000
Stop it! That is not- don't say that. Oh my god, I'm gonna have to write an apology email. That's your opinion, not mine.

2094
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Mhm. Um, and then also, I wanted to answer the frugal question of the week, because it's topical for me this coming weekend.

2095
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:40,000
Oh.

2096
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:41,000
So, we-

2097
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:42,000
Details, please.

2098
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:57,000
We, through some, what is the word, compromise, uh, we are going to be playing Slender Man, Slender Man The Arrival, and Amnesia this weekend, for our date stuff. So I think that's gonna be awesome.

2099
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:00,000
So, why horror video games?

2100
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:09,000
Because, just talking about them gets him really scared. So, that's fantastic. If I can just say the word Slender Man, and he freaks out.

2101
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:13,000
It's because it's an excuse to cuddle when you get really scared, huh?

2102
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
Or to laugh really hard.

2103
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Both valid.

2104
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:22,000
I thought you guys were gonna play Final Fantasy 14.

2105
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:25,000
One day, maybe.

2106
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
Maybe. Fair enough.

2107
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Between all the sex.

2108
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:33,000
I can't believe you just said that.

2109
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:37,000
Well, checking on the video is hilarious.

2110
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:40,000
This week and last, we learned the difference between Shane's filter and Rob's filter.

2111
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
Is he listening?

2112
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:43,000
No.

2113
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:46,000
Oh, okay. Well, we'll be sure to send him a copy of the recording.

2114
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Um, um, well, how-

2115
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Which recording are you talking about, Rob?

2116
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
How was your trip back, by the way?

2117
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
It was to where? To Kansas?

2118
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Yeah.

2119
03:00:55,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Full of snow. Snow out of nowhere. Like, my street I live on still hasn't been plowed. It is not fun to drive on.

2120
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Well, that's what you get for living in Kansas. California misses you. Come back.

2121
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:11,000
All right. Goodbye. I guess I'll leave right now.

2122
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:14,000
All right. Start walking. Bye.

2123
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:15,000
Bye.

2124
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
All right. There's, uh, Shane, everybody.

2125
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:21,000
The views and opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect those of Orange Lounge Radio-

2126
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Why do you have to go and say that?

2127
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:26,000
All right. 1877 Game O-L-R.

2128
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2129
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:33,000
Uh, we got time for about one or two other quick calls here.

2130
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:38,000
Uh, I did see some other people trying to get through, so I'm hoping we can get at least one of them here on the air.

2131
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:43,000
But there is a little bit of a delay between when I give the information and when people actually hear it.

2132
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Uh, I should actually pull up Twitter real quick, because I know we had a couple of, uh, Twitter topics.

2133
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
I actually queued up a bunch of topics.

2134
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:58,000
All right. Let me, um, I hate Skype on the iPad, by the way.

2135
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,000
Just, just so you know, I really hate Skype on the iPad.

2136
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
But there we go. Oh, hey, it's another video call. Woohoo!

2137
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
What's up? Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2138
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:08,000
Hey, it's Dave. I called in last week. What's going on, guys?

2139
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
Hey, not much. How you doing, Dave?

2140
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Good, good. And I now see what you guys mean when you're talking about those hand mics.

2141
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
There you go. Right? Now you got a visual to it.

2142
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:19,000
Yeah, exactly. Now we can see what Dave looks like. What's up?

2143
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
Not much. How you doing?

2144
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Pretty good. Pretty good. How about you guys?

2145
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Good. What's on your mind, buddy?

2146
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:28,000
Uh, well, today's actually just kind of a random call.

2147
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Uh, I got a late birthday present from a friend of mine, so I've got 20 bucks to blow on Steam.

2148
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:37,000
And I wanted to know from you guys what you would blow $20 on right now.

2149
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:38,000
Typing of the Dead.

2150
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:39,000
Drunken Robot Pornography.

2151
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
Uh, Rogue Legacy.

2152
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:42,000
FTL.

2153
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:48,000
Well, are there things that I don't already own or things that you ought to own that you already have?

2154
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Things I should own.

2155
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:50,000
That's what I thought. Um...

2156
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:51,000
Drunken Robot Pornography.

2157
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Civ V. The entire collection is a lot of fun. I love Civ V.

2158
03:02:55,000 --> 03:03:02,000
Um, actually, there's also legitimately a part of me that's like, hold on to the money until the summer sale,

2159
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
because you could probably get like four times the games.

2160
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:07,000
But that's a long time to wait. It's a very long time to wait.

2161
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Um, are you pulling up your Steam collection right now?

2162
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:17,000
No, I was actually queuing Twitter topics, but it will be interesting to see if Steam also does a spring sale.

2163
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:23,000
Or if that was just the fact that what's winter in America, it would be spring in the Eastern Hemisphere.

2164
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:24,000
Guacamelee.

2165
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:25,000
Whatever.

2166
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:28,000
Guacamelee is a game I've been spending an awful lot of time on lately.

2167
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
What kind of games do you like?

2168
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:37,000
Um, I mean, I've been searching for probably the last eight months for a good RPG.

2169
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:40,000
And Skyrim just didn't do it for me.

2170
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:45,000
They've got Baldur's Gate 2 on there, but I'm like, cool, I played that when I was 15.

2171
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:50,000
So, are you more like into the Final Fantasy type RPGs?

2172
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:55,000
Ish. Ish. I actually just picked up my brother's Bravely Default pre-order today.

2173
03:03:55,000 --> 03:04:00,000
I was just gonna say, go return your Steam card and put the money towards Bravely Default.

2174
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:05,000
See, maybe I'm alone on this one. I had no idea that the game was gonna be that big.

2175
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:09,000
I walked into the GameStop and said like, hey, I'm here to pick up this pre-order.

2176
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:14,000
And all of the employees in the store kind of collectively just went, oh, thanks.

2177
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Now people can stop calling us about whether or not we have this game in stock.

2178
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:21,000
Because this is literally the last copy in the region.

2179
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
Oh my gosh.

2180
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:24,000
Yeah, it was intense.

2181
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
Wow, I didn't know it was gonna be that big of a deal either.

2182
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:30,000
Um, let's see, ActDeaf suggests get the Ys games.

2183
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:31,000
And yes, the, if you like...

2184
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:32,000
Ys.

2185
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
Ys? I always wanted the Ys. E-A-S-E.

2186
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:35,000
Ys.

2187
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
Alright, well, um...

2188
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:38,000
Trust me.

2189
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:41,000
Whatever it is, I think that's a pretty fun series.

2190
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
Although, I don't know, the attacking is a little weird.

2191
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:44,000
It takes some getting used to.

2192
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
That's more like a Zelda-esque kind of game.

2193
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:47,000
Yeah, bump, bump, bump.

2194
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:48,000
This is kind of how it works.

2195
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:49,000
You kind of collide.

2196
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:50,000
Pump them until they're dead.

2197
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:51,000
Yeah, exactly.

2198
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:55,000
Let's see, I'm trying to think of like a straight up JRPG style game.

2199
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:58,000
I was gonna say, if you're not necessarily so much JRPG,

2200
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:01,000
but you're interested in more action RPG, then Borderlands.

2201
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
Ooh, that's a really good one.

2202
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
If you can be okay with the first person shooter element,

2203
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
Borderlands is actually not a bad choice at all.

2204
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:08,000
It's a very good meld of the two.

2205
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
The entire Mass Effect series.

2206
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:11,000
Good call.

2207
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Raginator reminds that Final Fantasy VII is a good RPG on Steam,

2208
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:18,000
so if you miss the classic somehow, Final Fantasy VII and VIII are there.

2209
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:19,000
I don't know why.

2210
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:20,000
I didn't think about that.

2211
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:21,000
That's still in my queue to be able to play.

2212
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:22,000
Right? Exactly.

2213
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
I just thought the same thing.

2214
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:25,000
You can skip VIII, though.

2215
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:26,000
Um, Alan...

2216
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:29,000
Hey, they fixed the crap from the third desk.

2217
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:30,000
...shaded every chance I can.

2218
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
Alan Alcomb used to just Hotline Miami.

2219
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
That's not an RPG, but that's a really good game.

2220
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
You can shoot a lot of people and dogs.

2221
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
So, alright.

2222
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
I think we've given you about 25 suggestions.

2223
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
You have. You've given me plenty of suggestions.

2224
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:43,000
And that's...

2225
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:48,000
And the very last thing is, so I'm still waiting with microphones,

2226
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:51,000
trying to figure out how to get you guys set up.

2227
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
Well, it sounds like you might...

2228
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
Which we're very lucky to be in that position.

2229
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
We had our emailer earlier who also was...

2230
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:00,000
So maybe like we get one guy to get the stands and one...

2231
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
Because Dave was talking to messages about maybe like a USB

2232
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
that could pick us all up or something, so...

2233
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
And some people to make a down payment on a new house for me

2234
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:07,000
so we can build a studio in the backyard.

2235
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:08,000
Yeah, right.

2236
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,000
I'm gonna be...

2237
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
We're trying to switch studios next month.

2238
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:14,000
It may or may not happen at this point, but we'll see.

2239
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:17,000
It'll be a good chance for us to really think about some of that stuff, so...

2240
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:18,000
I really appreciate it.

2241
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,000
Yeah, I really appreciate it.

2242
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:20,000
So, we'll be in touch.

2243
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:21,000
But thanks for listening.

2244
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:26,000
Also, Dave, sorry not sorry about my voice, how it sounds in your car.

2245
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:29,000
No, see, I love his voice.

2246
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
His voice is just so deep and it's so booming.

2247
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:32,000
Isn't it?

2248
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:33,000
That's why he's the announcer.

2249
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
That's why I got fired.

2250
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:39,000
Alright, well, I might be out in LA at the end of the month for a photography project of mine.

2251
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
We are nowhere near LA.

2252
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
Ah, well, I'll be in the same state.

2253
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Alright, close.

2254
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:45,000
But we like Disneyland.

2255
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:46,000
We do love Disneyland.

2256
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:47,000
We give that recommendation.

2257
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:51,000
And I would say this, we want to know, follow up with us what you bought on Steam and what you thought of it.

2258
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:52,000
Will do.

2259
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:53,000
Alright.

2260
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:54,000
Thanks, guys.

2261
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:55,000
Take care, buddy.

2262
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:56,000
You too, bye.

2263
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Alright, bye.

2264
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:58,000
Alright, can we squeeze in...

2265
03:06:58,000 --> 03:06:59,000
Oops.

2266
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:00,000
That's what I get for not muting it.

2267
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:01,000
We need one more squeeze in one more car.

2268
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Okay, bye.

2269
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:03,000
I know you gotta go soon.

2270
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:04,000
I do need to go.

2271
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:05,000
Alright.

2272
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:08,000
Because it's already past a quarter after and I need to be in bed in 40 minutes.

2273
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,000
That's fine.

2274
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:10,000
I understand.

2275
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:13,000
Dar Sakura, before you take off, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2276
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
Fuck 6 a.m.

2277
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:16,000
No, I'm kidding.

2278
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
I'm grateful to have a job.

2279
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:21,000
I love my job working at Lokat.

2280
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:22,000
Cool job, Lokat.

2281
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Cool job, Lokat.

2282
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
You're not kidding about 6 a.m., though.

2283
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:26,000
No.

2284
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Fuck 6 a.m.

2285
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:28,000
No, but you know what?

2286
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
It's good because I'll start my regular schedule next week.

2287
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:32,000
This is our...

2288
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:33,000
We call it nesting.

2289
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:37,000
So I'm going to be learning a whole lot and I'm looking forward to getting a start on

2290
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:38,000
my career.

2291
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:39,000
So she won't be cutting out early every time.

2292
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
This is like the last time for a little bit.

2293
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:42,000
For a little bit.

2294
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
And hopefully I'll be able to keep on with late schedules.

2295
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:45,000
Alright.

2296
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:46,000
Sounds good.

2297
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:47,000
Alright.

2298
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:48,000
Alright.

2299
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:49,000
Bye.

2300
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:50,000
Bye.

2301
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:51,000
Drive safe.

2302
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
Alright, I just saw somebody calling in but Dar Sakura was talking and I didn't want to

2303
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:54,000
cut her off with a call.

2304
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:55,000
So try again.

2305
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:59,000
1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2306
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:02,000
San Fran Boy on Twitter, username SFRedHead.

2307
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
Oh, are you on top of the tweets for me?

2308
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:05,000
Thank you.

2309
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:06,000
Sends us an image from a Tumblr post.

2310
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:11,000
WalkingMyHellHound says, if I've learned anything from video games, it is that when you meet

2311
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:14,000
enemies, it means that you're going in the right direction.

2312
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:18,000
And the re-blogs and quotes and everything talk about, wow, that's incredibly profound.

2313
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:19,000
It was.

2314
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:20,000
It was a good quote.

2315
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Alright, we do have that call coming in.

2316
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:23,000
So let me get to it.

2317
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,000
This will be our last call tonight.

2318
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:25,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2319
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:26,000
Who's this?

2320
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:27,000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

2321
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:28,000
Hey, Akdeft.

2322
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
Pretty good, pretty good.

2323
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:38,000
I wanted to talk about something, you know, you're already tired of it, but it's something

2324
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:45,000
really curious that I saw today while out doing stuff.

2325
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:53,000
I saw a copy of FIFA 14 for the Wii, the original Wii.

2326
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:54,000
Right.

2327
03:08:54,000 --> 03:09:03,000
And I was thinking, didn't EA say that they didn't want to make the Wii U version because

2328
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:08,000
they didn't have the resources and they didn't want to do it basically?

2329
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:18,000
Meanwhile, here in Mexico, I can find FIFA 14 for every console, even old ones like the PS2.

2330
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:23,000
The PS2, the PlayStation 2 has a version of FIFA 14.

2331
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:24,000
I'm not kidding.

2332
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:28,000
I thought PlayStation 2 games were officially done with the, I thought the Final Fantasy

2333
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
11 expansion was last time.

2334
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:34,000
Technically, yes, but all they did was just reskin the last year's, well I should say

2335
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:38,000
by now it's probably like FIFA 12 and FIFA 11 that they're reskinning, but that's all

2336
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:39,000
it is.

2337
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:40,000
Same with the Wii version.

2338
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:45,000
In fact, they even have a call out now I think on the P, the Vita version.

2339
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:51,000
It's like the Legacy Edition or something like that, which is basically just a reskin.

2340
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:55,000
Yeah, so Loki is basically saying they just changed the 13 to a 14.

2341
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:56,000
That's a fair point.

2342
03:09:56,000 --> 03:10:00,000
Yeah, that's basically, sorry, that's basically what they did.

2343
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:08,000
They have, I took a picture of the box art and yeah, it has a label that says Legacy

2344
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:12,000
Edition or Elisiana Legado in Spanish.

2345
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:19,000
But, it's something that struck me like curious because they didn't want to make the FIFA

2346
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:24,000
14 version for the Wii U, but they did make the other ones.

2347
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:32,000
Even though, and especially like Loki said, they just reskinned the previous versions

2348
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,000
to a new one.

2349
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:34,000
Just a roster update.

2350
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:39,000
Why didn't they do the same with FIFA 13 on the Wii U?

2351
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:44,000
It's something that I'm seriously trying to understand, but I don't know.

2352
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:47,000
Well technically they did that way I think with the Wii U version.

2353
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:51,000
It was like a, it was a port of something else I think.

2354
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:55,000
EA is definitely doing the shots fired type of thing with the Wii U I think.

2355
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:58,000
I just, I do a double take at the picture of your box art.

2356
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:59,000
I saw you link it in chat there.

2357
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:02,000
When it says $799 I'm like, what?

2358
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:05,000
Then I have to remember, oh wait, that's not our money.

2359
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
That's a different country's money.

2360
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
Yeah, that's Tesla's.

2361
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:12,000
It's just around $60 I think.

2362
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:15,000
Yeah, Matt's in chat said $60, yeah.

2363
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:20,000
It boils down to the fact that on systems that have already had a FIFA release, the

2364
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
assets already exist, the engine already exists.

2365
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:26,000
They may fix bugs, maybe, but they also might not.

2366
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:30,000
They might just leave it to, you know, whatever's going to wind up happening.

2367
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:38,000
It's trivial to change a game's text and get close enough body models and, you know,

2368
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:41,000
put them in place of new talent that may look different.

2369
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Just pick the right race and get the face close enough and whatever.

2370
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
It's detailed enough as it is already.

2371
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
The Wii U is different from the Wii.

2372
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:55,000
It requires different work and it requires additional work to perform.

2373
03:11:55,000 --> 03:12:00,000
That's, unfortunately, that's their justification and that's where this is coming from.

2374
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:07,000
Yeah, I do understand that, but seriously, they're doing the, I still gather the Wii

2375
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:15,000
is still selling some games or releasing on a minimal amount, but the PlayStation 2, seriously.

2376
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:20,000
They released FIFA 13 and now 14 for the PS2.

2377
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:24,000
It's the only game that's getting released on that console.

2378
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:30,000
It's something that if they're going to put resources on something, why not the Wii U?

2379
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:32,000
It's my question, basically.

2380
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,000
There's still a lot of PS2s out.

2381
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:37,000
There's more PS2s out in circulation than there is Wii U.

2382
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:40,000
So it's very true.

2383
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:41,000
That's true.

2384
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:49,000
It is a strange call, but EA's clearly having a hissy fit with Nintendo, so it is what it is.

2385
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:52,000
All right, Act Def, I gotta let you go so we wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

2386
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:53,000
Appreciate it.

2387
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:54,000
Thanks for having me.

2388
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:55,000
Of course.

2389
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:56,000
Anytime, buddy.

2390
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:57,000
Take care.

2391
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:58,000
All right.

2392
03:12:58,000 --> 03:12:59,000
There we go.

2393
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:00,000
Bye bye.

2394
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:02,000
And thank you very much to all those that called tonight.

2395
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:03,000
I'm sorry if you didn't get through.

2396
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:10,000
We are going to close up the Skype line for now, but try again next week or send us an

2397
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:11,000
email.

2398
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:16,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us an email as well.

2399
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:17,000
Do we have other tweets?

2400
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
The quick, quick, quick Twitter topics.

2401
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:24,000
Tigerclaw sent us into Sony Pictures Entertainment and is negotiating with Seth Gordon to direct

2402
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:30,000
Uncharted, the movie all up in the air, of course, but obviously a lot of excitement

2403
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
coming around for that.

2404
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:38,000
A protest game puts Russian President Vladimir Putin in gay-friendly Sochi Winter Olympics

2405
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:39,000
competition.

2406
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:41,000
I'm sure I don't need to go too much into the backstory of this.

2407
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:44,000
Russia had a big anti-gay...

2408
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:48,000
I don't remember to what extent it was out in the media, but they had a big kerfuffle

2409
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:49,000
months ago.

2410
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:53,000
Flash forward to Sochi Olympics and it's kind of a big deal.

2411
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:54,000
That's related to this.

2412
03:13:54,000 --> 03:14:01,000
That's also why Google has their, for lack of a better term, pride doodle still in place.

2413
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:04,000
I expect it probably will be throughout the entirety of the Olympics.

2414
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:08,000
If you actually go to Google.com or use any of the Google apps, you can see it right there

2415
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:09,000
front and center.

2416
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
It's very resounding.

2417
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
It's very good of them.

2418
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:20,000
And then I already read the Twitter, the Tumblr, rather, the Tumblr post.

2419
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:25,000
One other thing that I really, really wanted to get out is that I read an op-ed this morning

2420
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:31,000
on IndieGamerChick.com, written by an individual named Kathy, who's apparently been doing this

2421
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
for about two and a half years.

2422
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:36,000
And she basically, this article is called The Indie Ego.

2423
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:41,000
It's still the most recent one on the site, again, IndieGamerChick.com.

2424
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:47,000
And she really breaks down the indie community, how things have been portrayed by the very

2425
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:50,000
prominent and vocal members that people may know.

2426
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:53,000
Such hate naming names, but let's be completely honest.

2427
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:57,000
Team Meat, Jonathan Blow, Phil Fish, i.e.

2428
03:14:57,000 --> 03:15:02,000
Indie Game the Movie, and a lot of other developers that you just see.

2429
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:05,000
Notch, Magnus, Peterson, Peterson?

2430
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,000
Crap, I forgot his last name.

2431
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:08,000
Notch.

2432
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:09,000
These...

2433
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:10,000
Magnus Pearson.

2434
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:11,000
Yeah, there you go.

2435
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:12,000
Thank you.

2436
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:20,000
She really, really takes the indie mentality, the good side and the bad side, and again,

2437
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:27,000
this article named The Indie Ego, really breaks down why you should not be insular

2438
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:32,000
and exclusive as an indie, because it does a really big disservice to you.

2439
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:33,000
It's a great article.

2440
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:34,000
Please go give it a read.

2441
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:36,000
It was incredibly well written.

2442
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:38,000
Kathy, well done.

2443
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
It came across in a retweet on Twitter.

2444
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:42,000
I sat down, I read the whole thing.

2445
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,000
It was absolutely fantastic.

2446
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:46,000
Alright.

2447
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:49,000
Is that it for Twitter topics?

2448
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:54,000
Not at all related to anything, but a couple of my coworkers have retweeted this thing,

2449
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
San Francisco Emergency Scanner.

2450
03:15:56,000 --> 03:16:00,000
San Francisco Police Department responding to reports of a homeless man operating a cherry

2451
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:01,000
picker on the sidewalk.

2452
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
In the rain and all of the weather that's frick-

2453
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:07,000
He just, he needs some cherries.

2454
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:11,000
I chuckled, and I was very sad at chuckling, and yeah, I just had to get that out there.

2455
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:16,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us a tweet for next week, but unfortunately

2456
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,000
Jason will not be here to read it.

2457
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:22,000
Before we get to the end of the show here, and I go around and hear everybody's final

2458
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:25,000
thought and so forth, I just really want to thank you, Jason, for all you've done for

2459
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:26,000
Orange Launch Radio.

2460
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:27,000
Absolutely.

2461
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:30,000
I mean, God, I'm making it sound like you're leaving, which you are and you aren't.

2462
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:35,000
We all know that, but again, we would not have a website if not for Jason.

2463
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:39,000
We would not have the YouTube thing if not for Jason, and I know you guys have only really

2464
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:44,000
heard him for the past three months, but there's a lot of soul to this show that is thanks

2465
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:48,000
to Jason, so I just, I really, really thank you for your efforts to help make O-L-R what

2466
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:49,000
it is.

2467
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:51,000
It's been a good decade, and it's been even better last year.

2468
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:52,000
All right.

2469
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:53,000
Amazing.

2470
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:54,000
You are welcome back anytime.

2471
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:57,000
There's always a chair here for you, even though this studio might not be here.

2472
03:16:57,000 --> 03:17:03,000
Wherever we are, you can just drive that cherry picker on over and have a seat at the table

2473
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:04,000
with us.

2474
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:06,000
That's when I drove in here today.

2475
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:08,000
Because you won't fly, so you have to drive something.

2476
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:09,000
All right.

2477
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:12,000
In all seriousness, Jason, thank you, thank you for being here.

2478
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:16,000
Anything you want to promote of your own self-worth or what have you before I get your final

2479
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:17,000
thought and all that?

2480
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:20,000
I'm on Twitter, and I tweet way too much random shit.

2481
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:21,000
Sometimes it's meaningful.

2482
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:24,000
Once out of every, like, 100 maybe, twitter.com slash VX Jason XV.

2483
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:26,000
Easy to find.

2484
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:27,000
Say hi.

2485
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:28,000
You know, whatever.

2486
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:29,000
All right.

2487
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:32,000
And you'll still be able to do calls and other things, so it's not the last of Jason.

2488
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:33,000
I call.

2489
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:36,000
I interject my opinion into the video from time to time.

2490
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:37,000
You'll be back in, like, a month.

2491
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:38,000
I'm back.

2492
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:39,000
Oh, I got snowed in.

2493
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:40,000
Sorry.

2494
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:41,000
Can I be here for another episode?

2495
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:42,000
Yeah.

2496
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:43,000
Any time.

2497
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:44,000
Any time.

2498
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:45,000
It'll be funny.

2499
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:46,000
It'll actually be hilarious at this point.

2500
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:47,000
We give you this big fanfare goodbye, and then, like, in two weeks, you're back.

2501
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:48,000
What's up, guys?

2502
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:52,000
You come back before Loki's able to get back.

2503
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:55,000
That would be some kind of irony.

2504
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:57,000
All right.

2505
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,000
Last final thought for our listeners tonight?

2506
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:00,000
Keep warm.

2507
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:01,000
Stay safe.

2508
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:02,000
It's been a great three months.

2509
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:04,000
I hope everybody else agrees, just in general.

2510
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:05,000
Have fun.

2511
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:06,000
Enjoy your games.

2512
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:11,000
This is a good point for me to always say what I do every week, as much as I'm begging,

2513
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:14,000
but for real, we don't ask for any money to do this show.

2514
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:16,000
If you like Orange on the Radio, please help spread the word.

2515
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:17,000
Help grow our family.

2516
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:19,000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2517
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:24,000
A nice review on iTunes or Stitcher goes a real long way, and we just really appreciate it.

2518
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:28,000
I know we said a lot about reviews, but no, seriously, because of that culture we're in,

2519
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:33,000
those help get the promotion and the exposure, and it goes a long way.

2520
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:39,000
Yeah, it helps us stand out amongst all the other corporate-based shows that are out there

2521
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:43,000
that have a lot of money and built-in hits to be able to fund that stuff.

2522
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:44,000
Thank you very much.

2523
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:45,000
I appreciate it.

2524
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:49,000
Thank you all for being here and listening and staying with the show all night.

2525
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:51,000
Loki, I haven't forgotten about you.

2526
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:55,000
I can't wait for you to be back in studio, but again, take all the time you need with the new baby.

2527
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:57,000
I'm glad to hear things are going well.

2528
03:18:57,000 --> 03:19:00,000
Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2529
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:05,000
No, I'll try to be working a little bit more on the Minecraft server this week,

2530
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:09,000
although we haven't had a lot of people commenting in threads and stuff, but I've been doing a lot of tweaks.

2531
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:15,000
I haven't been on in a while, honestly, but I did finish my underground tunnel thing I was building,

2532
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
so I've got to find another project to do.

2533
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:24,000
Well, I'm working on, I may test out trying to do, was it Bucket Forge or whatever,

2534
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:31,000
it was MCPC Plus or something, and that basically allows you to add Forge mods,

2535
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:36,000
which are new graphics and stuff, so it's a little bit more complicated,

2536
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:42,000
but you can have totally new mobs, totally new blocks, totally new things that aren't normally in there.

2537
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:45,000
So it'll be interesting if I can get that to work.

2538
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,000
Well, come join us on the VOG Minecraft server.

2539
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:50,000
All the details are at vognetwork.com in the forums.

2540
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:52,000
Some kind words for Jason as well.

2541
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:55,000
I don't know if you saw that in chat, but act-def says,

2542
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:59,000
Jason shall not be missed, considering he now does the intro voiceovers.

2543
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:00,000
Oh yeah, I missed the most important part.

2544
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:01,000
And the outro.

2545
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:02,000
And the passphrase.

2546
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:04,000
Yeah, and the passphrase for the podcast folks.

2547
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:08,000
Ray Genator says, VX JasonXV needs his own VOG show.

2548
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:12,000
Well, I hope he will find something he's passionate about and send us a pitch.

2549
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:14,000
Ideas. Ideas are a-brewin'.

2550
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:16,000
Alright, cook them up. Let them simmer. Let's hear it.

2551
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:17,000
Let's hear it.

2552
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:18,000
Alright.

2553
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:22,000
Loki, we'll see you next week, although it might be via Skype again, but have a good week, okay?

2554
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:23,000
Yeah, you too.

2555
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:29,000
Alright, and I guess my final thought is, again, I could be dead next week.

2556
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:34,000
So, just, oh god, wouldn't that be sick if something really did happen?

2557
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:35,000
No.

2558
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:40,000
Here's the thing, I'm just, I am stressed like so much right now, but it'll be good.

2559
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:44,000
Things will be good, and then there's so much to look forward to this year.

2560
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:51,000
There's a lot of great things in store, and yeah, I'm in a happy place, and I hope you guys are all in a happy place as well.

2561
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:54,000
Thank you guys all for your support. It means so much.

2562
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:56,000
We'll be back here to do it again next week.

2563
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:58,000
Have a great night everybody. Bye.

2564
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:01,000
