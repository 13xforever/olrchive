00:14.000 --> 00:27.000

00:31.000 --> 00:49.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 538 for this February the 2nd of 2014. Happy Puppy Bowl Sunday everybody. It's a big big day today.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Kitten Bowl

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
Kitten Bowl, Puppy Bowl. Hey, my name is Rob Roberts and that other voice you hear over there is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Sup bitches.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
How you doing Jamie?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Um, feisty.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Were you really excited about all the big games going on today?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Well yeah, I played some Mass Effect today and it was great.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
That's the only game you need right?

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Well yeah. Now that I've got text mod working.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
There you go, there you go. So have you watched the Puppy Bowl or the Kitty Bowl yet and how did you choose?

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
No, I didn't watch any but I've been looking at Tumblr and Tumblr has been taking care of it for me because then I can watch both through the power of animated gifs.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
That's true.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
GIFS!

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
Who needs picture in picture and all that stuff anymore when you just have Twitter and it just tells you everything you need to know and Facebook and all that stuff.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
Well that and they were talking about the sports ball stuff in the front room and I felt my brain shutting down and my eyes glazing over and I had to leave.

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
We do tape live and if you're joining us live and skipping the big football game to listen to our show, first off thanks, we really appreciate it.

01:48.000 --> 02:00.000
If you are participating with us, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:00.000 --> 02:09.000
Loki is not here tonight, Techmaster Loki, as y'all know, they had a new baby a couple weeks ago, Loki and Mrs. Loki, so he is still off on baby leave.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
He'll be back soon, we don't know if he'll be back next week or the week after.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
Jason has been filling in a lot lately but he is also not here tonight because of course the Super Bowl stuff going on, he decided to go to a party and he's earned it.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
He comes here from San Francisco which is quite the drive every week or so.

02:26.000 --> 02:39.000
But, you know what, because I know a lot of you are distracted with the big game going on, I got a few stunts up my own sleeve here on how we can have ourselves a heck of a show here on the Big Puppy Bowl Sunday.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
So we've got some special guests in studio, one of them I told you was going to be here and he is here in the house, he hasn't been on Orange Lawn's radio in a very long time.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
But you might know of him from his frequent phone calls to the show or his time on Horde House.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Everybody say hello to Shane.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Hello.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
How you doing Shane?

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm okay, my old co-worker needs some contact information for work.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
Wait, so you're having to work during the show, you haven't come to the show in five years and you want to work during the show?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
The mic is really fuzzy.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah, because I have a cat, I don't know what to tell you.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, just real quick, you can keep talking, I'll pretend I'm listening.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
Alright, so what brings you out here to California? You're visiting from Kansas, why do you live in Kansas?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Because it's where I live.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Alright, well you're out here in California, why?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
An airplane took me here.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Okay, that's a very good answer.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
What are you here to plug or promote these days? Do you have like a Twitter or something? I don't know.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
What egotistical way should you promote yourself today?

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
I don't know. I don't plug anything. I plug my ears when I'm listening to this show or Horde House.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Hey, hey, watch it, watch it.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
He plugs in his charger.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Fine, then you know what, we're going to move on.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
Shane, believe it or not, I don't know how, but has fans in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
SJ100matt says, yay Shane. Tigerclaw says, well Shane's got to pay them bills so he has to work no matter what.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
So, alright, fine, we'll check back in with you later.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
I do have some other guests here in studio tonight, this is very exciting.

04:17.000 --> 04:26.000
I promised some big stunts for Puppy Bowl Sunday and I can't think of a bigger stunt than this guy I'm about to introduce.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
Everybody say hello to, from the Horde House podcast, Extafur is here live in studio.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Oh hello there Rob.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Hello Extafur.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Hello.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
How are you doing?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm doing fantastic. How are you doing?

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
I'm better now that you're here and that you're a part of Orange Lawns Radio officially.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
You haven't been on this show in a very long time. I know we've lived together.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
It's been perhaps seven years?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
It's been about that long.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, it's been a long time.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Ever since Orange Lawns Radio was its own network and we had Extafur's case of the Mondays.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Right.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
So, what have you been up to for the last seven years?

05:06.000 --> 05:15.000
Oh, you know, getting fat, getting skinny, then getting fat again, then getting skinny again. You know, I'm Oprah. That's what I'm saying.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, for the listeners who don't know, you did lose a lot of weight. You lost what, like 120 some odd pounds?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
She lost a supermodel.

05:24.000 --> 05:33.000
I was at 1.335 pounds and I was down to 195 at one point.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
And it all happened because my doctor said I was high cholesterol.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
And because my liver enzymes are too high, I had to do it by myself. I had to diet by myself.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
I couldn't rely on any gimmicks or medications or anything like that.

05:50.000 --> 05:59.000
So I just kicked my ass and I went to the gym and I grew this passion for the gym.

05:59.000 --> 06:09.000
So now I regularly go. I try to go at least five times a week. And I love it. Are you guys hearing me?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
No, no, you're fine. The gym is the best thing ever.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yes.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Once you get hooked on going, then you really get hooked on going.

06:15.000 --> 06:25.000
Yes, and it's good to have a habit. Build the habit of going. And I'm just loving it. So that's my...

06:25.000 --> 06:35.000
Now, since this is a program about video games and video gaming and all that stuff, did you use any of the Wii Fit or any of the technology stuff?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
No, but I do have a Fitbit.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Do you?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Me too.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I have the Fitbit Flex, the one that you wear on your wrist.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I have the one that you put on your pants.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, my sister has that one. She puts it in her bra.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Me too, when you guys aren't here.

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
I believe you. I really enjoy the Fitbit. I haven't worn it in a little while because after the move I think I misplaced it.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
We just moved into our own house.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
And so anyways, yeah, but it's good. I don't rely on gimmicks like that though. I didn't use Wii Fit.

07:15.000 --> 07:30.000
I train with a trainer and I actually last year, like in September, decided that I wanted to do a program to learn to become a personal trainer myself.

07:30.000 --> 07:48.000
So I tried to stick with that. I kind of fell off the bandwagon about October and it's taken me a lot of energy to try and get back on that.

07:48.000 --> 07:58.000
But I'm hoping that once I regain my focus and everything that I can pick that right back up again and finish it.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, you look like you're doing fine to me.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Thank you.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
You're welcome. So let's talk about video games a little bit.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Okay.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
You obviously, I'm sure a lot of our listeners know, you are one of the hosts of Horde House. Hordehouse.com if you want to check that out.

08:11.000 --> 08:19.000
And do you have any other internet projects going on these days? Like Twitters to Pimp or Facebooks or other ego promotion things?

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, I stream regularly at Twitch.com. Twitch.tv slash E-X-T-O-P-H-E-R.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Why do you have to spell it all weird?

08:31.000 --> 08:41.000
Well, the way I usually spell Extrofer was taken so I had to kind of improvise. So, E-X-T-O-P-H-E-R.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And what types of games do you stream?

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I stream a lot of Rayman Legends.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Are you a fan?

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
If you like Rayman Legends then my channel is what you want to watch. I love that game so much.

08:54.000 --> 09:04.000
It's kind of funny because our show, Horde House, is online games and I tend to talk about console games every single time we have a show.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Well, console games are an online experience.

09:06.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah, there are many console games that have online experiences but I've just been in a very big console gaming phase.

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
And so a lot of the games I stream are very single player games that are very limited with their online connectivity.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
I stream the entirety of Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Which I still haven't finished but it's good. I've played that. You were hyping that up on Horde.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah, I cried on my stream.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Baby.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
I know. It was pretty pathetic. You can call me a pussy if you want. It's fine.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Although I don't have a vagina. Rob does.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Lies. And girl bits should never be used as an insult.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
No, no, no. I think that his vagina is very empowering.

09:53.000 --> 10:01.000
It makes me feel like a butterfly in springtime is what I want to say.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
So it makes you feel douchely fresh?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Just stop.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Yes. I feel like I'm in touch with Summer's Eve.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Just stop.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
And you guys expect this from me by the way because I coined bleach asshole on this.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
At my house.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
You invented them.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
At my house.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Let's see.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Anyways, so yeah.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Do you think they'll make a follow-up to Brothers called Sisters?

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Isn't that a Lifetime show?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
No, I think you're thinking Sister, Sister.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, there might have been a Lifetime show called Sisters.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
No, I don't think they will. I think this one was pretty contained in itself.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
You should play it. It's really good. It's only a three hour game.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
It's really good.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Codeman's in our chat saying he was watching the stream and he cried watching it.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
That doesn't surprise me.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
I haven't cried yet, but I'm only in chapter four.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
You haven't gotten to the crying bits yet.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Excuse me.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Alright.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
We'll get to your gaming week a little later, but let's talk about how did you get into video games?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I mean, you are a bit more of a nerd than you lead on sometimes.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
How did you get into video gaming and all that?

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
Well, when I was growing up, I mean, I grew up with video games.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
We had an Atari growing up.

11:20.000 --> 11:28.000
I wasn't that much into it, but when it was Easter and it was like 1985 or something,

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
and my parents came home with a Nintendo Entertainment System for my brother and I,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
and it was really aimed at my brother more than me,

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
but it really ended up being me that played it most of the time.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
And I absolutely loved it.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
I played all of the trademark Nintendo games,

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
Super Mario Brothers, Zelda, Kid Icarus, all of those things.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
And I just really loved all of them.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
My favorite one was Metroid, and that started it all.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And then we got a Sega Genesis.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
We were the first family on the block to have a Sega Genesis.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
So, of course, all the kids.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
So you're the most popular kid on the block.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Well, when it came to video games, I was kind of a wuss and got made fun of a lot in school.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
But when it came to, yeah, yes, they called me a girl and I was bullied in school quite a bit.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
What's wrong with being a girl?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Nothing, but they used it as an insult to me.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Which we can all blame the patriarchy for.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
They used it as an insult to me, and I was very much bullied in school.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
But video games were my way of just escaping,

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
and a lot of kids on my block would come over and watch me play Sonic,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
and I loved that. It was my element.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
And then when we got a Super Nintendo, we got a Sega CD,

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
we got the Game Gear, we got Game Boys.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
We had pretty much every system you could think of except for Neo Geo, those really niche systems.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Only the really rich kids could afford that.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
My friend had a Neo Geo and a Turbo Graphics CD or whatever, PC Engine.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
The Duo.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah, and he was awesome because whenever I got to go to his house, it was like Christmas,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
because I got to see the games that I couldn't normally play.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
But that was what ruled my life when I was younger, was video games.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I got two more questions for you, and then I want to move on because we have one more guest here in the studio.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I don't want to make him sit there quietly much longer.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
But I got two questions for you.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
The first, since you brought up Nintendo, this kind of got me thinking that on Hoard House,

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
you've often been quite a defender of the Wii U on the show,

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
and that you're a big fan of the Wii U console, and Nintendo's been a lot in the news lately.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
We're going to get into some of the recent developments tonight with their latest investors meeting.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
Obviously, I'm sure you saw all the news out there about Wii U flopped and all this stuff that was out there.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
A, what do you think about all that news as a Nintendo fan?

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
And B, what do you think people are missing about Wii U?

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
Well, I don't consider myself a huge proponent of Nintendo.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
I don't feel like I'm a big Nintendo fanboy, but I do really like the Wii U.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I feel like it's a fine system.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
I think that people write it off because of its name and the fact that it's Nintendo,

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
and we're not used to having Nintendo consoles really put out a lot of good third-party titles and stuff like that.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
And that's all understandable, but I don't know.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
I think that Nintendo has a pretty tough job.

14:39.000 --> 14:47.000
They need to sell people on this system, and I don't really have anything to say other than that, really.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
What do you think people are missing about the Wii U?

14:53.000 --> 15:03.000
Well, I don't know. You're missing some good, exclusive games that Nintendo has brought out.

15:03.000 --> 15:11.000
Obviously, Rayman Legends was brought out for every platform, really, but it's the definitive experience on the Wii U.

15:11.000 --> 15:18.000
And if you haven't played it on the Wii U, then you're really missing out on a really great co-op experience.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
And I say this, I have that game on three different platforms.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
So I really feel like I know what I'm talking about when it comes to that experience.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
And there's other games that share the experience.

15:32.000 --> 15:39.000
I know that a lot of people don't like Nintendo for their gimmicks and stuff like that.

15:39.000 --> 15:46.000
I go back and forth on it, but I feel that if you have a gimmick, you can do it right.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
And I think that with a lot of their games, they have done it right.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And I think that's really important.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
It is possible to have a gimmick.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
A lot of people wrote off the DS when it first came out, right?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
People thought that was going to be a gimmick. Look at that now.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
No comment.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
She's playing hers right now, just for the record.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I'd probably have bred with people.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Going to our chatroom for some comments on those questions too.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Locopoco says, just give me Bayonetta 2 soon and no one gets hurt. Right?

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Tech2030 says, Wii U is so great. I play it in bed on the gamepad before I go to sleep.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Dartitsuya says, oh yeah, I love mine. Mario 3D World, freaking great.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
So we got a lot of Wii U supporters in the chatroom.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
We'll talk a little more about the Nintendo stuff later.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I'm very curious to hear what you have to say about that.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Alright, totally different direction, but I have a second question for you.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
Since you do this show, Horde House, with me, the online games show, right?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
What's been your favorite experience with online games?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Because I figure you've played a lot of them. And why?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
What's been your favorite online gaming experience and why?

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
My favorite online gaming experience was probably World of Warcraft.

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
Back when the Wrath of the Lich King expansion was the big deal.

17:00.000 --> 17:09.000
And the reason why is because it's when I got into a real hardcore gaming type mode, I guess.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
And I got accepted into a really high-end guild on a server.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
And I got to beat a lot of endgame content with that guild.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
And it was just really fun. It was like a rush.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
And the thing is, it was very brief lasting.

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
I only was doing the hardcore gaming rating thing for just maybe about six months.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
Compared to the six years that I played WoW.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
And yet it was one of the best experiences I ever had.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
Ulduar, that dungeon in particular, that was my favorite dungeon experience.

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
And I think that I'll always hold that as probably my favorite online gaming experience.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
You made friends with that that you still talk to pretty regularly.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, I do. And they're all good people.

17:59.000 --> 18:10.000
And I like that. As much as I don't like WoW now, I still hold that as a very good, solid experience.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
MMOs are really kind of unique in that.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
Well, Shane's sitting right here. And Shane and I met on LiveJournal over Animal Crossing.

18:20.000 --> 18:27.000
I remember that. But I kind of feel like we really got to know each other and kind of got closer because of Final Fantasy XI.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Yeah, I think so. That sounds right.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Kind of interesting how MMOs work like that.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
Before I move on to Matt, since it looks like you're wrapped up with your work stuff, what's been your favorite online gaming experience?

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I'm playing Phoenix Wright, so no, I'm not wrapped up with my work stuff.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Oh, excuse me. Objection!

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
What's been your favorite online gaming experience?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Fantasy Star Online.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh, that's a good answer. Why?

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
It is. Because I almost failed a semester of high school because of it. Because it was so good. That's how amazing to me it was.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Are you playing too?

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
I did for a little bit, and then I decided not to.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
It was fun, I think.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It was okay. I just...

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It's weird that they won't release it here.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Sega, they're dumb.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
Well, let's move on. I want to introduce our other guest who's been sitting there very patiently waiting.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Say hello, everybody, to Matt, who's here joining us in studio as well.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Hello.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Hi. Not to be confused with Loki.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
Just so you know, you're going to want to get that mic nice and close to you when you talk, because Xtrfer is really loud, so you've got to be about the same.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
How are you, Matt?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I am pretty good. Good to be here.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah, I know. We're happy to have you.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
You play a lot of online games, too. Let's start with that.

19:31.000 --> 19:41.000
Because I really feel like, since I've known you, I've probably known you for about a year and a half, since you and Xtrfer have been friends.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
I've known you for about a year and a half, and I feel like every online game I've played in that time, I've played with you at some point.

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
We played Path of Exile for two days. You played League of Legends. We played Final Fantasy XIV extensively, obviously.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
What's been an online game you've really enjoyed and liked a lot?

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
The game I like the most is League of Legends. I'm really hardcore with that. I play it all the time.

20:04.000 --> 20:14.000
I go into phases, actually. Depending on the MMO that's coming up, usually I'm playing that. Like right now, we're in Final Fantasy XIV.

20:14.000 --> 20:22.000
I took a break from League of Legends when I started Final Fantasy XIV, and then I went home for Christmas, and all my cousins are like,

20:22.000 --> 20:30.000
Matt, play League of Legends. And so I play League of Legends. I like a lot of board games, too, actually. I played Dominion a lot.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh, right. You introduced Alan and I to some really cool board games. Dominion's fun.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
Dominion's a lot of fun. I bet we have a lot of board game geeks out there listening. What are some of your favorite board games you've played?

20:39.000 --> 20:49.000
Dominion's definitely one of my favorites. I like Race for the Galaxy. The same designer for Dominion also made a game called Kingdom Builder, which is really fun.

20:50.000 --> 21:00.000
I've tried a game similar to the Dominion style. It's called Marvel Legendary, but it's with a Marvel theme, and that's a lot of fun.

21:00.000 --> 21:08.000
I like playing more strategic games. I played Le Havre over Christmas, and that was a lot of fun. I don't know if you know any of those games.

21:08.000 --> 21:17.000
No, but I'll smile and nod. I like board games, too, though, and every time my friends that are really into them introduce me to them,

21:17.000 --> 21:25.000
I never have a bad time. The ones you've introduced me to were great. Tim, who was on the show a while ago, he was into some board games, too.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
We played The House on the Haunted Hill or something like that. That was a lot of fun. I love that one.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
Dan's still trying to work on completing our dungeon quest.

21:34.000 --> 21:43.000
I have some friends here locally that are into some games. One of my friends here had a night at the comic book shop where we all went and played Sentinels of the Multiverse, and that was a lot of fun.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I have not tried that one.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
That was a lot of fun. That was a fun card game.

21:47.000 --> 21:59.000
Let me get this out there, because this is pretty cool. You actually work in the games industry, and it's important to say you're here as yourself tonight, not representing your company.

21:59.000 --> 22:07.000
I can't go too far down this rabbit hole asking about the game, but you worked on a game that I'm sure a lot of our music game fans know, right?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Rocksmith 2014?

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
Yep, and Rocksmith, the first one, and Rocksmith 2014. I'm our game designer for it.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Awesome, and everybody should go buy it and check it out, right?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Yes, they should. It's a lot of fun.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Available on Amazon.com.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And retailers near you, right?

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah, Exover is the greatest, my greatest cheerleader.

22:27.000 --> 22:37.000
So even though I can't go too far down that path asking you questions of that tonight, I can say that if you look at some of the Rocksmith trailers that are out there and some of the behind-the-scenes video, you can see Matt in them.

22:37.000 --> 22:46.000
Yeah, you can see me a little bit. I'm not in a lot of them, but I'm the Asian guy with yellow glasses.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
By the way, Shane got to play a little bit of Rocksmith 2014.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I did. It's fantastic.

22:52.000 --> 23:04.000
I haven't played it. I'm such a bad friend, but I don't have the guitar and all that, and I've never really had the drive to learn to play, but everybody tells me Rocksmith is so good.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
This is before I met you.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
We actually have people in my training class who are totally into it.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Yeah.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
See, I want to be able to ask him questions like, how does it feel to have killed Rock Band, but I can't go down that path.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
I would love to play it, but I legitimately can't because of my hand.

23:20.000 --> 23:32.000
All right, let me go to the questions I can. So everybody check out Rocksmith 2014, but let me ask you the questions I can't ask you, and that is, what made you want to get into game design? Why did you choose that path in life?

23:32.000 --> 23:43.000
I've always loved games growing up. I grew up with a Nintendo and a Super Nintendo, and my childhood friends would always be like, oh, let's start a video game company.

23:43.000 --> 23:53.000
In my spare time, I'd write new spells for Final Fantasy. Just because I was really into it, I wanted to make a game.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
Okay, I love that you fess up to this stuff because so many people did nerdy shit like that but won't fess up to it.

23:58.000 --> 24:05.000
And I remember being in grade school, we would draw those dungeon games on pencil and paper. Like, did anybody else do this in their school?

24:05.000 --> 24:12.000
And it'd be like, have the pits and the dragons. You'd have that like item shop that you draw and everything. Like people, like that's how people get, you play them on lunch.

24:12.000 --> 24:21.000
When I was in high school, my friend Ashley and I, my senior year of high school, sat in the back room during our study hall and made up our own RPG.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
With maps, everything, you name it. We did our own role play game.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
That's awesome, that's awesome. So did you do all that too? You designed your own levels?

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Yes, I think every child.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
He designed games on his calculator, like those graphing calculators.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
Oh, were you that guy trying to get Tetris on your TI-81 and all that?

24:40.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah, my TI-82, I remember. I was sick of all these bad poker games on there so I was like, I'm going to create something better.

24:49.000 --> 24:59.000
But I didn't make anything original. I remember learning how to program. I created the game Mastermind. I don't know if you know that one.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh yeah, that's like the old, with all the pigs?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
The guessing one, yes.

25:04.000 --> 25:12.000
Well, is it true that, like, because I know I've talked, like Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us here at the voice games network, he's done a lot of game design stuff too.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.000
And I know it's always interesting. He talks about that when you first design a game, you actually should make a game you know.

25:18.000 --> 25:25.000
That's why you see a lot of people make Breakout clones. I remember when he was learning XNA, he did Crazy Eights, you know, like a card game.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
So a lot of people always start with something they know. So is that kind of why, you know, Mastermind is a game a lot of people know?

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
Yeah, I mean, I think, well, I think it's different between trying to learn how to program something versus trying to create something on your own.

25:36.000 --> 25:44.000
Because I think as a game designer, it's really easy to come up with your, I mean, it's really easy to not use programming.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
You really don't want to say, like, programming's my crutch when you're trying to create a game.

25:48.000 --> 25:59.000
Try to create a card game or a board game and just put all your ideas out on paper and then put them on cards, make a fake board, you know.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
Just draw on pencil and, you know, stick figures or even less of that.

26:04.000 --> 26:12.000
What I like to do sometimes, like, take magic cards and I put them in sleeves and then I print out stuff, paper, and put them in the sleeves.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
And then you can make your own little card game that way and, you know, have friends try it out and play.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
And, you know, you guys might just have a lot of fun.

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
Yeah, that's awesome. So you knew pretty early on game design was what you wanted to do.

26:25.000 --> 26:33.000
Like, you never, like, oh, maybe I want to do, I don't know, I want to be a teacher or an actor instead or something.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
You kind of always knew that?

26:34.000 --> 26:43.000
No, my life actually was, well, as a kid, I thought that was just kind of a thing you dream of but you never really actually aspire to go towards.

26:43.000 --> 26:51.000
Like a porn actor. Would you say it's similar? I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

26:51.000 --> 26:59.000
So, I mean, and I had other dreams like that, you know, I wanted to design roller coasters too when I was like, maybe I'll be an engineer or something of that sort.

26:59.000 --> 27:09.000
And so I just kind of went into computer science because I was interested in programming and I went through that.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
And I didn't really think actually that I would really go into games at first.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I was like, well, maybe I could try to get into a game company.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
And I actually, when I was in college, I had an internship at a company called Wild Tangent.

27:22.000 --> 27:29.000
Oh, I remember that. That was the stuff that installed its crap. That wasn't you that did that, did you?

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
No, I probably was because that was back in 2000, 2001. So that was those time of years.

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
But I actually hated the job environment there. And so I was like, I have no idea what I'm going to do.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
So I decided like, well, I really like the math side of computer science.

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
So I actually went, I spent like the next eight years in academia and that ended up not panning out.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
And I was like, well, what I'm going to do? And I was like, well, what did I want to do when I was little?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I was like, I wanted to design games.

27:57.000 --> 28:05.000
So I at that point of time, I was really into a game called Hellgate London at that point of time.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Yeah, that game.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
Yeah, it's a fun game. It's made from the old Diablo 2 team.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
And I played it a lot and I contributed on their forums a lot.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
And I just kept on contributing and contributing that the developers started talking to me a lot.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
And then there came the point of time during my academic career, it's like I ran out of funding.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
Because most of my academia life, I was under a grant or something.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
But then my grant ran out and my research wasn't being published.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
So I was like, what am I going to do?

28:35.000 --> 28:41.000
And I talked to the developers and they said, oh, we're going to have a game design open up pretty soon.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
And I was like, awesome, I want to try it. And they're like, okay.

28:45.000 --> 28:52.000
And so I applied for it and they liked me when I interviewed with them and that's where I started.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Wow, that's awesome. That's a great story, though. That's really cool.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
It's funny because I interned when I was in college.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
I was originally wanting to be started as a weatherman.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
And then I was going to be a broadcast journalist, right? I was going to be that guy on the news.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
And I actually interned at a news station up where I went to school and I really hated it.

29:11.000 --> 29:18.000
Well, actually, I take that back. It was a lot of fun. I had fun, but everybody else seemed really miserable.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
And it was kind of really a wake up call that like, wow, this isn't as glamorous as it looks.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
A lot of people here really are not having fun. I don't know if I want to do this.

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
But it kind of turned into like if I didn't go through that, I might not have this radio show I have now,

29:30.000 --> 29:37.000
you know, with my friends on kind of our own terms. So, you know, it's interesting how what you learn can kind of turn into something else.

29:37.000 --> 29:48.000
Anyway. Yeah. What's great about I feel the game design field is that if you if you work forward towards it, you can get a game design job.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
I've met a lot of other game designers. They don't have a formal education or anything of that sort.

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
But what they do is they have passion and usually the most important aspect.

29:58.000 --> 30:07.000
And when I interview other prospectus for game designers is they have to be they have to be excited about games that be playing games.

30:07.000 --> 30:14.000
They have to. And then and then hopefully they have one more step above that where they start analyzing like, well, this is what makes a good game.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
This is what makes a bad game. But how do you know that in general?

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
It's just what you do and don't like. And you you know, you start from that from that point.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
And and then usually I mean, you'll have a lot of people that have that same skill set,

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
but you would want someone who's then taking the next step of trying to create something on their own.

30:33.000 --> 30:39.000
I've had friends that, you know, she created she worked on her own webcomic for a couple of years,

30:39.000 --> 30:48.000
and that's really what got her in the in the game industry and, you know, helped her helped her get a more narrative game design type position.

30:48.000 --> 30:56.000
And me, my Wow. Why are we still trapped in my spare room for after 12 years doing this little dog and pony show?

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
No, I'm kidding. We love it. We love it. All right. No, I mean, a lot.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
I mean, and that's the thing is that, you know, and that's why I was saying earlier, you can anyone could create a game.

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
You could create games out of paper just from, you know, make your own card game, make your own board game.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
And just that itself and just showing your passion for creating and trying to, you know, entertain other people.

31:17.000 --> 31:24.000
That that that is really the most important thing when we when when when people are looking for game designers.

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
That's great advice. I love that. And that's straight from somebody who knows what they're talking about.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
I'm going to our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com Dungeon Buster says Hellgate London had a lot of promise to it.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
Wish it had a better chance to actually accomplish what it wanted to sit out to do.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
So definitely the game had a lot of fans there. Yeah. That coming from live dot vog network dot com.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Well, anything I know we plugged down the Rocksmith series.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
Is there anything else you want to plug out there? Personal projects or anything while you're here tonight?

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
Just Rocksmith 2014 play it. Yeah. You're welcome to give me your feedback.

31:57.000 --> 32:05.000
I'll take it by Rayman legends. This is still Matt talking, by the way.

32:05.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah. A lot of my spare time playing games is watching Christopher play Rayman legends on three different platforms.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
Also, our chats are a little distracted right now because Loki joined the chat room.

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
Loki is in our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com. And Loki says, I'm hoping to be back on next week.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
So be great. We miss Loki, but totally understand why he's got to take the time to be with the additions to the family.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
And Loki is probably just kind of mad he's missing all you guys here in studio tonight.

32:31.000 --> 32:37.000
So we have a pretty packed house tonight. I really wish we could see Loki and Miss Loki and their baby.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Wish we had more time. You should go there right now. I'm sure they're not trying to sleep or anything.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Just go right now. All right. No, stay here on the show. Darn it.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
Shane, I want to go back to you for like just a minute because you blew me off earlier.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
But now you're not doing anything important. You're just playing Phoenix, right? Trying to save my client's life.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
All right. But when it will, because we were talking, we were just talking with Matt and Matt, you know, has a lot of experience in the game industry.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
And I know you've told a little bit about this on the show before, but since, you know, we do gain and lose listeners every so often,

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
there's probably people out there that don't know that you at one time worked in the industry as well, right?

33:09.000 --> 33:16.000
Yes. And where did you work? Konami. And what did you do? I made DDR. You yourself made the whole game?

33:16.000 --> 33:23.000
Just me. Just you? With a piece of paper and a dream.

33:23.000 --> 33:29.000
Oh, so your story is kind of like grassroots. How did you get into it?

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
Was it really a piece of paper and a dream or what? It was connections. Connections.

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
That's that's true. That's how it went. I guess. I guess so. Yes.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
But you you were really passionate about music games though, right? Yeah. And I still am. Yeah.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
It's just they don't have to. They have to be good. They can't be crap. What's what's good and what's crap?

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
See, he can't say, but you can. You don't work in the industry anymore.

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
D.J. Maxx is awesome. Uh-huh. DDR is kind of crap.

33:58.000 --> 34:09.000
Pump It Up is awesome. And what else is crap? Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero is crap. Glad it died.

34:09.000 --> 34:15.000
D.J. Hero was awesome though. So what what why don't why don't you work there anymore?

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
Because they moved and they weren't. Can I even talk about that? Probably not.

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
All right. I guess I can. All right. Just in that sense, they moved.

34:27.000 --> 34:35.000
And oh, God, I don't know what else to ask you. How's life? Yeah.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
It's full of courtroom drama right now. Why do you love Phoenix Wright so much?

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
It's full of courtroom drama. That's true. You do.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
And now that I think about it, you you your favorite TV show is Law and Order SVU, right?

34:47.000 --> 34:53.000
Oh, Power Rangers. Do you want to talk about Mass Effect?

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
Would that make you feel better? No, I can talk about Power Rangers. I don't care.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
I would like to hear more about Power Rangers. So only the Japanese ones.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
OK. My favorite one for a while was the one where there were cops.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
So I guess it kind of makes sense. That one was interesting. But now now they're going to be trains.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
And it's awesome. Really? Yeah. I mean, I understand why the train ones like popular,

35:16.000 --> 35:21.000
but still. Yes. And they switched their costumes, which is awesome.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
I still think that nothing is as awesome as Mega Ranger was. I didn't watch the Japanese

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
version, but it kind of sucked in America. I'm watching Japanese

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
one of Time Ranger Time Rangers. Awesome. The intro sounds like a

35:36.000 --> 35:41.000
90s sci fi show. And it's amazing.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
I still think Mega Ranger was best. All right. Well, congrats, Shane. You succeeded in bringing Power Rangers chat to the show.

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
I hope I'll bring more than that way. There's going to be some Pokemon.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
Well, that kind of works. Well, we got it. We got to keep it moving and get into a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
Yes, we usually do a kickoff topic, but we talk to everybody for a little while. That was our kickoff topic.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
So let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
So we know Shane has been playing Phoenix Wright, so we can skip him. How about you,

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
DarkSocker? We'll go back to him. I'm kidding. I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now, am I?

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
That bitch, Ed, won't leave my town. Seriously, he's fucking creepy. You need the right to be able to evict people.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
But I guess Nintendo will. Blue horse with purple eyeshadow. That's just so to clash. Anyway,

36:25.000 --> 36:33.000
I am playing Animal Crossing. I finally deleted Julian's character now that he has my old wild world.

36:33.000 --> 36:44.000
So I played Mass Effect 3 because I finally figured out how to seamlessly change out hair textures in the actual game files.

36:44.000 --> 36:51.000
So I have completely modded my game. And the only problem is that I can't get custom textures replaced.

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
So I'm using text mod for that. Does your hair look as good as Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider Definitive Edition now?

36:57.000 --> 37:05.000
I don't want to say anything bad about it, but it still doesn't move like real hair does. No.

37:05.000 --> 37:13.000
But one of my shepherds has a really neat looking ponytail that doesn't look like the crappy ponytail that comes in the game.

37:13.000 --> 37:24.000
With the little, what is that thing in her face? It's actually really good. So I played, I've been playing some more of my characters and customizing them because it's also The Sims for me.

37:24.000 --> 37:35.000
And I finally beat that stupid dungeon in Zelda. After passing my week exam at work and then I go and just say,

37:35.000 --> 37:47.000
I'll try that dungeon again. Beat it. So it's very happy. And I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that I'm sure have hit a wall in a video game.

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
And then they come back to it like weeks later and it's like, beat it in one hit. Like, I know I've totally done that on a game before.

37:53.000 --> 37:59.000
Well, yeah. And I knew that that's what it was going to take is that's what it took back in on that same boss in Link to the Past.

37:59.000 --> 38:09.000
Because it's a stupid, whatever the circle thing is that knocks you off the platform. Or as I call it, God damn you bitch when I'm playing it.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
How classy.

38:10.000 --> 38:23.000
Well, because I'm a classy bitch. So anyway, I think that's really about it. I mean, I've kind of put off my Japanese coach because I found my Kanji book. So I'm trying to study on paper.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
You've been learning enough lately.

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
My brain is full. I know how to do so many things on non-PC computers now.

38:31.000 --> 38:42.000
Good times. All right. We're going to go over to Shane and ask Shane about his gaming week. But before I get to that, I have some comments for Shane from our chatroom at live.mognetwork.com

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
Tiger Claw says, you ever watch the Power Rangers that had that crossover with Ninja Turtles, the next mutation?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Try to forget it.

38:50.000 --> 38:58.000
S2100 Matt says, the other question is, will Shane convince Rob to buy a game live on air tonight? He always convinces him to buy something.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Oh, Lord.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
I'll figure out something. I was going to bring Skylanders. Apparently it's supposed to be Rocksmith.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Rocksmith.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Dartitsuya says, Mighty Morphin Power Voggers. Possibly.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
By the way, remind me and I'm going to have to show you the Mega Ranger versus Car Ranger movie.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I don't like Car Ranger.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
But it's better Japanese.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
All right, Shane. How was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

39:24.000 --> 39:34.000
I played, well, I've been mostly in California for this week, so I played a lot of Vita and 3DS stuff.

39:34.000 --> 39:42.000
I've played Phoenix Wright. I've been playing Pokemon and Zelda. I've played DJ Maxx and a little bit of The Walking Dead.

39:42.000 --> 39:50.000
And if I were at home, I could have been playing my copy of Bravely Default, and it makes me mad that I'm not home for that.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Kind of sucks.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
Why are you tapping your fingers at me? You like to hurry up.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
No, I'm not.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Well, now I'm done.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
All right. Let's see. Loki in our chat room says, seriously, fuck Skylanders.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
No, they're amazing, and I don't think they're attractive, so I'm not going to.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
Why do you like Skylanders so much?

40:13.000 --> 40:20.000
Because it's a fun, stupid game with neat characters, and the newest one's really fun because you can jump.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Why do you like Pokemon so much?

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
Because they're adorable, and you can collect so many.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And why do you like Mass Effect so much?

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Because they're adorable, and you can collect so many.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
That sounds like me in all of my saves.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
Did I miss anything? Did I miss any big games?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Why do you love Final Fantasy XIV so much?

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
Because they have minions, and you can collect so many, and it's fun to play.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
And I'm very sad I haven't got to play it this week, really.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Aw, I could boot it up on the PlayStation 3.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
Yeah, and then I could not play it because that's a crappy way to play it.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Shade. All right.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Extover, how was your gaming week?

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
It was fine. What did I play? I played some Don't Starve.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
I played a lot of Rayman Legends, of course,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
because I'm trying to get my last trophy in that game.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I only have one left to go.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Wait, wait. We also played Mario.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
We did. We played...

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
And I kept getting the crown.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
We played Mario 3D World 4-player. It was fun.

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
That's the only way I can enjoy that game, I figured out this week.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Actually, I figured it out a while back.

41:26.000 --> 41:32.000
I was reminded of how much better it is with multiple people as opposed to single player.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
I don't know. I just don't enjoy it as much on single player.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
So sue me.

41:37.000 --> 41:47.000
But I actually got to see Tomb Raider today briefly at Rob's tonight on PS4.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
I've already completed it on PC, but it looks excellent on PS4.

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
And yeah, I think that's it.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I don't think I've played anything.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Oh, I played Android Cactus, too.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
Assault Android Cactus. Great, great, great, great indie game event.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
You've been livestreaming that one a lot lately, too.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Oh, yes.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
Again, I'm on Twitch.tv.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
Thank you, Rob, for the opportunity to plug my Twitch.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
You're so welcome.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
Slash e-x-t-o-p-h-e-r.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Also, you can add me on Twitter.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
My handle is...

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
What is it? It's X-to-fer-c.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
It's X-t-o-f-e-r-c, as in cat.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
But anyways, I got to see Tomb Raider, and that was cool.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And Android Cactus.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
It's called Assault Android Cactus.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
It's a weird name, but it's a shoot-'em-up.

42:40.000 --> 42:47.000
It's a twin-stick shooter, kind of in the style of Smash TV.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
And it's really fun, and it's available on Steam.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
It was only made by three people.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
And I can't stress that enough, because when you see the game...

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
With a piece of paper and a dream.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah, it started with a piece of paper and a dream.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
Much like how Shane started with DDR.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
So yeah, you should check it out.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
There's a demo on Steam.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I mean, it's a gorgeous game, and it's really fun.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
It's very addictive, and it's kind of challenging.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
So there you go.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Excellent.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Matt, what does a week in playing games look like for you?

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
What have you been up to?

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
With Shane being here, I was, I guess, introducing him to other games.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Dominion and Rocksmith, of course.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Also fun.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
And playing Mario with what Exo said.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
And we also played Cards Against Humanity.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
That was really good.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Oh god, that was an epic...

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
How many hours? Like, four hour cards.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
We played through every single card.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Every single white card.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
Yeah, our friend Tim, who you've had on the show before, right?

43:53.000 --> 44:02.000
He has every single expansion, and he brought him over, and we played the crap out of that game.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
He must have played that a lot, because that was like New Year's Eve, too.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
It was like going through the entire deck.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
But yeah, I had a great time.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Definitely a great time.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
And then, of course, Final Fantasy XIV.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Yay.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
And League of Legends.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Boo.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Why the League of Legends thing?

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Because it sucks.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Why? You gotta have a reason.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Because it's not fun.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
You haven't played with me yet.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Counterpoint.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
That will make it less fun. I don't want to get yelled at.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I'm not going to yell at him.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
It's a lie.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
Does Matt yell at you when he's playing games with you?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
No, but I hear stories.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
Matt is notorious for pulling out the bitch side on League of Legends.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
Is he? Because I've heard him playing Final Fantasy XIV.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Sometimes I hear his tone.

44:46.000 --> 44:53.000
No, you know what? He's awesome because he can separate games from real life.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Shane totally can't.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
If Shane doesn't like you in a video game, he doesn't like you in real life.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Oh yeah, I've laid you off completely.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
It's a good thing you already like him in real life.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Occasionally.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
No, he's actually very professional when it comes to that.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
He doesn't do it personally.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
He's not there for personal insults. To his defense.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
But yeah, he does yell at you.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Well, I've never heard him go like,

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Rob, you're a fucking idiot.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
But I definitely hear that tone.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
Like, you know, you've got to not get hit with the plumes again.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I can't do it like he does it.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
But you know, the whole clenched, like,

45:33.000 --> 45:40.000
Gosh, Rob, you sure have a problem dodging those landslides.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Sorry, I can't stop laughing.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
No, that's fine. It's because it's true. No, no, it's great.

45:46.000 --> 45:54.000
Alright, let's see, I'm trying to look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
Segg says, when I get on the show, how about I do a cardboard game segment?

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
You know what? I know it's a video game show, but...

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Like a cardboard game?

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
No, card slash board.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Well, you didn't specify.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Card or board.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
I didn't know if there was, like, a game with a refrigerator box that I was unaware of.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
Alright, I think a lot of folks like card and board games, too.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
So, why not? Games are games.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
Let me talk quickly about my gaming week.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
I haven't been playing a whole lot besides Final Fantasy XIV, honestly,

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
because, you know, I've got problems.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
But I have been playing the new Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on PlayStation 4.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Now, I did play Tomb Raider before on Xbox 360,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
so this is really the second time I'm playing it.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And I don't...

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
You alright over there? Your phone just blew up.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
It's vognetwork on my phone.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
It did a fanfare for me playing Tomb Raider this week.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
So, yeah, I've been playing it on the PlayStation 4,

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
and I noticed that they definitely did a lot more to the game than just,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
ooh, it's prettier and more high-res textures.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
I mean, obviously it has all the DLC stuff in there, too.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
So, ooh, all the outfits.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
But I thought it was interesting, like, just the really subtle things,

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
like that little light that's on the back of the PlayStation 4 controller,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
like, they actually use that, like...

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
So if you're playing in the dark or whatever,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
like, let's say you have Laura get a torch,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
and she lights it up in a dark cave.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
The light on the back of the PlayStation 4 will actually glow,

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
like, red and yellow and, like, flicker on those colors,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
like a flame would.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
And just little subtle things like that are really cool.

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
And then it uses the speaker inside the controller quite a bit, too.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
So there are... there's more than just, like, the prettier graphics.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
So I thought that was good, because, you know,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
I'm paying $60 to play a game I've already played before.

47:41.000 --> 47:47.000
But it's cool, because the neat thing about where the PlayStation 4 is at right now

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
is that there's really not... and the Xbox One, really,

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
is that there's not really a whole lot of games on either one.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
I mean, yeah, you've got, you know what, Need for Speed, Knack, the sports games,

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
but I think there's, like, kind of a lull right now

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
as systems tend to get to in this time of year.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
So I actually think the repackaging of Tomb Raider,

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
which was, you know, one of the best from the end of the last generation of games,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I think that was kind of a smart idea. I think it really was.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
You know what else is getting repackaged?

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
What?

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Rayman Legends.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Is it really? Oh, that's right, it is.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
It's coming out in, like, two weeks, right?

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
Yep, and I... you should get it. Everybody should get it.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
You're gonna play it again, right?

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
You know what? I think I will.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Locopoco says,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Tomb Raider Definitive Edition is so, so pretty.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
Yeah, it's really not just the hair, it's just you can...

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
you just noticed it in the textures and everything,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
and the smoothness is really...

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
and I know there's a lot of that controversy

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
I couldn't tell you because I haven't played the Xbox One version,

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
I've only played the PlayStation 4 version,

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
but it's really smooth, and the framerate's great, and yeah.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
It's really cool.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
And Tech2030 says,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
That game is worth playing more than two times.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
There you go.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
So that was... I mean, I didn't really play an awful lot

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
besides those games, honestly.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I spent a lot of time... I did some livestreaming.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Oh, I did play Pinball Arcade,

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
because I did some livestreaming of that on PlayStation 4.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
I bought the entire Season 1 worth of tables,

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
and I died a lot on the Star Trek Next Generation table,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
because that table is an asshole.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
But it's Star Trek.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
It is in real life, too.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
It is. Like, the gutters on the left and right eat your ball,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
like, all the time. There's nothing you can do about it.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Did your balls get eaten?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I hate you.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
All right. Let's move on.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
That's it for our gaming week.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
So, quickly, some housekeeping.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I don't have a lot, so I'm just gonna say follow us on Facebook.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Laundry Dale.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
We're also on Twitter.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
We should be here for most of the coming weeks.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
We may miss a show in early March,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
but I'll keep you guys posted on that

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
as we get a little closer to that date.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Have we missed a week since, like, last year?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
I don't think we have.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
I did.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
You did, but...

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Because I had the plague.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
The show is still going on.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
So, yeah, we might have a week off in March,

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
but we'll keep you posted on that.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
All right. In the meantime, I guess we'll get into some news,

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
and I'm actually gonna start us off tonight with some gaming news,

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
since Loki and Jason's both not here to start us off.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
I'll start us off.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
And we're gonna talk Nintendo, like I promised.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
There was a lot of chatter this week with what's going on with Nintendo.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
As I mentioned earlier in the show when I was talking to Extifer,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
we all saw the news stories about,

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
Wii U is flopping and Wii U's not making expectations.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
What's gonna happen?

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
What are they gonna do when they have the investor meeting?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Are they gonna put Mario on cell phones?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Well, that investor meeting happened this week,

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
and quite a bit kind of came out of that meeting.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Let's touch on some of the bullet points.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Mario Kart 8 officially dated.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
Mario Kart 8 will be out in May at this point.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
I don't want to be that guy,

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
but I kind of thought this was gonna be the case

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
when they delayed Donkey Kong Country Freeze.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
What the heck's the name of that game, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Thank you, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I kind of had the feeling when they delayed that game

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
that it meant that Mario Kart 8 was getting delayed.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
So the push to May doesn't really surprise me.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
Sure, it's sad, I want the game now,

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
but I would rather they wait till May to make it good

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
than release it before it's really ready.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
And who knows, maybe the release in May is strategical too.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Maybe they need to space things out for the end of the year.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
I don't know.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Other big news that came out of the investor meeting.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
Wii U Virtual Console will be getting Nintendo DS games.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
And there's a lot of people out there going,

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
I called it.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
One of them being Loki, the other one being Alan,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
because when we did our silly little list list

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
at the end of the year last year,

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
they both, in one way or another,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
said that that was the type of thing that was gonna happen.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
So we are gonna get the DS games on the Wii U Virtual Console.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
No, we don't know which games.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
No, we don't know when.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
We do know that they showed Brain Age

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
in a conceptual type of thing,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
and that would be an obvious choice.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
I mean, most of those Nintendo first-party games

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
are gonna be the obvious things that come out on Wii U

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
pretty quickly.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
Another very interesting comment that came out of that is that

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
we've got over a technical hurdle with Virtual Console

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
and expect to get the games out quick.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
And I think that was in regards to the Nintendo DS games,

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
but some people have been interpreting it as

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
there's gonna be more Virtual Console games.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
That's not a bad thing, I don't think.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
They've really been trickling out.

52:13.000 --> 52:19.000
But, again, I wish there was more to Virtual Console.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
I don't know.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I get the whole concept that people just wanna have

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
the emulated games, but it just seems like

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
there would be value in online play,

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
leaderboards, trophies,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
being able to see your friends play on the webcam

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
that's built into the gamepad,

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
just something like that.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
They're gonna be building a Quick Start function

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
into the Nintendo Wii U gamepad.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
They say it still takes too long to play Wii U games,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
that they're gonna do a Quick Start function,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
that you're gonna be able to get the game right up,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
and that's something that's supposed to come later this year.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I think that's a good thing.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
It's a good thing, but I don't understand...

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
I don't quite understand why people feel like

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
it takes too long to boot up and play a game.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
It literally takes two inputs.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
You click your user, me,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
and then you click the game that you wanna play.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
That's it. It doesn't take too long to boot it up.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
People... I think I read on Kotaku...

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
You know how sensationalist they can be?

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Well, first off, you shouldn't have read that.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
I know, I know, I know.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
But on Kotaku, they were talking about how

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
you go through a myriad of menu screens

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
to get to the game you need to get to.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
That is complete bullshit.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
That is not true.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
You don't go through a myriad of video game menus.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
You go through two screens.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
Like, you know, get over it.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
And so I don't feel like it's absolutely needful

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
that you have to have a quick boot.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
But I mean, it is fine.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
It's fine for what it is, I guess.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Brad from Pod Culture says,

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
If you can't get your game up, you might need Wiagra.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Oh, I see what you did there.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
To be fair, I don't think the process

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
is really any slower on Wii U

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
than it is on any of the other consoles.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
It's actually faster on Wii U than it is PS3

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
to get to your game.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
It's just I don't understand why people are...

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
But I can also understand the allure

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
in being able to maybe just turn on the gamepad

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
and you have your virtual console game

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
right up on the gamepad without maybe even

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
necessarily having to navigate menus.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Yeah, I mean, I can see the draw for it.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I'm certainly not against it.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
But I don't know where the controversy is.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I can't see where the controversy is.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Nintendo is talking about tying an ID

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
across all hardware platforms,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
which I guess they've kind of already been doing

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
as they've merged Nintendo Network into 3DS.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
But now we're talking about future systems

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
and I think whatever they're going to plan

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
in the mobile space, which they've pretty much

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
come very clear and said it is not...

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Like, we're not putting Mario on...

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
Like, we're not designing a Mario game for the iPhone.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
But we're not opposed to new ideas.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
So they are exploring some new ideas.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
And some of those ideas have to do with fitness.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
And that could be a place...

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
Non-wearable health monitoring tech

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
was something they were talking about,

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
which struck me as particularly interesting

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
because last week I talked about the whole...

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
And, you know, if you didn't listen to last week's show,

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
you really should because I feel like I made a good point

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
about how, you know, you talked about Fitbit,

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
I talked about Fitbit.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
That should have been Nintendo.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
Nintendo could have had that.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
They could have hopped on that

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
and had Fitbit for themselves.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
And I talked about that last week.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Well, plus, if they...

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
Because they have a monitor for the new Wii U Fit, right?

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Yeah, right, yeah.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
But it's crap compared to Fitbit and all those things.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
If they invest a little bit of money to make it

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
a little bit more premium-feeling,

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
then, yeah, I see them.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
So that's something they're going to.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Nintendo's also talking about flexible price points

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
on games for loyal consumers.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
That that might be the trick is to make the games a lot cheaper.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
So, I mean, cheaper is good news for us,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
especially those that have been supporting.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Just a couple other tidbits here.

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
Legend of Zelda was listed on the Wii U's 2014 lineup

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
as To Be Determined.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
That was some documents that came out of the investors meeting.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Okay, so what does that tell us?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
They're working on a new Legend of Zelda game.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
We already knew that.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
Oh, shit.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
No shit.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
And that is not news, but it was on the list

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
and people have been reporting it as news, so there you go.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
One of the other big pieces of news,

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
Iwata taking a big pay cut but not stepping down.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
Iwata's going to take a 50% pay cut, which is pretty big.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
He's still making bank.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
He's still making bank, but not going to step down.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
I'm certainly not one of those people that's thinking,

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
like, off with his head.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Yeah, I'm not either.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
I don't think he needs to really take the fall,

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
but they all need to kind of, like,

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
this needs to be, like, the wake-up call.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
I mean, it's a wake-up call,

56:53.000 --> 56:59.000
but he's sitting on the success of the 3DS,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
and he turned that system around.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
You know what I mean?

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
So he's not all, like, bad,

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
and for people to call for his resignation,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I think, is just kind of silly.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
Yeah, I think it's, no, I wouldn't agree with that either.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Possibly one of the most interesting things

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
to come out of all this, and I'll end on this,

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
Nintendo is considering mergers

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
and new game studio acquisitions,

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
which led to a lot of wank in comment sections

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
about Microsoft should buy Nintendo.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Don't think that's going to happen, kids,

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
because Nintendo still has a shitload of cash on hand,

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
so it's not like, you know,

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
it's not like going to the bargain bin at Walmart

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
and buying a new company.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
You know, it's not really that easy,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
but it could be interesting to see

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
if Nintendo makes a grab for somebody,

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
and my head can't help but go here.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
I just had this weird feeling,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
what if Nintendo buys Sega?

57:56.000 --> 58:01.000
Like, that's the wank I'm coming up with in my head,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I mean, because it would make so much sense.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
It would make absolutely a lot of sense.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
It would make so much sense for Nintendo to buy Sega.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
What if Nintendo bought Capcom or Konami?

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I think that would be really cool.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
A lot of people think it's platinum games

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
that they're eyeing, but...

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
Well, yeah, and again,

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
it's a company they kind of work with.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
Yeah, like Wonderful 101 or whatever.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
But it's going to be very interesting to see,

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
because, yeah, I bet Nintendo would snatch up a company

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
and get a whole lot of exclusives that way.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Sega's kind of a company that's already been

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
very supportive of the Wii U,

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
but, you know, obviously my 12-year-old self can't help

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
but go, God, it was weird enough

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
when Sega started putting Sonic games

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
on the Nintendo platform.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
We can go back in time

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
and tell everybody that Nintendo won.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
Right?

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Seriously, you know, I would love, actually,

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
to see what Nintendo would do with Sega,

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
with any Segas, you know, like Sonic or whatever.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Yeah, it would just be so weird.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
My mind would be blown.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
Right?

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
So, SSJ100Matt says,

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
That's some 1990s wank.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I know, I can't help it.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
It's the only one in my mind that I go,

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
wow, that would make a lot of sense for that to happen.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
So, OrangeRight in chat says,

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
Konami won't happen because they'd have to cancel all their games.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
That's a good point.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
Konami's really developing a lot of stuff on other platforms.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Nintendo buys them.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
It's not as easy as like, oh, put Castlevania on Wii U.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Are they really relevant anymore, anyway?

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Ooh.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
I mean, let's just be honest.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
What do they do?

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
They make a Metal Gear every once in a while.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Castlevania.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
And yeah, at Castlevania, that's kind of...

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
What does the chat think is really taking off?

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I don't think it's really taking off.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
I think they're trying to make it take off.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
No, Silent Hill's really gonna get successful this time, Shane.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
That's a lie.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
Maybe they'll buy up some of their IPs.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
Or, you know, I'm not talking about just Konami,

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
but other companies like Mega Man,

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
you know how everybody's really, really butthurt about Capcom

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
pushing them to the curb.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Capcom wouldn't let it go.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Yeah.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Oh yeah, I wouldn't see Capcom...

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Nintendo would have to buy Capcom for that to happen.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
But see...

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
But then the fighting game world would just poop itself.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Yeah, they would.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
The fighting game world would literally shit itself

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
if Nintendo bought Capcom.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
No kidding, that would be great.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I'd love to see that happen, honestly.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Have you tried playing a fighting game on the Wii?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
No, because all you do is try to play the fighting game on a Wii.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom was...

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I love it, but it's just not great.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
You have to have the classic controller to play it.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And you know me, I'm probably one of the world's biggest

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Tatsunoko fans.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
No.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Even Gatchaman was not enough to make me love it.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Alright, so enough wank and all this stuff.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Obviously we're going crazy here.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Chatters, I ask you this.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
People in the room, I ask you this.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Live.vog.network.com if you want to chat with us.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
After what you heard come out of this Nintendo event,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
do you think they're on the right path at this point?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
It's hard to say, because Nintendo,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I feel like with every step forward they take,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
it feels like they take a couple back.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And I just don't feel like it got to the point of excitement for me

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
in anything they came out with.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
But I don't know, they've never been a company

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
that wants to be very aggressive.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
They don't ever give me that impression.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
So, I don't know. What do you say, Matt?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Well, I think for Nintendo,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I think they just want to make sure they take it slow

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
and they actually know they will make it big on their own IPs

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
and everyone loves their properties and their games.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So if they're spreading it out, they're spreading it out.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But I think we could take a look at Take-Two and GTA V

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
and all of a sudden one game can put you on top.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Unfortunately, I guess the game industry is kind of that way now.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
There's a lot more blockbusters and hit or miss type of things.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But I don't think Nintendo has that much to worry about

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
because they have a lot of strong IP.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
And they have a lot of cash on hand.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And we know they have patience.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And they do turn out the quality games.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
And they make the next GTA V.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
This is coming from a Microsoft fanboy.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Loki giving his opinion with the show tonight saying,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I could see them acquiring Atlus or Tecmo Koe,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
a smaller third-party company maybe.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And, let's see, Bochikawa says,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I use the Classic Controller for everything. Nothing wrong with it.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Yeah, but that is, I mean, the problem with the Classic Controller,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
it's optional. And when you have an optional piece of hardware,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
games don't necessarily have to support it.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
That is kind of why the Xbox One included the Kinect,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
for better or worse, because they wanted designers to know

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
the Kinect will be on every Xbox One.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
So you can design for it and not have to worry if somebody has it or not.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
When you design a game for the Classic Controller,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
not everybody's going to have it.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
A lot of people who owned a Wii didn't have a Classic Controller.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
So something to think about with that.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Tech 2030 says, if they're really thinking of buying companies

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
to get more first-party titles and IPs, then yes.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And I think that's in response to the Atlus and Tecmo Koe thing.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000
So, Dar Tetsuya says, if they announce even more than one bombshell title at E3,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
they might be able to turn things around, I think.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
You know, and I kind of agree with that answer.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
That's where I'm going, is that E3, I mean, E3's always important,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
and I feel like we say this every freaking year.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
But this is, the stakes are like super fucking high for Nintendo this year.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Super, super high.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And the weird thing is, I still don't, I would see that they're not going to get on stage again.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I think we're going to have another year of Nintendo Direct.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Why should they get on stage? Why should they?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Honestly, I liked the Nintendo Direct thing.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Well, the only thing I hated about it was that Ustream was full of fail.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I liked the theory behind it, but it didn't work.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And that thing was crashing every five seconds, so they better fix that shit.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
But otherwise, yes, in theory, I think there's nothing wrong with what they did with Nintendo Direct.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It's very interesting how they're changing the landscape that way.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
But I would fully anticipate we have another E3 where they do that.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Gonna be very, very, very make or break this year.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
All right, let's move on. We got a lot of other companies to talk about.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
So, Dark Saga.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Speaking of other companies, we have some Sony news.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Well, more like a rumor, which, you know how I feel about rumors, but this could be a good one.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Basically, there was a source close to Sony was saying that there is going to be a backwards compatible PS1 and PS2 emulator.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
For the PS4.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And they say that the theory is that, from what I can tell in here, it's supposed to be able to let you play the games you already have.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Which is actually sort of opposite of what Sony was saying about having the PS1 and PS2 games available through PlayStation Now.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So, it would be interesting if they did that, but I don't see it.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Well, I mean, there's PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 emulators on PC.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And isn't the PlayStation 4 just kind of like a PC in a box?

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I mean, we're getting closer and closer to that.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
So, I like that idea as opposed to streaming.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I mean, as cool as a lot of the stuff they were talking about was streaming sounds.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Like, I really worry about the lag and the bandwidth and all that that goes with it.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So, I really like this as an approach. I hope they can do it.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:51.000
The thing I like about it is that it actually would add more value to the system itself so that people who already have their older games would be willing to upgrade to the next level of hardware.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I would be so flippin' happy if they implement this and they do the right thing, which would be...

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Remove region locking?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:10.000
That and, well, if I could play the games I already bought on PlayStation 3 for PS1, if I could play those on PS4 as well because they're already in my catalog.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
That would be the right thing to do and I really hope that's what they do.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I hope so, too.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Which, by the way, would include... Those were region-free because they release Japanese games all the time.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
The Japanese Mega Man releases were out and I bought one of those and, like, Castlevania Chronicles.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I bought a... Sweet Coding 2. There's a series that Shane didn't get to fanboy over yet.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I bought... No, Sweet Coding 1, not 2. Sorry.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Yeah, 2 will never be on there.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Why won't they release 2? Jerks.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I don't know. Maybe.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Or maybe they would have this as something that you can subscribe to.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You know, beyond their whole PlayStation Now thing, they have an emulator subscription service.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Or maybe it has to be licensed per game.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Tech2030 in chat says, I think because of PlayStation Now, I'm gonna say backwards compatibility won't happen.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It would almost be hindering their sales potential with PlayStation Now.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Why can't they be together?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Is it giving people an opportunity to get games that they don't have access to anymore?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Why can't PlayStation Now be both emulator and streaming?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
It could easily be.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Yeah.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And, again, it's the whole concept of added value to make the hardware more attractive.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Absolutely. So we'll see what develops with that.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I'm hoping that it does turn out to be true.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And, again, I'd love to see the library of PlayStation 1 stuff I already bought open up on PlayStation 4.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
That would be fantastic.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Alright. Well, let's move on to some Microsoft news.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
So, Matt, if you're a Microsoft fanboy, pay attention. Although I'm sure...

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I was just being kind of facetious when I said that.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000
But, honestly, he had an Xbox only when I moved in with him.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Oh, did you force him to go buy console?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
No, no. I didn't force him to buy anything.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I forced him to get the newest console for free, though.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Alright. Moving on to some big news out of Microsoft.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Microsoft, I'm sure many of you heard this week,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Microsoft Studios purchased the rights to the Gears of War franchise from Epic Games.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
They will be taking over the existing games that are already out there,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
as well as development of future games.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Development of future games will be handed over to Black Tusk Studios,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
which at one time was Microsoft Vancouver.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But Black Tusk will now be working on future Gears of War games.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
So, hmm. We'll see.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Rod Ferguson, who is the director of production at Epic Games and on the Gears of War franchise,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
is now going to be going over to Microsoft and will play a key studio leadership role.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
We don't know what that is all about.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
2K did put out a statement that says,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
We can confirm that Rod Ferguson is no longer with 2K.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Any projects the new studio is working on are unaffected by his departure.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
We wish him the best of luck in future endeavors. Blah de blah de blah. All that stuff.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So, not a lot of surprise here, honestly.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I mean, of course, Gears of War has been a great franchise for Microsoft.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Of course they want to keep it going.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
It's interesting that it's going to end up getting the Halo treatment of sorts.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Now that Epic Games isn't doing them anymore, they'll go to a new developer.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
But you know what? Halo 4 was way better than Halo 3, in my opinion.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Or any of the Halos that came out after 2. It wasn't as good as Halo 2.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I've never played a Halo.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Really? Halo 2 is really the best out of all those if you're going to play one.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Well, speaking of all that, in other Microsoft news,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
take this with a huge grain of salt,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I would really be not talking about what everybody's talking about

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
if I didn't talk about this story, which is the Xbox leaks.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Apparently there's been some Xbox One rumors or leaks that are posted out there on NeoGaf.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And, you know, we take a lot of those posts with a grain of salt,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000
but the problem is this guy, N-T-K-R-N-L, not Colonel or whatever his name is,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000
this guy apparently he's been a source before,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
and people have verified yes he is with Microsoft or what have you.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Here's a summary of what he said was going to be coming from Xbox One this year.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Halo 2 anniversary on Xbox One. November 11th even gave a date.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Halo 2 anniversary. Crackdown 3 coming in 2016.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Halo 5 possibly delayed. Not going to come out as soon as we thought.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Forza Horizon 2 for the Xbox One in September at 1080p.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And a white Xbox One that's diskless, meaning there will be no disk drive.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And perhaps that's how they're going to cut down the cost a little bit.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
They're not going to cut out the Kinect, they're going to cut out the disk drive,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
which is a very interesting way of, you know,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
when we talked about all that digital distribution

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
and some of the stuff that Microsoft was considering at one point,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
it's very interesting that they might end up going down that road

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
where it would be all digital after all.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Just if you get that, make sure you have no bandwidth caps.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Right? So, let me do some quick comments from our chatroom

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
on the Gears of War thing that I just talked about,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
and then we'll talk about these rumors a little more over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Tech 2030 says they really need to sit on Gears for a while,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
give people a break, and come back with an awesome sequel or maybe even a reboot.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
SSG100Matt says, to be fair, as a long time Gears of War fan,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
the series has been hoarded out a little too much.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Dungeonbuster says 343 Industries didn't do a half bad job with a new Halo,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
but Blast Tusk really needs to shake up the Gears formula.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Back to these rumors, here's the thing.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't, I mean, rumors are rumors, whatever.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
We'll find out what's true or not at E3,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.000
but here's my thing, is that pretty much everything this guy revealed,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
these are like the safest fucking bets you could make with Microsoft, right?

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
This is like the whole, Nintendo is working on a new Zelda game that'll come out in a year.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Well, no shit. And if it doesn't come out in a year, oh, it got delayed, it wasn't ready, and you still look right.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Am I right? Like, if Nintendo comes out at E3 and says,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
we're working on a new Zelda game, and I see people going,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I called it, I'm gonna be like, did you also call that the Pope was Catholic and that bears shit in woods, because no shit.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And so when I hear news like, you know, Forza Horizon 2 coming to the Xbox One, no shit.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Forza Horizon was great. That was a great game. It sold well. It's gonna get a sequel.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I will buy an Xbox One for Forza Horizon 2. No shit that's happening.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Crackdown 3, okay, maybe a little more risky, whatever.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Halo 2 Anniversary. Again, I think that's a safe bet.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Especially if it's true that Halo 5 is getting pushed back a little bit, you want a Halo to bridge the gap in there a little bit.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Halo 2 Anniversary?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
It's like what they did with Wind Waker HD on Nintendo.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Which, by the way, when they announced Wind Waker, they already said they were working on another Zelda.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
So I don't understand how this is like...

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I'm just, I'm comparing. But here's the thing.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Only one of these where I go, okay, well now that's a little bit ballsy is the white Xbox One that happens to be diskless.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Now, again, it's not... I mean, we knew that Microsoft was thinking about going down this path at some point anyway.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It's not like that's new information, right?

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000
But for them to actually do it would really be something to see.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Matt thinks they should do it.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
They should be digital only, right?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Don't put words in my mouth.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Come on, don't be shy.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Well, I mean, just X for an I. We like everything being digital, so it's easier.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I don't go to the store. Just order something.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Let me ask this question. People are very hostile about that.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.000
What would you tell people that are very hostile and don't want to see people that are really attached to their disk-based games?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
What would you say to them? What are they missing?

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I don't think they're missing anything. I mean, everyone's allowed to kind of prefer to play games how they like to,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
but, I mean, at the same time, you should be open up to how other people like to play.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And so we like to play without having to put a disk in. That's annoying.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I'm a graphic designer who is in love with print media, so I miss disks, and I miss manuals,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
and I miss everything that gives you something to hold and to possess,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
because some people are just attached to things, and some people like to have something tactile,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
and I think that that shouldn't be abandoned,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
especially since you're going to be putting a whole bunch of designers out of business in print shops.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Sadly, I hate to say it, but too late. I mean, already, I don't see games really coming with manuals anymore.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
In fact, Tomb Raider I just bought this week doesn't have a manual. It says, for the online manual, go to this website.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
That's sad.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Granted, somebody still has to design the online manual, so there's that.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Yeah, PDFs aren't hard, but, for example, Dan and I have this box. We have an Atari 5200 Frogger box.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:12.000
You know what it's full of? Manuals that we go back and look at, especially when we are playing said games that we have those manuals for.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:25.000
One of my favorite things as a gamer from the old Nintendo days was to, when I got a new game,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
was to pop open that manual and look through it like it was a new book, you know what I mean?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I don't think that actually is ever going to be replicated by an online manual or a manual that you can access through the video game itself.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I just feel like there's a certain joy as a little kid that I had looking through the Legend of Zelda manual.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And reading the story of the game because it might tell you.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Exactly. And my mom would always joke, she would always be like,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I don't know how he masters these games, but he opens them up and he reads that manual from cover to cover and then he beats the game!

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And I felt like, I was no childhood prodigy, but my mom sure made me feel like I was.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
She would brag to her friends about that and I was just like, I love the manuals.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
That's how I knew the evil mushrooms were called goombas.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Sometimes there would be hints in those manuals and everything.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I've heard in Japan that they still really treasure the instruction manual.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Oh yeah. Now that's one thing I've seen, especially because there's a big thing for collector's editions that come with a bunch of stuff.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It's the manuals and art books coming with things are really, that's half the reason why my husband and I have imported stuff.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Yeah. So I wonder why there's this big cultural difference between Japan and I guess the Western world.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I remember when I was younger, I would get the manuals and I would color them because they were always a black and white and I had markers.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Well, I'm trying to think of an example of something. Okay, here, now it's a Dreamcast game, but it came with, it was a Cardcaptor Sakura game.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.000
That came with, and the game was kind of crap, but it was cute because it was Cardcaptor Sakura, but it came with a pillowcase.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
It came with a clock, a fork and a spoon. You remember this?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
What's this? Sorry, I left the room for a minute.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
My Cardcaptor Sakura game.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Oh God, that was so hilarious.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And they did a Sakura Taisen game that came with all that same stuff too.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:33.000
But it's like, we see, you know, Collectors editions that come with postcards and things and companies just passing out postcards.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:43.000
You know, I've got a whole bunch of postcards thanks to Ikuma JP who sent me some Phoenix Wright ones and some other Capcom game ones.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:53.000
It's just a whole lot more of a Collectors audience to have just things that go with your game that enrich the game itself without actually being in the game.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Well, I do feel there is kind of, there is a boom in the US with different varying Collectors editions. You see like every game now has a Collectors edition.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I'm going to our chat room for some feedback.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Live.vognetwork.com. Segg says, my hope with the move to going full digital on consoles will put pressure into network neutrality and a better investment in broadband.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And Segg continues that saying, because you tell me with a straight face that Microsoft would like to pay for better access to every ISP in the US.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And Drew in the chat says, I just like manuals, but oh well, I honestly don't have time for them now. I do all the reading I used to now before the game comes out.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
We didn't have the internet when manuals were big. That's a good point.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I mean, Extifer would read the manual cover to cover when he bought the game, but now you have the internet.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
You already know everything about the game before you buy it.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Yeah, but you know what's funny is that I still like, when I opened, for instance, when I opened the new console, and I used to do this when I was a little kid too.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:00.000
When I opened the PS4, I love looking at all the little inserts. I like looking at all the little advertisements. I like looking through all of that stuff.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I seriously, it's like bathroom reading.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Here's what I ran to get in the back room for a minute here is that I was going to say all hope is not lost, because here's Retro Magazine.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Watch your gamers better.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Well, how mean, because Retro Video Game Magazine, this is where we had the guy on the show not that long ago.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I know, I know, I'm kidding.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
All right, yeah, sure.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Actually, Dan and I picked up the issue.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Did you?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
At Fry's.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Nice.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Yeah.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:37.000
This magazine came out, and I was going to say, people are going to Kickstarter now. There's a lot of people that are really upset about, you know, I wish I had the magazine and so forth.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
And maybe they want things that they can read in the bathroom or what have you.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000
But yeah, they got this whole little magazine, and this is what was really cool is that if you go to the very back page, look at that, supporters.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Look at the number one right there. Yeah, orangelunchreader.com.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Yep.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
After you went and said something nasty.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
You know what?

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
You said nasty mouth.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
You know what? I didn't mean it.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
That's pretty awesome.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
No, like I said, we actually picked it up because we saw it at Fry's.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Nice.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And I remembered it. But yeah, it was very good.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I was going to say, all hope's not lost. Like, there's still communities that are like, you know, hey, we missed this, so let's make it.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Yeah, I miss the old days where I'd pick up the new EGM or GamePro or whatever.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
They got what, Nintendo?

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:22.000
You'd flip through that thing, like, over and over and over again, and even when you thought you read the whole thing from cover to cover, you'd still look through it, you know?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Why do you think I kept issues of EGM, like, for years? We actually ended up having to throw them away because they were just decaying.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I think I was reading up on Twitter or the internet somewhere that Nintendo Force is another magazine that's kind of run off Kickstarter and stuff, and they're gearing up for their second year.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
So, kind of, it's not dying. There's going to be an audience for it that appreciates it, so there you go.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It's becoming more of a specialty market, and I really wish that it was more the norm then. Well, it's like, I was even having a conversation with Becky, my best friend, a while back, about how whenever she gets DVDs, she just throws the cases away and puts them in a binder.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And I'm like, but you realize that someone put work into this design and that, you know, it's as much a part of the experience as having the disk, right?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And she's like, oh, I didn't think about it that way. But, I mean, I don't know. Some don't. Some don't. It's sad.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:31.000
All right, let's move on. Dark Soccer, you have another story for us? I do, and it's about how pissed off I am that print media is dying, and I'm kidding.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:40.000
This is about the Ouya. Well, it's getting makeover. It was kind of crap before, and it's still kind of crap, but we still like it.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:56.000
What? It's just the way you phrased, that's really funny. I'm sorry. No, well, okay, a lot of people will say it's kind of crap, and then there's people like our Brad from Pod Culture, who likes his Ouya and plays retro games on it.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:16.000
But the Ouya is going to have better Wi-Fi connectivity, or as they say in Quebec, Wi-Fi. It will have more storage. It's going to be going to a 16GB flash storage, and I wonder if anyone will need it.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Better controller, better analog, it's supposed to be better everything, and it's all black and sleek, and I still am not buying one.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I was just saying, you just pre-ordered one today, didn't you? Just kidding. No, because you can't pre-order, you can only order, and it will be delivered when it's ready.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000
You're so mean. I am not. I have a personal grudge against unnecessary prefixes.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Alright, so I have to admit, I'm also still not really big on the whole Ouya thing. I think it's a pile of shit. Sorry, I'm sorry to crap on your parade.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I don't think I'd go that far, but... It has untapped potential, meaning its potential is really hard to tap, I guess?

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:18.000
It's a fucking Android phone on your TV. I just feel like it's having a hard time finding its audience. What am I really getting out of that thing I can't get on my PC?

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Absolutely nothing. You're getting one exclusive, that Soulfjord? That's it?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:34.000
To be fair, other people might say, well then why do you get a PlayStation 4, Rob? Because all those games are on your PC, but I'll tell you what, they run a lot better on the PlayStation 4 than they do on my PC.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.000
They're dedicated gaming consoles with all that power, whereas an Ouya is not really about the power.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Plus there's going to be exclusives on this.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:49.000
If you look at this, I'm sorry. Buying a PS4 is basically cheaper than buying a graphics card.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Ooh, interesting thought here from Sega in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. If the Ouya would drop its requirement for having a demo or free version for every title, they would have a lot more buy-in.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Brad from PodCulture says, it is a neat bit of kit to tinker with, but it sure as hell isn't mainstream.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Well, let's talk about what is coming to the mainstream as we go over release dates and the types of things that are coming out around the world this week.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I'm going to start with the US release dates. We have a few things coming out.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Earth Defense Force 2025. If Loki does come back next week, I think we're going to hear a lot about this, because this game is out on February 4th on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Fable Anniversary also out this week on the Xbox 360. I think that's just the one, two, three games all out together.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:42.000
The Lego Movie Video Game is out on pretty much all consoles. Windows 360, PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Lego Movie Video Game.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
And, let's see, Outlast making its way to the PlayStation 4 this week as well.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
And the Windows version of Double Dragon Neon makes its way to Steam this week as well.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.000
And then lastly, I think this is another, this is a Friday release. Did Nintendo move their things to Friday?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Bravely Default comes out on February 7th. And I know a lot of people are excited about that.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I still need to play the stinkin' demo, but I'm hearing a lot of good things about that.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Did you get your four swords, by the way?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I already had four swords.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
This is special.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It's the same one they gave away at E3 a while ago.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Yeah, when the 3DS was first, first out, they gave it away before, and I got it then.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Well, I didn't have one then.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Oh yeah, for all the new 3DS owners, it's great. But yeah, I had it from before.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Was it part of the ambassador thing?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Why don't you buy it again, Rob?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
It's free, Rob. Get it again.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Why is everybody picking on me?

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Because you're here.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I already own the fucking game. Leave me alone.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Alright.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Moving on.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Let's see, Brad from Pod Culture says,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
No, it's a remastered version of the game a la Halo. Looks good too.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Shoot, I don't know which game he's talking about, but alright.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Oh, he's talking about Fable? Oh.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Well, that's pretty cool then.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
A Fable 2 was good.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
This is not Fable 3.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Going over to Japan and checking out the releases there.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
On the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Gotcha, it's not out in Japan until the 22nd of February.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Just seeing if you were paying attention.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Going over to the consoles that are out in Japan on the PlayStation 3.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge goes into the Best Hits collection.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I'm sure Dark Sakura will be excited to play Puyo Puyo Tetris.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Puyo Puyo.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I guess they just combined the two.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
It's both. It literally is both at the same time.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Holy shit.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Are you really excited?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Why the crap do I not have this?

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
PlayStation 3 is region free. You can do it.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Hey, I have brand new news.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
What?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Did you know what it's called when a brony masturbates to ponies?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I just want to tell you, we have bronies that listen to this show.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I don't care. Don't be offensive. Alright, what?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It's called clopping.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Where's that from?

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:11.000
It's true. And so somewhere in the United States, somewhere, somebody is clopping right now.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I'm clopping listening to you talk.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
So nasty.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Moving on.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Bronies are disgusting.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
No they're not.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
You probably like things that are stupid too.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Actually, if I may.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
You like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
I like Buffy.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
That is amazing.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I don't understand you right now.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I do need to actually set aside and make a statement because there's a little boy who is 11 years old who is a brony and got picked on and tried to hang himself and he's in critical condition.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So I just like to say, don't mock anybody's fandoms because they may be very seriously affected by it.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Are you listening to her?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I'm listening to her. I'm not trying to get people not to commit suicide.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
I'm not trying to people.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I'm sorry, that came out completely.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
That completely.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I did not intend that to be interpreted the way that it did because I didn't mean to say it like that.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I'm talking about all the other guys that are the creeps.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000
You know, if you're creepy about it, just keep your creepy in your closet.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:26.000
And the thing that's cracking me up most of all is that Rama, who I know is a brony, is in our chat room saying, really Shane? Really?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
That was extra for talking.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
No, but I said something. I said that terrible because I'm not going to lie, they're terrible.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
You guys are too mean.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:43.000
But if you like something, shout it from the mountains and don't let anybody hate on you.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And also follow your dreams and don't kill yourself.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And I think the point here is rainbows and gummy bears.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I'm allergic to gummy bears.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Well, non-allergic.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
They make you shit.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
They make you shit rainbows.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
No, they just make you shit for hours.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Didn't you see the Amazon review?

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Where was I? Talking about Japanese release dates.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Which somehow led to clopping.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
And poop.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Fable Anniversary Limited Edition comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Going over to the Playstation Vita in Japan this week.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Puyo Puyo Tetris.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Terraria comes out on the Vita this week. I didn't even know that was a Vita release.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
And Super Heroine Chronicle.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
That means a female hero, not a drug warlord type game.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Especially since that guy just died.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Yeah, it would be in poor taste, wouldn't it?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
It would be in poor taste.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
On the Wii U, hey guess what's out on the Wii U?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Puyo Puyo Tetris. This game is getting around.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I love Puyo Puyo.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
And Monster Hunter Frontier G Memorial Package.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
They need to have a re-release of Monster Hunter every week in Japan.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Well, that's just because they want to set up permanent residents outside of the Capcom headquarters.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Lastly, but not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
This is important because this is a big title for some people.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Dragon Quest Monsters 2 is out this week in Japan.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I know some people like that little spin-off series.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
There's a lot of slime accessories to go with that.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
The iconic Dragon Quest character.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
You know, we had a slime that used to wear Dan's wedding ring as its crown.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
That's awesome.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And then Midna found it.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I was like, can I play with this?

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
And lastly, but not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Dar Sakura.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Clopping.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Puyo Puyo Tetris!

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Alright, let's go to the UK.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Kind of off topic.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Kind of.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
From Valentine's Day, Dan and I are going to bust out our Dreamcasts.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
So I can play Puyo Puyo Da.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And Blue Stinger.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
With a really motion sick camera.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Just saying that that's our idea of romantic.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Okay, so in February in the UK, we have a few things.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
On the 4th, we have The Sun at Night on PC.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
We have on the 5th, Outlast for PS4.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
And on the 7th, we have Fable Trilogy on the Xbox 360.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
And Jazzpunk for Mac and PC.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Jazzpunk.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
That sounds interesting.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
What is jazzpunk?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
It's jazz and punk.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Oh, it's like an indie game sort of thing with...

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
It has a neat art style to it.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
That's kind of cool.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Okay, I'll have to get that.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Alright.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
By Necrophone Games.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Necrophilia Games? What?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Necrophone.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Oh, okay.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Sounds like a company Extrovert might work for.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And it looks like they had a big thing at PAX Prime.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
So, that's cool.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Alright, moving on to one more story before we get to our classic game of the week.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And this talks about a newer game.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
And it's an MMO that some people are very excited about.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
We talked a lot about this game a couple weeks ago on Hoard House.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
And it made me excited for it.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
EverQuest Next is going to be released on the PlayStation 4.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
It was confirmed.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
It's coming to PlayStation 4.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000
This came from an AMA over on Reddit, which is how we break news now.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
But John Smedley, who's the CEO of SOE,

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
was really talking about the closures of those games there.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
But he also took some questions on other titles.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And one of the things he talked about, EverQuest Next.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And it will be available on the PlayStation 4.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
He almost confirmed this last November.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
But kind of stopped short of actually confirming it.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000
But now it went out on Twitter.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
It went out on the official Twitter.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And that's how we break news now.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
AMAs and Twitters.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Gotcha.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
So, there you go.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Is it going to be cross-platform between PC and...

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I don't think they've said that yet.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I would sure hope so, considering it's an SOE, Sony online entertainment game.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
No kidding.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
No kidding.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Anything is possible.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Yeah, that's really interesting.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I mean, you're looking at the PlayStation 4, it's getting a lot of MMOs now.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Between Final Fantasy XIV, Elder Scrolls Online, and now EverQuest Next.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And I mean, these are not...

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
They also have Warframe, which is, I mean, kind of MMO-lite.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Yeah, some of those free-to-play games.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
It's very interesting.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And we're not, like...

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
In the PlayStation 3 days, we had some cool MMOs.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
But there was a lot of shit, too.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Like, Free Realms.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Sorry, that's one of the ones that's closing.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
So, it's kind of neat to see that, like...

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Oh, and PlayStation 4's got DC Universe, which is pretty cool, too.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Like, it's very different.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
So, it's kind of neat that, you know, we're seeing, like, a lot of MMOs.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
EverQuest Next is free-to-play, isn't it?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Oh, I have no idea.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I have been really following it.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
All the other EverQuest games are.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I know there was Landmark and there was Next, so...

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Hey, I'm all for more free games.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
How about it?

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
All right.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Well, let's move on to...

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
We're gonna take a trip back down memory lane to a time when games definitely weren't free.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
They cost you at least a quarter.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Or, who are we kidding?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Two tokens, 50 cents per credit.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.000
We're gonna walk down the aisle of memory lane where Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
and finds a game that she thinks,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Hey, you, brat, play this game.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Or I'm gonna, you know what?

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Get off my lawn and play this game.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
All right.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Get inside from the outside.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Or, play this game where I'm gonna take a shit in your mouth.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Ew.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Ew.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Let's take off this game where I'm just gonna pull your head off with your spine attached

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
to it and set the rest of you on ice.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
There's gonna be a babality, right, Dark Sakura?

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
And then I'm gonna take a shit in your mouth.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
What?

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
You're obsessed with shitting.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I don't know.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I'm not obsessed with shit.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I take my fiber.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week already?

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Are you watching porn?

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
No, it's got an ad here.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Okay.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Is it pony porn?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
What is the classic game of the week?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Are you copping?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
It's Mortal Kombat.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Sorry, X versus Mortal Klop bat.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:55.000
So, Mortal Kombat was put out by Midway and later on Acclaim for the home consoles.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And, it was done by Ed Boon and John Tobias and this has spawned quite a lot of wank over

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000
the years and crossovers and all kinds of things.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And is now the franchise owned by Warner Brothers since 2009 after Midway went bankrupt.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000
So basically it is, it was supposed to be an original game that was starring Jean-Claude

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.500
Van Damme, but it fell through.

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.600
And like I said, it has all kinds of shit around it.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:32.320
Even a TV show, I tried to watch some of the TV show and it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.320
Tara bad, but it was terrible.

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:41.520
So, it's bloody violent, has fatalities where you just kill them at the end of the round

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:52.280
and this was the game of my high school experience, actually Mortal Kombat 2 was more of the game

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:57.120
of my experience, but you can't talk about Mortal Kombat 2 without going to its roots.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:14.800
So anyway, all of the games, well up through the third game they were digitized actors

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.160
and sometimes it would just be palette swaps depending on the different characters, like

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:25.360
for example Scorpion and Sub-Zero, same dude, different colors.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:32.320
And I remember back in EGM actually having interviews with some of the actors and showing

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.640
them the costume and behind the scenes filming, so it was really neat.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:48.620
So yeah, the first three were 2D style with digitized actors and you had a high punch,

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:50.720
low punch, high kick, low kick and block.

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:53.960
Mortal Kombat 3 added a run button.

01:36:53.960 --> 01:37:00.400
So basically it was just kick everybody's ass, try to make it to the end of the game

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:05.880
and if you have your timing perfectly and know where to do it, where to stand to do

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:14.160
your moves, you get a fatality where you can rip someone's neck out or all kinds of things,

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.400
set them on fire if you're Scorpion, blow the kiss of death if you're Sonya.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:24.800
And it had, starting with, I think it was really with Mortal Kombat 2, it started having

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:34.520
more of the people would start going into like the game menus and start reading things

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:40.760
and that's where they got the noobs I bought from and a bunch of different rumors and then

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:46.200
a little easter eggs hidden in the game and it really just sort of, it seemed that basically

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:52.240
if someone made up a theory about game A, then by the time game B came out, the theory

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.760
would actually be in the new game.

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:58.480
So it seemed like a lot of feedback was actually listened to, the fan community was really

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:01.560
paid attention to.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:05.560
Yes you can drop an arcade machine on somebody, I think that was Mortal Kombat 2.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:10.520
Or you could, see Mortal Kombat 2 just really started putting in, Mortal Kombat 3 started

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:18.120
putting in the funny stuff like the, the, what was it, the fableties and the animalities.

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.120
Those were in 2 I think.

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:27.920
No, 2 had the fableties and the friendships, friendships were great, friendships were great.

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:36.780
Which honestly, it's just that this was really kind of a shift in fighting games at the time

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:42.340
because you were going from the, I would say a good number of the popular fighting

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.620
games at the time were out of Japan.

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:50.300
You know we had our Street Fighter at the time, we had our, I think, you know KOF started

01:38:50.300 --> 01:39:01.300
after that because this actually was first out in 1992 so yeah this was before King of

01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:02.300
Fighters.

01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:07.980
By the time you had like Fatal Fury and World Heroes and you know all of those games and

01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:14.740
this was something that was new, it was supposed to be more of a realistic kind of, of, I mean

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:20.660
at least by just having actual human looking people and the violence, you had all the blood

01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:28.300
which oh my god they're just, everybody's freaking out over fake skeletons and red pixels.

01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:31.700
It was something else though that it was like, I mean it's one thing to have the violence

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:35.220
of cartoons but this was really one of the first circumstances where you had that kind

01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:41.380
of extreme violence, as I say as Raiden gets impaled on a spike there in the video, using

01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:43.620
like digitized real people.

01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.620
That was a real eye opener for some people, you know what I mean?

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.620
It was.

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:51.980
And then there was, they also had the stage based fatalities, remember the pit?

01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:53.940
Yeah we just saw that in the video, yeah yeah.

01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:59.020
Yeah and they really played on that in Mortal Kombat too with having the acid bath and the

01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:00.020
pit for that one.

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:03.420
I think every Mortal Kombat game has had a pit stage now.

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:05.420
Yeah now.

01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:10.980
But you just, you have those, and the storyline in the game, you know, the first one was like

01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:16.340
oh you have to go to the outer world and fight to save Earth, blah blah blah, cliche, but

01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:25.860
as it's gone forward, the series itself has really developed its own rich type of mythology,

01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:29.180
you know, really vast character base, I mean.

01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:33.900
Yeah when you play the new one, it's like there's a lot of story in it, which is really

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:38.500
weird for such a dumb fighting game, I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Mortal Kombat,

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:41.300
but it's kind of dumb.

01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:44.660
And I also thought it was funny that some of the influence for this game actually came

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:46.940
from Big Trouble in Little China.

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:47.940
I can see that.

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:55.340
Well especially in, what was the character, Kung Lao, and Raiden, which I hate how people

01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:58.060
mispronounce that name, but anyway.

01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:03.940
So yeah, now the other thing about this, and this is actually where one of my pinball heroes,

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:09.700
Steve Ritchie, comes into play, who I have met, he's a lovely guy, he autographed a couple

01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:16.140
of our pinball tables, but he's the one that suggested the K instead of the C for Mortal

01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:19.220
Kombat.

01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:23.060
And that, it just sort of stuck.

01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:25.900
So there you go.

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:32.860
It was, like I said, it was with Mortal Kombat 4 that it really went to the 3D and then moved

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:41.140
on from there, but I think that really this was just the big thing to stick.

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:45.420
And then when you had the home copies come out, like for example, the Sega version, the

01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:51.220
Genesis Mega Drive, had different Easter eggs in it, like for example, Mortal Kombat 2 had

01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:52.580
Pong in it, remember?

01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:53.860
Yeah, I do.

01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:56.500
For record, that does not work on the Super Nintendo version.

01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:00.900
My brother and I stayed up all night playing 250 versus matches to try to get that to work,

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:03.700
but I have done it in the arcade.

01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:12.900
There were the Fergalities for the Genesis version, the Sega CD had the D.A.D.D.S code

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:19.620
that changed all the fighters to the characters from a show called D.A.D.D.S Army.

01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:23.700
Reptile and Jade were included as hidden characters and they finally came out in the later ones.

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:25.940
So there's the toasty thing around here.

01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:26.940
I do.

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:36.580
But again, we can't really go into any of the other ones without it.

01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:37.580
Absolutely.

01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:41.020
So, how about the list?

01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.020
Or I won't go through the whole list.

01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:44.020
Can I ask about this?

01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:45.660
Because I'm seeing comments on it in chat too.

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:51.100
You said you are bothered when people say Raiden, but I thought that's what the announcer

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:52.100
said.

01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:55.740
That's how it's pronounced in the game, but the actual legit way to pronounce that name

01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:56.740
is Raiden.

01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:00.300
Well, because I'm thinking like obviously there was that other game that was called

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:04.060
Raiden that, you know, was out in the arcades and I'm sure we think of that, but then I'm

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:05.060
thinking...

01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:06.060
No, that's people being Americans.

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:09.500
But wasn't, well, wasn't his name at one point spelled R-A-Y-D-E-N?

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:14.340
Yeah, but if they're trying to name someone after a legit thunder god and just misspell

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:18.140
it because that's how they think it's supposed to be, that doesn't necessarily make it right.

01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:19.140
Alright, alright.

01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:20.140
I had to ask.

01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:21.140
I'm sorry.

01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:25.340
It's my little uppity internal Japanese major.

01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:26.460
At least you can admit it.

01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:27.460
I can admit it.

01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:35.060
So we started in 1992 and the franchise is still going on 20 years later.

01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:36.740
So that's to say something.

01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:40.980
We have the first Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat 2, Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate, Mortal Kombat

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:44.300
3, Mortal Kombat trilogy, Mortal Kombat 4, Mortal Kombat mythology sub-zero, Mortal Kombat

01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:48.220
2, Mortal Kombat Gold, Mortal Kombat Special Forces, Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance, Tournament

01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:53.540
Edition, Deception, Shaolin Monks, Unchained, Armageddon, Ultimate Mortal Kombat, Mortal

01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:58.140
Kombat Collection, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, which was kind of amusing but they took out,

01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:01.900
they changed Joker's fatality, but they put it in with another character in a later one

01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:03.460
where he just comes out and shoots them.

01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.460
That's pretty funny.

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:10.840
Mortal Kombat, which was the 2011 release, which is the reboot game, Mortal Kombat Arcade

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.400
Collection and Mortal Kombat Complete Edition.

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:16.400
So yeah.

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.040
And then we had one good movie and a bunch of crap after that.

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.480
And Utah Saints remix.

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:24.480
That's right.

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.480
Good stuff.

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:26.480
The first movie was so good.

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.280
How could the second movie be so bad?

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:34.180
An interesting kind of like FYI from Dark Tetsuya in the chat room saying again back

01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:38.200
on the Raiden thing or Raiden, but I have to go here because Dark Tetsuya says, I think

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:41.240
that was because of Fatal Furies Raiden at the time.

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.240
That's right.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.120
I think that's why they had ended up in later games, they had changed the spelling was because

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.480
of the Fatal Fury character.

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:48.920
I don't know.

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:49.920
All right.

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:51.120
We're done with that topic.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:53.820
I just, I had, I thought I kind of went, Oh yeah.

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:54.820
When I read that comment.

01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:58.600
The TV show was actually kind of okay.

01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.600
It was...

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.600
They also had a cartoon.

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.600
Well, they had the web series on YouTube not that long ago.

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.600
Cartoon was awful.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.600
What, the cartoon?

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.600
The cartoon was awful.

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.600
The web series was kind of neat.

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.040
They had some big actors in it.

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:09.880
I'm surprised about that.

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:10.880
All right.

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:11.880
All right.

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:12.880
I have a Mortal Kombat story.

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.880
All right.

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:14.880
Yeah.

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:22.840
Did you guys see that there, the subway or the 12 minute YouTube subway ad that this

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:23.840
band did?

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:24.840
No.

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:25.840
What?

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.080
Where they, they sing $5 foot long for like 12 minutes.

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:31.660
They're all in Mortal Kombat cosplay.

01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:37.320
Actually it starts with like Sub-Zero in Scorpion and Scorpion on the mic, you know, Sub-Zero

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:38.320
on the drums.

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.320
Wait.

01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.320
Is that on YouTube?

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.320
It's on YouTube.

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:42.320
It's called...

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.320
I don't know.

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.320
12 minutes, $5 foot long.

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.520
And they're like $5 foot long.

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:47.520
And then as the...

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.520
There it is.

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:49.520
Your classic game of the week, Mortal Kombat.

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:50.840
Now I gotta find this $5 foot long.

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:56.200
As it's going on, more and more cosplay, you know, like Molina and like all kinds of other

01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:00.600
characters come in with their subways and they're like eating as he's singing $5 foot

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.600
long.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.600
Oh my God.

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.600
I think this is it.

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:12.080
It's uh, it says 12 minute, $5 foot long cover by Mortal Komband.

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:13.080
Is it?

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:16.200
You know, I was going to end this with a really profound statement.

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.800
Is $5 foot long the statement?

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.800
No.

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:22.800
I have to hear this.

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.800
There's smoke.

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:31.800
Are they going to sing the song or not?

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.800
Scorpion on drums.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Dar Sakura, let's get to your statement while we wait for them to actually sing something.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000
It's going to sound awful if it is.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
This sounds like a Wesley Willis song.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.100
So Time Magazine in 2012 had a quote that Mortal Kombat had become the boogeyman for

01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:01.320
anti-games activists and politicians.

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:06.400
But the reason the 1992 classic remains seminal is because it broke the implicit taboo about

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:09.000
what was okay to put in a game.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
And there you have it.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.080
All right, there it is.

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.200
Your classic game of the week, $5 foot long.

01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:16.600
Oh, they're not even paying us to advertise.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:17.800
Look at that stealth marketing.

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.480
I don't eat at Subway because of bread.

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.400
The classic game of the week was $5 foot long.

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.400
That's what you just said.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.400
That's what I just said.

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:30.400
The classic game is Jamie kicking Rob's ass during the break.

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.480
There might be a fatality.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:35.480
But stay tuned, guys, because we've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come,

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:37.480
including some rapid-fire news.

01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:41.480
The FUGO Question of the Week and your calls at 1877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:42.480
Orange Launch Radio.

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.480
We've got more show to come.

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:46.480
More Matt, more Exfer, more Shane.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.480
Maybe more Shane if he's not too busy playing Phoenix Wright.

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:54.480
Plenty more of that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:08.400
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio live on this Sunday evening.

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.400
Happy Groundhog Day because there's not any other bowl type of games going on today.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.400
Actually, we were talking during the break, and I think Matt, who is one of our guests tonight,

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:23.400
was mentioning that one of the teams got annihilated in the Super Bowl or something.

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:25.400
Do we want to spoil that?

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.400
Okay.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.400
We're going to download this tomorrow.

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:30.400
Watch it live or you didn't.

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.400
I don't know people that DVR the Super Bowl game, but...

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:36.400
Yeah, well, I actually don't know anything about football, but...

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.400
Tough titty.

01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.400
I'm from Seattle.

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.400
I'm happy the Seahawks won.

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.400
So Seahawks won their first Super Bowl, right?

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:43.400
Their first Super Bowl.

01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:44.400
All right.

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:45.400
Congratulations.

01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:48.400
Now, that led to a topic we were talking about just briefly during the break.

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.400
Speaking of Seattle, and I didn't bring this up earlier, you guys went to PAX last year.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.400
You guys go, like, a lot, don't you?

01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:54.400
Yeah, we love it.

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:55.400
Since you're from Seattle?

01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:00.400
Yeah, Christopher and I have gone the last two years and I've gone probably six or seven times since then.

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:01.400
Yeah.

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.400
I remember the first time I went, it was super small.

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:14.400
You can buy a ticket at the door and the expo hall would be one small room and there'd be...

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.400
You could play anything, but now it's like super long line.

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.400
Yeah.

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.400
It's really long, but it's really great.

01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:23.400
I was going to say, how does it feel though?

01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:27.400
Now that it's this big thing that everybody's into, do you kind of miss the old days?

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:35.400
I do miss the old days, but I like how it is now because now there's so much excitement and it feels like a giant party almost.

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:40.400
You see the enthusiasm of everyone and everyone's there.

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:43.400
You know it's into things like me.

01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:46.400
You can probably smell the enthusiasm too.

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:51.400
What does enthusiasm smell like?

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:53.400
Probably B.O.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.400
All right, you guys are going back to PAX again this year, I imagine?

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.400
Most definitely.

01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.400
As long as you can get a ticket.

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.400
What are you most looking forward to out of this year's PAX?

01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:03.400
I guess it's too early to ask maybe, but...

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.400
Yeah, I don't know.

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.400
I mean, the thing I like the most actually is back to board games.

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.400
At PAX, they have a huge board game.

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:12.400
They always have a huge board game library.

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.400
I was going to ask about that, yeah.

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:19.400
We're always, my friends and I, we're just like, let's find something that we've never played before and check it out.

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:20.400
Board games are expensive.

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:23.400
I just remember Wil Wheaton signed my iPhone.

01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:24.400
That did happen at PAX.

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.400
It wore off by the end of the day.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.400
Shane, are you going to try to go to one of these expos this year?

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:36.400
It would be cool, especially now that it's not associated with Penny Arcade anymore, so it's tolerable.

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:41.400
Do they have any big gaming shows in Kansas?

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:42.400
I guess...

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.400
Is there like a Wichita anime slash video game?

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:49.400
I don't know if there's an anime thing, but no.

01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:52.400
I thought I'd ask.

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.400
All right.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.400
Let's get back into the news.

01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:02.400
We're running a little long tonight with all these great people in the studio, but we want to just run through the news here so we can get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.400
Not yet, because we've got plenty of news first.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:07.400
Rapid fire news, and I'm actually going to start us off.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:13.400
We were talking about online games earlier, and one online game that hasn't come up was The Secret World.

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.400
But I know there's some people that are really into The Secret World.

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.400
Well, some very interesting news regarding The Secret World this week.

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:25.400
Funcom's offices, Funcom is the group that made The Secret World, they got raided.

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.400
And this is coming out of Norwegian.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:31.400
Was it like a 20-man raid?

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.400
I don't know how many people are on the police force in Norway.

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:41.400
I almost said Norwegian, but I corrected myself and said Norway.

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:46.400
I don't know how many people are on the police force in Norway who went to where these guys are located in Oslo.

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:52.400
But yeah, they went to get boxes of seized documents.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:58.400
And yeah, apparently the reason why, infringement of the provisions of the Securities Trading Act.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:05.400
Now, of course, Funcom came out later and said, move along, everything's fine, nothing happened, the game's still being made, we're good, y'all.

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:10.400
But certainly it made a lot of people raise their eyebrows if they got raided.

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:15.400
All right, moving on to news on Pac-Man Museum.

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:20.400
If you were looking forward to getting Pac-Man Museum, yes, yet another repackaging of various Pac-Man games.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:24.400
Does anybody even want this game? Because I think the answer is no.

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:27.400
Dark Sakura, you like Namco stuff. Do you want Pac-Man Museum?

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:30.400
I do. How many freaking versions of Pac-Man do I have to own?

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:31.400
Exactly.

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.400
Don't you want Pac and Pal again?

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.400
All right, well here's the thing.

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.400
I want baby Pac-Man, okay? That's it.

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:45.400
If you were looking forward to this on the 3DS or Wii U, tough titty, because the games are no longer coming out. It was cancelled.

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:52.400
The game was announced last summer and it was supposed to come out on Steam, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and then Wii U and 3DS eShops.

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:57.400
But then it was updated to remove the references to Wii U and 3DS.

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:03.400
And the reason why they got cancelled? Quote, a result of delayed development.

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:05.400
Hmmm.

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.400
Made sense.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.400
Hmmm.

01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.400
All right, so there you go.

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.400
Also, one quick story here on The Wolf Among Us.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:18.400
This was a game from Telltale that they did last year that a lot of people were talking about.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.400
It's like one of their favorite games of the year.

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:24.400
I have yet to play it sadly, but I'm really excited to check it out.

01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:33.400
Episode 2, Smoke and Mirrors, has been announced that it is coming out for PC, Mac, and PlayStation 3 on February 4th.

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:36.400
Xbox 360 the very next day.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:40.400
Telltale announced that news and I know a lot of people will be very happy to hear about that.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.400
The Wolf Among Us.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:47.400
Okay, there's giggling going on because of something that you brought up earlier about JCPenney being drunk.

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:49.400
Wasn't that really funny, the tweets you're making?

01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:51.400
Yeah, but Kia.

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:52.400
I love Kia.

01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:54.400
Kia came and said do you need a Disney dress?

01:53:54.400 --> 01:54:00.400
They came out, JCPenney came out later and said they were typing with mittens that are available at JCPenney.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:05.400
Yeah, were those mittens soaked in alcohol that they were spilling all over themselves?

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:09.400
You know what? I call it a brilliant viral marketing move.

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.400
Like, okay, everybody's talking about it.

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:15.400
I didn't even watch the damn Super Bowl, but I heard about that Radio Shack commercial, which was awesome.

01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:16.400
I didn't hear about that.

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:22.400
The Radio Shack commercial was, hey, we're that store from the 1980s.

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:29.400
And then all these 1980s icons run into the store like Alf and Mary Lou Retton and all this stuff.

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:32.400
And then they say, you know, we're not just that store from the 80s anymore.

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.400
So it was very, very like, tongue in cheek.

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:38.400
What's the assurance when I keep seeing hashtags for on Twitter all over the place?

01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:39.400
I don't know.

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:44.400
Somebody tell me because it looks like it might be a contest.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:49.400
You can tell Shane in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, although he'll have to look over my shoulder to see it, I guess.

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.400
I can't see it.

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.400
Go home, JCPenney. You're drunk.

01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.400
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for rapid fire news?

01:54:53.400 --> 01:55:00.400
Well, in other news, it's stupid machinery that I actually really love, the Apple technology.

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:05.400
There is sad news in the gaming world, and that has to deal with cave.

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:09.400
You know, we have lots of listeners who are totally cave shooter fans.

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:22.400
Well, and if this gives you an idea of, you know, just what cave's done, it was DeathSmiles, Dodonpachi, Espagaluda, Espagaluda 2.

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:28.400
But they basically are closing their western offices. They've closed their English blog.

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:35.400
And I think the last thing that they've done was the DeathSmiles 2X, which was untranslated.

01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.400
They just published it over here.

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:41.400
So, that's sadness, but we will still be importing them.

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:45.400
Were they found in their apartment with a needle in their arm, too, like Philip Seymour Hoffman?

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.400
Stop it! Why would you say that?

01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:53.400
What even provoked you to say such an awful thing?

01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:55.400
Is your name Extafirm?

01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:57.400
He's laughing at it.

01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:58.400
I am laughing.

01:55:58.400 --> 01:55:59.400
Your fans are awful.

01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.400
Here's my thing. Here's my thing. Okay, okay.

01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:04.400
I'm gonna make one little political comment, and then I'm gonna move on to the rest of this.

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.400
Oh, boy. When she says one little political comment, brace yourself.

01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:13.400
Why is it that everybody is all like, oh, he's going to be so missed, and it's such a shame he was battling drugs,

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:19.400
when if it was just a regular person on the street that died of a heroin overdose, you'd call him a fucking junkie?

01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:21.400
What's up with that?

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:23.400
He was a fucking junkie. I'm sorry.

01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:25.400
Yeah, he was. Well, stop with that!

01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:29.400
They found him with a needle hanging out of his body.

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.400
Look what you did! Look what you did!

01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:34.400
That had nothing to do with video games!

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:39.400
Are you just mad that nobody answered your question about dumbass insurance or whatever it was you were asking about?

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:41.400
Yes, that's what they get punished for.

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:45.400
Apparently it's too soon, because that's all I'm seeing in the chat room.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:51.400
Video games, people. Video games.

01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:55.400
He is about to be a Cards Against Humanity card pretty soon.

01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:56.400
He is.

01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.400
May I go back to my serious thing?

01:56:58.400 --> 01:56:59.400
Yes.

01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:06.400
Why is it that celebrities are held to a higher standard for doing the same fuckery that we belittle other people for?

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:09.400
God damn it, I thought serious thing meant video game news.

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:13.400
Just think about your double standards, people.

01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.400
Okay, so moving forward.

01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:17.400
Don't nod.

01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:26.400
There was a rumor, and I actually read the rumor on Eurogamer myself, that they filed for bankruptcy, but they actually did not file for bankruptcy.

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:36.400
They did something in France called judicial reorganization that allows them to basically reorganize the company without having to file for bankruptcy.

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:40.400
And by the way, this is the company that did Remember Me for Capcom.

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:44.400
And then last, but not least, but very unsurprising news.

01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:50.400
Zynga bought another company, they bought Natural Motion, and then they fired 15% of their global workforce.

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:53.400
So fuck you, Zynga.

01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:58.400
No, Jamie, tell us how you really feel.

01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:01.400
Alright.

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:02.400
Moving on.

01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:04.400
I'm gonna make a bad joke.

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:05.400
Oh no.

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:07.400
I don't know if you're allowed to talk anymore.

01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:19.400
I wonder if King is gonna rip them off and fire 15% of their global workforce and repackage it as firing global workforce saga.

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:28.400
This is why I don't visit often.

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:33.400
This is why it'll be another five years before Shane's invited back on the show.

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.400
Hey, it's the Fubo Question of the Week.

01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:37.400
Oh, what, Jamie?

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:43.400
I'm just saying, people need to get their priorities straight and not live in, you know, the brave new world.

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:51.400
I'm just saying Fubo Question of the Week, y'all.

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:55.400
You take Facebook and Google Plus and you slam them together, you get Fubo.

01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:57.400
It's the Fubo Question of the Week.

01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:59.400
This week's question, very easy.

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:01.400
Whatever could have inspired a question like this.

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:06.400
What is your favorite sports game ever made and why?

01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:09.400
And I clearly said, by the way, at Facebook and Google, I said,

01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:16.400
Don't be a party pooper with the I hate all sports answer because there's more sports than those that involve balls.

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:18.400
Yes, I said balls.

01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.400
How many people said that they hate all sports?

01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.400
You shouldn't read them.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:23.400
I'm not going to read them.

01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:25.400
But we can make fun of them. Read their names.

01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:27.400
Okay, I will.

01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:29.400
Osfer says, NFL Blitz.

01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:33.400
That series was just plain silly and I loved playing as a bald eagle that caught on fire.

01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:37.400
It would be all kinds of need if that's actually how Super Bowl games win.

01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:40.400
Unfolded Raptor says, Harry Potter Quidditch World Cup.

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:43.400
You know, that's a creative answer. Great answer.

01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:49.400
It's the closest thing you get to playing real Quidditch without actually going outside on a broom beating balls into vertical hoops with a stick.

01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:51.400
It plays a lot like soccer and is a lot of fun.

01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:56.400
The game was fairly overlooked, but as a sports game, I find it to be an underrated gem.

01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:59.400
Andy R. replied and said, Blizz Ball.

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:03.400
I think you meant to say Blitz Ball and I'm assuming that's from Final Fantasy X.

02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:07.400
Rob H. says, California games on the Sega Master System 2.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:11.400
But I've always loved the WWE SmackDown games since PlayStation 1.

02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:16.400
But I've gone off of them since the 360 and PlayStation 3 era.

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:20.400
I also have a soft spot for Sensible Soccer on the Amiga.

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:25.400
It's one of those games that's fun, simple multiplayer and I spent a lot of time on that with my brother and friends in the early 90s.

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:29.400
Sly Red Panda says, Beach Spikers for the GameCube.

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:34.400
Great mechanics and design and you can do four player versus, two versus two co-op matches.

02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:37.400
It's one of the few games my non-gamer cousins love to play.

02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:43.400
There's nothing better than throwing shade at your opponents by smashing their faces in via a full powered volleyball spike.

02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:45.400
And that's followed by a heart.

02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:49.400
Monty Boggs says, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey.

02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:51.400
I've never had an interest in hockey but that game is great.

02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:55.400
Delvin, our buddy from Video Game Realness.

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:57.400
That's a really hilarious show, by the way.

02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:59.400
Check that out, Video Game Realness.

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.400
Delvin says, Skate or Die is pretty rad.

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.400
And also, Paperboy.

02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:05.400
Yes, that's right, Paperboy.

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:10.400
Because dodging bitches with bats and people exercising in the street and assholes who back out randomly is a sport.

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:13.400
Of course, there's the bonus round that's actually more sports-like.

02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:17.400
Tech 2030 says, SSX Tricky on PlayStation 2.

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.400
It was insane, unrealistic and I loved it.

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:23.400
Renji221 says, NBA 2K11.

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:25.400
That was the first basketball I played in years.

02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:29.400
Eddie K says, always been a fan of most NHL games.

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.400
Being Canadian and all.

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:34.400
Also, the most recent UFC games were really good.

02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:38.400
And although it's not technically a sport, I've always had a soft spot for pro wrestling games.

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:42.400
Strudels89 says, I was a huge fan of NBA Street on the GameCube.

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.400
Basketball is my favorite sport.

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.400
I loved getting my meters up and just breaking the backboards doing those crazy tricks.

02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:50.400
Tim Tripp says, Bushido Blade.

02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:52.400
Kendo is totally a sport.

02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:59.400
Tiara says, if poker counts as a sport, since they show it on ESPN, sure it counts.

02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:03.400
Then my favorite sports game ever created is Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII.

02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:08.400
It's probably one of the most fun minigames in the Final Fantasy series other than Chocobo Hot and Cold.

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:13.400
But it wasn't nearly as good as Chocobo Racers, just saying that game was the bomb.

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.400
AZHP said, I just recently discovered a Neo Geo gem called Windjammers.

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:19.400
I think it came out in America as Flying Power Disc.

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:22.400
Dark Soccer is probably the only person who heard of it though.

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:25.400
I've heard of Windjammers actually. I haven't heard of the US one.

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:29.400
Codeman says, my favorite sports game is and always will be NBA Jam.

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:33.400
I always played a lot of it in arcades and console and well, best catch phrases ever.

02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:35.400
Boom Shakalaka.

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:39.400
CyberJudge says, I have to say that I love hockey and soccer games in general.

02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:43.400
But the one game that sticks in my mind when I think of sports games is the very first sport game I owned on NES.

02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:45.400
Blades of Steel.

02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:51.400
The joys of 8-bit graphics, blue and red, nameless guys skating around in fights out in the yin yang.

02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:53.400
The best.

02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:56.400
Generate Johnny says, I'm going with Mutant League Hockey.

02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:01.400
Why? What's not to love about robots, undead and trolls playing hockey together?

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:05.400
Besides, the only hockey game that turns a traditional hockey fight into a brutal deathmatch.

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:11.400
Ryan B. responds and says, here is the game that tops all sports games.

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:13.400
Tecmo Bowl or Super Tecmo Bowl.

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:16.400
It was way better than Madden, better than NFL Live or Blitz.

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.400
Hell, I'm shocked that nobody said Daytona USA.

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:25.400
Haseo Sumerugawa says, I'm going to just say Mirror's Edge.

02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:30.400
Because Parker is technically a sport and the game is centered around using Parker to get around.

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.400
So yeah, otherwise NBA Jam on the Genesis because Boom Shakalaka.

02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:38.400
Backwards Glance says, Super Monkey Boxing.

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:41.400
Beating up a friend as a cute monkey. I also love their billiards.

02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:45.400
NFL Blitz is the answer from Matt Jay.

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.400
The only traditional sports game I ever got into.

02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:53.400
Now if you're willing to step beyond anything really traditional, then I'd go with Mario Kart.

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:58.400
Have owned nearly every title in the series and loved every single one.

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:02.400
Going over to Google Plus real quick, we just have a few answers over there.

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:05.400
Rettertainment says, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004.

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:09.400
I like golf games in general and Tiger Woods PGA Tour especially.

02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:13.400
But the 2004 model of the game is the first Tiger Woods game I really sunk my teeth into.

02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.400
The experience I had playing this game is what I compare other sports games to.

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:24.400
Sam H said, NFL 2K5 had 3, 5, and 7 step drops with actual play verbiage.

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:28.400
True pocket passing and offensive lineman and receivers blocking correctly in the run game.

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:33.400
And lastly, Jason. He's here tonight through the Fugu question who says,

02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:36.400
The Mario sports games have been incredibly impressive.

02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:40.400
I had a ton of fun with Mario Strikers, Tennis, Virtual Boy, and GameCube alike.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:43.400
And really all the Mario universe party games.

02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:47.400
I generally don't like golf games, but Mario Golf was fun and approachable.

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:53.400
With just enough charm and tweaks to the way the game played to make it really worth, sorry,

02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:57.400
to make it a worthwhile and even legitimate golf game.

02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:00.400
Really hotshots golf with a recognizable brand attached.

02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:06.400
So I'd probably pick NFL Blitz as my favorite. After naming all those games.

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:13.400
Alright. There. I read all the answers because the last couple weeks I've been skipping some of the answers and I felt bad.

02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:16.400
How about you guys? Quickly. Like favorite sports games.

02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:18.400
Shane, do you have a sports game?

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:21.400
Yes, I played the crap out of Ken Griffey on Super Nintendo.

02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:26.400
It was part of, I think, the Nintendo Power Fest one year and so I wanted to get good at it.

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:29.400
I played it non-stop and I ended up liking it a lot.

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:35.400
My favorite sports game, and I can't believe nobody named it, is Kirby's Dream Course on the Super Nintendo.

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:37.400
It's cause Act F didn't answer tonight.

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.400
It's miniature golf. What? It counts?

02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:42.400
He was too busy clopping.

02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:49.400
I would also say, honestly, Wii Sports Bowling really changed everything in many ways.

02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.400
So, I don't know. I kind of have to tip my hat to that too.

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:54.400
But of course I loved a lot of the stuff you guys named too.

02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:56.400
Like NBA Jam and Blades of Steel. Of course, of course.

02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:57.400
Extrovert?

02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:04.400
I think the only sports game, besides fighting games if you consider that sports, I don't know.

02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:09.400
Would boxing be considered?

02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:10.400
Sure, why not?

02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:12.400
I love Mike Tyson's Punch Out.

02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:15.400
Fifth Dream just said that in the chat and I was like, that's a really good answer.

02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:18.400
And Super Punch Out was one of my favorite games ever.

02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:19.400
Sure, of course, boxing is sports.

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:22.400
Oh, and NBA Jam. I liked that a lot too when that was around.

02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:23.400
Jamie?

02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:27.400
Well, actually, you just named all of the ones that I liked too.

02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:33.400
Also, the one football game that I have to really say I liked was Super High Impact on the Super Nintendo.

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:35.400
Last but not least, Matt?

02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:39.400
Not sure if I'd call it a sports game, but I really liked Excitebike way back.

02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:40.400
That game's awesome.

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:41.400
It's Motocross.

02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:42.400
So why not? Why not?

02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:45.400
There was a Game Boy version of that that was really good.

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:46.400
Or no one.

02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.400
There was Motocross Maniacs, I think, was the Game Boy.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:52.400
And then there was Uniracer on the Super Nintendo, which kind of reminded me of Excitebike.

02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:53.400
Yeah, Uniracer was fun.

02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:56.400
I don't know why that game really reminded me of Excitebike, and I really liked it.

02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:58.400
I loved Excite Truck, though. You know that.

02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:00.400
Actually, there is a game.

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:03.400
Hydro Thunder.

02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:06.400
Hydro Thunder was super, super fun.

02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:08.400
A lot of good racing games out there. A lot of good stuff.

02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:12.400
Let's just say F-Zero. It's a racing game.

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:17.400
That's a very good way of looking at it. Why not? F-Zero's amazing.

02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:20.400
Alright, let's do some more news here before we get to some calls.

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:25.400
Quickly, some updates on free games. Yay, free games.

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:29.400
If you are an Xbox Live Gold member, you've got some free games coming your way.

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:33.400
Dead Island is the free game right now. That's the original.

02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:37.400
But I'm sure if you like Dead Island enough, they'll be happy to sell you.

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:40.400
Dead Island, the new one. Riptide? Is that the name of the new one?

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:42.400
They'll sell you the sequel happily.

02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:45.400
But that's free right now if you want to experience Dead Island 1.

02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:50.400
Free starting on February 16th will be Toy Soldiers Cold War.

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:55.400
I don't know anything about that game, but it's got a Rambo-looking guy and a Guile-looking guy on the front of it.

02:07:55.400 --> 02:08:00.400
Man, Xbox Live games they get for free are such crappy games.

02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:05.400
They must hate their customers. That's what I'm seeing off that picture.

02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:07.400
Now let's talk about PlayStation Plus.

02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:12.400
And then going over to PlayStation Plus, here's the free games that are coming out on PlayStation Plus.

02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:14.400
They just posted a February preview.

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:17.400
PlayStation 4 Outlast is going to be the free game on PlayStation 4.

02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:19.400
Oh, that's so scary. I don't know if I can do that.

02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:20.400
I know, right?

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:26.400
On PlayStation 3, Metro Last Light, Payday 2, and Remember Me.

02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.400
Solid titles.

02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:28.400
Those are all going to be pretty good.

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:30.400
And on the PlayStation Vita, this is pretty rad, too.

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:34.400
ModNation Racers Road Trip, which was an okay launch title.

02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:40.400
But Street Fighter versus Tekken, which, you know, even though that game was kind of not the best fighting game,

02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:44.400
it's still a pretty high-profile title to be going free on the Vita.

02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:46.400
Again, with PlayStation Plus. Those are all coming in February.

02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:51.400
But are they getting Dead Island, the first game from like five years ago?

02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:53.400
No, they are not, actually.

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:54.400
Dang.

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.400
I know.

02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:56.400
Really upsetting.

02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:57.400
All right.

02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.400
If only there was like a Humble Bundle I could have bought a while ago to have that in it.

02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:02.400
Dude, I think I got that one.

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:05.400
But I did not get Dead Island because I did not install that.

02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:07.400
All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.

02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:09.400
Well, we do have other news.

02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:13.400
And it's actually really, really good news.

02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:26.400
There's been a study that came out that stated that playing relaxing video games actually will increase your positive social behavior.

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:28.400
And they weren't just saying like just casual games.

02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:34.400
They included the Endless Ocean or the mini fishing game from Twilight Princess.

02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:36.400
They had Super Mario Galaxy, Wii Sports Resort.

02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:44.400
They even tested it against violent games and they said that they used the noise blast test.

02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:53.400
And basically said that it was the relaxing games caused better social behavior.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:57.400
Of course, it's not saying that violent games cause aggression.

02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:04.400
Just saying that they were overall less relaxed than those who played the more calming games.

02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:07.400
So, I mean, it's kind of a common sense duh thing.

02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:09.400
But at least we have a study behind it.

02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:12.400
Video games are good for you.

02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:16.400
It's always nice to hear more positive news like that come out of studies.

02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:22.400
See, and I find games where I kill lots of people to be highly relaxing so that makes me a much better person.

02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:24.400
Ace Trainer Jelly Bean.

02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:26.400
Which, by the way, I really like that name.

02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:28.400
And our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:31.400
I believe it. Flower, the game, makes me feel so happy.

02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:35.400
Flower is a very like zen kind of game.

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:42.400
I put it to how I use fractal to calm myself down before I'm about to go melty.

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.400
I was talking about this last week, Minecraft.

02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:47.400
And when I was playing Minecraft and I was building that tunnel, somebody said,

02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:49.400
Oh, you want to use world edit to do it real quick?

02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:50.400
I'm like, no.

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:52.400
It's like popping bubble wrap.

02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:53.400
It's therapeutic.

02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:56.400
I don't want to just click every little thing and make my own damn tunnel.

02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:58.400
I don't want to have the help.

02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:00.400
I mean, I appreciate it, but I don't want to do it myself.

02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:04.400
Well, that's kind of how I feel about doing stuff in Minecraft as well.

02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:15.400
But a friend of mine showed me another iOS game that is called Art of Glow.

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.400
And really, it's just like having a moving light bright on your phone.

02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:25.400
But at the same time, it was just super relaxing and it gives another focus for,

02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:29.400
I think, any type of emotion that happens to pop up.

02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:33.400
Or, you know, like how we all felt after playing a music game.

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.400
You know, you have happy music.

02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:37.400
You have the activity that goes with it.

02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:41.400
And that really, I think, also changes the mental state.

02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.400
Now, on the other end of the spectrum, I downloaded an iOS game this week

02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:46.400
that everybody's been talking about.

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.400
An iOS game this week that everybody's been talking about called Flappy Bird.

02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:53.400
Fucking hell.

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:57.400
This game is straight from the bowels of hell by Satan himself.

02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:58.400
I refuse to play it.

02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:59.400
Let me play it.

02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:00.400
I have a void.

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.400
You want to play it?

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:02.400
I have a void.

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:03.400
Candy Crush.

02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:04.400
Flappy Bird.

02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.400
I have a void.

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.400
All you do is you tap the screen to flap the bird.

02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:09.400
And you're going to fly through the pipes, okay?

02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:12.400
And try not to hit Mario while you're at it.

02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:14.400
Because it looks like...

02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:15.400
No, it's nothing to do with Mario.

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.400
It's more techno kitten adventure than Mario.

02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:18.400
Okay.

02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:19.400
Shane's...

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:21.400
Oh, he died already before he even got to the first pipe.

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:22.400
Way to go.

02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:24.400
You fly through the pipes.

02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:26.400
You're supposed to not play it and play a good game.

02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:31.400
All you do is you tap to flap, and you fly through the pipes.

02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:32.400
Way to go.

02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:34.400
Mom, did you say tap to flap?

02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:35.400
Tap to flap.

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:37.400
This is the worst game.

02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:38.400
Did you pay for this?

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:39.400
No, it's free.

02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:41.400
You get your money back.

02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:42.400
Too much.

02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:43.400
Too much.

02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:44.400
My best score is 11.

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:48.400
And then for the pony version, you bop to the crop.

02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:50.400
Shut up.

02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:55.400
Shane, do you have a zen game that you play to relax?

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:56.400
To relax?

02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:58.400
And get yourself at peace?

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:00.400
Like maybe you should have played it before coming to the show tonight?

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:02.400
Super hexagon.

02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.400
That game is stressful.

02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:05.400
That game is awesome.

02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:08.400
I can just play it for like an hour and not even care.

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:09.400
That's like me playing fractal.

02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:13.400
I kind of get a little frustrated with it, but I have such a good time.

02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:17.400
Ragenator in chat says, DarkSakura wants to flip Flappy Bird the bird?

02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:20.400
No, I want to pretend it doesn't exist in my version of reality.

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:23.400
Who makes it so I know not to get their games ever?

02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:27.400
Extifer or Matt, do you have a zen game that you?

02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:32.400
I'm going to go with Rocksmith 2014.

02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.400
I second that.

02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:43.400
Well, that's perfectly legitimate. Music is an outlet for the soul.

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:45.400
Do not justify his answer.

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.400
I'm totally justifying your answer.

02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:50.400
Rayman Legends, I just want to get that one in there.

02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:54.400
Well, I play Mass Effect 3 still because it's got a great engine.

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:57.400
Even if I don't really care for the story in 3 as much as the first one.

02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:01.400
It has a great engine and I get to shoot people and make my Shepard look pretty.

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.400
That's calming.

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:07.400
I don't know if these are zen-like relaxing games.

02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:10.400
No, these are games also that make you want to scream.

02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:14.400
These are awesome games. They're games by Treasure Games.

02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:17.400
Which, you know, they recently did a green light campaign for Ikaruga.

02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:22.400
Well, now Treasure is considering doing a new, original game for PC.

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:28.400
That's right, the makers of Gunstar Heroes and Bangayo and a lot of great classic shooter games.

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:31.400
They could be making other games for Steam.

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:36.400
This was from a comment from Treasure President Masato Megawa who said,

02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:39.400
Ikaruga is the first one and we don't intend on stopping there.

02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:42.400
There are some players who say, how about Radiant Silver Gun?

02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:44.400
But we also don't intend to do only ports.

02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:48.400
We're thinking of making a new, original title for the platform, Steam.

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:56.400
Well, and keep in mind Treasure, it's not just Radiant Silver Gun and Ikaruga.

02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:02.400
They did Silhouette Mirage, which is one of the best Saturn games ever.

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:05.400
Have you literally done every Treasure game as a classic game of the week now at this point?

02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:09.400
No, I have not. Because I don't think I did Miss Shiftmakers.

02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:16.400
And I don't think I've done... I think I've done Bangayo. I've done...

02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:17.400
Well, anyway.

02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:19.400
I think I did Radiant Silver. You know, I forgot to play that in Arcade.

02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:22.400
Do you want them to make a shooter? Do you want them to do something a little more outside the box?

02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:24.400
I want another platformer.

02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:27.400
And Gunstar Heroes is freaking amazing.

02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:32.400
Which I'm still irritated at my husband because I bought him Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear.

02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:34.400
He still has not opened the damn box.

02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:35.400
Rude.

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:36.400
How rude.

02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:41.400
Let's go to the mailbag. Dark Soccer's gonna open up the mailbag box right now.

02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:42.400
No, I'm not.

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:43.400
Yes, you are.

02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:44.400
The mailbag box?

02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:45.400
Yes.

02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:46.400
Is it a bag or a box?

02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:48.400
It's both. It's a box made out of bag.

02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:51.400
It's one of those bags with the hinged cover on it.

02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:52.400
Yes, shaped like a box.

02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:54.400
It's a bag.

02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:55.400
It's like a Chinese takeout.

02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:56.400
It's a Bax.

02:15:56.400 --> 02:15:57.400
Alright, anyway.

02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:58.400
It's a Bax.

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:02.400
Dark Soccer's gonna go to your emails at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:04.400
and Dark Soccer's gonna jump into the mailbag head first

02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:06.400
and hopefully she doesn't drown in all those spam emails.

02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:08.400
But she's gonna find the legit ones and read them now.

02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:10.400
I have no idea what you're talking about, Elliot B.

02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:13.400
Um, hey O.L.R. I don't know if this will translate to radio

02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:17.400
but I felt the need to share this inspired use of screenshots in the App Store.

02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:20.400
I have no idea if this game is any good.

02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:23.400
I'm gonna click it and it'll probably pull up my App Store.

02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:26.400
If it pulls up Flappy Bird, I'm gonna poop my pants with laughter.

02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:27.400
If it's Flap Prisma Drop.

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.400
Oh, bummer.

02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:34.400
Um, I don't know. I don't think it's gonna work.

02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:38.400
Is this stealth advertising for, I mean, it looks, it's all like rainbows and pretty things.

02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:39.400
I like rainbows and pretty things.

02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:40.400
Wait, keep going though.

02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:42.400
Like, is there, I'm wondering, is there a joke in there?

02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:44.400
Like, if you look at all the screenshots, can't you swipe?

02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:45.400
I, no.

02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:46.400
Oh, that's weird.

02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:48.400
I don't see, oh, there we go.

02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:51.400
No, that's just not very good.

02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:56.400
I think maybe you're thinking of the PC App Store, so no, I, no.

02:16:56.400 --> 02:17:00.400
Oh, it's trying to bring it up in my, in my iOS App Store and no.

02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:03.400
We have to look at it on, on a computer.

02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:09.400
This is from Imus, which I'm guessing is I, it's spelled E-Y-E-M-U-S,

02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:11.400
so I'm guessing I-E-mus.

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:13.400
Or a-ye-mus, maybe?

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:14.400
Hello, OLR.

02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:16.400
I'd first like to congratulate Loki on his new arrival

02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:18.400
and hope he has a lot of sleep and rest in the coming months.

02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:20.400
I'm writing because in the last week's show,

02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:22.400
I think you misunderstood the issue that the majority of people had

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:24.400
with the Machinima debacle.

02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:27.400
The problem wasn't that they were paying YouTubers to say good things

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:29.400
about Microsoft as part of an ad,

02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:32.400
but the fact that part of the contract said they were not allowed to mention

02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:37.400
that it was a paid ad in the first place, which is against FTC guidelines.

02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:40.400
And, let me find where I was.

02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:43.400
This is an issue because it would be like if it was revealed that

02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:46.400
Dark Soccer was getting paid by EA to talk favorably about Mass Effect

02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:48.400
all this time and not because she actually loved the game.

02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:50.400
Well, that's not true.

02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:51.400
You got us.

02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:54.400
Or if Loki got money every time he mentioned GTA and how great it is.

02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:56.400
That's not true either.

02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:59.400
It would cause all listeners to take everything else that you say

02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:02.400
with a skeptical eye in the future and your credibility would be shot,

02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:04.400
if it's not already.

02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:08.400
In every previous contract that Machinima and other outlets have,

02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:11.400
they say that you must include the fact that this is a paid promotion,

02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:14.400
but for some reason this deal with Microsoft said the exact opposite,

02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:16.400
that you can't mention it's an ad.

02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:19.400
Love the show and keep up the great work you guys do every week.

02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:20.400
Thank you.

02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:21.400
Thank you.

02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:23.400
And I thought we had talked about that.

02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:24.400
I mean, maybe we didn't.

02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:25.400
We talked a lot about that.

02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:27.400
I thought we had brought up that part of it was that, you know,

02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:29.400
they weren't talking about it and mentioning it.

02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:31.400
We kind of talked about how with product placement,

02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:33.400
a lot of times they don't mention it.

02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:36.400
But what that emailer did bring up that I don't think we really talked about

02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:40.400
last week was that stark difference between usually you do say it's an ad

02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:42.400
and this is very different.

02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:45.400
But I still think a lot of the points that we brought up last week were still

02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:48.400
kind of valid even considering what you're saying.

02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:51.400
But thank you for clarifying because, yeah,

02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:54.400
that is a very good point that it's very different from what they were doing

02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:55.400
in the past.

02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:58.400
Thank you for that email I miss.

02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:01.400
Okay, this is another email.

02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:02.400
This is the last one.

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:04.400
Hey, OLR, I've been listening to your podcast.

02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:06.400
Now for about three years and while I'm a fan of the show,

02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:08.400
I never take the time to write in.

02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:12.400
I recently signed up on Vogue Network under their user name, Andrew.

02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:14.400
Let me start off by saying congratulations to Loki on the new baby

02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:16.400
and to Jamie on her new fun job.

02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:17.400
That's right.

02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:19.400
It's called fun job.

02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:21.400
The reason for my email is because I recently started playing DC Universe

02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:23.400
on my PS4 because I'm a noob.

02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:26.400
Added it's really difficult to find a party to join up with.

02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:28.400
Rob, I know you recently picked up a PS4

02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:31.400
and if you or any listeners would like to make an OLR clan,

02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:32.400
that would be great.

02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:36.400
My PSN name is Andrew, as in A-N-D-R underscore capital U.

02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:38.400
By the way, I typed this on my phone,

02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:41.400
so if there are any typos, tough titties, Jamie, deal with it.

02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.400
You did miss a comma, but I will let this pass.

02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:49.400
You spelled everything correctly, so that spelling is, yeah.

02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:51.400
Was there a question in there? Sorry.

02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:56.400
No, I just wanted to say that he wanted to start an OLR clan on the PS4 DCU.

02:19:56.400 --> 02:19:57.400
Oh, okay.

02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:02.400
I just wanted to say that he wanted to start an OLR clan on the PS4 DCU.

02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:07.400
Oh, you know, I haven't played a lot on DCU, I have to be honest.

02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:08.400
Not since the beta.

02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:11.400
And I started a new character and I keep getting sidetracked

02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:13.400
because Final Fantasy XIV is my MMO right now.

02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:16.400
But I would be totally down with a VOG clan.

02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:18.400
I would have to talk to Brad from Pod Culture.

02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:20.400
He's the resident DC Universe expert at VOG

02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:23.400
and I'll have to see where he's playing and try to figure that all out.

02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:31.400
Our person, our reader here, Andrew, username is ANDR underscore U, Andrew.

02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:33.400
So, thank you.

02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:36.400
And that's it. I'm not reading any more, even if there were more.

02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:39.400
I'm kidding. I would, but not.

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:43.400
So, Bobby Blackwolf, our good pal from VOGnetwork.com,

02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:46.400
just joined our chat room and said,

02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:50.400
the emailer with the iOS App Store link is referencing the iPhone screenshots,

02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:52.400
not the iPad screenshots.

02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:55.400
I never realized there was a difference. I guess that makes sense.

02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:57.400
Well, since I'm on my iPad.

02:20:57.400 --> 02:20:59.400
Yeah, so maybe that's why it didn't make sense.

02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:01.400
Well, I'm going to bring it up right now.

02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.400
You do that, Rob.

02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:05.400
I'm working on it.

02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:08.400
You know what, Raginator? I'm just going to boot you from the chat room right now.

02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:11.400
I'm misspelling everything. I can do it too.

02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:12.400
I'm not going to ban you.

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:13.400
Power trip.

02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:15.400
But I'm going to boot you because I can and it's hilarious.

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:18.400
Okay, so that would explain why it made no sense to you.

02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:21.400
Look at that. Two more spam messages came in just in the time it took you.

02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:24.400
You know what? I'm about ready to offer up something different, so.

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:26.400
Right? Annoying.

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:30.400
Oh, my God. Okay, it is way funnier on the iPhone.

02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:34.400
Now I get it. See, so there's like they play any time anywhere.

02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:40.400
Play birthdays, play while parenting, play on your commute, play at your own funeral.

02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:42.400
Okay, that's funny.

02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:46.400
Why aren't the iPads, like Elliot's probably listening to the show going,

02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:49.400
did they not see the same thing I saw?

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:52.400
No, we didn't. It's very different on iPad.

02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:56.400
And lol kidding, Raginator.

02:21:56.400 --> 02:21:59.400
By the way, Rob, I have a suggestion for you after the show.

02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:00.400
Okay.

02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:01.400
About our email situation.

02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:03.400
Oh, yeah. Okay, great.

02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:05.400
All right, you done looking at that? You want to see this too?

02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:07.400
Since everybody's laughing at this, Shane?

02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:08.400
That's hilarious, actually.

02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:11.400
Shane's too busy reading like gossip websites.

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:13.400
What are you reading on your phone over there?

02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:14.400
I'm reading about Harry Potter.

02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:15.400
Reading about Harry Potter.

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:19.400
That's okay, because I used to read Harry Potter during the show.

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:20.400
All right.

02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:24.400
Every time a new Harry Potter book would come out, I would just read the book on the show.

02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:27.400
No, the one with the little baby crying.

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:28.400
All right.

02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:29.400
Play on birthdays.

02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:31.400
Let's get to the FUs. They can't hear you, expert.

02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:33.400
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:50.400
This is fucked up.

02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:52.400
FUs of the week time.

02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:56.400
I guess I really don't have any.

02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:57.400
Well, okay.

02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:03.400
FUs making a new friend at work just to have to have them move to Tulsa, Oklahoma.

02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:05.400
That was a really fucked up situation.

02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:07.400
Fuck you to his ex-remates.

02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:10.400
And I hope that life treats you better in Tulsa.

02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:13.400
Also...

02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:18.400
Acceptance, Oklahoma. Sorry, code man.

02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:25.400
I'm just really, I don't know, I'm a little bit just irritated at double standards.

02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:26.400
I'll put it that way.

02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:29.400
But I love my job and I wish I could tell everybody where it is that I'm working.

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:33.400
So cool job is super fucking cool.

02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:34.400
All right.

02:23:34.400 --> 02:23:38.400
Shane, do you have any FUs of the week or FUs of the past five years?

02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:42.400
The past five years? No.

02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:46.400
All right, then how about extrovert? Do you have any FUs of the week?

02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:48.400
I don't have anything.

02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:51.400
FU to life.

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:55.400
No, I'm generally good, Rob.

02:23:55.400 --> 02:23:58.400
All right. Well, FU to being happy. You don't get the point.

02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:00.400
No, I take it back. I got one.

02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:03.400
So, FU to my car dealership.

02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:08.400
I left my car there to get an oil change while I was gone and they're keeping it for like the week I'm gone.

02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:09.400
Yeah.

02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:13.400
And they ask for my phone number in case something goes wrong.

02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:16.400
I'm like, okay, but you should already have it. So I give it to them.

02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:23.400
And on Thursday morning, I get a call from them at 6 a.m. Pacific time.

02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:24.400
Right.

02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.400
They don't leave the message. I'm like, holy crap, what's wrong with my car?

02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:32.400
I give them a call, call the wrong number.

02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:33.400
That's scary.

02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:35.400
Yeah. So they're jerks.

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:37.400
Matt, do you have any FUs of the week?

02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:39.400
Nope. Pretty happy.

02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:41.400
God, y'all make me sick.

02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:47.400
I have an FU. FU to all the fuckers that keep texting me and calling me.

02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:49.400
I keep getting freaking wrong.

02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:51.400
Rebecca or something?

02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:52.400
No, Rachel.

02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:53.400
Rachel.

02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:58.400
Everybody wants to talk to Rachel and she doesn't even bother telling anybody she dropped her phone.

02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:06.400
Save a list of all of those people, send them a mass message, and then drop yourself from it so that they keep texting each other.

02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:08.400
Oh, that's excellent.

02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:16.400
So I think that the Gold's Gym in Valencia needs to stop fucking calling me.

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:20.400
I have called them and told them to take my number off their list.

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.400
You're blowing out people's speakers, Exeter. Calm down.

02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:30.400
I have called them and politely asked them to change or drop my number and they won't stop calling me.

02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.400
I'm like, I don't know who you guys are. Stop calling me.

02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:36.400
Leave me alone, Rachel.

02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:37.400
Yeah.

02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:42.400
My FU of the week, actually things are fairly alright so I don't have a lot of angsty stuff.

02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:50.400
FU to the fact that I missed all the fun this weekend when Shane got here because I had other real life commitments and stuff.

02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:52.400
I got here in the middle of the week, not even this weekend.

02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:56.400
I know, but you know. I missed Espeduce, Sniff, OL.

02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:57.400
Yeah, it was really good.

02:25:57.400 --> 02:25:59.400
Yeah, yeah, rub it in. That's fine. That's fine.

02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:01.400
I had like 15 chicken hearts.

02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:03.400
Did you demand everybody's chicken hearts?

02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:05.400
No, me and Annie fought over them though.

02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:06.400
Of course, of course.

02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:09.400
I wanted to go but I'm poor.

02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:16.400
Alright, one more story for you guys and then we're going to go to the Skypline at 1877 Game OLR.

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:20.400
This one's really quick. You know, everybody's talking about Google Glass.

02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:22.400
Oh my God, y'all. Google Glass.

02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:24.400
Are you interested in Google Glass, Matt?

02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:26.400
Would you replace your glasses with Google Glass?

02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:30.400
I don't know. It'd be fun.

02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:32.400
Well, now they have games on it.

02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:40.400
Some games you can download on Google Glass are Tennis, Balance, Clay Shooter, Matcher, and Shape Splitter.

02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:43.400
Do you just like move your head and shake it to play?

02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:47.400
So don't trust anybody driving with Google Glass on? Is that what we're saying?

02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:52.400
Well, you probably shouldn't but you can play these games with your Google Glass.

02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:55.400
I don't know where you would but I guess where do we play games today?

02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:58.400
On the subway or something. You wouldn't look weird at all.

02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:04.400
Balance has you using Glass's gyroscope to balance books on your head.

02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:05.400
Sounds like fun.

02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:10.400
Clay Shooter is like a first person shooter where you blast clay targets like Duck Hunt or something.

02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:13.400
Matcher is memory. You know, the tile matching game.

02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:18.400
And Shape Splitter is like Fruit Ninja. Can you imagine playing that game with your head?

02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:24.400
Playing Fruit Ninja. You'd look like you have a tick or something. It'd be very interesting.

02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:30.400
So, there you go. You can play those games on Google Glass if you like.

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:35.400
I guess it's just the start of what is to come.

02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:38.400
Extrovert, would you get Google Glass?

02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:45.400
I don't think so. I saw a person with Google Glass at the Bay Street Mall in Emeryville a while back.

02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:50.400
That was kind of nifty. But they're like $1500.

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:51.400
They're very expensive.

02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:53.400
I don't need it.

02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:57.400
Think about all the world peace you could buy with $1500. It's a lot.

02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:02.400
Screw world peace. I want a damn shiny new electronic.

02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:05.400
That's what Google Glass is.

02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:06.400
It's world peace?

02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.400
No, it's a shiny new electronic.

02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:14.400
Well, not in the form of Google Glass, is what I'm saying.

02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:17.400
I want an Xbox One over Google Glass.

02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:21.400
Alright, we're going to go and open up the Skype line, y'all.

02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:28.400
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:30.400
And the phone is already ringing.

02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:32.400
Oh, they just disappeared.

02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:35.400
Somebody else is calling, so let's go to the next call.

02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:38.400
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:39.400
Hello?

02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:43.400
Hello? Bienvenidos a OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:45.400
Yo soy Mateo.

02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:47.400
Is this Grandpa?

02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:48.400
Is this Hoard House?

02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:51.400
No, this is not Hoard House. This is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:54.400
Ah, shit. My bad. Where's the end call button?

02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:56.400
Grandpa?

02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:57.400
Rob Roberts.

02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:02.400
What are you up to? Why aren't you here with everybody else?

02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:03.400
I wasn't invited.

02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:04.400
Yes, you were. You're always invited.

02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:05.400
Why don't you ever come visit me?

02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:06.400
Yeah, why do you hate me?

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:07.400
Why don't you ever come visit me?

02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:12.400
You and Jamie were going to come down and visit me in San Francisco, but then you abandoned me.

02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:14.400
I actually had my first day of work.

02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:16.400
She started Cool Job.

02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:21.400
Jamie, your excuse is acceptable. Rob Roberts, no.

02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:26.400
Well, to what do we owe this phone call tonight? Do you want to talk about video games?

02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:28.400
Is there something in the news you'd like to talk about?

02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:34.400
Well, there was a major game that was played today that was a shit show for Denver Broncos.

02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:37.400
Oh, was that the Puppy Bowl?

02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:40.400
No, the Kitten Bowl.

02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:44.400
Oh, Rob, my little kumquat. No, it was the Super Bowl and it was a very, very depressing game.

02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:47.400
I was hoping that the Broncos would avenge the loss of the Niners to the Seahawks.

02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:52.400
If you're going to lose, don't you want to lose to the best?

02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:57.400
No, I just made Grandpa explode from logic, everybody. Look at that.

02:29:57.400 --> 02:30:00.400
Mind blown. No, I just want to say hi. I'm a long time listener, first time caller.

02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:03.400
You have never called O.L.R. before, have you?

02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:05.400
No, you never invited me to.

02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:09.400
I invite everybody to call. Did you not hear me? Just say, what are you drinking?

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:14.400
I was drinking vodka orange juice. It's the only thing I have left in the house.

02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:16.400
You know what's at my house right now?

02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:18.400
Free willow.

02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:20.400
Home infused vanilla vodka.

02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:21.400
Sounds good.

02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:25.400
And mocha vodka that I also infused and Metaxa.

02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:27.400
Why is your elixir not all inside my mouth?

02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:29.400
Because you're not at my house.

02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:31.400
Why don't you guys get a room?

02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:33.400
Party at Darth Sockra's house after the show.

02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:36.400
Totally. Except after work tomorrow.

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:41.400
Now, here's the best idea. Do you take your pinkberry and pour some of that vodka goodness on top?

02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:43.400
That sounds good.

02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:54.400
I just want to call and say hi. I'm looking forward to seeing Rob Roberts and his entourage Tuesday night as Shane departs back to the unforgettable, hospitable land of the Midwest.

02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:56.400
Tell everyone my personal schedule, why don't you?

02:30:56.400 --> 02:31:05.400
Well, you said your schedule is the homosexual agenda, which means what? Breakfast at 8. Democratic posturing at 10.30.

02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:07.400
NPR for lunch.

02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:14.400
Definitely. And then adopt a gaybee at 1.30pm. Head to Grandpa's at 5.30.

02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:20.400
Alright. Do you want to plug your other little... I know you cannot leave this show until you plug your other little project.

02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:22.400
It's like you know me.

02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:23.400
I know.

02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:33.400
Well, I wanted to. I wanted to make a continuous plug to my up and coming, well one episode anyway, project called the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.

02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:35.400
It's a Star Trek podcast you hope doesn't fail.

02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:37.400
There better be lots of DS9.

02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:38.400
What's that?

02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:40.400
There better be lots of DS9.

02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:53.400
We were a little Star Trek Online Voyager heavy this last time, but all three hosts. We've got Lieutenant Commander Eddie who's been on Orange Lounge Radio in yesteryears and Dr. Ken who's been on Hoard House before.

02:31:53.400 --> 02:32:02.400
We all have our different favorite series and we do talk about them, so check us out. We've only got one episode under our belt. It is a project. We're a little rough around the edges.

02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:08.400
We're not as refined and Caviar-esque as Orange Lounge Radio after two decades.

02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:10.400
I was like, this is episode 538.

02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:12.400
We are totally whale eggs here.

02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:16.400
If you listen to episode one, it was a hot ass mess. Episode one was a hot ass mess.

02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:18.400
I had a migraine and passed out after the show.

02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:20.400
Yeah, but...

02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:23.400
Damn, and you're still going at it almost 12 years later.

02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:27.400
I took two days off and lived in the Harry Potter closet in a gay frat house.

02:32:27.400 --> 02:32:36.400
Before the other boys got here, I was just sitting here with Dark Sire before the show going, Dark Sire, that's 538 weeks we've been sitting here doing this show. It's so crazy.

02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:40.400
Plus your vacations, plus or minus, all that. It might be more like 600.

02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:48.400
Alright, Grandpa, I'm gonna go ahead and let you go so we can get more calls because I know there's other people trying to get through, but thanks for calling and everybody listen to Hoard House on Wednesday, alright?

02:32:48.400 --> 02:32:50.400
Can I at least give the website where to go to?

02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:52.400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:54.400
Jesus. I can't take you anywhere.

02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:56.400
Sorry you're not on iTunes.

02:32:56.400 --> 02:32:58.400
Jesus doesn't have internet.

02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:13.400
Right now, before we get to iTunes, go to Facebook.com slash Starboard Power Coupling. You'll find questions and things to get involved with as well as the first episodes, so check us out and we look forward to your feedback and hopefully many, many more episodes on a podcast.

02:33:13.400 --> 02:33:17.400
That's Starboard Power Coupling.

02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:19.400
You say it so freaking fast.

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:23.400
Get on iTunes and all that crap.

02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:25.400
It's my project tonight, actually.

02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:26.400
Alright.

02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:27.400
Fine, I'll get off your line now.

02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:28.400
Great. Bye.

02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:29.400
Bye.

02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:38.400
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Tech2030 in the chatroom saying, is there anywhere to listen to really old episodes of OLR?

02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:41.400
Uh, yes.

02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:44.400
Let's go to the phones.

02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:54.400
I don't like to give it out because it was such a different show. Ask Dart Tetsuya. He's in the chatroom and he has the link to the archive for the really die hard, but I just, I always get the footnote.

02:33:54.400 --> 02:34:01.400
It was a mess in the beginning, but it was a good way. I'm proud of it, but it was just very different. Don't expect to hear what you hear now.

02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:04.400
Alright, we're going to go to the phones and take another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:08.400
Uh, Dave. Holy crap, I actually just got through.

02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:13.400
Holy crap! I know it is kind of hard to get through the show sometimes. What's up, Dave?

02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:30.400
Uh, not much. Just finished up dropping my brother off at UMass Amherst and I have told myself for probably the last like three months I would call in and say something and I just would always end up busy on Sunday nights.

02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:38.400
Well, here you are, Puppy Bowl Sunday. You made it on what's actually a pretty crowded show. What do you want to talk about? What's up?

02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:50.400
Uh, well, I want to start off with one question for you guys. I've kind of polled my friends who play video games and it seems like I'm alone on this. Do any of you guys ever get motion sick playing first person-

02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:54.400
Yes. Here we go. Yes. Absolutely.

02:34:54.400 --> 02:35:07.400
Because, like, I've got a PS4 and I've got Battlefield 4 with it and I can basically only play half the game. I have to play with a friend of mine and we sort of switch off where he does all the gunfights and I just fly jets. That's all I do.

02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:20.400
I get super motion sick on a lot of games, not just first person games. Katamari Damacy makes me sick, which sucks because I love the game. Um, Mass Effect used to make me sick. Actually, all of the Mako missions make me really nauseous.

02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:30.400
You have some interesting particulars about that, though. Like, if you, and I mean, it's just the way it is. I'm not trying to, like, make fun or make light of the situation, but it's just interesting how you've kind of learned what does and what doesn't trigger it.

02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:37.400
Like, didn't you say that Mass Effect, part of the reason you're okay with that is because it's third person, not first person? Exactly. That's a big difference?

02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:46.400
Exactly. If I have a character on the screen, then I'm not as likely to get motion sick because it gives me a different focus, but sometimes I get motion sick in multiplayer.

02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:56.400
And you can play Doom and 3D games that were, like, sprite based, right? Yes, but sometimes they still make me motion sick, depending. Depending. But for the most part, I was fine with them.

02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:05.400
Sonic Adventure made me motion sick. Dave, is it just these new games that are doing it to you? Like, are the games getting too real and that's the problem?

02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:25.400
Yeah, it's like, you know, when I was in high school, me and my friends would play Counter-Strike all the time, and I never had a problem with that. But my friends tried to get me into Black Ops 2, and it's just something about the fact that they just want to try and simulate being a person in the game and having all that screen shake and the explosions and the suppression,

02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:31.400
where my brain goes, this isn't real, this isn't happening, so I'm going to make you vomit now.

02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:34.400
How big is the TV that you play on?

02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:42.400
I play on anything from the 25-inch IPS monitor in my bedroom all the way up to a 60-inch plasma in my friend's place.

02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:51.400
Do you think that might be part of the problem? Because when you play on a monitor, you're usually sitting up really close, so it's almost just as big as a 60-inch TV in some ways. Do you think that could be the issue?

02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:58.400
I don't know, because usually I get more motion sick on the bigger TVs than I do on my own monitor.

02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:10.400
I actually get more motion sick the lower the resolution is on the screen I'm using, like for example on our old 32-inch Toshiba, and it was a full CRT everything.

02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:24.400
I would watch Dan play Goldeneye on Nintendo 64, and I've thrown up watching him play that game before, but I've gone back and watched emulated playthroughs from a computer and haven't been as sick.

02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:48.400
The thing I've kind of settled on that I've accepted as an answer for myself is that something about gunfights in some of these games with all the screen movement that's going on, when things change really, really quickly in front of my eyes in some of these video games, it just doesn't seem to sit right with my head, whereas I can fly the jets around in Battlefield 4 no problem.

02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:55.400
Let me ask you another question. When you see polygon clipping, does that make your head hurt?

02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:00.400
Could you tell me what that actually is first?

02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:15.400
It's when the collision doesn't hit for two items, and one polygon will go through another one, and I'm not talking about so much as like seeing someone's arm go through the wall, but when you actually see the other side of the polygon that your house looks to.

02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:19.400
Oh, when you can see the other level or the other side of the level, stuff like that.

02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:22.400
This happens in Minecraft a lot, I notice.

02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:24.400
Yeah, okay, I know what you're talking about now.

02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:25.400
Does that affect you?

02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.400
That doesn't really bother me, no.

02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:42.400
See, that affects me. That's why part of my problem is with the first Sonic Adventures, there was a lot of camera issues with the polygons, and it would be just for a moment like my head would shut down, and then when it was gone, I was better.

02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:47.400
It's just a really weird thing, but I have issues with depth perception, too.

02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:59.400
Well, sadly, Dave, I can't sit here and come up with solutions for you. I think that's something you might have to actually bring up with the doctor, and I think a lot of it could just be, you know, you gotta look away more often and take more breaks.

02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:04.400
I know I cannot watch an entire 3D movie in the theater without looking away from the screen every few minutes.

02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:09.400
Yeah, I have a problem with 3D. My problem is MS related, so maybe you have MS.

02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:10.400
Don't say that.

02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:16.400
I'm saying my problem is definitely related to that, so I can't do 3D.

02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:23.400
Okay, that was like WebMD diagnosing you right now. WebMD always tells you, you got cancer, sorry. You got a cough? Oh, it's probably cancer.

02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:25.400
And mine may be related to autism.

02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:36.400
But just, you aren't alone, Dave. I see in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, 5th Dream says, I do. I do very much. Killzone kicked my ass. Some bother me more than others.

02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:43.400
Chris109 says, Killzone was fun, but yeah, I had two or three dizziness. 5th Dream says, serious Sam was pretty bad.

02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:48.400
5th Dream says, the odd thing is I've noticed I get really motion sick when I'm looking for something.

02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:54.400
If I'm just running and shooting and stuff, I'm better than if I'm trying to find an objective or an item that searching makes me really sick.

02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:57.400
Yeah, that happens to me too. But two more really quick things.

02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:58.400
Yeah, of course.

02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:13.400
One, to answer what Dark Soccer was saying earlier about why do celebrities kind of get the pass on doing stupid things or, you know, why are they put on this pedestal when they pass away.

02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:26.400
I think that for a lot of people, it's that this person has contributed something to their life, whereas the random guy on the street who would otherwise just be a junkie really hasn't.

02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:33.400
I still kind of see that, but I still believe there's a lot of double standard in place.

02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:38.400
I think Dark Soccer comes from the place of why don't we show compassion the same.

02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:46.400
I mean, I think you get why people might feel that connection with celebrities when we see them fall or whatever, but it's like, why don't we have that same compassion, I guess would be the same.

02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:54.400
Yeah, I really think that's it. I think that society as a whole needs to stop being as judgmental and look at every individual life as something that's important.

02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:56.400
You know, funny story.

02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:57.400
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:59.400
Go ahead, X for real quick and then we'll let Dave finish.

02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:04.400
Somebody back when I was going to school in college told me that I looked like Seymour Hoffman.

02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:06.400
Oh, that's going to make you feel really good today.

02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:09.400
Well, I wonder if he looked like me when he was killed over.

02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:10.400
Stop it.

02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:12.400
You are a bad person.

02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:14.400
Okay, you were saying, Dave.

02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:15.400
Dave, please finish your thought.

02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:26.400
But the very last thing, this is just sort of a technical thing I've noticed because I started listening to this show probably like April of last year on the way back from a White Mountains camping trip.

02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:27.400
Nice.

02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:36.400
But I don't know kind of how you guys have the volume set up between the microphones, whether there's multiple or not.

02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:50.400
But something I've noticed because I usually listen to this in my car or on my laptop is that Jamie's voice is, you know, compared to someone like, let's say, Jason, who has a bassier voice, it's much, much louder.

02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:53.400
So I keep on doing this thing where I'm like, oh, Jason's talking, I have to turn the volume on.

02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:56.400
And then Jamie comes on, I have to turn the volume down.

02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:58.400
It might have to do with pitch.

02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:00.400
We try to balance the mics best we can.

02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:02.400
But unfortunately, we are using hand mics.

02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:04.400
I don't have a studio set up.

02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:09.400
We don't really have the finance to get the mics that are in place that pick up from where a person's sitting.

02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:16.400
And with the hand mics, if somebody moves the hand to a different position, or I can mic balance for somebody before the show.

02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:24.400
And not to pick on Loki because we love Loki, but Loki will give me a mic check before the show where he's talking like in his normal voice.

02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:27.400
But then he gets really mad about Nintendo or some shit during the show.

02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:31.400
And he gets really loud. It's like, God damn it. I didn't balance your mic for that.

02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:35.400
So I have a friend tells me it's my Welsh blood when I get worked up, I get higher pitched.

02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:38.400
Yeah. So sadly, it's not just you.

02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:44.400
I am if there's sound engineers out there that have some tips, some ideas, I am I'm more than open to it.

02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:50.400
So when you say hand mics, are you talking like the kind of microphones you would normally sing into it like karaoke?

02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:51.400
Yeah.

02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:55.400
I mean, I might end up donating like a blue mic to you guys.

02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:01.400
Wow. I'm not going to have a blue mic in there. Pretty, pretty nice.

02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:03.400
Those things are pretty neat.

02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:04.400
All right.

02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:07.400
I think it'll be worth it for my ears in the long run.

02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:09.400
I'm trying not to be overly loud.

02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:10.400
So all right.

02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:13.400
We'll try to get our eye on it.

02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:15.400
Thanks for taking my call. Hope you guys have a good one.

02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:16.400
All right. Take care, buddy.

02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:17.400
All right. Bye.

02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:18.400
Bye.

02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:23.400
Yeah, I do notice like if you're listening on headphones, usually it's whatever it works fine.

02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:28.400
But if you listen in the car, I have listened to show in the car and it does kind of use notice the volume differences.

02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:31.400
So I really try to adjust that stuff on the fly best I can.

02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:35.400
But some things like extra first little fit he threw earlier where it got really loud.

02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:37.400
Some things you can't foresee.

02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:42.400
So but if there's anything we learned about that call, it's that that guy probably has MS.

02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:43.400
Stop it.

02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:48.400
Actually, I can I sort of get the same way with certain people's voices.

02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:52.400
Like, for example, I can't listen to Sarah Brightman.

02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:53.400
No, I'm serious.

02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:56.400
Are you sure that's not just because it's it's bad or no.

02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:01.400
Sarah Brightman's got a gorgeous voice, but she's too brassy of a soprano for me to listen to without being uncomfortable.

02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:05.400
You know, I'm just saying as an example, sometimes pitch has a lot to do with it.

02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:07.400
All right. Well, let's move on because we got another call on the line.

02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:09.400
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:10.400
Hey, it's Sturlock.

02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:11.400
Hey, Sturlock.

02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:12.400
How are you doing?

02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:13.400
Pretty good.

02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:14.400
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:16.400
A lot, actually.

02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:20.400
I wanted to talk about something very, very cool that happened.

02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:23.400
Please. You've been teasing me on Twitter all week.

02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:24.400
Yes.

02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:26.400
This is huge.

02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:34.400
So Dark Sakura, as noticed, I'm sure because you added me.

02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:35.400
Yes.

02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:39.400
That I have taken the plunge and I am now on Steam.

02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:40.400
Yes.

02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:47.400
There is a very good reason for this, and it has to do with Skullgirls.

02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:49.400
I love Skullgirls.

02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:50.400
Isn't it great?

02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:51.400
Yes, it is.

02:44:52.400 --> 02:45:03.400
Well, the developer, Mike Z, has been very, very open in the community in general.

02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:20.400
And just recently, a buddy of mine named Liren was talking to him about a lot of the text that's in the game.

02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:23.400
Because he's blind like I am.

02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:32.400
And he wanted to play online and get some enjoyment out of the story mode.

02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:53.400
And basically, they came up with a method of doing this where if you set a certain option in the launcher properties or whatever it is through Steam,

02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:59.400
that now all of the text will output directly to the clipboard.

02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:15.400
With the end result, if you run a certain program, your screen reader will say any text that copies to the clipboard.

02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:26.400
So now we actually have a mainstream game that is fully voiced with all of the text.

02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:28.400
That's super useful.

02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:29.400
Everything.

02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:30.400
Everything.

02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:45.400
Menu, story, like a group of us actually yesterday, we set up a Skullgirls team talk channel, and we're just hanging out.

02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:49.400
Like five of us just doing Queen of the Hill is fucking awesome.

02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:54.400
Wait, so this is really the first game on Steam that has that kind of accessibility option?

02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:56.400
This is the first game, period.

02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:58.400
That kind of shocks me.

02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:00.400
And not in a good way.

02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:02.400
Like, I'm really surprised that...

02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:03.400
Sorry.

02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:06.400
Uh oh, get the phone. Somebody knows you're on the line.

02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:10.400
Is this just the first one that copies the clipboard?

02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:14.400
Because I know there's other games that will talk through the subtitles for you, right?

02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:15.400
And things like that.

02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:26.400
But this is the first game where the developer has actively just gone out of their way to make things easier for us.

02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:28.400
Well actually, that's not entirely true.

02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:37.400
Because Injustice did something similar last year with the interactable objects.

02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:49.400
But to this level, I now can do anything that anybody else would do.

02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:54.400
I can go online, I can set up a lobby with no trouble whatsoever.

02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:56.400
It's amazing.

02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:01.400
That's awesome news. I'm really happy to hear it.

02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:04.400
Especially a game that has such a following like Skullgirls does.

02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:10.400
That's really neat that you can kind of be a part of that officially now, so to speak.

02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:12.400
Yeah, so I immediately...

02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:17.400
Oh, by the way, for blind, setting up Steam is a fucking pain in the ass.

02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:19.400
So maybe Valve needs to take some cues, huh?

02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:22.400
Oh my god. I mean, it's doable, but oh my god.

02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:25.400
Let me ask this question. We're a little pressed for time, so I'm going to wrap up here in a minute.

02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:31.400
But let me ask this question, because I've got at least one game developer here in the room, and I know we have others that listen.

02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:36.400
What would you say to all the game developers out there of the world and so forth?

02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:42.400
How can they best help you play or experience their stuff?

02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:46.400
What can they do to help you out, to help you enjoy video games?

02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:48.400
Sound design is a big thing.

02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:52.400
Keeping up in mind, I guess, too.

02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:55.400
Don't forget about me type of thing.

02:48:55.400 --> 02:48:59.400
Not to say people do, just to be clear, but you know, just, you know.

02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:05.400
Yeah, but like, I don't know. I think if you're going to...

02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:12.400
I think it's really important to have, and I know this isn't really possible in a lot of cases, but...

02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:20.400
With the Skullgirls thing, they were basically chatting on like IRC, and were having just an open dialogue.

02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:26.400
It was like, how can we do this kind of thing? What would be the easiest way?

02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:29.400
Right. Start a dialogue. Talk about it. Sounds good.

02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:34.400
And it was really easy for him to set up, apparently, too. It only took like a couple days.

02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:36.400
Oh, that's awesome.

02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:41.400
Oh, by the way, is not... Oh, um...

02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:45.400
I'll have to kick your ass in Skullgirls at some point, Jamie.

02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:46.400
We'll see if that happens.

02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:49.400
I don't know. Bring it. I think we'll bring it.

02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:55.400
Also, I wanted to give you a link to a good Mortal Kombat video.

02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:56.400
Okay.

02:49:56.400 --> 02:50:00.400
If you search for Tato Salad, finish him.

02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:02.400
I'm afraid of what I'm going to see.

02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:05.400
Oh my god, it is the funniest shit ever.

02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:07.400
Uh-oh.

02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:09.400
I don't know. Five dollar foot long thing.

02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:10.400
Five dollar foot long was pretty good.

02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:11.400
Yeah.

02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:12.400
Alright.

02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:13.400
This is great.

02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:19.400
Alright, let me... Tato Salad, finish him. I'm looking it up right now. Let's see what happens.

02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:20.400
This looks scary.

02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:22.400
It's by GoPotatoTV.

02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:25.400
Yep, I see it. I see it. Let's see. I'm trying to see if there's an ad or something.

02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:29.400
Okay, no. Here we go. I'm going to play a little bit. If this is awful, I'm holding you responsible.

02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:31.400
It's epic.

02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:34.400
It's like fake animation or something.

02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:38.400
You've seen this game?

02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:39.400
Finish him.

02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:40.400
Wait.

02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:44.400
Before you do that, massage him.

02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:47.400
Massage him?

02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:50.400
You dare defy the great Shao Kahn?

02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:51.400
You gotta play this whole thing.

02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:54.400
Oh, this is too long. It's three minutes. I can't play the whole thing.

02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:55.400
I'll watch it when I get home.

02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:56.400
Yeah, maybe.

02:50:56.400 --> 02:50:57.400
We'll have to look at it later.

02:50:57.400 --> 02:50:58.400
Massage him.

02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:00.400
Alright. Alright, fine.

02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:03.400
And then what? Then it's make out with him? Kiss him?

02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:04.400
Is this good?

02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:05.400
Yep.

02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:06.400
Oh, gosh.

02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:08.400
Loosen up those muscles. Oh, you're so tense.

02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:11.400
Alright, alright, alright, alright. I gotta go wrap up the show.

02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:12.400
Maybe we'll make this a fortune cookie later.

02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:13.400
You're turning this into pornography.

02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:16.400
Yes, that is definitely fortune cookie material.

02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:18.400
Didn't even take Extrovert to do that.

02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:21.400
Alright, take care, buddy. Thanks for letting us know about that. That's a really cool change.

02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:22.400
Yeah, alright. Thanks.

02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:23.400
Alright, take care.

02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:24.400
Yeah, you too.

02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:25.400
Bye.

02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:26.400
Bye.

02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:29.400
Alright, sadly, I think that is going to do it for calls tonight.

02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:35.400
I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through, but we are trying to wrap up here about midnight, East Coast time, nine o'clock, West Coast tonight.

02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:40.400
So, we're going to wrap up. That's about it for the show tonight.

02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:43.400
I do want to ask real quick, are there any last minute stories?

02:51:43.400 --> 02:51:47.400
I don't know if Dark Sakura has anything or... Oh, I know what I'll ask about.

02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:53.400
Before the show, Matt, you were telling me something about EVE Online that we never brought up, and I thought it was really funny.

02:51:53.400 --> 02:52:00.400
Well, I don't know the exact details, but I was just reading on through the news, and they apparently had a really huge epic battle.

02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:02.400
I heard about this, yeah.

02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:19.400
In EVE, and since EVE has an exchange rate where you could buy in-game currency with real dollars, you could actually calculate how much monies, how much real value worth of stuff have been destroyed in that gigantic war.

02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:22.400
And I think it was like priced over $200,000.

02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:24.400
Damn.

02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:31.400
That's a lot. I can't believe there's that much money sunk into that game. I don't hear about a lot of people playing EVE, but I guess so.

02:52:31.400 --> 02:52:40.400
Alright, quickly, I do want to mention this, because TigerClaud messaged me this, and I thought it was worth mentioning, because a lot of you guys like your Sony franchises.

02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:47.400
There's a new Sly Cooper movie being made, and it's being directed by Kevin Munro, who made the TD Mutant Ninja Turtles CGI movie, for better or worse.

02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:49.400
Hey, I like that.

02:52:49.400 --> 02:52:55.400
Yeah, alright, well then maybe you'll like the Sly Cooper. They did announce that. They've got a little teaser trailer out there on the internet.

02:52:55.400 --> 02:53:00.400
And yeah, it's being made, and it's slated for release in 2016, and in 3D.

02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:05.400
So, very cool. There's a teaser trailer out there on Twitter, and all that if you want to check it out.

02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:12.400
I'm gonna see real quick if we have Twitter topics.

02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:18.400
I know this is really interesting radio.

02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:25.400
Well, in the meanwhile, I will serenade our listeners with... actually, I'm not gonna.

02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:32.400
That's actually really it. I don't really see a lot of tweets tonight, so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up. That's it. No tweets.

02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:33.400
Ribbons and bows?

02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:43.400
Yeah. BlackWolf does want to clarify, though, there isn't that much money sunk into EVE. That's if you converted all the in-game money into how much it would cost to buy a Plex.

02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:48.400
Not all that money that was lost was once real money. Some was earned in-game.

02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:52.400
Anyhow, so we're gonna go ahead and wrap up and get on out of here for the night.

02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:55.400
DarkSoccer, I know you're trying to leave because you've got work in the morning, but...

02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:57.400
Yeah, but this will change in two weeks when I'm on my other schedule.

02:53:57.400 --> 02:54:00.400
Woohoo! So, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:02.400
I wish I could have ramen.

02:54:02.400 --> 02:54:04.400
Ramen sounds good, doesn't it?

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:05.400
Yeah, but I can't.

02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:07.400
We might not end up having that tonight anyway, so we'll see.

02:54:07.400 --> 02:54:08.400
Okay.

02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:09.400
We'll see.

02:54:09.400 --> 02:54:10.400
Bye!

02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:16.400
I'm gonna say, as always, thank you very much for downloading our show. Thank you for tuning in. Really appreciate it.

02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:23.400
All we ask, you know, we don't charge for the show, so just tell a friend or five or twenty about the show. Help spread the word.

02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:33.400
Reviews go a long way as well. If you wouldn't mind leaving us a nice review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio's website, those go an awful, awful long way and we really, really appreciate it.

02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:38.400
Going around and saying goodbye to our guests. Shane, thanks for coming all the way from Kansas to be here.

02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:39.400
You're welcome.

02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:42.400
We didn't really say a whole lot besides one really tasteless thing, but that's okay.

02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:46.400
What? There was nothing tasteless about talking about Power Rangers.

02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:48.400
Um, we'll come back sometime.

02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:49.400
Maybe.

02:54:49.400 --> 02:54:52.400
Alright. And do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:53.400
Go away.

02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:58.400
Why would you s- How rude! You go away.

02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:00.400
I'm about to once we end the show.

02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:01.400
You go away for five years.

02:55:01.400 --> 02:55:02.400
We can go eat.

02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:06.400
Alright. Uh, Xtafer, I hope you had fun. You've been wanting to crush the show for a while.

02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:08.400
I did. I had a lot of fun. It's been fun.

02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:11.400
It's been a long time. Do you have final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:19.400
Uh, I want to have raw men.

02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:21.400
You're so weird.

02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:24.400
That's great. That's great, Xtafer. I know, thanks.

02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:26.400
Listen to Hoard House. Thank you, Shane.

02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:28.400
Alright. Because Ra-Ma made that sticker.

02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:29.400
What?

02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:31.400
Because Ra-Ma made that sticker. I forget. Alright.

02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:34.400
Alright. Uh, Matt, thank you very much for being here.

02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:39.400
And, uh, I apologize for the behavior of the other two guests you had to be on the show with tonight.

02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:41.400
I've just really been awful. I'm sorry.

02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:44.400
He loves me no matter what.

02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.400
But you were a lot of fun to have on the show.

02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:47.400
Oh, thank you.

02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:52.400
Thank you for, um, some of the, um, candid discussion earlier about development and everything. Appreciate it.

02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:54.400
All you need is a piece of paper and a dream.

02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:59.400
Yeah. I mean, I encourage anyone to continue to pursue game design if that's your dream.

02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:00.400
Awesome.

02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:04.400
I must be doing really well because I have a Moleskine book in my purse.

02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:06.400
A big imagination. No, I'm kidding.

02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:09.400
Alright, uh, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:11.400
Just play some Rocksmith 2014.

02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:14.400
Sounds good. Will do.

02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:16.400
Alright, that's gonna do it for our show tonight.

02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:18.400
Thank you everybody for tuning in.

02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:20.400
Uh, we're out of here until next week.

02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:22.400
Loki's tentatively back next week.

02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:25.400
Uh, Jason might be back for one more week next week.

02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:27.400
So it'll be kind of the usual suspects.

02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:30.400
And we'll have fun with whatever should come up in the news.

02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:34.400
In the meantime, have a lot of fun gaming and, uh, don't be a jerk to each other.

02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:37.400
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.

02:56:57.400 --> 02:56:59.400
See you next week.

02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:30.400
Thanks for watching!
