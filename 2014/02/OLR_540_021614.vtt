00:00.000 --> 00:17.960
This week, Nintendo News continues as one highly anticipated title gets a release date.

00:17.960 --> 00:21.840
Trademark news involving the creators of Candy Crush Saga continues with a recent accusation

00:21.840 --> 00:23.000
of intellectual property theft.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.760
If it's not one game, it's another.

00:24.760 --> 00:32.000
All this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.920
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.920 --> 00:36.680
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.680 --> 00:45.600
It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 540 for February the 16th, 2014.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.540
My name is Rob Roberts here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games

00:49.540 --> 00:53.980
and video gaming, the gamer culture, gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts here in studio

00:53.980 --> 00:54.980
with me as always.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.420
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:57.420 --> 00:58.420
Sup bitches.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.700
Hey, how you doing?

00:59.700 --> 01:00.700
That's going to be my thing now.

01:00.700 --> 01:01.740
I'm just going to do sup bitches.

01:01.740 --> 01:02.740
I think so.

01:02.740 --> 01:03.740
I think so.

01:03.740 --> 01:07.420
So I was admiring your shirt earlier because you have this really rad shirt and I know

01:07.420 --> 01:09.460
it's a radio show so I was like, hey everybody, look at Jamie.

01:09.460 --> 01:10.460
I'll put a picture up.

01:10.460 --> 01:11.460
But I'll describe it.

01:11.460 --> 01:15.540
It's basically like an old school NES cover, specifically like Excitebike.

01:15.540 --> 01:20.620
You know, they all had the, but it's Pee Wee Herman riding his bicycle and it says Adventure

01:20.620 --> 01:21.620
Bike.

01:21.620 --> 01:22.620
I love it.

01:22.660 --> 01:24.420
From the Loner Rebels series.

01:24.420 --> 01:25.420
Yeah.

01:25.420 --> 01:26.900
I loved Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.340
There was another one over here.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.180
So instead of Nintendo, it's, you are, but what am I?

01:31.180 --> 01:32.180
I know you are, but what am I?

01:32.180 --> 01:33.180
Infinity.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.180
I know you are, but what am I?

01:34.180 --> 01:35.180
I know you are, but what am I?

01:35.180 --> 01:36.180
Knock it off.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.180
Cut it out.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.180
I love it.

01:38.180 --> 01:39.180
So instead of Nintendo, it says Infinity.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.180
I know you are, but what am I?

01:41.180 --> 01:42.180
I know you are, but what am I?

01:42.180 --> 01:43.180
Infinity.

01:43.180 --> 01:44.180
Yeah.

01:44.180 --> 01:45.180
I need to watch that movie again.

01:45.180 --> 01:46.180
No way.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.180
Stop it.

01:47.180 --> 01:48.180
Cut it out.

01:48.180 --> 01:50.940
Um, uh, but you said that shirt's no longer available.

01:51.140 --> 01:54.540
I don't remember where Dan got it from, but it was like one of those one day sale things.

01:54.540 --> 01:55.900
I mean, it could come up again.

01:55.900 --> 02:00.900
I don't know, but they do like a different, it's almost like shirt.woot except, um, they

02:00.900 --> 02:05.340
don't bring them back that you can pay five bucks more and order them later.

02:05.340 --> 02:08.060
So, um, here's, here's a random question.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.340
It's well, oh, go ahead.

02:09.340 --> 02:13.220
One thing it's fun that I work in a place with like mostly dudes and they're like looking

02:13.220 --> 02:18.260
at my boobs to see Pee Wee Herman and I'm like, um, I feel uncomfortable now.

02:18.260 --> 02:23.100
I'm going to go with my cubicle and hug my weighted companion cube until I feel better.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.700
Here's my random question and I'll, I'll introduce of course, Loki in a minute here, but starting

02:26.700 --> 02:31.140
with you for this and of course our live chatters at live.vog network.com where we do tape live

02:31.140 --> 02:35.100
every Wednesday or every Sunday night, excuse me, at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

02:35.100 --> 02:36.980
right after the Bobby black will show.

02:36.980 --> 02:42.740
Um, my question, since we're talking about your, your top, um, do you have a favorite,

02:42.740 --> 02:47.400
do you have a favorite piece of gaming clothing, like game related clothing?

02:47.400 --> 02:51.560
Cause I'll tell you mine and it always gets comments too is that hoodie I have with the

02:51.560 --> 02:55.720
tanuki Mario on it where with the hoodie actually has the little raccoon ears on it.

02:55.720 --> 02:59.040
I always like, what is that 35 year old man doing wearing a hoodie?

02:59.040 --> 03:04.520
Well, I super love my N seven hoodie just because like now if I wear it at work, people

03:04.520 --> 03:06.720
get it.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.080
And I've, I've actually finally hit the point where I stopped keeping count of all of the

03:11.080 --> 03:17.640
shepherd references I get at work because it's like I hit 30 and then I stopped cause

03:17.640 --> 03:19.600
there's that guy that I meet in the hallway every day.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.160
He's like, sup shepherd.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.280
And I'm like, this is my favorite hallway in the Citadel.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.280
I want coffee.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.280
Nice.

03:27.280 --> 03:33.320
But yeah, that's the good thing about working at a, um, for, uh, at the land of cubicles

03:33.320 --> 03:34.320
and tech.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.320
There you go.

03:35.320 --> 03:39.400
Well look, I, he's, he's been sitting there very patiently and I, I think that's the five

03:39.400 --> 03:42.040
minutes of silence from this man's, uh, too many.

03:42.040 --> 03:48.000
Say hello everybody to tech master Loki on the Skype line tonight.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Do we have a tech?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Are you muted Loki?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Or did he go?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.920
No, my, my key, my, uh, my new, uh, touch pad's really sensitive.

03:53.920 --> 03:57.800
So like I tap it and it's all unmute, mute, unmute, mute.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.920
I was a little worried there for a minute.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.120
I was like, well, this is going to be awkward.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.760
No, no, no.

04:03.760 --> 04:07.480
It's, it's, it's been a weekend, I guess.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.480
It has been a weekend.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.400
And all right, look, I'm, I'm dying because some of the listeners have seen your tweets.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.600
You've got to tell us about why you're having technical issues tonight and so forth and,

04:16.600 --> 04:17.600
and how this all started.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.600
Loki.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.520
Well, I tried to play Titanfall on Friday, right?

04:21.520 --> 04:24.280
You know, I downloaded it at work and I was like, Oh yeah, I'm going to totally play it.

04:24.280 --> 04:30.320
So I played it at lunch and you know, my laptop, I've done a lot of modifications to it, you

04:30.320 --> 04:38.200
know, because it was an old ACES gaming laptop and it was, they're basically infamous that

04:38.200 --> 04:43.600
model of being very terrible as far as heat efficiency goes.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.760
And so it got to the point from playing Titanfall, I only went through the tutorial, I didn't

04:47.760 --> 04:48.760
even get into a match.

04:48.760 --> 04:55.720
I started a match and then I could tell that the graphics card was overheating a lot.

04:55.720 --> 05:01.520
And you know, I was actually, I touched the top of the laptop, I'm like, ow, that is really

05:01.520 --> 05:02.520
hot.

05:02.520 --> 05:07.220
And so I just, you know, shut the thing down and you know, I was like, okay, I really need

05:07.240 --> 05:12.100
to play with my cooling pad and because I have a souped up cooling pad that I made.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.020
And so I was like, okay, I'm not going to play this anymore until I get that cooling

05:15.020 --> 05:16.020
pad.

05:16.020 --> 05:23.340
So, you know, yesterday I was playing Titanfall a little bit and had my cooling pad and you

05:23.340 --> 05:26.300
know, I was just checking to make sure it still got hot.

05:26.300 --> 05:31.480
So I shut it off again, updated my graphics drivers and then put a temperature monitor

05:31.480 --> 05:34.580
thing on there so I could see how hot it was getting and ran it again.

05:34.580 --> 05:38.940
And it wasn't getting that hot anymore because, you know, it seemed like it would, the new

05:38.940 --> 05:40.740
drivers kind of did the trick.

05:40.740 --> 05:45.380
So I was like, okay, cool, done that, I'm going to shut my laptop down for the night.

05:45.380 --> 05:52.100
And so I flipped the screen down, which would put it in sleep and 20 minutes later it still

05:52.100 --> 05:53.100
hadn't shut off yet.

05:53.100 --> 05:58.840
And I was like, okay, what the hell, you know, so I had to force it off and so I held down

05:58.840 --> 06:03.980
the power button to force it off, tried to turn it back on again, doesn't see the hard

06:04.020 --> 06:07.020
drive anymore.

06:07.020 --> 06:12.100
And when I went to go load like, you know, okay, I'm going to load the windows disk and

06:12.100 --> 06:16.860
see if I can maybe recover the drive and stuff, there's just all sorts of graphical glitches

06:16.860 --> 06:21.380
like that, that GPU is toast, is just damaged.

06:21.380 --> 06:25.700
So the Titanfall beta was so awesome it literally melted faces.

06:25.700 --> 06:31.820
Yeah, or at least GPUs, but you know what, to be honest, it's, I'm not surprised, that

06:31.820 --> 06:39.820
laptop, like I said, is very, it just wasn't meant for, you know, that awesome game, I

06:39.820 --> 06:40.820
guess.

06:40.820 --> 06:43.580
So I had to get a new laptop, so I have a new laptop now.

06:43.580 --> 06:47.340
It's kind of funny to me though, because I'm really surprised, you kind of took it in good

06:47.340 --> 06:49.420
stride with a good sense of humor.

06:49.420 --> 06:53.060
But there was a lot of people on Twitter this week about that Titanfall beta that were like,

06:53.060 --> 06:58.100
how could EA release such a like crappy, you know, like, I guess it's still, I don't know,

06:58.100 --> 07:00.980
when I played it, I didn't notice a lot of bugs or anything like that.

07:01.020 --> 07:04.020
Like it just, it seemed like the game was ready to go to me, but I guess other people

07:04.020 --> 07:05.260
have been running into issues.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.700
You had your laptop melt, literally.

07:07.700 --> 07:12.020
And here's the thing, it's based off the source engine, and I had, it wasn't like I was running

07:12.020 --> 07:16.620
like super ultra or something, it was all low, because it like, my GPU is so old and

07:16.620 --> 07:21.860
that it's like a Nvidia 360M or something, it was like a really old one, and it couldn't

07:21.860 --> 07:22.860
run crap.

07:22.860 --> 07:28.300
So I was like, okay, all low settings, and it was fine, and when it ran, it just ran

07:28.340 --> 07:29.340
really hot.

07:29.340 --> 07:33.700
And it's really strange though, because I've run pretty graphically intensive games before,

07:33.700 --> 07:35.500
and I've never had it overheat.

07:35.500 --> 07:40.780
I mean, like I said, I built a custom, I've done so many cooling modifications to that,

07:40.780 --> 07:48.780
I reset the, I put new thermal paste on everything, I literally have the bottom cut open to let

07:48.780 --> 07:56.140
more air flow in, I built a, you know, a cooling pad that has two 120mm fans in there that

07:56.140 --> 07:57.140
are running high.

07:57.140 --> 08:03.820
I have the throttle on the fan that's in the actual laptop cut so that it runs high all

08:03.820 --> 08:04.820
the time.

08:04.820 --> 08:11.340
So, you know, the fact that it still overheated everything, and that's the weird thing is

08:11.340 --> 08:16.660
when it locked up, it wasn't like it was overheating again, I think that's just that first time

08:16.660 --> 08:19.740
that it got so hot that something got damaged in there.

08:19.740 --> 08:20.740
Huh.

08:20.740 --> 08:26.460
So now, did you submit that feedback to EA?

08:26.460 --> 08:32.180
I haven't gotten a chance to, because like I said, my laptop's been down, but I got a

08:32.180 --> 08:39.860
new Asus though, and now it's an AMD quad core with a, I guess it's a lot newer of a

08:39.860 --> 08:50.300
graphics card, it's an 8670M with 2GB of dedicated graphics RAM, or video RAM, and it's a native

08:50.340 --> 08:54.860
1080p screen, it's like a 15 inch I think.

08:54.860 --> 09:01.020
So the only problem is, and why you didn't see me on Skype earlier, is it's running Windows

09:01.020 --> 09:02.740
8.1.

09:02.740 --> 09:09.720
I fucking hate Windows 8.1, because it's like, it's all, we're having trouble connecting

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
to the internet.

09:10.720 --> 09:15.680
I'm like, why the fuck, okay, so I downloaded Firefox just fine, I'm like, how the hell

09:15.680 --> 09:19.900
did it, I can't connect to the internet, yeah I downloaded Firefox.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.900
How is that fucking possible?

09:21.900 --> 09:27.940
And then I go into my settings, oh, we disabled your WiFi card, what the fuck are you doing?

09:27.940 --> 09:29.740
It's just so messed up.

09:29.740 --> 09:32.400
Yeah I hate Windows 8.1, so.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.440
So what are you talking to us now from, if you don't have a laptop?

09:35.440 --> 09:41.760
No I have a laptop, I got it working, I figured out that it disabled my WiFi, so I turned

09:41.760 --> 09:42.760
it back on.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.760
Okay, there you go.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.460
Yeah, so I have my new laptop that I'm talking to you from right now.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.020
You did end up having to buy a new laptop, it's not like you fixed the other one.

09:51.020 --> 09:52.780
No there's no fixing that one.

09:52.780 --> 09:53.780
Okay, fair enough.

09:53.780 --> 09:57.100
Well I'm going to, you know what's funny is that right now, this particular portion's

09:57.100 --> 10:01.140
only going to be heard on the podcast, because we cannot, we lost connection with the live

10:01.140 --> 10:07.400
feed that broadcast our show, and it seems like Titanfall may have melted our host for

10:07.400 --> 10:11.780
VOG Network as well, we're not able to broadcast right now, and a lot of our chatters are complaining

10:11.780 --> 10:12.780
about it.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.200
But some of the comments that did get through before it went down, Tigerclaw says, no matter

10:16.200 --> 10:21.440
what they say, laptops are no, nor mentioned for high end gaming.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.040
Laptops are so thin that there isn't room for cooling the GPU inside it.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.000
It's got a little fan and that wouldn't be enough to cool it down.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.460
Yeah, it's not, and that's why like I said, I literally had the bottom, I had drilled

10:33.460 --> 10:37.640
holes in the bottom of the laptop to where the heat pipe was, and I had air blowing in

10:37.640 --> 10:40.480
on it, but yeah, it was still toasty.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.720
But I would think that they would have something built in place that like, okay it's getting

10:44.720 --> 10:52.840
too hot, let's throttle the card back, because I've had that in my other, my PC had that,

10:52.840 --> 10:54.840
so I don't know.

10:54.840 --> 10:58.880
It might not have even been that, it could have been that the GPU's just, well the GPU's

10:58.880 --> 11:04.540
not fine, but it, I don't know what exactly it damaged, and to figure it out I could buy

11:04.540 --> 11:09.540
a new drive and put it in there and I might get Windows running again, but still that

11:09.540 --> 11:15.620
graphics card's got damage to it, and even if I replaced that, it would just by that

11:15.620 --> 11:19.900
time might as well buy a new laptop.

11:19.900 --> 11:22.840
Do you use desktops at all, or do you only have laptops at home?

11:22.840 --> 11:27.680
I only have a laptop because I've taken apart my desktop, it's so old now that I can't really

11:27.680 --> 11:33.100
run anything on it, so I just run on my laptop now.

11:33.100 --> 11:37.540
There you go, well at least we got our live listeners back, so that whole thing unmelted

11:37.540 --> 11:38.540
there, that was really weird.

11:39.540 --> 11:43.820
Usually if we had the live listeners get dropped, it's back in like literally 10 seconds, but

11:43.820 --> 11:45.900
we lost them for almost a full two minutes.

11:45.900 --> 11:51.320
That sucks, but that's just the joy of live radio, right?

11:51.320 --> 11:54.860
Before we get into our quick kickoff topic tonight, Loki, I want to ask you the same

11:54.860 --> 11:57.520
question I asked ARK Soccer a minute ago about clothes.

11:57.520 --> 12:02.600
Do you have a favorite like gaming, you know, shirt or hoodie or something that you like

12:02.600 --> 12:03.600
to wear?

12:03.600 --> 12:04.600
The tingle costume?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.600
No tingle costume.

12:07.160 --> 12:14.240
No, I have a few different t-shirts, like I'm wearing my portal one right now from Woot.

12:14.240 --> 12:19.320
I bought a lot of shirts from Woot, it's all about them being comfortable, and a lot of

12:19.320 --> 12:25.520
the shirts, like I've bought some from Ripped and they shrank, which is annoying because

12:25.520 --> 12:26.520
they keep shrinking.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.560
The Woot ones for some reason though, they haven't shrunk, and that's why I kind of like

12:29.560 --> 12:30.560
them.

12:30.560 --> 12:36.040
My other one is my Video Game High School Season 1 Kickstarter shirt.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.760
That one's super soft and comfortable.

12:37.760 --> 12:43.440
But yeah, those are my favorite ones at least right now just because that's all I have.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.040
I like that you're a little more practical when we talk about the favorite shirt.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.200
You're like, oh well this one was the most comfortable, like it doesn't matter what was

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
on it.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.240
In defense of my hoodie, it's super comfortable.

12:51.240 --> 12:56.240
I had one from Ripped that was, you know, Lokeo's and stuff like that, and it shrank.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.760
I was like, god damn it, now it's too damn small.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.680
It looks really stupid when I wear it, but I don't know.

13:03.720 --> 13:04.720
Alright.

13:04.720 --> 13:08.040
Well hey, I want to do a quick kickoff topic tonight before we get into our gaming weeks

13:08.040 --> 13:13.160
and everything, and maybe Lokeo in a Tingle costume will be future DLC for this.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.160
This is pretty funny.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.260
We just announced this on the Bobby Black Wolf show because again we tape live on Sunday

13:17.260 --> 13:22.200
nights and immediately before our show, Bobby Black Wolf, he's one man over in Atlanta talking

13:22.200 --> 13:25.640
about games, and if you don't know Bobby, I know many of you that listen to this show

13:25.640 --> 13:30.100
listen to Bobby, but if for whatever reason you don't know Bobby, Bobby also is kind of

13:30.100 --> 13:31.600
like an indie programmer.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.800
He's dabbled in things in the past like doing, you know, creating music for games, and he

13:35.800 --> 13:37.080
does a little bit of programming.

13:37.080 --> 13:41.120
He did the VOG Network site, which is, if you've never visited, it's also kind of a

13:41.120 --> 13:45.120
game in itself because you can check into shows, you know, there's a passphrase somewhere

13:45.120 --> 13:48.600
in this show if you're listening on the podcast or you can actually check in live, and you

13:48.600 --> 13:50.240
get points and loot.

13:50.240 --> 13:54.080
It's kind of like, I think like Foursquare or Get Glue, one of those types of sites.

13:54.080 --> 13:58.640
Like that whole little game is built into the website for fun, and sometimes for little,

13:58.640 --> 14:03.880
just little prizes, little raffles, but because Bobby's in Atlanta, you know, they had that

14:03.880 --> 14:08.960
whole lockdown this week with the snow and the ice on the roads and, you know, after

14:08.960 --> 14:12.120
what had happened there a couple weeks ago, they said, everybody stay the hell home.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.640
Do not, do not leave the house, do not try to drive.

14:15.640 --> 14:20.600
So some people in the snow go all Jack Nicholson and The Shining and, you know, go crazy, but

14:20.600 --> 14:25.280
Bobby gets programming, and what he programmed this week is a really fun little thing for

14:25.280 --> 14:26.280
the site.

14:26.920 --> 14:33.520
flappy.vognetwork.com, that's flappy.vognetwork.com, yes?

14:33.520 --> 14:39.560
Bobby Blackwolf has unleashed flappy vog on the world, as if you weren't sick of flappy

14:39.560 --> 14:43.480
bird clones, but you know what, no, this is really funny, and there are some really funny

14:43.480 --> 14:46.700
flappy bird clones out there, you know, ever since they took that game down.

14:46.700 --> 14:47.700
We had what?

14:47.700 --> 14:51.480
We have Maverick Bird from Terry Cavana, the maker of VVVVV.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.480
That one's amazing.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.140
It's like very like Commodore 64 inspired.

14:54.140 --> 14:55.140
It's great.

14:55.140 --> 14:59.740
It might be, whatever it's called, that game is awesome.

14:59.740 --> 15:02.940
And let's see, there was Flappy Burt from Sesame Street.

15:02.940 --> 15:04.540
They did that.

15:04.540 --> 15:05.540
Flappy Kaiden.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.740
That's how, you just saw that on Tumblr, Flappy Kaiden.

15:07.740 --> 15:12.820
So you know, hey, we wanted a little piece of the parody action as well and it was a

15:12.820 --> 15:16.660
good way for Bobby to kind of mess around in making his first game in, I think it's

15:16.660 --> 15:20.080
his first game in Unity, his first public game, anyway, over in Unity.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.140
So that's really cool that Bobby did that.

15:22.140 --> 15:27.820
And what's also kind of fun, you actually play the game as hosts of the various shows

15:27.820 --> 15:32.580
on VoG that don't shut up because we're podcasters, we never stop talking.

15:32.580 --> 15:36.340
Bobby's in there, I'm in there, Brad from PodCulture's in there, and Travis from Understation

15:36.340 --> 15:37.340
Live's in there.

15:37.340 --> 15:40.580
That's like the first set, but Bobby will be enhancing it in the coming days.

15:40.580 --> 15:44.920
I mean, he literally did this on Wednesday until today.

15:44.920 --> 15:48.060
So like those of us that couldn't get our voice samples in, because you know, like our

15:48.060 --> 15:51.500
laptop's freaking melted or whatever, we're going to get in there a little later.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.660
Like I know Dark Soccer's going to do some and so forth.

15:53.660 --> 15:57.460
So Flappy VoG will only get bigger and better.

15:57.460 --> 16:00.460
So Loki, have you been able to check out Flappy VoG yet?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.900
Yeah, I did.

16:01.900 --> 16:06.420
He wanted me to record some stuff for it and that was right before.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.420
Right before the meltdown, right?

16:07.420 --> 16:08.420
Yeah.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.420
Yeah, what'd you think?

16:09.420 --> 16:13.860
Pretty, I mean, it's obviously very basic, but it's cool that he whipped that together

16:13.860 --> 16:14.860
in days.

16:14.860 --> 16:15.860
Yeah.

16:15.860 --> 16:16.860
Yeah.

16:16.860 --> 16:17.860
Very cool.

16:18.100 --> 16:22.260
Um, let's see, Akdeft is saying that I'm pronouncing Terry's last name wrong.

16:22.260 --> 16:23.260
I apologize.

16:23.260 --> 16:24.260
Kavana.

16:24.260 --> 16:25.260
Kavana.

16:25.260 --> 16:26.260
Kavanagh.

16:26.260 --> 16:27.260
Kavanagh.

16:27.260 --> 16:28.260
Kavanagh.

16:28.260 --> 16:30.020
I could see pronouncing it either way.

16:30.020 --> 16:33.180
Every last name needs a pronunciation guy with it there.

16:33.180 --> 16:37.220
Akdeft also saying VoG's Flappy Bird will get bigger and better.

16:37.220 --> 16:42.120
GameGuru, in my response to the Jack Nicholson from The Shining response, said, Bobby did

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
go crazy.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.180
He made a Flappy Bird clone.

16:45.500 --> 16:50.180
Well, I know we're probably a little sick to death of talking about this game, but you

16:50.180 --> 16:51.180
know what?

16:51.180 --> 16:55.740
It's become this very strange phenomenon that a lot of people are talking about and I think

16:55.740 --> 16:59.380
it is worth bringing up just a couple quick follow-up items here about Flappy Bird.

16:59.380 --> 17:03.700
A, iTunes and Google Play are really starting to crack down on a lot of the clone apps that

17:03.700 --> 17:08.980
are out there and if you look, actually if you look at the top 10 right now on iTunes

17:08.980 --> 17:13.300
in the App Store for free stuff, like, in the top 10, three of them are Flappy Bird

17:13.300 --> 17:14.300
clones.

17:14.420 --> 17:19.820
The one is like the little swimmy, the cheep cheeps from Mario in their own game, so it's

17:19.820 --> 17:21.240
very interesting there.

17:21.240 --> 17:26.820
But why did Dong Nguyen take down Flappy Bird in the first place?

17:26.820 --> 17:27.820
Why?

17:27.820 --> 17:32.180
He said to an interview with Forbes, he pulled the game because, quote, it's an addictive

17:32.180 --> 17:33.900
product.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.540
It happened to become an addictive product.

17:35.540 --> 17:37.740
I think it has become a problem.

17:37.740 --> 17:40.160
My life has not been as comfortable as I was before.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.900
I couldn't sleep.

17:41.900 --> 17:42.900
So what do you think?

17:42.900 --> 17:46.140
Is Flappy Bird too addicting, Loki?

17:46.140 --> 17:48.140
Was addiction the problem?

17:50.140 --> 17:51.140
Loki?

17:52.140 --> 17:53.140
No idea why.

17:53.140 --> 17:57.460
I mean, I guess he could think that people would be addicted to it, but, you know, to

17:57.460 --> 18:02.780
be honest, I think it was just all the attention he was getting was too much for him.

18:02.780 --> 18:06.240
He just wanted just to make a game, because if it was any other developer, they would

18:06.240 --> 18:10.220
be happy with attention to a game like that.

18:10.540 --> 18:15.740
DarkSakura, are we proud of the creator of Flappy Bird for having the social responsibility

18:15.740 --> 18:19.940
to recognize that his game was too addicting and pull it down, or is this all a little

18:19.940 --> 18:20.940
cray?

18:20.940 --> 18:21.940
Sure.

18:23.940 --> 18:25.940
What, you're telling me you have no opinion?

18:25.940 --> 18:26.940
Sure.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.820
In the end, it doesn't matter why the fuck he did it.

18:30.820 --> 18:31.820
He did it.

18:31.820 --> 18:32.820
He made a choice.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.820
He did it.

18:33.820 --> 18:34.820
Everyone else has to deal with it.

18:34.820 --> 18:35.820
The end.

18:35.820 --> 18:38.740
If you don't like it, tough titty.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.220
That's a fair response.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.420
Why do we keep trying to overanalyze this shit?

18:42.420 --> 18:43.820
He did what he wanted to do.

18:43.820 --> 18:44.820
Deal with it.

18:44.820 --> 18:45.820
I know, right?

18:45.820 --> 18:52.220
It's like, aren't there, you know, babies being abandoned in Russia and, you know, people

18:52.220 --> 18:53.620
being shot on the street?

18:53.620 --> 18:55.860
Yes, but we do a show about video games, DarkSakura.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.860
I know, I know, I know.

18:57.860 --> 18:59.940
People listen to us to escape those things.

18:59.940 --> 19:03.820
Yeah, but in the end, does it really, really matter why he did it?

19:03.820 --> 19:05.820
Does it?

19:05.900 --> 19:14.500
Well, I could, one could argue that yes, because would future games possibly suffer a similar

19:14.500 --> 19:15.500
fate?

19:15.500 --> 19:16.500
And maybe ones that-

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
Maybe they should.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.140
Maybe ones that have a little more depth than Flappy Bird.

19:20.140 --> 19:24.220
What if Mass Effect, what if, what if the creators of Mass Effect, DarkSakura, decided

19:24.220 --> 19:27.020
they have a social responsibility to stop-

19:27.020 --> 19:31.220
Ha ha ha, EA social responsibility, ha ha ha ha ha.

19:31.220 --> 19:32.220
Yeah.

19:32.220 --> 19:36.900
EA recognized they have a social responsibility to stop Mass Effect fan fiction.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.380
It needs to be stopped.

19:38.380 --> 19:40.620
Nothing will stop the link.

19:40.620 --> 19:41.700
Nothing will stop the link.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.900
I do think it needs to be stopped.

19:43.900 --> 19:50.180
Yeah, well, I think tacos need to be here at Rob's house.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.180
But are they here?

19:52.180 --> 19:53.180
No.

19:53.180 --> 19:56.980
Alright, so there you go.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.540
You have all caught me, by the way, in mood.

19:59.540 --> 20:00.540
In mood?

20:00.540 --> 20:01.540
In mood.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.500
It will be a night of honesty.

20:03.500 --> 20:07.500
Alright, oh, oh, you're having one of those nights like I was having a couple weeks ago.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.500
I might be.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.500
We're gonna do a special segment tonight, ask DarkSakura a question.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.500
Okay, we'll do it.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.500
Alright, maybe later, maybe later.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.500
Alright.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.260
Why did I get disconnected from chat?

20:17.260 --> 20:18.980
Because, because it wanted to deal with it.

20:18.980 --> 20:19.980
It wanted to kick you.

20:19.980 --> 20:20.980
You know what?

20:20.980 --> 20:21.980
It's because of your butt.

20:21.980 --> 20:28.020
You farted or something, and it affected the internet, and it was like, you know what,

20:28.020 --> 20:30.500
you don't get to be online.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.500
Fuck you.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.460
Really, internet?

20:32.460 --> 20:33.460
Fuck you back.

20:33.460 --> 20:34.460
Bitch.

20:34.460 --> 20:37.540
Alright, look, DarkSakura, I am gonna ask you a question, and that question is, how

20:37.540 --> 20:38.580
is your gaming week?

20:38.580 --> 20:41.060
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

20:41.060 --> 20:42.060
It was really shitty.

20:42.060 --> 20:47.140
All I've done is play Animal Crossing, and nothing else.

20:47.140 --> 20:49.900
I really want tacos, by the way.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.220
Are you Dunny Fire?

20:51.220 --> 20:52.940
I just really want tacos, okay?

20:52.940 --> 20:55.600
So don't judge me.

20:55.600 --> 21:02.080
So yeah, I've, I played some Final Fantasy XIV for a little bit, and I actually saved

21:02.080 --> 21:07.980
a lot of the screen captures, and they're part of my desktop thing at work, at the land

21:07.980 --> 21:14.080
of cubicles and tech, and, oh yeah, I need to go to Act Deaf's Animal Crossing town,

21:14.080 --> 21:17.340
because I have one of those stupid petitions, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, this makes

21:17.340 --> 21:18.340
me actually happy.

21:18.340 --> 21:20.000
Like, for real happy.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.040
In my village, that motherfucker, Ed, is gone.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.280
He didn't even tell me.

21:26.280 --> 21:30.080
Next thing I see, Isabelle's like, Ed's leaving, isn't that sad?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.000
I'm like, no.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.320
Fuck him.

21:33.320 --> 21:37.640
So I planted black roses where his house was.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.360
Did you throw a little party in town to celebrate that he finally left?

21:40.360 --> 21:42.240
Throw a little party in my head.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.560
Did you leave a little sign where his house used to be, going like, you know.

21:45.560 --> 21:46.760
He's not worth leaving a sign.

21:46.760 --> 21:49.400
I'm just planting the black roses there so that my grass will grow and I won't have to

21:49.400 --> 21:51.360
remember he was ever there.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.360
Fuck him.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.040
Love it.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.040
All right.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.520
Alan Alchemy in chat says, you got Ed to move out.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.520
That is huge.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.520
Finally.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.760
Well, I had to ignore him for what?

22:02.760 --> 22:03.760
What was it?

22:03.760 --> 22:09.520
Because I had him soon after I started my village and then I kept hitting him and beating

22:09.520 --> 22:13.680
him and he apparently liked it because, you know, I guess he's a dirty horse.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.400
So finally I just started ignoring him.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
And actually-

22:17.400 --> 22:18.760
You're a very dirty horse, Mr. Ed.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.200
You name one, Politary, okay?

22:21.240 --> 22:25.880
When we were playing this horse racing, at least it wasn't a horse humping game like

22:25.880 --> 22:26.880
that other one.

22:26.880 --> 22:27.880
For Final Furlong.

22:27.880 --> 22:28.880
For Final Furlong.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.880
For Furlong, yeah.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.800
But like, fucking Ed.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.800
I did salt the earth.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.920
I salted and burned the bones.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.400
And actually, oh, thank you for saying something, Queen Sumia, because she's the one who gave

22:40.400 --> 22:43.720
me the idea to ignore him and it worked.

22:43.720 --> 22:50.520
So thank you for, even though I'm still totally jealous that like she got rid of her Ed first.

22:50.560 --> 22:54.760
Alan Alchemy in chat says, Dark Sakura salted the earth, quote, nothing can ever grow here

22:54.760 --> 22:55.760
again, quote.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.360
I think it's all a front.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.880
I think you got Isabelle to lie for you and I think you somehow figured out how to-

23:00.880 --> 23:02.080
I'm the mayor, fuck that.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.880
You sent Ed to the glue factory.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.240
You made him disappear.

23:05.240 --> 23:09.840
I sent Ed to, um, I don't know.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.840
All right.

23:10.840 --> 23:14.520
No, you know why I wouldn't send Ed to the glue factory or to any type of factory?

23:14.520 --> 23:16.120
Because he's useless.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.320
No one's allowed to use that carcass.

23:18.320 --> 23:23.200
Even the earth will not absorb the nutrients from this decayed corpse.

23:23.200 --> 23:30.360
It will just lay there forever in a sludge of black decayed goo.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.360
All right.

23:31.360 --> 23:36.600
Next week on As the Animal Crossing Village Turns, who will Dark Sakura set her sights

23:36.600 --> 23:37.600
on next?

23:37.600 --> 23:39.040
No, cause I like everybody in my town now.

23:39.040 --> 23:45.120
I have Groucho and Lobo and I have Margie and Whitney, the two that were from the anime.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.880
I couldn't tell you shit about my Animal Crossing village.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.920
That's because you abandoned your people when they needed you the most.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.000
You are the worst mayor ever.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.440
You should be ashamed of yourself.

23:54.440 --> 23:58.640
I'm going to go hang out with that deaf now, bye.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.800
But I'm playing Bravely Default.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.580
You know what?

24:03.580 --> 24:06.400
I'm mad because I want that game.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.440
All right, Loki.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.720
How was your- yeah, you okay over there?

24:09.720 --> 24:11.020
We can hear all your movements.

24:11.020 --> 24:12.200
Be careful.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.600
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

24:16.120 --> 24:26.360
Okay, so I played Titanfall and well, that didn't work out too well.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.800
I actually did get to check out another thing.

24:28.800 --> 24:34.960
It was Jazzpunk and Jazzpunk is this game that's- I don't really know how to describe

24:34.960 --> 24:35.960
it.

24:35.960 --> 24:39.600
It's kind of like an adventure game, but it's just got a lot of really strange humor in

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
it.

24:40.600 --> 24:43.720
It's kind of done like you're a secret agent and you're investigating all these different

24:43.720 --> 24:54.960
missions that have you steal a kidney at one time and you know, find some carrier pigeons

24:54.960 --> 24:58.240
and I don't know, it's just a really strange game.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.480
It's got a lot of funny humor in it though.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.840
So I got to check that out and play a couple hours of that.

25:03.840 --> 25:09.480
And then I went in and played some Grand Theft Auto 5 online just because they had a new

25:09.480 --> 25:16.800
weapon out for this week for Valentine's Day and also all the strip club lap dances

25:16.800 --> 25:17.800
were free.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.480
So, you know, why not?

25:20.480 --> 25:24.720
And yeah, I think that was pretty much it.

25:24.720 --> 25:25.720
Oh, Call of Duty 4.

25:25.720 --> 25:31.000
I actually played a little bit of that online on Wednesday, but yeah.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.160
Hopefully now that I've got a better gaming PC, I'm going to check out some of my Steam

25:37.160 --> 25:40.200
Backlog maybe or try Titanfall again.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.200
Hopefully it won't eat this one too.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.400
Are you really trying to push your luck there?

25:44.400 --> 25:48.320
Hey, you know what, they have a one year, no condition warranty.

25:48.320 --> 25:52.440
So you know, if this thing gets set on fire by Titanfall, they'll replace it for free.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.440
So I don't care.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.440
There you go.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.440
There you go.

25:55.440 --> 25:56.440
All right.

25:56.440 --> 26:00.560
My gaming week, my gaming week was pretty abbreviated as well because I had a big show

26:00.560 --> 26:01.560
on Friday.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.880
So like, you know, the few days before that I was literally like just stressed.

26:05.600 --> 26:09.580
You were spending all night in high heels and pantyhose.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.160
It was the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.160
That's what you're supposed to do.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.160
But yes, that was Friday.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.200
Yeah, I know, I know.

26:16.200 --> 26:20.160
But well, we had a sold out show in the middle of February, which is which is on Valentine's

26:20.160 --> 26:21.160
Day nonetheless.

26:21.160 --> 26:22.160
So that was that was pretty awesome.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.160
I got to say.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.160
Oh, I almost forgot.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.000
Dan and I did something really romantic for Valentine's Day.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
What did you do?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Our taxes.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
OK, you can go.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
All right.

26:31.120 --> 26:36.440
Well, I wore women's clothes in the Rocky Horror Picture Show and, you know, that was

26:36.440 --> 26:37.440
in front of 500 people.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.440
Never be embarrassed.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.440
All right.

26:39.440 --> 26:44.220
No, it's I've been doing it for years and years and I love the community and the environment

26:44.220 --> 26:45.220
it creates.

26:45.220 --> 26:46.960
I miss doing cast crew stuff.

26:46.960 --> 26:47.960
Oh, yeah.

26:47.960 --> 26:48.960
Crew is fun.

26:48.960 --> 26:49.960
It's good.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.400
We have a we have a lot of like just out of high school girls that kind of do our crew

26:52.400 --> 26:53.680
and they have a lot of fun with it.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.240
So they have a good time.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.740
But anyway, this isn't the Rocky Horror podcast.

26:58.740 --> 26:59.960
This is a podcast about video games.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.680
So what have I been playing outside of that this week?

27:02.680 --> 27:04.440
I've been because of the show Friday.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.000
I've been really like this whole weekend.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.760
It's just been like dead man walking like I'm just like my back hurts.

27:09.760 --> 27:13.480
I want to sleep seriously.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.880
Oh my God.

27:14.880 --> 27:15.880
We have these little.

27:15.880 --> 27:16.880
OK, sorry.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.120
Not to talk about Rocky again, but you need to know it.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.920
Now it's relevant to the story.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.300
OK, you we have these stairs backstage.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.420
It's like it's just like the movie Showgirls.

27:25.420 --> 27:28.800
You have to run up and down these stairs all night.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.480
When you want to go do a quick change.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.640
So I was running down the stairs and no, nobody pushed me down them because I'm not a bitch

27:33.640 --> 27:34.640
or whatever.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.600
But only one person can fit in the staircase.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.280
So you have to like kind of yell if you're going to go down the staircase because somebody

27:39.280 --> 27:40.560
might be coming up.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.800
So anyway, I had to go up and down this thing like a ton of times because there's all the

27:43.800 --> 27:44.820
costume changes.

27:44.820 --> 27:50.800
So by the time Saturday rolls around, I wake up and I'm like, my back hurts.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.640
I hate being old.

27:52.640 --> 27:58.760
I used to do this shit every week without a problem and now my back hurts so much.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.720
So yeah, so Saturday I was like, I'm not going to do anything.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.520
I'm going to sit around and play video games all day.

28:04.520 --> 28:10.120
So I played Final Fantasy 14 and one other game that I played was Diablo 3 on PlayStation

28:10.120 --> 28:11.120
3.

28:11.120 --> 28:16.920
Diablo 3, of course, I played a long time ago on PC and I played the demo on PlayStation

28:16.920 --> 28:22.200
3 a while ago and I decided I would put the game in my rental service queue and get it

28:22.200 --> 28:25.040
at some point because I was like, I want to try it, but I don't really want to buy it.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.520
Maybe I'll buy it on PlayStation 4, but I don't really want to buy it on PlayStation

28:28.520 --> 28:30.380
3 if they're not going to do the upgrade.

28:30.380 --> 28:35.360
So yeah, I got it on PlayStation 3 from the rental service and I was playing a lot of

28:35.360 --> 28:41.280
that and it is really weird to get used to the controller at first because I can't like,

28:41.280 --> 28:46.000
I hate that you can't specifically target things like you can kind of point the direction

28:46.000 --> 28:50.860
and it sort of targets what it thinks you want to go for, but it's really weird that

28:50.860 --> 28:53.880
I can't, like you don't have that precision from the mouse.

28:53.880 --> 28:59.200
Now the game is tuned to that and you know, it works and I'm not saying it's a bad experience,

28:59.200 --> 29:02.520
but it does take some real getting used to, especially having played through the game

29:02.520 --> 29:06.960
once on the PC, but you know, it works on console.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.280
I'm having fun.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.380
I like the fact that there's no auction house.

29:11.380 --> 29:14.840
It really does make a difference because you really have to work for the gear that you

29:14.840 --> 29:19.840
want and it makes crafting more important and all that, so it changes the challenge

29:19.840 --> 29:20.840
a little bit.

29:20.840 --> 29:26.040
I have nobody to play multiplayer with yet, but maybe when the game is released for PlayStation

29:26.040 --> 29:33.440
4, people will kind of rediscover it all over again, so that would be really cool.

29:33.440 --> 29:37.880
That was Diablo 3 on the PlayStation 3, so yeah, I'm having enough fun with it.

29:37.880 --> 29:42.440
I heard that your characters will get to transfer over to PlayStation 4 and that's more incentive

29:42.440 --> 29:44.920
for me to get the PS4 version whenever it comes out.

29:44.920 --> 29:48.760
I mean, they were saying it was like a launch window game and then it kind of disappeared.

29:48.760 --> 29:53.580
My thought is they're going to sell it with the expansion, because I can't see them selling

29:53.580 --> 29:56.600
the game alone and then trying to sell you an expansion right after.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.720
I would kind of think they're going to time the release of the PlayStation 4 to be the

29:59.720 --> 30:02.520
game plus expansion, but I think that's what they're doing.

30:02.520 --> 30:05.240
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, but that's my guess.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.240
That's my big guess.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.240
That sounds reasonable.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.240
Yeah, exactly.

30:08.240 --> 30:12.480
So, yeah, other than that, some of the other same old stuff on DS, you know, lying in bed

30:12.480 --> 30:13.480
with my back hurting.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.380
I play a little more bravely default, but not a lot.

30:16.380 --> 30:19.980
All my friends have run circles around me in that game, but I'm okay.

30:19.980 --> 30:24.260
I had other things to do this week, so yeah, there you go.

30:24.260 --> 30:27.660
So that was pretty much my gaming week, so I think that's all of us.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.780
So quickly, some housekeeping.

30:29.780 --> 30:34.860
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com

30:34.860 --> 30:41.300
slash OrangeLoungeRadio, and our Google Plus page, google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

30:41.300 --> 30:45.020
We appreciate all you guys that follow us on the various social media, and you can keep

30:45.020 --> 30:48.540
up with the latest and greatest of the show, answer our frugal question of the week, give

30:48.540 --> 30:50.740
us your feedback, and so forth.

30:50.740 --> 30:55.500
Also, we are definitely, definitely going to be closing the mailbag that we currently

30:55.500 --> 30:56.500
have.

30:56.500 --> 31:01.260
This week will be the last week to use that email address that we have, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

31:01.260 --> 31:04.660
It will no longer work after episode 541.

31:04.660 --> 31:08.360
Don't want to discourage you from sending emails, but we have such a huge spam problem,

31:08.360 --> 31:11.940
we do think we know what we're going to do to fix it, so that will happen next week.

31:11.940 --> 31:16.180
So mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com will no longer work.

31:16.180 --> 31:18.420
After how many years have we had that address?

31:18.420 --> 31:19.420
Like 12 years?

31:19.420 --> 31:20.420
After 12 years of using it.

31:20.420 --> 31:21.420
Four Eves.

31:21.420 --> 31:24.740
Yeah, it just has too many spammy problems, so we're just going to, we're going to burn

31:24.740 --> 31:31.540
it down to the ground and plant black roses, just like Dark Soccer did with Ed's corpse.

31:31.540 --> 31:32.660
All of Ed's house.

31:32.660 --> 31:34.620
Everything having to do with Ed.

31:34.620 --> 31:35.620
Amazing.

31:35.620 --> 31:36.620
Amazing.

31:36.620 --> 31:40.460
All right, let's get into some gaming news, and I believe Loki's going to start us off

31:40.460 --> 31:43.740
talking about his favorite game of the week, right Loki?

31:43.740 --> 31:49.460
It, you know, you joke, but I had a great time playing the two matches I did before

31:49.460 --> 31:51.380
my computer exploded.

31:51.380 --> 31:56.180
But Titanfall Beta is going to be open to all very soon.

31:56.180 --> 32:00.940
In fact, it's actually already open for everybody as of the 15th on Xbox One, and it's supposed

32:00.940 --> 32:05.220
to be through this Origin as well on the 16th.

32:05.220 --> 32:06.220
Here's the weird thing though.

32:06.220 --> 32:10.460
I've gotten like four or five beta invites, or not even invites, but codes.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.340
They keep sending me codes for everything.

32:12.340 --> 32:17.060
In fact, I checked my mail like right before the show started, and I had yet another set

32:17.060 --> 32:18.060
of codes.

32:18.060 --> 32:19.940
One for Xbox One, one for PC.

32:19.940 --> 32:23.780
So I don't think it's that hard to get into the beta in the first place, but...

32:23.780 --> 32:27.620
Hey, I didn't get in until you gave me the code, which by the way, I only really had

32:27.620 --> 32:32.420
enough time to play the tutorial section, but I liked that it had like matrix elements

32:32.420 --> 32:33.900
of running on the walls.

32:34.700 --> 32:38.060
I liked that it was really doing some different stuff that we haven't really seen in first

32:38.060 --> 32:39.620
person shooters.

32:39.620 --> 32:45.060
I liked the idea that you could just summon this gigantic mech to fall from space onto

32:45.060 --> 32:46.060
where you're at.

32:46.060 --> 32:47.060
I mean, it's a little bit ridiculous.

32:47.060 --> 32:50.100
It's pretty awesome, and even the whole six on six thing is not a big deal, because there

32:50.100 --> 32:54.300
is a lot of AI guys running around, although the AI people are completely retarded.

32:54.300 --> 32:58.820
I mean, you seriously can walk up right to them and punch them in the face, and that's

32:58.820 --> 32:59.820
it.

32:59.820 --> 33:03.660
I think it was Bobby was comparing it a little bit to League of Legends, and like the gruntlings

33:03.660 --> 33:08.460
in that game, that they're supposed to be easy like that, but it's just if you get kind

33:08.460 --> 33:12.860
of like, if the numbers of them become insurmountable, that's how you can lose.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.820
That's kind of the idea I got.

33:14.820 --> 33:15.820
I guess.

33:15.820 --> 33:16.820
I mean, it was fun.

33:16.820 --> 33:23.660
I had a lot of fun, so I'm definitely going to check it out some more, but yeah, so if

33:23.660 --> 33:26.420
you haven't got in yet, you should be able to get in now.

33:26.420 --> 33:35.540
So at least definitely on Xbox One and PC, I'm assuming it's open now, so go check it

33:35.540 --> 33:37.620
out if you haven't, because it's pretty awesome.

33:37.620 --> 33:40.780
Just be careful if you're playing on a laptop.

33:40.780 --> 33:45.920
And then the other thing is, of course, they're going to be fixing the Xbox One controller,

33:45.920 --> 33:51.820
and I guess this is by request from Respawn.

33:51.820 --> 33:56.180
They were saying that they're fixing, I guess, some of the inputs in there.

33:56.180 --> 33:59.100
They haven't really said what exactly it says.

33:59.100 --> 34:04.500
It wasn't really, it didn't feel like it should be, it was a little overly twitchy with the

34:04.500 --> 34:09.300
current controls, and they're saying now it's fixed and they're happy with it.

34:09.300 --> 34:13.860
So I'm wondering if that means that they're just going to adjust the dead zone on the

34:13.860 --> 34:15.500
controller or what.

34:15.500 --> 34:19.820
I would think that's almost something that they could do with the actual game itself.

34:19.820 --> 34:22.460
Like you wouldn't have to adjust the controller, just adjust the game.

34:22.460 --> 34:23.460
But whatever.

34:24.460 --> 34:26.740
As long as it works better, I'm all about better.

34:26.740 --> 34:31.900
I wish EA or Activision would have complained about the D-pad on the 360 a long time ago,

34:31.900 --> 34:34.020
and how awful it was.

34:34.020 --> 34:37.640
Even like, they have that convertible D-pad now on some of those controllers, and that's

34:37.640 --> 34:40.060
even more terrible from what I've seen.

34:40.060 --> 34:43.420
It can break off real easy too.

34:43.420 --> 34:50.260
I think what would be awesome is if they would put out the goddamn PC drivers for the Xbox

34:50.260 --> 34:51.260
One controller.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.740
That would be pretty awesome.

34:53.740 --> 34:56.380
That's true, wasn't that supposed to happen like soon?

34:56.380 --> 34:57.380
At some point.

34:57.380 --> 35:01.620
I would think that maybe with Titanfall launching that would be a good, well I don't know, they

35:01.620 --> 35:04.420
still want you to play on Xbox One I guess.

35:04.420 --> 35:09.900
And I gotta say, playing Titanfall I was like, could I get an Xbox One?

35:09.900 --> 35:11.900
Ah, here we go.

35:11.900 --> 35:13.780
No, I'm not doing it.

35:13.780 --> 35:17.460
Unfortunately you just had to buy a new laptop, so that kinda screwed that plan.

35:18.460 --> 35:23.660
Alright, I didn't really want to spend that money, and my wife's gonna be a little mad,

35:23.660 --> 35:25.900
but she said I could, so you know.

35:25.900 --> 35:27.940
She said you could do it, you got permission, so you're good.

35:27.940 --> 35:34.580
And to be honest, it's not as expensive, I mean, I don't know, I think it's reasonable,

35:34.580 --> 35:35.580
whatever.

35:35.580 --> 35:36.920
Alright, fair enough.

35:36.920 --> 35:41.580
Other big gaming news this week, you know, since apparently I'm the show's resident Nintendo

35:41.580 --> 35:45.900
fanboy, I'm gonna talk to you guys about a little bit of Nintendo news, why are you making

35:45.900 --> 35:46.900
angry face?

35:47.340 --> 35:54.500
I know you do, no I was going off that email from last week, but I like everybody, and

35:54.500 --> 35:59.300
Nintendo had a big thing this week, they did their big Nintendo Direct, so let me quickly

35:59.300 --> 36:03.020
review some of the news that came up in Nintendo Direct this week, and then we'll talk about

36:03.020 --> 36:04.020
it a little bit.

36:04.020 --> 36:07.700
So Nintendo Direct took place on February 13th, and we learned the following, Little

36:07.700 --> 36:10.500
Mac will be a character in Super Smash Brothers.

36:10.500 --> 36:13.500
That was the best trailer ever.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.780
That is actually, kinda one of those things where I was like, oh yeah, like why the hell

36:16.780 --> 36:18.260
wasn't he in the previous games?

36:18.260 --> 36:21.780
We've really been missing this guy for a while, so, I know a lot of fans have been demanding

36:21.780 --> 36:23.660
it for a while, so there you go.

36:23.660 --> 36:28.900
Kirby Triple Deluxe, finally announced for North, well, sorry, it's been announced, but

36:28.900 --> 36:33.100
now it's officially dated, and of course I don't have the date in front of me, Loki help

36:33.100 --> 36:34.100
me out.

36:34.100 --> 36:35.100
May 2nd.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.100
Thank you.

36:36.100 --> 36:37.100
What's that, May 2nd?

36:37.100 --> 36:38.100
Yeah, May 2nd.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.100
There it is.

36:39.100 --> 36:46.240
Same as, what is it, it's same as Mario Golf World Tour, I think.

36:46.240 --> 36:52.040
And then they also dated Mario Kart 8, which will be out on May 30th, and they announced

36:52.040 --> 36:55.860
along with that that all of the Koopa Kids are going to be playable in that game, which

36:55.860 --> 36:57.320
is pretty exciting.

36:57.320 --> 37:01.400
That seemed not very exciting at all, in fact I was just like, man, you know, instead of

37:01.400 --> 37:05.280
having like 8 Koopa Kids, why couldn't they have had like 8 interesting characters?

37:05.280 --> 37:10.160
Actually, it's 7 Koopa Kids, not 8, because Bowser was World 8's boss, so it's 7 Koopa

37:10.160 --> 37:11.160
Kids.

37:11.160 --> 37:16.360
Okay, so 7 Koopa Kids, instead of 7 Koopa Kids, they could have had like 1 or 2 Koopa

37:16.360 --> 37:23.840
Kids and, you know, Geno, or, you know, I don't know, maybe like a Shy Guy, or...

37:23.840 --> 37:27.260
Well, I don't think they're necessarily cutting all these, I just get the sense that Mario

37:27.260 --> 37:32.520
Kart 8's going to have a huge roster, which is pretty cool, so, you know, I'm okay.

37:32.520 --> 37:35.640
I'm okay with that, some of the Koopa Kids are pretty cool and don't really get, like,

37:35.640 --> 37:38.760
enough attention, so I think it's pretty cool.

37:38.760 --> 37:43.960
Except, no one is ever going to get the reference for Morton Koopa Jr., unless they are old

37:43.960 --> 37:44.960
like us.

37:44.960 --> 37:45.960
I like Wendy O Koopa.

37:45.960 --> 37:46.960
Yeah.

37:46.960 --> 37:47.960
See, you know, punk rock school.

37:47.960 --> 37:51.040
But anyway, NES Remix Volume 2 is announced.

37:51.040 --> 37:54.920
It's going to come with Super Luigi Brothers, those are coming out on April 25th.

37:54.920 --> 37:59.960
NES Remix Volume 2 is going to have the good NES games, or I should say the re- because,

37:59.960 --> 38:05.040
to be fair, NES Remix did have some good games in it, but it also had a lot of filler crap,

38:05.040 --> 38:08.600
so it looks like NES Remix Volume 2 is going to cut a lot of the filler crap in favor of

38:08.600 --> 38:11.280
games that we actually remember, so that's pretty cool.

38:11.280 --> 38:15.320
I'm kind of tempted, but we'll see.

38:15.320 --> 38:19.680
Game Boy Advance games will be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console in April.

38:19.680 --> 38:20.680
That is official.

38:20.680 --> 38:29.440
Pokemon Battle Troizei is going to get a sequel on the 3DS eShop, and Steel Diver Sub Wars,

38:29.440 --> 38:33.200
one of those It's Out Now announcements, the free-to-play version of Steel Diver that we've

38:33.200 --> 38:37.800
been hearing about for some time, that is now available for download on the 3DS eShop.

38:37.800 --> 38:42.560
I'll quote myself here, stop trying to make Steel Diver happen.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.960
It's just not going to happen.

38:44.960 --> 38:48.720
I downloaded it, I didn't get to play it yet, so I don't have an opinion on it really yet,

38:48.720 --> 38:53.840
but hey, if it's free, I'll try it, especially with Nintendo jumping into this territory

38:53.840 --> 38:55.080
themselves, you know?

38:55.080 --> 38:59.920
Steel Diver I think is a good choice to test the waters with, no pun intended, so, you

38:59.920 --> 39:03.080
know, because you're right, Loki, it didn't work on 3DS, so it'll be interesting to see

39:03.080 --> 39:08.360
if this kind of revives it, or if it, not really, so we'll see.

39:08.360 --> 39:15.280
Also on the eShop announced today, Inazuma 11, which is the soccer RPG that's been out

39:15.280 --> 39:18.800
in Japan and Europe for some time, it was just, bam, it's going to be on the eShop right

39:18.800 --> 39:23.680
now for North America, so I know some people are very excited about that, so.

39:23.680 --> 39:29.440
There was also a new trailer for Bayonetta 2, so quite a bit of news for Nintendo in

39:29.440 --> 39:30.840
that Nintendo Direct.

39:30.840 --> 39:36.720
A little heavy on 3DS, which is of course Nintendo's money machine right now, I was

39:36.720 --> 39:41.640
a little disappointed in how light it was on Wii U, I was hoping there might be a little

39:41.640 --> 39:46.400
something else, but I suppose they did say it was only supposed to be spring type of

39:46.400 --> 39:51.240
releases, but yet then they threw in Bayonetta 2, now I wasn't expecting the Bayonetta 2,

39:51.240 --> 39:56.120
I'm still sitting here thinking that, oh, we ain't gonna see Bayonetta 2 until 2015,

39:56.120 --> 39:59.720
but apparently, it's gonna be in Japan this summer.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.320
Bayonetta 2 will be a game this year, apparently.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.960
That is what Platinum Games and Nintendo announced, is that Bayonetta 2 is gonna be out in Japan

40:05.960 --> 40:13.200
in the summer, and will be in the west sometime this year, so, color me a little bit surprised.

40:13.200 --> 40:18.840
So they did talk about some non-spring releases, because there was that.

40:18.840 --> 40:24.040
So I'll be very curious to see what E3 brings us as far as, you know, what other big, because

40:24.040 --> 40:26.560
Bayonetta 2 is not gonna be enough, you know?

40:26.560 --> 40:32.960
I mean, Bayonetta was great, but I do think Bayonetta 2 has a really limited audience,

40:32.960 --> 40:38.480
and I'm a little worried about how it's gonna sell, because Bayonetta 2 is for those fans

40:38.480 --> 40:41.160
that actually went and bought a Wii U.

40:41.160 --> 40:44.360
I don't know if there's gonna be a lot of people that go buy a Wii U because of Bayonetta

40:44.360 --> 40:46.720
2, but we'll see, I guess it really depends on how good the game is.

40:46.720 --> 40:50.000
We actually had talk about getting a Wii U because of Super Smash Bros.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.060
Oh, there you go.

40:51.060 --> 40:53.680
And so if we do that, then I definitely want Bayonetta 2.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.180
I wonder if Super Smash Bros. is gonna make the holiday this year.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.780
They're sure acting like it.

40:57.780 --> 40:58.780
That would be...

40:58.780 --> 40:59.780
It looks fun.

40:59.780 --> 41:05.140
I mean, if Wii U does get Bayonetta 2, Super Smash Bros., and maybe one other little Nintendo

41:05.140 --> 41:10.720
secret that they're sitting on until E3 all this year, that's gonna be a nice little boost

41:10.720 --> 41:11.720
for Nintendo.

41:11.720 --> 41:18.300
Now, again, they still really need the third-party support, but, you know, it'll still, well,

41:18.300 --> 41:21.780
if they could work a price cut in as well, I think they would really be competitive.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.780
But we'll see.

41:23.780 --> 41:24.780
We'll see.

41:25.780 --> 41:26.780
There you go.

41:26.780 --> 41:27.780
That's my news from Nintendo Direct.

41:27.780 --> 41:31.780
Um, Loki, I don't know if you had some opinions on what you saw on Nintendo Direct.

41:34.780 --> 41:35.780
Loki, did you mute yourself again?

41:35.780 --> 41:36.780
You gotta watch that.

41:36.780 --> 41:39.780
Or did he just go away for a minute?

41:39.780 --> 41:41.780
I think Josh took over.

41:41.780 --> 41:42.780
I guess so.

41:42.780 --> 41:43.780
Decided to fill in for him, but he shouldn't.

41:43.780 --> 41:44.780
Right.

41:44.780 --> 41:46.780
Well, that is why he does the show on Skype right now.

41:46.780 --> 41:49.780
He's taking kids' shoes off.

41:49.780 --> 41:50.780
That's what we figured.

41:50.780 --> 41:51.780
All right.

41:51.780 --> 41:53.780
Anyways, um, so let's see here.

41:53.780 --> 41:54.780
No, no, no.

41:54.780 --> 41:59.780
We were asking you about the Nintendo Direct and what you thought of it.

41:59.780 --> 42:01.780
It was boring.

42:01.780 --> 42:05.780
I mean, they didn't really announce anything interesting, and they spent way too much time

42:05.780 --> 42:07.780
on just, I don't know.

42:07.780 --> 42:12.780
I mean, is any of that stuff really supposed to get me excited about a, you know, Wii U

42:12.780 --> 42:13.780
or anything?

42:13.780 --> 42:15.780
I mean, it was all 3DS news.

42:15.780 --> 42:19.780
And, honestly, you know, with Bayonetta, even though they're kinda claiming that it's gonna

42:19.780 --> 42:22.780
be out later this year, I just don't buy it.

42:22.780 --> 42:24.780
I mean, and even...

42:24.780 --> 42:26.780
You'll believe it when you see it?

42:26.780 --> 42:28.780
Yeah, I guess.

42:28.780 --> 42:29.780
I mean, here's the thing.

42:29.780 --> 42:33.780
Even though Bayonetta 2 might be coming out later this year, is it really gonna sell any

42:33.780 --> 42:34.780
systems?

42:34.780 --> 42:37.780
I mean, some people, yeah, they're all, oh, I'm so excited about Bayonetta and, like,

42:37.780 --> 42:40.780
the Wii U, but I don't know.

42:40.780 --> 42:43.780
It's just, like, even, even, like, in the second quarter, I was talking about, like,

42:43.780 --> 42:49.780
what titles are coming out, and they've only got, like, maybe two or three Wii U games.

42:49.780 --> 42:53.780
I mean, it's literally, like, six Wii U games in the first half of the year.

42:53.780 --> 42:54.780
Like, retail releases.

42:54.780 --> 42:55.780
And that's kinda what I count.

42:55.780 --> 42:59.780
I mean, yeah, you can go digital all day, but let's be honest.

42:59.780 --> 43:03.780
Digital offerings even, you know, on other consoles are way better than what's being

43:03.780 --> 43:04.780
offered on Wii U.

43:04.780 --> 43:08.780
I mean, it's just not, like, a ton of digital releases on there.

43:08.780 --> 43:10.780
I just...

43:10.780 --> 43:11.780
They're hurting.

43:11.780 --> 43:14.780
They really need, like, Mario Kart 8 better be...

43:14.780 --> 43:17.780
I mean, it's gonna be awesome, but is it gonna be enough to...

43:17.780 --> 43:20.780
Are they gonna start selling a ton more units than they were before?

43:20.780 --> 43:22.780
I just don't think that they are.

43:22.780 --> 43:26.780
I think it'll be a slight uptick, but it's just not...

43:26.780 --> 43:28.780
They still haven't found a good hook.

43:28.780 --> 43:32.780
I mean, we already know that there's gonna be great Wii U games from Nintendo,

43:32.780 --> 43:37.780
but that's not enough to hook a lot of people to buy the system.

43:37.780 --> 43:38.780
Alright, well, we'll see.

43:38.780 --> 43:40.780
I think a price cut might be the trick, but we'll see.

43:40.780 --> 43:41.780
I mean...

43:41.780 --> 43:42.780
That would help.

43:42.780 --> 43:43.780
That would definitely help.

43:43.780 --> 43:46.780
Because right now, even selling Wii U to my customers and stuff,

43:46.780 --> 43:47.780
no one wants to bring it in.

43:47.780 --> 43:50.780
They have no interest in it at all.

43:50.780 --> 43:55.780
And so now you're losing retailer interest, you're losing third-party interest,

43:55.780 --> 43:57.780
you're losing consumer interest.

43:57.780 --> 44:00.780
I don't know where they're gonna be able to make it up.

44:00.780 --> 44:03.780
Alright, well, we'll see as the year continues.

44:03.780 --> 44:04.780
In the meantime, DarkSakura.

44:04.780 --> 44:06.780
Yeah, I got something.

44:07.780 --> 44:10.780
So, as we might have teased,

44:10.780 --> 44:15.780
there was talk going on about virtual purchases becoming regulated.

44:15.780 --> 44:18.780
And this is, by the way, news out of Amsterdam.

44:18.780 --> 44:20.780
You know, where...

44:20.780 --> 44:21.780
Pot brownies.

44:21.780 --> 44:23.780
Oh, no, they have other stuff than that.

44:23.780 --> 44:24.780
Like history and art.

44:24.780 --> 44:25.780
And Sil.

44:25.780 --> 44:26.780
And Sil.

44:26.780 --> 44:27.780
Oh, I miss Sil.

44:27.780 --> 44:29.780
Hi, Sil, if you're listening.

44:29.780 --> 44:33.780
Anyway, you know, there's been the whole thing with kids

44:33.780 --> 44:39.780
that are basically spending all their parents' money on little transactions and games.

44:39.780 --> 44:49.780
And so now, because of an investigation going on from the UK Office of Fair Trading,

44:49.780 --> 44:56.780
they've got a lot more information about what kids are spending their parents' money on pretty much

44:56.780 --> 44:58.780
in those little games.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.780
They said they found a lack of, I'm gonna just quote this,

45:02.780 --> 45:07.780
transparent, accurate, and clear up-front information about costs.

45:07.780 --> 45:13.780
You know, saying that the costs may change as you hit levels.

45:13.780 --> 45:16.780
And there's actually even a quote from Peter Mullineau,

45:16.780 --> 45:23.780
who says that it was shameful that developers are exploiting their users that way.

45:23.780 --> 45:29.780
So now there's talk, and they're actually talking about, in some countries,

45:29.780 --> 45:36.780
of having these transactions be regulated and even taxable.

45:36.780 --> 45:41.780
So I'm really, really interested in seeing how that plays out.

45:45.780 --> 45:46.780
Yeah, I'd be curious.

45:46.780 --> 45:50.780
I mean, it would seem so hard to regulate the internet.

45:50.780 --> 45:52.780
Kind of arbitrary in a way.

45:52.780 --> 45:55.780
I know. Yeah, yeah. That too. Anyway.

45:55.780 --> 46:01.780
But coming into the situation that we've seen families finding themselves in,

46:01.780 --> 46:04.780
because, of course, kids have no concept of money when it's virtual,

46:04.780 --> 46:09.780
and a lot of adults don't have a concept of money when it's a card,

46:09.780 --> 46:11.780
or just, oh, I get my points.

46:11.780 --> 46:15.780
Why do you think we had, in the first place, things like Xbox Live Points,

46:15.780 --> 46:18.780
and Nintendo Wii Points, and things like that?

46:18.780 --> 46:21.780
I mean, it's to make it sound like...

46:21.780 --> 46:22.780
Separate the concept of cost.

46:22.780 --> 46:26.780
Exactly. Now, granted, Microsoft got rid of that.

46:26.780 --> 46:28.780
Nintendo still has it, though.

46:28.780 --> 46:34.780
Well, also, it means that they can charge a universal amount of points

46:34.780 --> 46:38.780
and make the individual country cost of it different.

46:38.780 --> 46:43.780
So, for example, what may be 400 Wii U points in Japan may be something completely different here.

46:43.780 --> 46:50.780
So, that, again, is hiding that illusion of how much money you're actually spending on it.

46:50.780 --> 46:56.780
So, I'd like to actually see some type of regulation come out, especially over here.

46:56.780 --> 46:59.780
But then again, I don't know.

46:59.780 --> 47:06.780
I don't know that we are, because people will pay off their attorneys, and judges, and everything,

47:06.780 --> 47:12.780
and circumvent copyright law, and so...

47:12.780 --> 47:15.780
I wish I could buy Nintendo Wii U games with Dogecoin.

47:15.780 --> 47:17.780
Or whatever. However it's pronounced.

47:17.780 --> 47:18.780
Doge.

47:18.780 --> 47:19.780
Doge.

47:19.780 --> 47:20.780
Doge.

47:20.780 --> 47:21.780
Doge.

47:21.780 --> 47:23.780
I think it's from Strongbad. The whole thing is from Strongbad.

47:23.780 --> 47:25.780
So, it's however he said it, and I forget.

47:25.780 --> 47:30.780
But, yeah, I wish I could use my Dogecoin to buy Wii U games.

47:30.780 --> 47:32.780
Oh, virtual currency.

47:32.780 --> 47:33.780
Well, it's gonna be...

47:33.780 --> 47:35.780
That's a whole other thing.

47:35.780 --> 47:37.780
I mean, this is opening a whole other can of worms.

47:37.780 --> 47:39.780
That whole Bitcoin, and, you know, Doge, and all that.

47:39.780 --> 47:43.780
It's very interesting that that stuff isn't really regulated yet.

47:43.780 --> 47:45.780
I'll tell you what about the Bitcoin.

47:45.780 --> 47:49.780
I had a very entertaining day about a month ago, month and a half ago,

47:49.780 --> 47:57.780
of watching someone just completely take about, what was it, like, 9 million or something worth of Bitcoins.

47:57.780 --> 48:01.780
Just completely taking it from right out in front of people, packing his way out of the money.

48:01.780 --> 48:02.780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard about that.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.780
That was hilarious!

48:04.780 --> 48:07.780
Well, that's kind of why I personally like the Dogecoin,

48:07.780 --> 48:11.780
because it's not very valuable, and it's used in a much less serious manner.

48:11.780 --> 48:15.780
Like, more about, like, what internet community is supposed to be about.

48:15.780 --> 48:17.780
So, I think that currency is kind of fun.

48:17.780 --> 48:21.780
But, yeah, all the rest of it is really volatile.

48:21.780 --> 48:25.780
And you kind of are waiting, like, are they gonna try to clamp down on this?

48:25.780 --> 48:29.780
But then again, how do you clamp down on something that's born of the internet?

48:29.780 --> 48:31.780
That's a world thing.

48:31.780 --> 48:33.780
Anyway, that's a whole other thing.

48:33.780 --> 48:38.780
And I'm still of the opinion that I should form my own country, my own island nation,

48:38.780 --> 48:41.780
where everyone rides, where we have a complete monorail system,

48:41.780 --> 48:47.780
everyone else will ride a Vespa, and we don't have this fuckery going on.

48:47.780 --> 48:50.780
We're supposed to get the shoes that tie their own laces next year, just like Back to the Future.

48:50.780 --> 48:51.780
Oh!

48:51.780 --> 48:53.780
Queen Simeon, in our chatroom, says,

48:53.780 --> 48:56.780
It's Doge. Doge. Doge.

48:56.780 --> 49:00.780
If you pronounce it like the actual word there, so, alright, fair enough.

49:01.780 --> 49:05.780
Well, give me more of it. I will gladly accept donations in Doge.

49:05.780 --> 49:08.780
For the record, I made one of those little memes to put in my cubicle.

49:08.780 --> 49:09.780
Did you?

49:09.780 --> 49:10.780
I did.

49:10.780 --> 49:11.780
With the Shiba Inu?

49:11.780 --> 49:13.780
Yeah, with Shiba Inu. It was awesome.

49:13.780 --> 49:15.780
I can't say what it was because then I'd have to mention where I work.

49:15.780 --> 49:17.780
Oh, I was like, I don't want to know what it is.

49:17.780 --> 49:20.780
But I am gonna design a picture for the land of cubicles and tech.

49:20.780 --> 49:22.780
Okay, fair enough.

49:22.780 --> 49:25.780
Alright, moving on. Loki.

49:25.780 --> 49:37.780
Alright, so we have some information about the brand new, was it, Japanese Arcade Expo coming in 2014.

49:37.780 --> 49:39.780
Some of the games are gonna be showing off there.

49:39.780 --> 49:42.780
Looks like some updates to just a bunch of games that I've seen before.

49:42.780 --> 49:48.780
Like, you know, remember that old Alpine Racer game that they had, you know, with the downhill skiing game?

49:48.780 --> 49:53.780
So they're gonna have a new one of that, Midnight Maximum Tune 5.

49:53.780 --> 49:57.780
Hopefully some great new music coming from that as well.

49:57.780 --> 50:06.780
Let's see, a game called Mock Storm, which is kind of like some sort of, looks like a dog fighting game.

50:06.780 --> 50:12.780
And then Taiko no Tatujin Master White version is gonna be coming out as well.

50:12.780 --> 50:15.780
So that looks kinda cool.

50:15.780 --> 50:20.780
Taiko no Tatujin in the arcade is so fun. I played that in San Francisco.

50:20.780 --> 50:27.780
It was when we had the Hoard House night, when Shane was visiting, and when we went to Japan Town with Grandpa and extra for everybody.

50:27.780 --> 50:34.780
I played Taiko no Tatujin, and it's so much better in the arcade when you have that gigantic taiko drum to bang on.

50:34.780 --> 50:36.780
But anyway, sorry, just random tangent.

50:36.780 --> 50:44.780
No, and then of course, you know, being Japan, they've got a Gundam versus game coming out as well.

50:44.780 --> 50:46.780
It looks kinda cool.

50:47.780 --> 50:49.780
Is it like the older Gundam game?

50:52.780 --> 50:55.780
It was like the first person Gundam game?

50:55.780 --> 51:00.780
Yeah, I think it's like that. It's hard to tell. The screenshot's really small.

51:00.780 --> 51:09.780
And then, what was I gonna say? There's a, I was gonna say, I saw like an AKB48 shooter game.

51:09.780 --> 51:10.780
What?

51:10.780 --> 51:12.780
It's a zombie shooter game.

51:12.780 --> 51:14.780
Are the girls zombies?

51:15.780 --> 51:18.780
Yes, I've seen this game. Yes, it's the pop idols as zombies.

51:18.780 --> 51:19.780
I might need this.

51:19.780 --> 51:21.780
Yeah, I've heard of this. Hilarious.

51:25.780 --> 51:26.780
Awesome, awesome.

51:26.780 --> 51:30.780
By the way, our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com say hi to Josh.

51:30.780 --> 51:34.780
We can hear him in the background, which is fine. It's cute.

51:35.780 --> 51:42.780
Alright, moving on. A lot of people, you might want to mute your speakers there, Loki, with the kids around,

51:42.780 --> 51:46.780
because I'm gonna use some naughty language with this, because this really ticks me off.

51:46.780 --> 51:51.780
And this is more, and there's really no better word for this, which is why I told Loki to mute it,

51:51.780 --> 51:56.780
because it's really pure fuckery is what's going on there with Candy Crush Saga.

51:56.780 --> 52:00.780
And I'm sure many of you have heard this, because this is a news story.

52:00.780 --> 52:06.780
The interesting thing about it is that much like Candy Crush Saga, this news story has really caught wildfire through Facebook,

52:06.780 --> 52:09.780
and there's all these people sharing, like people that I didn't even know really played games,

52:09.780 --> 52:14.780
that share these things that say, here's why you should stop playing Candy Crush Saga.

52:14.780 --> 52:21.780
And it's because of another game out there called Candy Swipe, which many, many, many people are confusing for Candy Crush Saga.

52:21.780 --> 52:29.780
In fact, the creator, Albert Ransom, has put together quite the evidence that his game gets confused with Candy Crush Saga all of the time.

52:29.780 --> 52:34.780
Well, what's the problem? Candy Swipe is a rip-off game, right? Wrong.

52:34.780 --> 52:41.780
Candy Swipe was written in 2010. In fact, Candy Swipe was written by Albert Ransom as a tribute to his mom,

52:41.780 --> 52:43.780
who had passed away at 62 because of leukemia.

52:43.780 --> 52:45.780
And it has better graphics.

52:45.780 --> 52:51.780
Yes, and Albert Ransom details this all in a letter that he wrote openly, that has gone viral,

52:51.780 --> 52:56.780
to King, the makers of Candy Crush Saga, in a note over at candyswipe.com.

52:56.780 --> 53:01.780
And he basically said to the makers of Candy Crush Saga, congrats, you win.

53:01.780 --> 53:07.780
You're taking the food out of my family's mouth when Candy Swipe clearly existed well before Candy Crush Saga.

53:07.780 --> 53:10.780
And this all boils down to trademark issues.

53:10.780 --> 53:21.780
Because Albert Ransom, when he made Candy Swipe, he tried to actually get protection for his name, intellectual property protection.

53:21.780 --> 53:27.780
But the makers of Candy Crush Saga are coming in and saying, nope, you've got to change your game,

53:27.780 --> 53:30.780
because people are getting it confused with us, and we own the trademark.

53:30.780 --> 53:34.780
We bought the name Candy as a trademark, because they didn't actually get that. They bought it.

53:34.780 --> 53:38.780
And so your game is too confusing, even though it was out first.

53:38.780 --> 53:46.780
So this guy who made the game is battling these trademark issues, and now Candy Crush Saga is trying to cancel the Candy Swipe trademark.

53:46.780 --> 53:49.780
So the guy who made this game can't even use his own name.

53:49.780 --> 53:54.780
And the way trademark issues work in this country, it doesn't necessarily matter that he's first.

53:54.780 --> 53:59.780
It matters that Candy Crush Saga is kind of the well-known one, so to speak.

53:59.780 --> 54:01.780
It's just completely stupid.

54:01.780 --> 54:06.780
It's completely stupid, and it just keeps on going, like, why we need reform of these laws in this country.

54:06.780 --> 54:14.780
But unfortunately, our Congress, which can't get a fucking thing done, like, not a single fucking thing done, will never get around to this.

54:15.780 --> 54:20.780
Because I'm sure, as many of you probably feel, there's far more important things that they need to be dealing with.

54:20.780 --> 54:32.780
And, you know, certainly there are some other things too, but, I mean, this is the type of fuckery that these laws not being reformed, that were written well before the internet, are leading us to.

54:32.780 --> 54:39.780
So anyhow, so basically, you know, this maker is saying, congrats, you win.

54:39.780 --> 54:42.780
And it was very, very passive-aggressive there.

54:42.780 --> 54:48.780
Congratulations on your success, is how it ended there, but I think we all know that was very tongue-in-cheek.

54:48.780 --> 54:59.780
Anyhow, so, I mean, again, if you're still out there playing Candy Crush Saga, you know people that are out there playing Candy Crush Saga, I have no easy way to say this.

54:59.780 --> 55:01.780
You're continuing to support this.

55:01.780 --> 55:02.780
Now, it's important to note-

55:02.780 --> 55:04.780
That makes them part of the problem.

55:04.780 --> 55:07.780
It really does. Like, there's no nice way for me to say that.

55:07.780 --> 55:10.780
You are part of the problem in letting King-

55:10.780 --> 55:12.780
Literally, you're part of the problem.

55:12.780 --> 55:14.780
Because, what did we just say?

55:14.780 --> 55:23.780
In trademark laws, because Candy Crush Saga is more well-known, because it's more popular, because people continue to play it, they can stomp the little guy like this.

55:23.780 --> 55:32.780
I think it's very important to note, Candy Swipe isn't really a replacement for Candy Crush Saga, because Candy Swipe, yes, it uses little pictures of candy too, but it plays like you connect lines.

55:32.780 --> 55:38.780
It plays more like that- there's a puzzle game, like Puzzle Miner or something on iOS that's very similar, but not the same.

55:38.780 --> 55:39.780
iOS.

55:39.780 --> 55:42.780
Sorry, iOS, the puzzle- I can't think of the name of it.

55:42.780 --> 55:43.780
I don't know.

55:43.780 --> 55:44.780
But yeah, it's-

55:44.780 --> 55:45.780
But I bought Candy Swipe.

55:45.780 --> 55:46.780
Yeah.

55:46.780 --> 55:50.780
I'm very proud to say that I've never, ever gotten Candy Crush.

55:51.780 --> 55:52.780
So.

55:52.780 --> 55:59.780
But yeah, there's that, and yeah, so please, if you're playing Candy Crush Saga, stop.

55:59.780 --> 56:05.780
There's many, many other games out there that are very similar, like I would even say, play Bejeweled, which is now an EA game.

56:05.780 --> 56:11.780
I would rather- much rather you be playing Bejeweled than Candy Crush Saga, which is a much better match 3 game.

56:11.780 --> 56:13.780
So, just throwing that out there.

56:13.780 --> 56:16.780
A little tough love from Rob Roberts.

56:16.780 --> 56:20.780
Well, I fully condone that course of action, because I mean, seriously?

56:20.780 --> 56:21.780
Mhm.

56:21.780 --> 56:22.780
Fuck those guys.

56:22.780 --> 56:23.780
Yeah.

56:23.780 --> 56:24.780
Fuck them.

56:24.780 --> 56:25.780
King needs to be put to an end.

56:25.780 --> 56:28.780
King needs- King needs to be buried in the backyard and assaulted-

56:28.780 --> 56:29.780
With Zynga.

56:29.780 --> 56:31.780
And just like Ed was.

56:31.780 --> 56:33.780
I'm just gonna call them Ed Corp.

56:33.780 --> 56:38.780
Yeah, seriously, look, many of you listen to this show on your mobile phones.

56:38.780 --> 56:39.780
Take a moment right now.

56:39.780 --> 56:40.780
Do it.

56:40.780 --> 56:41.780
This is peer pressure.

56:41.780 --> 56:42.780
Do it.

56:42.780 --> 56:43.780
Delete Candy Crush Saga.

56:43.780 --> 56:44.780
Just do it.

56:44.780 --> 56:45.780
I don't care if you're on level 250.

56:45.780 --> 56:47.780
I don't care if you're on level 300.

56:47.780 --> 56:48.780
These guys are evil.

56:48.780 --> 56:49.780
Do it.

56:49.780 --> 56:50.780
Right now.

56:50.780 --> 56:51.780
Delete it off your phone.

56:51.780 --> 56:52.780
Do it.

56:52.780 --> 56:53.780
Peer pressure.

56:53.780 --> 56:55.780
And if you don't, I'm very disappointed with you.

56:55.780 --> 56:56.780
Mhm.

56:56.780 --> 56:57.780
You make me-

56:57.780 --> 56:58.780
I'm borderline angry.

56:58.780 --> 56:59.780
I'm crying a little bit.

56:59.780 --> 57:00.780
You're crying on the inside.

57:00.780 --> 57:01.780
I am.

57:01.780 --> 57:02.780
I'm just angry.

57:02.780 --> 57:05.780
I'm not gonna buy Dark Soccer at a taco, because you won't delete that app.

57:05.780 --> 57:06.780
I really want a fucking taco.

57:06.780 --> 57:13.780
If you don't- if I don't get my taco, I'm going to kill another horse.

57:13.780 --> 57:14.780
In my village.

57:14.780 --> 57:17.780
And I don't even have another- I'm gonna import another fucking horse into my village,

57:17.780 --> 57:20.780
and I'm gonna stab it with a shovel.

57:20.780 --> 57:21.780
Because of you.

57:21.780 --> 57:24.780
Because of you people playing that game.

57:24.780 --> 57:26.780
You made me do it.

57:26.780 --> 57:29.780
That's what all the mentally ill people say when they kill people, right?

57:29.780 --> 57:30.780
You made me do it.

57:30.780 --> 57:31.780
Alright.

57:31.780 --> 57:33.780
ActDeftInChat at live.vognetwork.com says,

57:33.780 --> 57:37.780
Sky, I won't do it, because I never installed it in the first place.

57:37.780 --> 57:39.780
Well, that's fair.

57:39.780 --> 57:40.780
That's fair.

57:40.780 --> 57:42.780
See, that means that you and I are the very awesome people, because we don't ever have

57:42.780 --> 57:43.780
to deal with that shit.

57:43.780 --> 57:50.780
But make sure that- also, I will even give people three dollars to buy Candy Swipe.

57:50.780 --> 57:52.780
Be careful what you offer.

57:52.780 --> 57:53.780
One or two people.

57:53.780 --> 57:54.780
One or- okay.

57:54.780 --> 57:57.780
And I have to really like you.

57:57.780 --> 57:59.780
Like, I'd buy it for you and Alan.

57:59.780 --> 58:00.780
Okay, that's fair.

58:00.780 --> 58:01.780
Thank you.

58:01.780 --> 58:02.780
Appreciate that.

58:02.780 --> 58:05.780
I would buy it for, maybe ActDeft.

58:05.780 --> 58:06.780
Maybe.

58:06.780 --> 58:07.780
I don't know.

58:07.780 --> 58:09.780
You have to send me real tacos.

58:09.780 --> 58:12.780
Because you're like where real tacos are.

58:12.780 --> 58:16.780
Alright, anyway, full disclosure, I tried Candy Crush Taco because all my friends were

58:16.780 --> 58:17.780
playing it.

58:17.780 --> 58:20.780
I would never put a horse's head in someone's bed.

58:20.780 --> 58:21.780
I would just- no.

58:21.780 --> 58:22.780
That's disgusting.

58:22.780 --> 58:25.780
What kind of a sicko are you?

58:25.780 --> 58:27.780
Okay, so how about some other stuff?

58:27.780 --> 58:28.780
How about it?

58:28.780 --> 58:35.780
Well, we might have covered this before about Yasumi Matsuno, who directed Vagrant Story

58:35.780 --> 58:37.780
and Final Fantasy Tactics.

58:37.780 --> 58:43.780
Well, there's a partnership with PlayDeck that's a mobile developer to do a Kickstarter

58:43.780 --> 58:48.780
campaign for a tactical RPG called Unsung Story, Tale of the Guardians.

58:48.780 --> 58:51.780
And it's turn-based, 3D map, all of that.

58:51.780 --> 58:55.780
Well, it actually funded.

58:55.780 --> 59:00.780
As of Valentine's Day, the Unsung Story, Tale of the Guardians Kickstarter fully funded.

59:00.780 --> 59:08.780
The first 200,000 backers that pledged 20 bucks reserved a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android

59:08.780 --> 59:13.780
copy of Unsung Story that's supposed to be out on July 15th.

59:13.780 --> 59:17.780
And if you donated 50 bucks, there's digital versions of the strategy guide, the soundtrack,

59:17.780 --> 59:18.780
and a poster.

59:18.780 --> 59:24.780
So congrats to you, dude.

59:24.780 --> 59:28.780
It looks neat, except I really, really hate turn-based RPGs.

59:28.780 --> 59:31.780
So I'll let other people enjoy it for me.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.780
Well, there's a lot of fans in that game, so.

59:33.780 --> 59:36.780
Yeah, and I definitely would get soggy, so I don't want soggy tacos.

59:36.780 --> 59:38.780
I'll just have to come hang out with you.

59:38.780 --> 59:39.780
All right.

59:39.780 --> 59:41.780
And ew, Nemesis, yuck.

59:41.780 --> 59:43.780
Doritos tacos, ew.

59:43.780 --> 59:44.780
That just made my stomach curdle.

59:44.780 --> 59:46.780
I don't want tacos anymore now.

59:46.780 --> 59:47.780
Those Loco Tacos?

59:47.780 --> 59:49.780
The Dorito Taco, whatever the crap they are.

59:49.780 --> 59:51.780
The Loco Tacos from Taco Bell.

59:51.780 --> 59:53.780
I don't want tacos anymore, Rob.

59:53.780 --> 59:54.780
I've just been completely-

59:54.780 --> 59:55.780
They're not that bad, but here's the thing-

59:55.780 --> 59:56.780
I hate Doritos.

59:56.780 --> 59:57.780
Here's the thing.

59:57.780 --> 01:00:00.780
There's Taco Bell Tacos, and then there's real tacos.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:03.780
I want real tacos, but right now that just made me nauseous,

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.780
and I'm angry again.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.780
I'm angry at the world.

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:11.780
Doritos Tacos make me hate people.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.780
A lot.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:15.780
All right, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.780
Wow, okay.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:22.780
So this week we've got a bunch of, well, a few good games coming out.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:27.780
Starting off with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release of Rayman Legends.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.780
They'll be coming out this week.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.780
NASCAR 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:40.780
Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze coming out on that Friday.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.780
And then, of course, the biggest game of February, in my opinion,

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:50.780
Earth Defense Force 2025 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.780
Finally.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.780
Wow, all righty.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.780
It's starting to pick up a little bit.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.780
A little bit.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.780
Well, moving on to Japan.

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.780
Guess what?

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.780
Japan actually has a really huge week this week because on February 22,

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.780
the PlayStation 4 is out.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.780
Yay, Japan.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.780
So Japan, we finally get to read PlayStation 4 release dates for Japan

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:12.780
because they are getting the PlayStation 4 on Saturday.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:13.780
So there you go.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.780
So, yes, coming out this week on the PlayStation 4.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.780
The PlayStation 4.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.780
And with that, you can get, like, a vertical stand.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.780
You can get the camera, supposedly.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:28.780
And I'm thinking you got all the inventory that they're not making in the U.S. right now.

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:29.780
So enjoy that.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.780
And here are some of the games you can check out in Japan.

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.780
Drive Club is on the list, supposedly.

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.780
So I guess that's actually happening in Japan.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.780
So I'm hoping we're getting it over here soon, too.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.780
No, it's not happening.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.780
Really? All right.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.780
Because it's still on the list here for February 22.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:50.780
But coming out as well in Japan, Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Call of Duty Ghosts,

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:55.780
DualShock controllers in black, red, blue, and a little charger stand for those two.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:00.780
FIFA 14 World Class Soccer, Killzone Shadow Fall, NAC, NBA 2K4.

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:01.780
Now, wait a minute.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.780
Aren't they getting NAC for free?

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.780
I wonder why they're having a separate release of NAC.

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.780
I thought NAC was being bundled in.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.780
Maybe it's a PlayStation Plus thing.

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.780
NBA 2K14, Need for Speed Rivals.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.780
Nobunaga no Yabu Sozu comes out as well.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.780
And let's see, what else did they get?

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:23.780
Ryu Ga Gotoku Isshin comes out from Sega and Tomb Raider Definitive Edition.

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.780
And I don't know why Watch Dogs is on the list.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.780
There's no way that's coming out.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.780
But for some reason, that's on my list.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.780
But I think that is a falsity.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.780
I think that just hasn't been updated.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:37.780
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Strider comes out in Japan.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.780
Strider.

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.780
The new Strider game.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.780
Strider.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.780
Hiryu.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.780
Hiryu is what they're calling it in Japan.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.780
There's a regular and limited edition.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.780
What?

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:50.780
Ryu Ga Gotoku Isshin comes out there as well.

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.780
Far Cry 3 gets a price reduction.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:03:00.780
And on the PlayStation 3, Shin Kohime Musou Otome Taisen Sangokushi Engi comes out this week.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.780
So check that out on the PlayStation.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.780
Little Princess what?

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.780
On the Xbox 360 this week, nothing.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:10.780
On the Vita this week, not a lot.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:17.780
Chon no Doku Hana no Kusari Taisho Iroki Ibun comes out from Prototype.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.780
I'm trying to see what game that might be.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:24.780
Of course the website's not working for me right now, so I can't get any more on that game.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.780
Let's see the Wii U.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.780
Nothing on the Wii U this week.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:38.780
And the 3DS gets Kuroko no Basuke Shoryu no Kisuke comes out from Bandai Namco.

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.780
So there you go, your Japanese release dates.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:42.780
Enjoy your PS4, Japan.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.780
There's some games coming out in the UK.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:52.780
But my list has not decided to load for me, so...

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:53.780
Yeah, suddenly we're having a...

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.780
Are we still broadcasting?

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.780
Yeah, we are.

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:56.780
I suppose we are.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:00.780
On the 19th we have Banished for PC and Ikaruga for PC.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.780
On the 19th we have Strider!

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.780
Yay!

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:09.780
On everything, and I'm going to have every version of it ever and on the PC.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:16.780
On the 20th we have Blue Eden for iPhone, which the name sounds cool, I don't know what it's about.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:23.780
There's also Men of War Assault Squad 2, but I don't have to see why it has to be so patriarchy focused.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:27.780
And Weapon Shop de Omas on the 21st.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.780
Wow, this is a pretty busy week over in the UK.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:37.780
We have Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, Earth Defense Force 2025, Rayman Legends on various variouses.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.780
That's it.

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:44.780
You know, Rob, women can be a war too.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.780
Why does it have to be Men of War?

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.780
Maybe that'll be the sequel.

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.780
Alright, just like Ms. Pac-Man.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:57.780
See, now I'm coming up with subtitles for it, it'd be Women of War, fuck shit up.

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:00.780
I'd make that game, I'd play that game.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.780
Alright, moving on. Loki.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:09.780
Alright, so there was another announcement this week, not necessarily from Nintendo, but Sony.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:14.780
They had a press event where they showed off some Playstation 4 games coming out,

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:23.780
and also announced that, guess what, that redesigned Vita game is going to be coming over here as well in April, I believe.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:30.780
They're going to have Borderlands 2 launching with that release, a special Borderlands 2 bundle.

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:36.780
So that'll be coming out for $1.99 as well as an 8GB memory card.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.780
So that's kind of cool.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:47.780
And then of course, with that, I want to say, oh yeah, it actually includes all the DLC too, so that's a pretty good deal.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.780
And then I'm not sure how much the system is by itself.

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:58.780
I'm assuming that you can get it without buying Borderlands 2, but probably slightly cheaper than that.

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:08.780
But it's 20% slimmer, 15% lighter, and has just a LCD screen instead of an OLED screen.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:18.780
So, kind of neat. I don't know if that's going to necessarily help drive the Vita, but I know that games like Borderlands 2 probably will help.

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:26.780
Alright, do you think folks are going to actually buy that new Vita model here?

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.780
Maybe. I don't know. If they're looking for something smaller, perhaps.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:39.780
I'm not really sure. Probably if they put out the new version, maybe the old version will be dropping in price?

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:44.780
Yeah, I think certainly price is a big, big key driver of this stuff.

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:52.780
Borderlands 2 on Vita, I guess that's kind of cool, but I also sort of think that most people who wanted to play Borderlands probably have by now.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:58.780
I mean, they gave it away for free on PlayStation Plus, or I think it's still there for free, so I'm just...

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:03.780
It seems like it's almost too late to put it out on the Vita. You know what I mean?

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:09.780
Maybe, but it's still a good handheld. I mean, if you want to take it with you, that's kind of cool.

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:16.780
Alright, well, added to Steam this week, tags. Tags came to the Steam store this week.

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:22.780
But here's what's interesting about it. It's actually a crowd-sourced tag system. They're not like official tags.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.780
Oh, I'm sure that'll be effective then.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:31.780
Well, it's had some very interesting effects, because people have tagged things with very interesting things, but yeah, it's all kind of like crowd-sourced.

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:41.780
So you can suggest tags, and you can tag things yourself, you know, that this is an action game or a hardcore game or whatever, or you can come up with your own inventive tag.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:51.780
You can browse by popular tags. You can also look at tags that are recommended for you, I guess, based on some type of algorithm behind the scenes.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:08:03.780
It is localized for various languages, so you can tag in, you know, I know Steam is very big in Russia, it's in big part thanks to Dota 2, and other languages as well, so you can tag in those languages.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:13.780
And yeah, looking at it, what your friends have tagged things with and so forth. So it is in beta right now, but it's not like one of those invite-only things.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:18.780
It's just kind of out there, and you can check that out, the Steam tags. So there you go.

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:29.780
All right. Well, you know, I'm going to go back to a day when we didn't really have a way to tag games. It was just like, which drawer are you going to put this in, or which bin are you going to throw this game in?

01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:32.780
Tagging games meant that you took spray paint to a billboard.

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:35.780
Or you took masking tape and you put it on the NES cartridge.

01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.780
And you wrote your name on it.

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.780
Exactly. It's the classic game of the week.

01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:50.780
Dark Soccer's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking this game out, because if you don't, you like suck or something.

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:53.780
Seriously, what's up with you kids? Get off my lawn and play it.

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:56.780
Here it is, the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer. What would you pick?

01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.780
I sure do like my compile games, don't I, Rob?

01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.780
You sure do like your compile games.

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:08.780
This one is Golvelius, which, well, the technical name is Mao Golvelius, which is Devil Golvelius.

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:14.780
It was an action adventure game that was done for the MSX, developed by compile and released in 1987.

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:23.780
Then Sega licensed it in 88 and did a remake of it for the Sega Master System, which was the Mark 3 in Japan.

01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:27.780
And that's the version that actually this music is coming from, because I couldn't find the MSX one.

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:37.780
And then later on, compile also did a remake for the MSX2 that was called Shin Mao Golvelius, which was True Devil Golvelius.

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.780
Although, is that true or new? I don't know.

01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:46.780
Anyway, it looks like the Sega Master System version, but had different layouts.

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:57.780
Now the thing about this game is that it actually was announced that it would be coming out on the iOS platform.

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:15.780
In 2009. I actually haven't seen if it actually did, but there was a spin-off game that was called Super Cooks that was released in 1989 with the disc station Special Rokugo.

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.780
So yeah, it's kind of a neat little game.

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:31.780
Basically, this game, I have to say the American artwork is just another one of the sufferers of the really bad 80s style let's change the awesome artwork that it had into shit.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:41.780
But anyway, the game has got some really interesting type of motion mechanics in it.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:51.780
Can I just say this whole thing we're looking at right now in the video where the power bar and the gold and everything is scrolling on the screen repeatedly.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.780
The whole level itself is scrolling.

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.780
Yeah, it's so weird.

01:10:54.780 --> 01:11:01.780
And see, that's one of the things. When you're exploring your overworld, it's just the standard above ground thing.

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:08.780
Then you have these levels that are like this that Rob was describing, where it's almost like you're playing a scrolling shooter.

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:11.780
Yeah, it's like a shooter, but with a sword and shield type of thing.

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.780
It is compile. I mean, hello.

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:13.780
True.

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:19.780
But you're just walking around stabbing things and then killing gigantic, cute looking, weird bats.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:27.780
The other types of levels that you have in here are side scrolling levels, platform style.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:36.780
Where one of the first ones that you do is the one with the giant red snake in it and you shoot all the little cute baby snakes and the red snake just looks at you disapprovingly.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:40.780
And then you stab him in the face and he dies, which is what you're supposed to do with snakes apparently.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:51.780
Then, as you go through it, I mean, really the way to make it through this game is to grind, to grind, to grind.

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:56.780
And find your shopkeepers, buy stuff, you can get potions to extend your life meter.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:04.780
You get bibles, and bibles increase the amount of gold you can carry, which is very apt of religion in the United States.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.780
I wonder if that's the same all over the world.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:11.780
You know, but it's just really a grind heavy game.

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:16.780
But it's got different, it's pretty straight forward in how you play it.

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:19.780
It doesn't really have a lot of the puzzle solving stuff.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:24.780
It's just really, you know, you have the side scrolling stages, you have the overhead stages.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.780
Sorry.

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:31.780
And also, once you scroll the screen, you can't backtrack, so you have to keep going forward.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.780
And you can really get stuck in tight places, you know, if you've got your screen scrolled just the wrong way.

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:41.780
But you do have a big, huge world to explore.

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.780
And it's really detailed.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:50.780
It really makes the most of the capabilities of the, definitely the Master System at the time.

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:54.780
And like I said, I tried to find some more of the MSX version.

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:59.780
The MSX2 Govellia sequel is actually really, really nice as well.

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:03.780
And I mean, some of the writing in it is like super, super funny.

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:10.780
There's even a place where, you know, you find a woman and she's mistranslated.

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.780
And it says, why, thou art but a moron of the first class, hit the road.

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.780
And, you know, it's just a fun little game.

01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:23.780
And like even the levels have some fun type of things thrown in here and there.

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:35.780
And like in the snake level, for example, when you get to the end of it, there's actually like an arrow built into the ground when you get past the snake.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:38.780
You're in the one with the big snakes.

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.780
But keep in mind, you know, the other stuff that Compile did, they did the Alest series.

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:45.780
They did Zanac, which I've covered. Puyo Puyo.

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:51.780
They did Maru Monogatari for, you know, if you're looking, again, to RPGs.

01:13:51.780 --> 01:14:02.780
But really, Golvelius is, I'd even say it's probably got to be one of the unsung classics of the adventure RPG genre.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:07.780
And yeah, it did actually come out on iOS.

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:12.780
So I knew about it, but I didn't get it.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.780
So I actually didn't see if it did, if it was available.

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:18.780
But it's the Sega Master System version that has touch controls.

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.780
So definitely go get the game. It's pretty neat.

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.780
It's Golvelius.

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.780
Devil Golvelius.

01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.780
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:35.780
Golvelius for the Sega Master System is what we're looking at here in studio, but MSX sounds like probably the definitive version there.

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:40.780
Actually, for the one that most people would have seen would have been the Master System one.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.780
Well, here anyway.

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:48.780
No, no, no. From what I understand, because it was the touched up graphical one, it ended up being one of the more notable ones.

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.780
But yeah, but I mean, you know, the MSX was also, of course, super popular.

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:57.780
But I've got the game. It's a fun little game.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.780
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:03.780
Not one I'm super familiar with, I've got to be honest.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:07.780
So that was pretty cool to learn something new tonight in the classic game of the week statement.

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.780
I aim to educate.

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:12.780
Well, we've got plenty more show to come, some rapid fire news.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:17.780
The Fookle Question of the Week, the mailbag, and plenty more to come.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.780
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:30.780
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:37.780
Live here on February the 16th of 2014 with the 540th episode of our show.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:41.780
And we've been talking a little bit about Flappy Vog and Dark Soccer.

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:44.780
She just don't give a fuck tonight.

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:49.780
No, not a single fuck has been, is being, or will be given.

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:53.780
Because she is taco-less and this is upsetting.

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:57.780
No, you know what it is? Is it like the last two days of completely carb-fested?

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:00.780
Oh, that sounds awesome.

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:06.780
It was awesome. I had Choco-Pon and Cream-Pon and On-Pon.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:11.780
And chocolate, lots of chocolate. And beer, lots of beer. I love beer.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:15.780
And I had a legit cheeseburger with a bun.

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.780
Did you see that Jelly Belly is doing a beer flavor?

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.780
Don't tell me these things.

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:23.780
They supported what's-as-fuck, so I'm not giving them.

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:25.780
Yeah, I know. They're kind of crappy.

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:27.780
They don't, douchey people don't get my money.

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.780
Jelly beans are really good though.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.780
Jelly bellies are really good. Other jelly beans are made of gummy material.

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.780
They suck. I can't eat them because I'm allergic to them.

01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.780
See, I'm not gonna lie. I used to love, like on Easter,

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.780
because that's like when you get all those types of jelly beans,

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.780
I used to love getting the licorice ones are my favorite.

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:45.780
And some people are like, ew!

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:49.780
You and Dan can go hide in licorice land and eat that shit far away from me.

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:52.780
It's the Dutch. It's got to be a Dutch thing. Is it? I don't know.

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.780
I need to ask Sil. I'm bringing her up for the second time on tonight's show, but that's okay.

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:59.780
I love Sil. I say that every time you mention Sil too.

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.780
I don't like licorice.

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.780
You don't like licorice? Are you Dutch, Loki?

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:04.780
But you're not Dutch.

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:06.780
Well, then maybe that's the thing.

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:10.780
I'm not Dutch, but I have a Dutch name because of Dan. Dang it.

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:13.780
I hate Starbursts a lot, Brad, from Pod Culture,

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.780
because they have the stuff in it I'm allergic to, so they make me vomit.

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:19.780
The jelly beans are really good though. He's right.

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.780
They're the same stuff. They make me vomit.

01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:26.780
Well, I don't know. They don't taste like they don't have the texture of Starbursts at all.

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:32.780
But the only ones I can actually eat are the ones that are actually the crystallized, like the jelly bellies are.

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:38.780
They seem more like jelly bellies to me than regular jelly beans, but I don't know.

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.780
I wouldn't risk it. It's not worth risking it. They're not that good.

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.780
No, it's not worth risking it.

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:49.780
But, Dan, I do actually buy him licorice.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:56.780
Even though I cannot stand the smell of it, he is respectful enough to be gracious

01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:02.780
when I sacrifice my olfactory senses to bring him a treat.

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.780
He is kind enough to take it to work and not eat it in front of me.

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:10.780
Alan will say, I went to the store and I got you a surprise.

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:16.780
It's either good and plenty, which I really like, or the Australian licorice that they sell at the store.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:20.780
But, to be fair, I will also buy him mayonnaise. That's love.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:25.780
I bought Dan something awesome. You'll hate it, but I bought him cool because I love him.

01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:29.780
I also can't be around sriracha because the smell makes my nose break out.

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:30.780
Oh, yeah.

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.780
I got him sriracha mayonnaise.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.780
He is a happy, happy Dan.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:38.780
No thanks.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.780
I can't have Swedish Fish either because they totally just make me...

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.780
Swedish Fish are the bomb.

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:45.780
Yuck.

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:46.780
Alright, anyway.

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.780
And I hate absinthe.

01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:53.780
We could talk about candy all night long. I did not have absinthe until...

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:54.780
You know what?

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:55.780
Dragon Con this year.

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.780
You know what I brought you last week?

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.780
And I don't know if you had any of it.

01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.780
I haven't, but I think Alan did.

01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:04.780
I made vanilla... I'm making a full bottle of vanilla vodka right now.

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.780
Nice.

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.780
Alright, look. We could talk about booze. We could talk about candy.

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:10.780
You're listening to Orange Booze Radio.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.780
We're now CoinTrow Radio.

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.780
Cause it's orange liqueur.

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.780
Let's get back into games with the rapid fire news segment.

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:19.780
Loki, start us off.

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:20.780
Alright.

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:21.780
Alright.

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.780
So, first up, South Park.

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.780
You know, it's been pushed back and back and back and back.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:27.780
It's finally gone gold.

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:31.780
So, South Park The Stick of Truth will actually be releasing on March 6th.

01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.780
Which is only a few weeks away.

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:38.780
And they even teased about 13 minutes of gameplay and it looks fantastic.

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:43.780
So, that'll be coming out on current gen systems and on PC.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.780
It looks like...

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.780
Was it the...

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:51.780
6th is also a European day.

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:54.780
I want to say maybe coming out on the 4th over here.

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:58.780
Yeah, I'm sorry. The 4th of March for North America.

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:01.780
The 6th for Europe.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.780
And then, let's see.

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:08.780
Gearbox has announced their final DLC for Borderlands 2.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:12.780
And Borderlands 2 is going to be getting two campaigns.

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:16.780
So, first, they was, let's see here.

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:21.780
featuring Sir Hamlock and it's...

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:27.780
Did we lose Loki? We lost you, Loki.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.780
I don't know if it's your magic mute button.

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.780
Hello?

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.780
Hello?

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:33.780
Hi.

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:34.780
Welcome back.

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:35.780
That's weird.

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:36.780
This live thing is weird.

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.780
Okay, no. Keep going. We lost you for a minute. That was weird.

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:40.780
That's strange.

01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:47.780
Okay, yeah. So, they have a couple new pieces of DLC.

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:51.780
One is Sir Hamlock versus the son of CrawlerMax.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.780
That's supposed to be coming out, I think, later this year.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.780
And then, let's see.

01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:03.780
They had another one for Valentine's Day recently that was...

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:06.780
Oh, I'm sorry. That is the final Borderlands DLC.

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.780
I was going to say they had one more that just came out.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:17.780
It was for Valentine's Day featuring Mad Moxie and the two rival clans that were in Borderlands 2.

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:20.780
I can't remember their names.

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.780
It's kind of like some hillbilly clans in there.

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:27.780
And so you had to kind of bring them together with some forbidden wedding thing.

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.780
It was pretty funny.

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.780
But they put that out for Valentine's Day.

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:37.780
But this one, I don't think they've given a date yet when this is supposed to be coming out.

01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.780
But it's only supposed to be April 5th.

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:45.780
So, $2.99 on April 5th.

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:46.780
So, wow.

01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.780
They've been really...

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:52.780
Considering that this game came out in 2012, they've really supported it with some DLC.

01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:55.780
That's for sure.

01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:57.780
Alright, and then...

01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.780
Let's see, I was going to say last but not least.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:07.780
We have The Witcher 3 is going to be a possibility on Linux.

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:10.780
That's suing how well SteamOS does.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:20.780
If it ends up being popular enough, they will go ahead and create a version for SteamBoxes and SteamOS.

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:24.780
But their comment of course was,

01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:30.780
First of all, we have a lot of respect for Steam and we think they are very, very good business guys and good gamer friendly guys.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:32.780
And that's really, really important.

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:39.780
We like what they're doing with the SteamBox and if they're able to deliver a cool console, definitely we are interested in having a game there.

01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:45.780
You know, one of the reasons we have not released Witcher on Linux is that the most...

01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:53.780
Probably they have to address five different versions of Linux and this is always terrible, the support quality of the game afterwards.

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.780
The patches, the updates and everything.

01:22:55.780 --> 01:23:01.780
If Steam will deliver a constant Linux environment and call it SteamOS or anything like that, we'd love to have our games there.

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:04.780
Because, you know, most of the people play our games.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:07.780
The more people that play our games, the better for us.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:15.780
So, cool, we'll have to see how that turns out and maybe we'll get Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk 2077 or something like that.

01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.780
I wonder how some of the Linux fans feel about that though.

01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:24.780
That like, you know, they're waiting for SteamOS to kind of unify it when maybe people are attracted to Linux because it's not that way.

01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:25.780
You know what I mean?

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.780
So, hmm.

01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.780
Alright, moving on with some more news.

01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:33.780
A very interesting statement from Mutant Mudds Deluxe.

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.780
I don't know if you have played this game.

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:38.780
It's on like the 3DS and it's on the Wii U, it's on Steam and all this.

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:46.780
But the developer, Renegade Kid, says he has seen the best sales for Mutant Mudds Deluxe on Wii U.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:47.780
Which might be surprising.

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.780
Better than PSN and Steam combined.

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.780
He mentioned this on Twitter.

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:58.780
And there was also a follow-up tweet that said the 3DS was undoubtedly the most popular platform for Mutant Mudds Deluxe.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:03.780
Which was a free content download on the original Mutant Mudds game for the 3DS.

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.780
But, yeah.

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:09.780
Apparently it's doing very, very well on Wii U, so go figure.

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:13.780
I wonder if that's just because there's not a lot else available there.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:14.780
I don't know.

01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:15.780
Alright.

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:16.780
But, yeah.

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:19.780
Anyhow, going on to other games.

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:23.780
These are some real classics that are coming to Steam.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:25.780
Descent. Do you remember Descent?

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.780
I had Descent on 14 disks.

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:29.780
Yeah.

01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:31.780
Please insert disc one. Please insert disc two.

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.780
No, no, no, no.

01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:35.780
I told you about my friend Avery in Alabama, right?

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:36.780
Probably a while ago, yeah.

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.780
Who built the chair.

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.780
Mm-hmm.

01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:43.780
That had, like, two full-sized joysticks, extra things, and all this.

01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.780
Just so he could play Descent.

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:46.780
That's awesome.

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.780
Yeah, I know Descent.

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.780
But, yeah. It goes full 360 degrees.

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:51.780
It's like Doom in 360. That's kind of what Descent is.

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:52.780
So, it's awesome.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:55.780
It's actually now on Steam.

01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:57.780
It's not coming to Steam. It is now on Steam.

01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:00.780
350. So, no more 14 disks.

01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:01.780
Have. Must have.

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:02.780
Digital download.

01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:03.780
Must shoot everything.

01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:04.780
There it is.

01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:05.780
Descent, by the way.

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:08.780
Guess how old Descent is. Uh-oh.

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:09.780
Old as balls.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:11.780
19 years old.

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:14.780
Older than this show, so, yes.

01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:15.780
Older than some of our listeners.

01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:16.780
All right, yeah.

01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:18.780
Also coming to Steam, however.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.780
See, Dark Soccer, I wouldn't hit the buy button on Descent just yet,

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:26.780
because then you may not have the money for Ikaruga is coming out on Steam.

01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:28.780
Do you know how many freaking copies of Ikaruga I have?

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.780
Well, what's one more?

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.780
Dan will be the one getting that.

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:34.780
I actually already bought BlazBlue.

01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.780
That will be coming out actually on February 18th.

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.780
So, you have a couple more days.

01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:40.780
But, yeah.

01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:44.780
As you might remember, Ikaruga, Dreamcast, GameCube, 360.

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:47.780
The Steam version, by the way, is based on the 360 release.

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:51.780
And you can just plug in a 360 controller via USB, and voila.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.780
It'll magically work. Imagine that.

01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:54.780
You know what's funny?

01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:58.780
Dan needs to just put on playthroughs of Ikaruga so he can take a nap.

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.780
Because the music is so good.

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:04.780
Very interesting little experiment going on at Twitch TV.

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:07.780
Something called Twitch Plays Pokemon.

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.780
Yes, it's where you have this Twitch stream,

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:17.780
but you actually have the viewers can control the hero of Pokemon Red and Blue

01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:20.780
by actually putting commands in the chat window.

01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:25.780
And at one point, there was 10,000 viewers after two days of play,

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:28.780
and people just typing A, B, up, down, and so forth.

01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:33.780
And the Pokemon Master, of course, he just runs around in circles a lot of the time

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:36.780
because people can't seem to coordinate how to do it.

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.780
But, yeah.

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:43.780
Apparently, though, viewers did get far enough to get past Misty, the second gym leader.

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.780
So, it's not all just running around in circles.

01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:48.780
So, maybe late at night, people have been able to coordinate a little better

01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:50.780
and be able to battle Misty.

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.780
I don't know if it's still going. I think it is.

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:54.780
You know what? I want to battle Misty for real.

01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:56.780
We need to get her back on the show so we can battle.

01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:57.780
October, I believe, is when.

01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:00.780
Okay, you better come with all of your Pokemon.

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:01.780
I'm kidding.

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.780
I'm trying to see if the video will come up.

01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:06.780
Oh, God, I probably broke our own stream trying to pull this up.

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:07.780
That was done.

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:09.780
Okay, yes, it's still going.

01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:10.780
Good Lord.

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:12.780
That's all you get.

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:14.780
That slowed my computer to a crawl there.

01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:16.780
I didn't want to lose our own feed.

01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:17.780
All right.

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:19.780
So, an interesting little experiment.

01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.780
Who knows what game will come next after that?

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:25.780
Act F says the update is they currently have four gym badges.

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.780
So, it might actually beat the game.

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:29.780
Who knows?

01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.780
Dark Soccer, your turn.

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.780
There's some stuff.

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:37.780
First of all, this one makes me stupidly happy

01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:41.780
because what is one game that I have always just gone completely off about?

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:43.780
It's Awesometasticness.

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:45.780
Fucking Drunken Robot Pornography.

01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:46.780
Hell yeah.

01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:52.780
So, on February 19th, it is going live.

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.780
I have been playing in the early access.

01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:58.780
That game is fucking amazing, and it's fucking hard.

01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:04.780
So, it was made by a company called Dejobaan, and it's just awesome.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:09.780
I mean, you can basically just shoot them with everything.

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:17.780
It's really a lot of, like, maybe a cross between Oratorio Tengram,

01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:21.780
Virtual On, and Jumping Flash, and games like that.

01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:24.780
But it's crazy, and the music is amazing.

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:30.780
It's going to retail for 15 bucks, but it may have a Steam discount on launch day.

01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:33.780
Everyone get this game.

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.780
It is awesome.

01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:42.780
So, also, there is another game coming out for the Dreamcast.

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:45.780
It's Neo XYX.

01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:49.780
That is another shooting game. Yay!

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:52.780
So, I mean, the Dreamcast is 15 years old.

01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:54.780
Actually, it's Neo Xixu.

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:57.780
That's how it's pronounced, so I said it incorrectly.

01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:04.780
And it's like Truxton and Batsugun, so it's like those other arcade games.

01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:05.780
So, yay.

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:07.780
And, um, I won.

01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:10.780
Also, Sonic Boom.

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:15.780
I don't know how I feel about this, because Royd Knuckles is just not attractive.

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:22.780
There is actually an interview out that has some details about it.

01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:23.780
So, it's going to be...

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:27.780
They're going to be using the Wii U gamepad for map upgrades,

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:32.780
and some other functions that they have not completely unveiled.

01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:35.780
And then, um, all the games...

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:38.780
All the levels are connected by story and location.

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:41.780
It's supposed to be more organically challenging.

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:44.780
It's an adventure style with currency and upgrades.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:48.780
And, yeah, I still don't know how I feel about it, so...

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:53.780
But they are taking inspiration from Sonic 2, Sonic Adventure, and Sonic Generations.

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:56.780
And those were all good games, so maybe.

01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:58.780
Maybe it'd be fun.

01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:01.780
It could be crap, too, so...

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:03.780
I'm just being honest.

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.780
It's a night of honesty. It could be crap.

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.780
But it might not be.

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:10.780
It might be okay.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.780
We'll see.

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:13.780
Um, are you looking more...

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:14.780
Are you looking...

01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:20.780
Well, I guess the question would be are you looking less forward to the game or the cartoon?

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:23.780
I might just hide under my bed when the cartoon comes out.

01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:25.780
The cartoon didn't look that bad.

01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:27.780
I think the cartoon's probably getting better than the game.

01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:30.780
I mean, because their games haven't really been that great to be in with.

01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:34.780
Oh, and it's Nintendo exclusive, so I'm sure that'll sell somewhere we use systems, right?

01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:38.780
Yeah, you never know. You never know. Kids. Kids.

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:39.780
Maybe.

01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:41.780
Do kids even care about Sonic, though? That's the thing.

01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:44.780
Does anyone care anymore about that series?

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:47.780
It looks like really bad fan art.

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:49.780
It's just...

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.780
Ugh. Okay, sorry.

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.780
No, it's fine. It happens.

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:57.780
I can't right now. I really have lost the ability to can, so let's continue.

01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:01.780
Alright, um, I'm gonna get to the frugal question of the week, but for whatever reason I didn't have...

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.780
I was trying to buy myself a little time because I don't have my little bumper.

01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:08.780
Well, you know what else I could say since we're having a night of honesty?

01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:09.780
Sure. Why not?

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:20.780
I think that the best ever Sonic thing that has ever come out of anything in the newer era that they did something different with was Sonic Adventure.

01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:24.780
And then Sonic Adventure 2 came out and it was kind of turd-like.

01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:29.780
I mean, it had some fun parts, but it was kind of turd-like, but Sonic Generations was really good.

01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:35.780
It's like, I don't know what's going on. Like, sometimes they smoke, like, something really good and have a great Sonic game.

01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:39.780
And then sometimes you just get that bad batch of, like...

01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:40.780
Sonic 2006.

01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:42.780
Of, like, tainted heroin.

01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:44.780
Sonic the Bad Batch?

01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:47.780
Yeah, and they make Sonic the Bad Batch.

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.780
It's, like, tainted.

01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:58.780
OrangeLunchRadio.com. Use the passphrase, Frost.

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.780
All right. I found bumper music, so let's get to the...

01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:02.780
How was my buying time, Rob?

01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:03.780
It was good.

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:07.780
Hey, it's not a show if we don't talk about tainted heroin.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:20.780
You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together, you get FUGL.

01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:25.780
It's the FUGL question of the week, and this week is a little more about classic games.

01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:28.780
Inspired a little bit by our own classic game of the week segment.

01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:33.780
Look, we have all heard of Super Mario Brothers and Alex Kidd, Legend of Zelda, Phantasy Star.

01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:41.780
What do you think, however, is a game from the NES and Sega Master System era that has been grossly neglected by time?

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:43.780
Let's get to some of the answers here.

01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:50.780
Ragenator says, most of the good ones haven't been neglected, but Mike Tyson's Punch-Out could have used more sequels.

01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:53.780
There were two. There was the one on the Super Nintendo and then they did a Wii one.

01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:54.780
Some people forget about the Wii one.

01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:57.780
And you can't have Mike Tyson's name on it anymore because he's crazy.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:58.780
That's right.

01:32:58.780 --> 01:32:59.780
What?

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:06.780
Alternatively, T&C Surf Designs, while being somewhat mediocre, could have seen some more love.

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:16.780
Nemesis 47 says, it's a Japanese import game on the Genesis, but one that comes to mind is Pulseman on the system along with Ristar and Mutant League.

01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:21.780
I said Master System, not Genesis, but I guess I'll accept it anyway because I just read it.

01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:25.780
Awesome Unicorn says, Legend of the Ghost Lion.

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:34.780
It was an old NES RPG starring a female protagonist, and it could have created a much larger presence for serious games of the girly edge if others had followed his lead.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:41.780
Kane IM says, Caveman Olympics for the NES. How else are you supposed to hit your friend with a stick?

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:43.780
With a stick?

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:48.780
But if he says, if we're just going by that time period in general, how about a Zork remake?

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:51.780
Dude, Zork was pretty awesome.

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:54.780
I wonder who owns the rights to that now. I'm sure it's on Wikipedia or something.

01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:59.780
But then there was like the Zork, that first CD-ROM game, Zork Returns.

01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:02.780
There was like Zork Grand Inquisition and all that stuff.

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:09.780
For the short time GameTap was really cool, like I played all those Zork games again on there because Zork is cool.

01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:16.780
Emily C says, Marble Madness is due for a reboot. It could be enhanced with the capabilities of the Wii U or 3DS.

01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:21.780
Check out a game on the Wii that would actually work on the Wii U called Koro Impa.

01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:27.780
Because this came up on the show not that long ago. I think Marble Madness is the classic game of the week, but Koro Impa is very, very similar.

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:31.780
Well, Koro Impa is more like Super Monkey Ball, I think.

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:35.780
Oh, that's a good point too. Well, Super Monkey Ball in turn is very similar too.

01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:39.780
But yes, Marble Madness was a good game.

01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:47.780
Dart Tetsuya says, Crystallis, SNK should stop with the fighting game nonsense and give us a sequel.

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:52.780
Daniel S. replied and said, Where are my Lolo games at?

01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:57.780
Where did Lolo go? Did Lolo and Lala get married and go to puzzle heaven?

01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:59.780
They got stomped flat, now they're being used for Bingo.

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:09.780
Degenerate Johnny says, Bad News Baseball. There's something about having pink umpires in this game that made it so addicting.

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:13.780
Not to mention, I believe this was the only baseball game on which there were teams for both men and women.

01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:17.780
If we had the Bad News series today, I would come back to the sports gaming genre.

01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:20.780
I thought that was Baseball Stars. Maybe it was both.

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.780
Is it like the Bad News Bears?

01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:26.780
I think it's inspired without copying, yes.

01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:32.780
Let's see, Harold the Wonder Dog replied and said, Star Tropics.

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.780
Yes.

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.780
Wasn't Star Tropics 2 one of the very last NES games?

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:38.780
So was Revenge, yeah.

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:41.780
I'm surprised you haven't rebooted that franchise.

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:44.780
Ospurr with another Sega Genesis answer.

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:47.780
Steph said that Lolo and Lala are Kirby characters.

01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:50.780
Are they really? I didn't realize that.

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:54.780
I guess they do because it's the same studio that ended up making them.

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:57.780
Aren't they like Lolo and Lala?

01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:02.780
I guess that's true, yeah. They're like the king and the queen or something like that.

01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:06.780
Anyway, moving on, we have...

01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:09.780
Did I say Ospurr said Ristar?

01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:15.780
Let's see, which by the way is another Genesis answer. Shame, shame.

01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.780
Katsuhiko J says, Jackal and Iron Tank deserve a sequel or reboot.

01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:22.780
That's not a real name so you can say the full thing.

01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:24.780
Oh, well, I... Look.

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:26.780
It's after an anime.

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:29.780
Anyway, as Joe 100 Matt says, Blades of Steel.

01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:35.780
It's probably the most important sports game of its time and still that one sports game that people don't mind playing.

01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:40.780
The last Blades of Steel game was on the N64. I didn't even realize that on N64.

01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.780
But a reboot of the classic will be well received.

01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:44.780
Chigurh says, EVO.

01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:50.780
I love that game and our Mormon friends weren't allowed to play it because it was promoting evolution.

01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:53.780
Really? Really?

01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:55.780
I think it was pretty awesome though.

01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:58.780
Get this, get this, Arcadian42.

01:36:58.780 --> 01:36:59.780
I miss him.

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:03.780
Well, get this, get this. He didn't, he was not, he does not know what was gonna be on the show tonight in advance.

01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:07.780
You know what his answer was? Golvellius.

01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.780
So there you go, Arcadian42.

01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.780
You win some air.

01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:15.780
You win. He did mention it has some pretty memorable music.

01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:16.780
It does have good music.

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:17.780
There you go.

01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:18.780
It's fucking weird.

01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:21.780
B replied and said, I was also gonna say Star Tropics, but here's a few more.

01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:26.780
Chippendale Rescue Rangers, Tailspin, Darkwing Duck, Adventures in the Magic Kingdom,

01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:30.780
Battletoads, Casino Kid, Wall Street Kid, and River City Ransom.

01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:31.780
That's a pretty lengthy list.

01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:34.780
But yeah, those Capcom Disney games were the bomb.

01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:36.780
Well, they did end up doing DuckTales.

01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:37.780
DuckTales?

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.780
So if maybe, there's a chance, Ryan. There's a chance.

01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:44.780
For the record, I'm actually looking to see if Golvellius is still in the store.

01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:49.780
Dr. Noir says, the very first Western RPG I played was Sword and Sorcery,

01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:53.780
and the character customization and the horribly difficult puzzles made for a very exciting challenge.

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:56.780
It is, and it's only two bucks.

01:37:56.780 --> 01:38:00.780
Hitstun says, let's see a Sunsoft NES compilation.

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:05.780
Everybody knows Blaster Master and the Batman games, but more people should play Super Spy Hunter.

01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:12.780
Known as Battle Formula in Japan, its aimable second gun pushed cross-country, excuse me, vehicular combat to its limits.

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:18.780
At the title screen, press A, B, select start to play a roulette game to decide how many lives you start with.

01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:21.780
You might have up to 12 lives, but you might be stuck with just one life.

01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:26.780
You know what was another Sunsoft NES game that came up on Twitter today in random conversation?

01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:27.780
Adventure Island?

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:31.780
No, that wasn't Sunsoft. That was, uh, no, that was Hal.

01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:33.780
Hal, the B, Hudson.

01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:34.780
Hudson, yeah.

01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:44.780
Fester's Quest, which was basically Blaster Master's overhead stuff without the car stuff, which kind of made it not as good, but yeah.

01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:47.780
Dando said, I'd have to say River City Ransom and Marble Madness.

01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:51.780
There was a great GBA remake of River City Ransom, but I need more.

01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:58.780
Renee said, on the NES, Wampum, which is a Native American themed Mega Man clone.

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:02.780
I didn't realize, actually no, I think I have heard of that game.

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:05.780
And Amanda R. replied and said, the Lufia series.

01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:07.780
So there you go.

01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:10.780
Very good answers over on Facebook.

01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:15.780
But wait, there's more, because we have to get to the Google Plus answers, of which we have just a handful here.

01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:19.780
Flaco Jones, who was gonna be here tonight, but got sick.

01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:20.780
So get better soon, Flaco.

01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:21.780
Stop getting the plague.

01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:23.780
Yeah, we will have him on the show in the future.

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:25.780
He was supposed to be here tonight, but sadly couldn't make it.

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:29.780
Flaco Jones said, I love the NES ports of the Mac Venture games,

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:34.780
but while most people liked Uninvited or Shadow Gate most, my favorite was Deja Vu.

01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:37.780
Still one of my all-time favorite games, despite the cheap deaths.

01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:40.780
Well, they are doing a Shadow Gate remake, for what it's worth.

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:44.780
I know Deja Vu is your favorite, but they have that Kickstarter for Shadow Gate.

01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:45.780
So that's coming soon.

01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:49.780
I was, I don't know, I kicked like 60 bucks to that game or something to get my name in the credits.

01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:51.780
So, excited to see that.

01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:53.780
Oh my god, it just occurred to me.

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.780
I can afford to kickstart now.

01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:56.780
Awesome.

01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.780
Well, change your password though, because you know.

01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.780
Yeah, and all that.

01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:00.780
Yeah, and all that fuckery.

01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:03.780
I don't even think I've ever done, bought anything on there yet.

01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:04.780
Mmm.

01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:06.780
Retertainment says, Skate or Die.

01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:07.780
Yeah, I'll call that game.

01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:09.780
Didn't they have Ski or Die?

01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:10.780
I thought they did.

01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:11.780
Was like, kind of the sequel.

01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:12.780
I think they did.

01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:14.780
There was Ski or Die, I think came out later.

01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:15.780
Mmm.

01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:18.780
And lastly, Act F says, RC Pro-Am.

01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:19.780
Ha ha.

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:21.780
That game doesn't get the love it deserves.

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:25.780
It's fun and challenging, and it could seriously use a new version.

01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:29.780
I thought you were about to say it seriously needed a neutering.

01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:35.780
Well, you guys, those were really good answers all around, but I'm going to express my disappointment with all of you.

01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:36.780
None of them said the game.

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:38.780
None of them said the correct answer.

01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:39.780
None of them.

01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:45.780
Not a single one of them said the correct answer to this question, which is the Guardian Legend.

01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:51.780
Fail. Fail. Fail.

01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:53.780
Good lord.

01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:57.780
Loki, would you answer the Guardian Legend as well, or do you have your own answer for that?

01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:00.780
Oh, I think Guardian Legend is good.

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:01.780
There you go, that's the correct answer.

01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:03.780
I would probably say, um...

01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:04.780
The Guardian Legend.

01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:07.780
Sure, because I can't remember.

01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:08.780
More Space Harrier.

01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:09.780
I like Breakthrough.

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.780
Breakthrough is kind of fun.

01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:11.780
Okay.

01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:13.780
I don't know if it was a really great game.

01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:14.780
Buy it at Commando.

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:18.780
Oh, except that new one they did on the 360 and stuff was not that good.

01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:19.780
You know what we need a new one of?

01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:20.780
I don't care.

01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:22.780
I got them on PC too during the Steam sale.

01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:24.780
But the remakes were really good.

01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:25.780
Yeah, Dark Saga?

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:26.780
A new Fantasy Zone.

01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.780
Ah, that'd be fun.

01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:29.780
Yep.

01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:30.780
There you go.

01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:33.780
And not just the re-releases like they did with the Sega Ages.

01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:35.780
We need a new Fantasy Zone.

01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:36.780
I would love to see...

01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:39.780
A game I was randomly thinking about today was Life Force.

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:41.780
Or, you know, Salamander, if you will.

01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:43.780
We haven't really seen that series in a while.

01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:45.780
So, I'd like to see that.

01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:47.780
But we're getting other Gradius stuff.

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:48.780
Have we?

01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:49.780
When was the last time we had a Gradius game?

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:51.780
Gradius 5 was the last one.

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:52.780
Gradius 5 was the last one.

01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.780
That was a while ago.

01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:54.780
That was PlayStation 2, right?

01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.780
That was a while ago.

01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.780
That's what I want.

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:02.780
Anyhow, but Konami would rather make two-hour Metal Gear games.

01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:03.780
Anyhow.

01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:04.780
Two-hour?

01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:05.780
No, two...

01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:08.780
Metal Gear games with two-hour endings.

01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:10.780
Well, no, there's that.

01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:12.780
There was a whole controversy last week about the...

01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:14.780
It's basically the prologue game.

01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:16.780
But anyway, I'm not gonna go there.

01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:17.780
It's old news.

01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:19.780
They said it's like four hours now.

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:22.780
I think they had another playthrough that didn't do any of the side stuff.

01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:23.780
And they said four hours.

01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.780
Oh, wow.

01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:25.780
Alright.

01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:26.780
Yeah.

01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:27.780
Let's move on with some other news.

01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:28.780
This week's news, Loki.

01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:29.780
This week's news.

01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:30.780
This week's news?

01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:32.780
Okay, I'll try.

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:37.780
So, we talked about, I think, before that there was some information leaked out about

01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:39.780
a bunch of different things that were supposed to be coming out.

01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:41.780
This is from NeoGaf and stuff.

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:45.780
And one of which was the Halo 2 Anniversary Edition.

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:48.780
Kind of like the HD remake that they did of Halo 1.

01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:52.780
Well, now there's even more fuel to that that's supposed to be coming out this year.

01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:55.780
I think they said November was the original leak.

01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:59.780
And this is coming from the actual voice actor for Master Chief.

01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:04.780
Saying that, yeah, there's gonna be a new game.

01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:09.780
Something like, I wouldn't expect anything until 2015 for Halo 5.

01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:14.780
He says, but what you can look forward to this year is an Anniversary Edition of Halo 2.

01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.780
So.

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:20.780
Well, now you know what's interesting about this being pretty much confirmed?

01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:25.780
Is that we had those rumors a few weeks ago from that, you know, the Xbox leak or whatever

01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:27.780
that was posted on NeoGaf.

01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:28.780
And it had all this other stuff.

01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:29.780
Yeah.

01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:30.780
Was it us?

01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:33.780
It was all the other...

01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:34.780
Is it in boat or...

01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:35.780
Us boat or something like that.

01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:38.780
The disc list, Xbox One and all this stuff.

01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:43.780
And, you know, I mean, it does sort of make you go, hmm, you know, that's one.

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:46.780
But I did, I remember being a little bit critical of that post in the past

01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:49.780
because I was like, these are all safe bets it's making.

01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:52.780
So wouldn't Halo 2 Anniversary Edition be kind of a safe bet too?

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:54.780
Yeah, but it is, it's okay.

01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:55.780
It's interesting.

01:43:55.780 --> 01:44:01.780
So it gets that, that little post gets a little more credit, but I'm still a little, so.

01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:03.780
Yeah.

01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:07.780
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com said it was Seaboat.

01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:10.780
And I think it turned out that Seaboat was a mod who hated Microsoft.

01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:13.780
They unearthed all that crap a few weeks ago, I think.

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.780
Oh, internet drama.

01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:18.780
Girl.

01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:19.780
That's all I have to say.

01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:23.780
The internet has more drama than Dark Soccer's Animal Crossing Village

01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:24.780
and that's saying something right there.

01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:29.780
My village is pretty, well, now that that bitch Ed's gone, then I don't have any more drama.

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:31.780
I don't know Dark Soccer, you've been...

01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:36.780
Except for Isabel's crack habit because, you know, she never sleeps.

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:38.780
That too.

01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:39.780
I love Isabel, I really do.

01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:45.780
All right, well, there was a little exploit on PlayStation Network this week

01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:51.780
where somebody was able to exploit the 14-day PlayStation Plus trial subscription

01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:54.780
into about a 21-year subscription.

01:44:54.780 --> 01:45:01.780
Basically, they signed in and they got the free 14-day PS Plus trial

01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.780
and they spammed the offer over and over and over again.

01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:09.780
They did this through the PlayStation 4 and, yeah, now this guy is a member until 2035.

01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:12.780
There has not been really a comment from Sony on this yet.

01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:15.780
I imagine they had to have closed this loophole up by now.

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:18.780
But, yeah, you can't already have a membership in order to see this.

01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:20.780
So if you're already a PlayStation Plus member, you can't do this.

01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:24.780
Plus, if a bunch of people jump in on this, then Sony's really going to crack down.

01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:26.780
They're going to take away all those trials.

01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:33.780
But it does beg the question, like, how the hell did something this easy get exploited like this?

01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:36.780
I mean, this doesn't seem that hard that you could take a 14-day trial,

01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:39.780
which I guess was specifically branded for Outlast,

01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:41.780
and make it go on and on and on and on.

01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:44.780
I mean, doesn't this get tested somewhere along the line?

01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:46.780
Huh?

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:49.780
Loki, did you try to extend your...

01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:51.780
Oh, you don't have PlayStation 4, though, yet, huh?

01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:53.780
I didn't try it.

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:55.780
And, you know, I don't know.

01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:58.780
It would be wrong. Stealing is wrong.

01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:01.780
But it's an experiment for news.

01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:04.780
That's true. I'm pretty sure it's closed up now.

01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:05.780
We're doing it for the people.

01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:08.780
I know. I know.

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:09.780
Just being honest.

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:12.780
I want to see what happens next week, though, if that guy got it all taken away,

01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:14.780
or if he got the ban hammer.

01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:15.780
Probably a combination.

01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:17.780
We ban you. Although, I mean, he didn't hack it.

01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:20.780
He just exploited it. There's a huge difference.

01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:25.780
You know, if you just abused something that was there for the taking,

01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:28.780
did he really steal anything?

01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:29.780
It's an ethical question.

01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:30.780
They will say yes.

01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:33.780
They will say yes, but we'll see.

01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:36.780
All right. Moving on. DarkSakura.

01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:39.780
Oh, I've got stuff for you.

01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:43.780
There is a guy in Oslo who killed a bunch of people once,

01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:45.780
and so he's in prison now.

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:48.780
His name is Anders Breivik, which I'm just laughing because it's Anders

01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:52.780
for anyone who's played Dragon Age 2.

01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:54.780
Because of the character in there also went crazy.

01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:58.780
Anyway, he killed 77 people in Oslo, Norway,

01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:01.780
and he's calling himself a human rights activist now

01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:04.780
because he's complaining that he only gets to play kids' video games

01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:07.780
while the other inmates gets to play grown-up video games.

01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:08.780
He's quoted as saying,

01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:10.780
Other inmates have access to adult games

01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:13.780
while I only have the right to play less interesting kids' games.

01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:17.780
One example is Rayman Revolution, a game aimed at three-year-olds.

01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:19.780
He says he behaves better than most prisoners

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:22.780
and deserves more liberties because of this,

01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:26.780
and that he considers himself a human rights activist.

01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:30.780
So you don't give people the right to kill people.

01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:31.780
You don't give people the right to live.

01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:32.780
You take that away from them,

01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:36.780
but you think you get rights to play video games that you want to.

01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:38.780
You want to know what's also shitty about this?

01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:42.780
He's serving a 21-year sentence, which is the maximum in Norway.

01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.780
Isn't this the guy that killed all those kids

01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.780
that were at the leadership camp or something?

01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:47.780
Isn't this that guy?

01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:49.780
Fuck that guy.

01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:52.780
Why is he getting to play a video game at all?

01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:54.780
He should sit in the corner and think about what he's done

01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:57.780
for a very, very, very long time, like eternity.

01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.780
According to Norway, that's 21 years.

01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:00.780
Oh my gosh.

01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:04.780
But his other complaint is that the chair in his cell is not up to his standards,

01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:07.780
and he would like to have access to a PC instead of a typewriter.

01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:09.780
Guess what? Too bad.

01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:12.780
Someone send this guy to prison in Korea, okay?

01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:13.780
North Korea.

01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:15.780
I'm sorry, specifically North Korea. My bad.

01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:18.780
I'm going to look this guy up, so keep going,

01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:21.780
and I'm going to look him up to make sure this is who I think it is.

01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:25.780
I see the picture there. I'm pretty sure it's that guy.

01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:27.780
What an ass.

01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:29.780
So yeah, and the chat room is backing me up there.

01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:31.780
SJ100Matt says, yes it is, Robin.

01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:36.780
SJ100Matt also says, I'm sorry, but why are any of them playing games to begin with?

01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:40.780
Marissa made a good point that they renew the sentences for five years at a time

01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:43.780
if they're determined to be a dangerous society, which, yeah,

01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:45.780
if you kill that many people.

01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.780
He bombed government buildings in Oslo,

01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:51.780
and then he had the mass shooting at the Workers' Youth League.

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.780
Yeah, no. This guy needs to not be playing video games at all.

01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:56.780
That's a privilege.

01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:57.780
Yeah.

01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:00.780
Weird.

01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:05.780
He also is opposed to feminism and is an extreme Zionist,

01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:08.780
which gives all the rest of the people who are Zionists a bad name.

01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:11.780
And is not somebody whose name should ever be uttered again.

01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:12.780
He should be forgotten about.

01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.780
Yeah, banned from OLR.

01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:15.780
Yeah, I mean.

01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:17.780
Banned from everything.

01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:18.780
Gross.

01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:23.780
Night of honesty, scorpions at the ass.

01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:30.780
Let's talk about someone a bit more sane, Loki.

01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.780
All right.

01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:38.780
Peter Molyneux basically saying that, you know, talking,

01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:41.780
I think this is probably coming from the fact that, you know,

01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:45.780
he was looking at the Dungeon Keeper, you know, mobile game,

01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:49.780
which is kind of like, yeah, what did they do to my game?

01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:53.780
But basically saying that Goddess is going to be a,

01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:57.780
not a free to play game, but an invest to play game.

01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:03.780
Basically saying, you know, there cannot be a term that is less true.

01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:08.780
What we want is a new term and that term is more like invest to play.

01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:12.780
What we're really doing is we're tempting people, or what are we really doing?

01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:15.780
We're attempting people to invest some of their money into the game.

01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:21.780
And I guess it's kind of basically saying that they're incentivizing people

01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:26.780
to want to get the in-app purchases or in-game purchases and that kind of stuff.

01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:34.780
You know, to tempt people to think about being proud and to invest.

01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:37.780
Before we even talk about monetization,

01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:41.780
we want players to feel like Goddess is a hobby and not just a game.

01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:45.780
And then of course commenting on Dungeon Keeper,

01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:49.780
yeah, I'm worried about that, but the risks,

01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.780
talking about the free to play formula,

01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:54.780
yeah, I'm worried about that, but the risks are worth taking.

01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:56.780
We could layer it in.

01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:01.780
It takes six days to build this house and maybe we would make a shitload of money,

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:04.780
but that's not my ambition for games.

01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:09.780
Yeah, because it was completely broken, that Dungeon Keeper game,

01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:14.780
and he's got to be disappointed what they did to his original IP.

01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:17.780
I thought Goddess was supposed to be like $9.99.

01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:20.780
Like, why are they now talking about invest to play or whatever?

01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:24.780
Like, I didn't, I thought this was a game that always was supposed to be,

01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:26.780
or are not enough people buying it or something.

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:29.780
I think maybe they want to make more money.

01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:33.780
You know, maybe this is kind of like DLC or something.

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:35.780
Hmm, maybe.

01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:39.780
All right, well, moving on to a story that never seems to die,

01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:42.780
it's about 38 Studios, remember when they,

01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:45.780
and you know, with all due respect,

01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:48.780
because I do understand that Curt Schilling a couple weeks ago

01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:51.780
had announced that he had cancer, you know, which sucks,

01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:53.780
fuck cancer, period.

01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:55.780
So I'm not saying all this to be mean,

01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.780
I'm just saying this to be very matter of fact,

01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:00.780
about the 38 Studios settlement bill,

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:03.780
because obviously 38 Studios,

01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:05.780
there's not really a nice way for me to put it.

01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:08.780
It failed spectacularly, and a lot of money, you know,

01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:09.780
was put up by the state,

01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.780
and it's kind of one of those tough lessons learned,

01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:13.780
and you know, they didn't make it back.

01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:16.780
So anyhow, the Rhode Island House of Representatives

01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:22.780
actually passed this bill that's going to move on this out-of-court settlement.

01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:25.780
The bill passed in a vote of 53 to 16.

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:28.780
It will protect the defendants who settle from lawsuits filed by codefendants

01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:31.780
over the damages those codefendants are found liable for.

01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:34.780
So in other words, the bill encourages settlements and so forth,

01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:37.780
so if a 38 Studios person settles with the state,

01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:41.780
they can't get those damages from any other 38 Studios official

01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:44.780
tied up in proceedings, so that bill is going to be signed.

01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:51.780
That bill goes along with the default on the $75 million loan

01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:58.780
that they gave to 38 Studios, where the state, I guess,

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:01.780
they default on the loan, and Rhode Island gets off the hook

01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:04.780
for $12.5 million of payment.

01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:07.780
So I guess they basically just passed a bill that said,

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:12.780
we're not going to pay the bill.

01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:14.780
That's kind of ironic.

01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:16.780
Isn't it?

01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:17.780
I want to do that.

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:19.780
Isn't that great when government finally does something,

01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:24.780
and in this case it is, all right, we're going to vote majority

01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:27.780
that we're not going to pay the bills.

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:29.780
That's just like the unemployment thing that happened.

01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:30.780
I won't go there.

01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:32.780
I thought that was federal government.

01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:34.780
Well, that's state or federal.

01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:37.780
Neither one of them is working.

01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:42.780
So anyhow, it's all broken.

01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:44.780
Fix it, Dark Sakura.

01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:45.780
Fix it.

01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:47.780
Oh, fuck.

01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:49.780
How about I just do other stuff?

01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:50.780
All right, how about you read some emails,

01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:52.780
because every week you guys send us emails,

01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:54.780
and for one more week you can send them to Mailbag

01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:57.780
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:53:57.780 --> 01:53:59.780
Here we go, the emails.

01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:03.780
So of note, if you want to be the very last email ever

01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:05.780
at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:06.780
this is the week to do it.

01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:07.780
Do not delay.

01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:08.780
Yeah.

01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:10.780
But we do have, what, one email tonight, two emails?

01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:11.780
We have two.

01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:12.780
Two?

01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:13.780
There was only one earlier.

01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:15.780
Yeah, well, someone got sneaky.

01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:16.780
All right.

01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:19.780
Sneaky, sneaky monkey.

01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:22.780
Dear OLR, with another Valentine's Day coming,

01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:25.780
I have heard many people discussing their favorite video game relationships.

01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:29.780
While it's very easy to come up with examples of the types of relationships

01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:33.780
that will go down in history, side note, Cecil and Rosa forever,

01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:37.780
I am writing today about other types of relationships in video games,

01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:41.780
the relationships that are either doomed or nonexistent.

01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:44.780
Sorry.

01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:47.780
Personally, my favorite depiction of unrequited love in a video game

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:51.780
is from Luthia to Rise of the Sinistrals.

01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:54.780
The relationship between the characters of Maxim and Tia

01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:57.780
has really touched me in the dozen or so times I've played the game.

01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:00.780
Tia, a small-town crybaby, leaves her life behind

01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:02.780
to follow the man of her dreams on his quest.

01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:05.780
Over the first half of the game, Tia has to come to terms with the fact

01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:10.780
that Maxim always is and always will be an adventurer with no plans of settling down.

01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:14.780
Soon after Maxim falls for the first leotard-clad battle mage to join the party,

01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:17.780
Tia decides to move on with her life and give up adventuring.

01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:20.780
As a child, I've never paid much attention to the character of Tia,

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:23.780
but I've been impressed on subsequent playthroughs

01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:25.780
by the frank depiction of Tia's feelings.

01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:27.780
So I pose to you this question.

01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:30.780
What are some of your favorite dysfunctional relationships in video games?

01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:34.780
Thanks always for the excellent show, yours truly, Awesome Unicorn.

01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:38.780
Well, thanks for being awesome, Awesome Unicorn.

01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:42.780
Dysfunctional relationships in games, wow.

01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:44.780
Um, um...

01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:45.780
How about...

01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:46.780
Chell and GLaDOS.

01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:47.780
That's a pretty dysfunctional...

01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:49.780
Hey, he said relationship.

01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:51.780
And relationships can be friendships.

01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:52.780
That's right.

01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:54.780
They can be parental.

01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:56.780
You did not say romantic.

01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:58.780
So, Chell and GLaDOS.

01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:01.780
Um, well, how about that whole story in Gone Home?

01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:03.780
But that wasn't really dysfunctional.

01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:04.780
It was just kinda, you know, sad.

01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:07.780
Um, how about, um, no, for real though.

01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:09.780
What about, like, Mario and Princess Peach?

01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:10.780
For real.

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:11.780
For real.

01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.780
What the heck kind of relationship is that going on there?

01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:17.780
Like, is it, like, what is it even?

01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:20.780
Like, you kinda think it's romantic between Mario and Peach,

01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:22.780
but then it seems platonic in other games.

01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:25.780
And wouldn't it, I mean, if the thing between Mario and Peach was romantic,

01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:29.780
wouldn't it be weird that sometimes it's, like, his brother that comes in to save the day?

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:30.780
Like, is there a whole...

01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:34.780
That's kinda, like, someone explain the relationship of the Marioverse to me,

01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:36.780
because I think it's a little weird.

01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:38.780
Just saying.

01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:39.780
Yeah.

01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:40.780
I shouldn't say weird.

01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:41.780
It's modern.

01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:42.780
It's very modern.

01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:43.780
Yeah.

01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:52.780
Well, in that, I honestly have a big problem with people expecting there to be romantic subplot in games.

01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:59.780
And I just wanna see, you know, I wanna see people who are really close,

01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:02.780
really tight friends without other people fucking shipping them.

01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:03.780
And, no, no, no.

01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:05.780
I don't have a problem with people shipping.

01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:06.780
Okay?

01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:07.780
That, it's gonna happen.

01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:08.780
I'm fine with it.

01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:17.780
But I would still like for the shippers out there to accept that some people would like a canonical response

01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:21.780
that does not involve two characters fucking.

01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:24.780
They could be romantic friendships, all of that.

01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:26.780
I just don't want the fucking involved.

01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.780
Sorry, the instant you said shipping, I was like,

01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:34.780
you know, the shepherd, or the romance between shepherd and Jack is very interesting.

01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:36.780
Oh, did you do that one with...

01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:37.780
I've seen it.

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:41.780
I've watched all the YouTubes, and I'm like, that's a very interesting relationship in that game.

01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:43.780
I mean, yes, it's romantic, but it is.

01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:49.780
It's also kind of like, it's a very interesting depiction of like, it's not,

01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:52.780
like, you get the sense that that relationship is really about the Nookie.

01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:53.780
Yeah.

01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:54.780
More than anything.

01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:55.780
She's angry and likes to fuck.

01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:56.780
Yeah, exactly.

01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:58.780
It's very interesting to see that depicted in games.

01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:00.780
Like, they just wanna hook up.

01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.780
But it does get serious.

01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:04.780
It does, depending on how you go with it, too.

01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:06.780
But also, she kind of grows up a bit.

01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:11.780
So, I do get weirded out by the dating tally thing,

01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:14.780
because I always think of her as the little sister type, and no.

01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:18.780
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:21.780
Bobby Blackwolf says, there is no romantic subplot in flappy vog.

01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:22.780
Hallelujah.

01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:26.780
Except for the love affair with the podcaster's face and the wall.

01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:28.780
Yeah.

01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:33.780
ST100Matt asks, are Mario and Peach even officially a couple?

01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:35.780
I don't think so.

01:58:35.780 --> 01:58:37.780
AwesomeUnicorn in our chat room.

01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:40.780
He's actually there and says, it was a tough question for on the spot,

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:42.780
so I'll accept any relationships.

01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:44.780
Mario's just in it for the cakes.

01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:45.780
Yeah.

01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:51.780
I honestly, I've never once seen a romantic relationship at all

01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:52.780
between Mario and Peach.

01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:54.780
I never saw it happen.

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:59.780
I think he is a loyal servant, deciding to relocate from, you know,

01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:03.780
his beloved, somewhere in New York-ish place,

01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:08.780
and living in the romantic, fantastical Mushroom Kingdom,

01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:11.780
where he actually gets to do a really important job

01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:14.780
instead of pull stuck shit out of people's pipes.

01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:19.780
Loki, any relationships that you can think of that are strange in games?

01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:25.780
No.

01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:27.780
That's fair. It's a tough question.

01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:29.780
It's not, you know, you gotta be a little more prepared for that one,

01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:31.780
but that's a really good question.

01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:34.780
I'd be curious if we get, like, follow-up emails with that.

01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:37.780
I'm curious what some of your favorites are.

01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:38.780
One more email, you said?

01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:40.780
Yeah, there was one more.

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:44.780
By the way, Shepherd Garris. All the way.

01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:45.780
That's not dysfunctional.

01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:48.780
No, theirs is hot.

01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:49.780
Okay.

01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:51.780
Hola, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican.

01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:52.780
Act deft.

01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:53.780
Hola.

01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:55.780
I've had this question in my head since the Fugu question

01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:57.780
for February 2nd, Bull Night,

01:59:57.780 --> 01:59:59.780
and I thought I would share it with you.

01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:01.780
A lot of gamers and geeks don't like sports,

02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:04.780
whether they legitimately hate them or just don't give a puck.

02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:05.780
Haha.

02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:08.780
But we all have a favorite sports video game.

02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:11.780
I hate export, but I love game about export, so why is that?

02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:13.780
Why do people sometimes diss on sports,

02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:15.780
but at the same time they love games like NBA Jam,

02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:18.780
Blades of Steel, and Mario sports games, et cetera?

02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:21.780
I could even include stuff like Wii Sports

02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:23.780
and such that resemble traditional sports a bit more.

02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:24.780
Well, that's all for now.

02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:26.780
Hopefully you're having a great night, like always.

02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:27.780
See you.

02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:28.780
Deft as kabrown.

02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:31.780
Sometimes it's not so much the sport,

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:33.780
but maybe the sport culture.

02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:35.780
Yes, it is totally the sport culture.

02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:39.780
Well, for me, it's like, you know how I get about when people hype movies

02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:41.780
and it just makes me not want to see them?

02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:43.780
I'm the same way about sports,

02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:45.780
because the more I hear people just like,

02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:51.780
I don't, and to be honest, I don't dislike a lot of sports.

02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:53.780
I'm just kind of apathetic about a lot of them.

02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:55.780
But yeah, there's some sports video games I enjoy.

02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:57.780
But to be fair and to be complete,

02:00:57.780 --> 02:00:59.780
I've been to some basketball games.

02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:01.780
We do have a basketball team here in Sacramento.

02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:03.780
It's the only professional sports team we have.

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:07.780
And they've gone ten ways to Sunday

02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:10.780
to make sure they're going to keep them here for better or for worse.

02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:12.780
It's a very controversial thing here, but I'm not going to get into it.

02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:16.780
But I've been to a few Kings games, and I've had a good time.

02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:17.780
I have a problem.

02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:18.780
I've enjoyed myself.

02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:19.780
With something Rage Nader just said.

02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:20.780
What?

02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:21.780
Mario gets a bum rap.

02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:23.780
He saves Peach's ass.

02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:25.780
God only knows how many times.

02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:26.780
Oh no.

02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:27.780
Yet he gets nowhere with her.

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:28.780
Not even a kiss.

02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:29.780
Uh oh.

02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:30.780
What does she owe him?

02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:32.780
She owes him nothing.

02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:35.780
She thanks him, yes, and gives him a fucking place to live.

02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:38.780
Just because a guy does something nice for a woman

02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:40.780
does not mean she has to put out.

02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:41.780
Fuck you.

02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:45.780
She does give him flowers.

02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:47.780
Okay, she gave him something.

02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:51.780
But it doesn't mean that any time a guy does something nice for a woman

02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:52.780
that she has to put out.

02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:53.780
No, she doesn't.

02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:55.780
She only has to put out if she wants to put out.

02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:56.780
The end.

02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:59.780
Well, now, okay, to be fair, though, in his defense, he didn't say

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.780
why don't they ever have sex.

02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:02.780
Just a little kiss.

02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:03.780
Have a little kiss on the cheek.

02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:05.780
No, she doesn't owe him any of that.

02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:07.780
She does not owe him a damn thing.

02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:11.780
All right.

02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:15.780
That is what's wrong with guys.

02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:17.780
Not all guys.

02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:18.780
Not all guys.

02:02:18.780 --> 02:02:19.780
You're cool.

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:22.780
Loki's okay, too.

02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:24.780
I guess.

02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:26.780
Loki, I think you're cool.

02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:28.780
Loki, did you want to say anything on the sports game email?

02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:30.780
No.

02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:31.780
Fair enough.

02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:33.780
Then let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:34.780
I don't know.

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:36.780
Dark Soccer has started a little early over there.

02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:39.780
And I hate the term friend zone because it just makes it look like

02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:40.780
being friends is bad.

02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:42.780
Being friends is great.

02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:43.780
I like having friends.

02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:45.780
Unless all you're interested in is fucking someone

02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:47.780
and then that's not a friendship.

02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:48.780
You know what?

02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:50.780
I love having women as just friends.

02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:52.780
There's nothing wrong with that.

02:02:52.780 --> 02:02:55.780
I love having everybody as just friends except for my husband.

02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:57.780
And I love my husband.

02:02:57.780 --> 02:02:59.780
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:16.780
Fuck you to the patriarchy.

02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:21.780
If you are for equality, you are for feminism.

02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:22.780
That's why we need it.

02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:26.780
Because of people saying that Pete should put out.

02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:28.780
She doesn't have to put out.

02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:29.780
She doesn't have to give a kiss.

02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:30.780
She doesn't have to do anything.

02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:33.780
She is a strong, independent woman who don't need no man.

02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:38.780
Well, if she's that strong...

02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:40.780
Hey, she was a main character in Mario 2.

02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:43.780
Why does she keep getting kidnapped by Bowser?

02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:45.780
I mean, surely she would have set a trap.

02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:48.780
A strong woman would have set a trap for Bowser at this point.

02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:51.780
Okay, she's moderately independent.

02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:54.780
But she doesn't lift weights because she was raised in privilege.

02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:56.780
She's a privileged white girl.

02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:01.780
So she doesn't think anything bad will ever happen to her until it happens to her.

02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:04.780
What?

02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:07.780
Does Princess Peach have an Instagram?

02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:08.780
Probably.

02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:10.780
And wears glasses in her spare time.

02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.780
She's a privileged white girl.

02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:14.780
And?

02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:23.780
She has to rely on poor Mario with his weight problem.

02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:27.780
I can't do this with a straight face.

02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:33.780
Just because he doesn't fit the standard of aesthetics for guys

02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:36.780
does not make him any less valuable as a human being.

02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:40.780
When he lands on someone, he lands on them.

02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:44.780
Loki, what's your F.U. of the week?

02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:47.780
Uh, F.U. of the things breaking.

02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:52.780
Like, you know, my laptop and then knew it's even better.

02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:57.780
So I decided to, you know, play some games during Josh's nap.

02:04:57.780 --> 02:05:00.780
And my chair breaks.

02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:04.780
You're not having a lot of luck, are you?

02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:06.780
We'll get you some duct tape.

02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:07.780
By the way...

02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:10.780
The bolt's breaking out of it.

02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:13.780
In chat? What'd he say?

02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:17.780
Princess Peach shows up to her security detail ten minutes late holding a Starbucks.

02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:19.780
That's why she always gets kidnapped.

02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:20.780
Alright, look.

02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:23.780
My F.U. of the week goes to my screwed up sleep schedule.

02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:26.780
F.U. to screwing up my sleep schedule.

02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:28.780
Because you know what I really, really, really like?

02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:29.780
Sleep.

02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:34.780
Sleep, in fact, I would go so far to say, and I might piss Jamie off with this, but I don't care.

02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:36.780
Sleep might be better than tacos.

02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:37.780
Just saying.

02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:39.780
No, I think sleep is better than tacos.

02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:40.780
Okay, well good.

02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:43.780
But you know what's even better, though, is combine the two, have a taco, take a nap.

02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:46.780
Fair enough.

02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:49.780
Because then you go to bed with tacos in your stomach.

02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:51.780
And that's happy.

02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:54.780
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:57.780
Then we're gonna open the Skype line at 1-877-GAMELR.

02:05:57.780 --> 02:05:59.780
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:05:59.780 --> 02:06:01.780
We'll also get Twitter topics and last minute stories.

02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:03.780
I'm in a feminist tizzy right now.

02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:05.780
Did that, did that...

02:06:05.780 --> 02:06:07.780
I was actually angered.

02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:09.780
Alright, let's, let's move on.

02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:10.780
I have Rage at Rageinator.

02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:13.780
You know what, let's talk about a strong woman in games.

02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:14.780
Loki.

02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:17.780
Yes, Lightning.

02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:22.780
She is basically done now.

02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:30.780
The Lightning, they're saying Lightning Returns is the last part of the story for Lightning.

02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:38.780
However, they're saying that Lightning may come back as a guest character in other games.

02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:42.780
So, I don't know.

02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:46.780
They could get cliche, or they should get like really cheesy with it.

02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:49.780
Like, you know, Lightning strikes twice or something.

02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:52.780
No, we're just gonna see her a bunch more in Final Fantasy XIV.

02:06:52.780 --> 02:06:57.780
I was gonna say, they're doing the quest right now in XIV that has her in it that's very strange.

02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:02.780
I don't know why she would return in other games.

02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:05.780
I mean, I could see maybe like, you know, XIV.

02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:09.780
I guess they can do like some fun stuff where they have like guest characters and stuff from other games.

02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:14.780
But, it doesn't really make sense for Lightning to be in other games.

02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:17.780
I guess then, then again, Cid is in all the games.

02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:19.780
So, I don't know.

02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:22.780
Thinking of Lightning in all the games is a different person.

02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:25.780
That would be a little silly though.

02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:26.780
Like, I don't know.

02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:30.780
Like, her picture should just be hanging on the wall as a little cameo in the later games.

02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:34.780
I mean, you don't really see characters from one Final Fantasy appear in the other.

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:36.780
I mean, even Cid, sure, okay, there's a dude named Cid.

02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:38.780
But they're all different, you know.

02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:41.780
In fact, I believe the one in XIII was more of a villain than a...

02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:42.780
Well, it's mixed.

02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:45.780
But, you know, they're always different.

02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:48.780
Anyhow.

02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:52.780
There's always an airship. There's always a Cid.

02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:54.780
There's always a crystal.

02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:56.780
There's always Moogles, at least in the later one.

02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:58.780
Moogles didn't start until like 3, right?

02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:01.780
Well, they'll just have her, you know, guest star.

02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:03.780
Maybe she could be a summon or something.

02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:07.780
Or, you know, they'll have her guest star in all the different thunder spells.

02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:11.780
You would think that characters like Cloud would have been a little more iconic.

02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:15.780
But then again, they did dress Lightning up in a cloud suit.

02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:17.780
So, maybe that's the type of stuff we're looking for.

02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:20.780
DLC Lightning crap in later games, right?

02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:24.780
Act-Def says Final Fantasy XIII, too Lightning, too Furious.

02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:27.780
Don't give them ideas.

02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:28.780
All right.

02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:31.780
Well, sadly, our last story is a bit of a sad note tonight.

02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:38.780
And gives us a chance to reminisce, though, about some very classic PC and Sega CD and CD-based games.

02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:40.780
I don't know if you ever played a game called...

02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:42.780
That's not Microcosm, is it?

02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:44.780
No, no. This is actually a clip from Sewer Shark.

02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:45.780
Oh!

02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:52.780
And, you know, full motion games were, like, a big thing, especially in the early 90s, like the CD-ROM games.

02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:56.780
Ken Melville was one of the guys to thank for a lot of that.

02:08:56.780 --> 02:09:00.780
Unfortunately, he passed away this week at age 65.

02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:08.780
He produced Sewer Shark, and he also created other full motion video games like Make My Video in XS and Make My Video Criss Cross.

02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:09.780
Excellent.

02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:11.780
You know what? I have both of those games.

02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:21.780
Also, and probably most infamously, Ken Melville helped create Night Trap, starring Dana Plato, which is a pretty epically remembered CD game.

02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:28.780
Even though it really wasn't very good, people still remember it just because, you know, it was like Chicks and Horror Movie and all that stuff.

02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:30.780
But yeah, there you go.

02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:32.780
So Ken Melville, unfortunately, passed away.

02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:36.780
But, you know, without him, we might not have some of the things we see.

02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:40.780
I mean, yeah, sure, games can kind of render all this real time now, but, you know, I don't think we would have got there.

02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:46.780
We would have certainly never had the SimCity version with the SimCity Action News Report, if it weren't for this.

02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:49.780
So, for that, I'll be forever thankful.

02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:56.780
Some folks in chat also saying, SSJ100Matt says, RIP John Henson, Jim Henson's son.

02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:58.780
That also happened this week. That's very sad, too.

02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:02.780
Lots of, what, Sid Caesar had passed away this week.

02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:05.780
That made me so sad. And Shirley Temple.

02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:06.780
Shirley Temple.

02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:15.780
I mean, Caesar was like in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Silent Movie and History of the World Part 1 and Greece.

02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:18.780
I had thought Shirley Temple was already dead. Like, I felt horrible.

02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:21.780
But she disappeared from the public eye a long time ago.

02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:27.780
Like, I think she came to one Oscars as a, I don't know, but then she became a diplomat of sorts, right?

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:30.780
Wasn't she like an ambassador or something at some point?

02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:34.780
She's not really in the public eye like she used to be. So, sorry.

02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:38.780
You know, you know what? When I was probably about 13, I read her autobiography.

02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:42.780
Which was, oh my God, she went through some shit.

02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:43.780
Oh, I bet.

02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:48.780
But it's, if anyone can find her autobiography, though, it's definitely worth a read.

02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:49.780
Her life was just so interesting.

02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:50.780
Yeah.

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:51.780
So.

02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:53.780
Excellent. All right. We are going to open up the Skype line right now.

02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:57.780
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:03.780
If you'd like to give the show a call and interact with us, participate, you can do that right now.

02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:07.780
Once again, that's 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:09.780
The Skype line is now open.

02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:12.780
I'm going to go around for some last minute stories, though, first.

02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:14.780
Loki, I don't know, do you have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?

02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:15.780
No.

02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:16.780
No?

02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:17.780
I do not.

02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:19.780
Sorry. No, I don't.

02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:21.780
All right. Fine. Fair enough.

02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:25.780
I also want to look and see if there's any, like, Twitter topics, but we'll see here.

02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:31.780
Okay. The book, by the way, is called Child Star.

02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:33.780
There you go. Child Star.

02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:34.780
By Shirley Temple Black.

02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:40.780
Well, that is what Shirley Temple was, was a child star, but we're going to go to the Skype line right now.

02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:42.780
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:48.780
It's Ronma, and will you tell a brother next time you turn the cam on so I can have mine on, too?

02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:55.780
Oh, there you go. Oh, we're on the cam tonight. Yay. How you doing?

02:11:55.780 --> 02:12:00.780
Good, good. As you can see, I just got back from Catsicon 20.

02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:01.780
You're wearing your VOG shirt.

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:02.780
What did you get me?

02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:04.780
Love it. Great.

02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:07.780
I got you a lot of Ronma would have cosplay pictures.

02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:11.780
Yay! Did you take me any home stocks?

02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:13.780
I got a couple.

02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:14.780
Yay!

02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:17.780
There you go. They didn't turn the pool gray this year, did they?

02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:28.780
Uh, no, but let's just say the hotel and the convention were gunning more at professional photographers than anything else.

02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:29.780
Really?

02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:43.780
Yes. If it looked like you had more, if you had more attachments on your SLR, like big lights and this and that, they will tell you to leave the area because they assume that you're a professional photographer.

02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:50.780
A friend of mine had an assistant with him, and they told him, you can't have your, you're a professional photographer.

02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:51.780
Interesting.

02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:55.780
It boiled down to, as long as it's attached to your camera, it's fair game.

02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:59.780
Huh. I went to Katsucon a few years ago. I had a good time.

02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:04.780
Yeah, but they're no longer in that area. We're in a different area.

02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:05.780
Okay.

02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:09.780
The hotel convention is bigger, and it's all about the gazebo.

02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:11.780
I've heard about the gazebo.

02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:13.780
Oh, I've seen the memes about the gazebo.

02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:18.780
I'm in California for fuck's sake, and I've heard about the Katsucon gazebo, so I'm just saying. I'm just saying.

02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:21.780
That's because you have West Coast cosplayers going to Katsucon.

02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:23.780
There you go. There you go. Fair enough.

02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:36.780
I was going to say this. There was all those stormy storms in the Northeast, and I was reading that the con, like, they were going to say a con is happening no matter what, but I imagine that led to some hilarious fuckery right there.

02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:45.780
Yes, because they made an announcement that even though you can't make it to Katsucon, you are not getting a refund. The salt was strong on that.

02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:49.780
Ooh, ouch. I can only imagine on that. Yikes.

02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:55.780
So what gaming stuff did they have at Katsucon? Did they still have a game room down there? I know.

02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:59.780
Yes, there was two pump it up machines and a DDR third mix.

02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:02.780
Nice. Third mix. I fucking love third mix.

02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:03.780
Vivid mode.

02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:04.780
Erotic songs.

02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:10.780
And I've never heard of this game. I don't know if you guys reviewed it, but it's a rhythm game by Sega.

02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:17.780
It's two players, and it's five lines of colored lights, and you're bouncing lights back and forth.

02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.780
You start from one, then three, then five.

02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:27.780
I actually didn't know that was a Sega game. It looks like a giant table, like air hockey looking thing, right?

02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:30.780
There was one of those at Arcade Infinity before it closed down.

02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:32.780
I have video footage of that.

02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:35.780
Nice. Yeah, that game looked interesting. I think I did play it once.

02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:46.780
You know, I didn't talk about this on the show the week that Shane was here, but we had gone to Golf Land, the place where video games go to die, and we played a Pac-Man air hockey machine.

02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:47.780
What?

02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:54.780
Yeah, it was kind of like normal air hockey, but like at random parts, all these little pucks would just fly onto the table.

02:14:54.780 --> 02:15:00.780
Like you'd have your normal puck, like air hockey, but then all of a sudden like 20 small pucks would fly on the table.

02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:06.780
Like that was the whole little trick, and they were worth like half a point, whereas the other, the big pucks were worth like five points.

02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:13.780
Sorry, random tangent, but you talking about the big table games in Arcade kind of made me think of that, so.

02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.780
That's quite alright.

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:20.780
Alright, so we're gonna hear the full Katsukan wrap up, I imagine, this week on Anime Jam Session?

02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:38.780
Yes, you will, and we'll have two of our cosplay guests on the show, Avalon Cosplay and Serafita Cosplay, because Serafita had a booth going selling patches and a lot of cool stuff, and it was pretty fun, especially since somebody cosplayed the gazebo.

02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.780
Oh, I have to ask you.

02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:42.780
That's like when somebody cosplayed the carpet at Dragon Con.

02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:45.780
Did you get pictures of Kayla?

02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:47.780
Yes, I got a couple.

02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:49.780
Because I went in to see her Lilith costume.

02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:51.780
I got one of her Lilith costume.

02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:53.780
Yes! Awesome.

02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:55.780
Alright, well Rama, anything else before we let you go?

02:15:55.780 --> 02:16:04.780
I will say this much, when it comes to gaming cosplay at this convention, the most popular gaming cosplay was Danganronpa.

02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:07.780
Oh yeah, that's not surprising.

02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:09.780
Then Legend of Zelda.

02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:11.780
Yeah, that's not surprising either.

02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:13.780
You hear that the sequel's coming out this year as well, right?

02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:15.780
Loki said the sequel's coming out this year.

02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:20.780
I haven't played the game, but I've watched the anime, and holy shit, what a mindfuck.

02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:28.780
Yeah, the first one just came out, I think, last week, and then the sequel, I think, is already announced for...gosh, I want to say it's this summer.

02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:30.780
Did you hear what Loki said?

02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:32.780
Yes, I did.

02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:34.780
By the way, I'm working on something for you.

02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:35.780
Ooh!

02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:37.780
A Rama troll.

02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:38.780
Oh no!

02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:40.780
Yep, you're getting a Rama troll.

02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:41.780
Sweet.

02:16:41.780 --> 02:16:45.780
Alright, well Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try and get some more calls, but have a good one, buddy, thanks for calling.

02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:46.780
Hey, no problem, you too.

02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:47.780
Alright, take care, bye.

02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:48.780
Oh, bye.

02:16:48.780 --> 02:16:52.780
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:57.780
I always thought that Ranshan should cosplay the Rama troll out of irony.

02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:00.780
That would be hilarious.

02:17:00.780 --> 02:17:04.780
Alright, I'm gonna try to pull up the OLR Twitter here.

02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:07.780
A lot of activity on Twitter around FlappyVog, that's pretty exciting to see.

02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:09.780
Yay.

02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:11.780
Um, let's see.

02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:16.780
DarkTetsuya says, I'm trying to start an OLR me for Monster Hunter 3.

02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:18.780
God dammit, I forgot, sorry guys.

02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:23.780
I'm routing Skype a different way, so I have to route it through the mixing board.

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:25.780
Little bit of faux pas there.

02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:29.780
I'll go back to DarkTetsuya's tweet in a minute, but we are getting another call, so let's get to it.

02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:31.780
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:36.780
Hey there, guys, it's nemesis47, I'm from the chat, how you guys doing today?

02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:39.780
Hey, good, nemesis47, what's up, buddy?

02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:47.780
Nothing much, guys, I'm just getting ready for a convention here in a couple weeks as well, just like Rama said earlier.

02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:49.780
Where's here?

02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:55.780
In Colorado, he was in out east, I'm over here out in Rocky Mountains west.

02:17:55.780 --> 02:18:03.780
I would bet Jason, our good buddy VXJ's next V, who just said goodbyes on the show last week for now,

02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:08.780
he lives in Colorado, he's been living in San Francisco for the past couple months, he's usually in Colorado.

02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:10.780
He'll probably be there, I would bet.

02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:14.780
I guess he would, though, we have a lot of guests this year.

02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:19.780
This is actually my first convention I'm going to be staffing for this year.

02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:21.780
Nice, sounds like fun.

02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:22.780
Yeah.

02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:30.780
Yep, I'm mainly just the guy that's going to be doing the photoshoots.

02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:35.780
I've actually got all the photoshoots already done with the posters and everything.

02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:38.780
We just gotta get him hung up a lot of comments.

02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:43.780
There we go, it's the Anime Land Wasabi convention I'm doing in a couple weeks.

02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:45.780
Sounds like fun.

02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:46.780
Yep.

02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:52.780
So, are you trying to plug the convention here? Is there something else on your mind tonight?

02:18:52.780 --> 02:19:00.780
That's one thing, and plus the whole thing with the Sega Genesis thing, my apologies about that.

02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:04.780
I had brain fart earlier and stuff, so yeah.

02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:11.780
That's fine, and to be fair, because the Sega Genesis did come out, I want to say it was a year or two before the Super Nintendo,

02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:17.780
there was a little bit of overlap, especially in the late NES period, kind of overlapped with the beginnings of the Sega Genesis.

02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:23.780
And I seem to remember, DarkSocker, correct me if I'm wrong, or Loki, Sonic the Hedgehog was a Genesis game,

02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:28.780
but then they back-poured it to the Master System because it was kind of like the 8-bits was still going on.

02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:30.780
Or was that one of those Chinese hacks?

02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:38.780
No, no, no, there's actually quite a number of Genesis games that were sort of back-engineered for the Master System

02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:40.780
because of countries where the Master System was the big thing.

02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:46.780
Like, for example, Brazil. Brazil has a massive Master System following.

02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:48.780
But they had a huge Genesis following.

02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:50.780
But Master System was really big.

02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:52.780
Yeah, I've heard that too.

02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:53.780
Even to today.

02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:58.780
So there's lots of games that you'll find those older versions.

02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:07.780
I think the Sonic one had been released, don't quote me yet, but it was really, some of those countries where the Master System was huge,

02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:14.780
so they took their most popular titles from Genesis because the Genesis ones weren't selling, the Master System ones were.

02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:16.780
They were milking the money where they could.

02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:22.780
Interesting. Well, there you go. I learned something. So yeah, don't feel too bad about the answer.

02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:27.780
I actually still got my Genesis still to this day. I had that thing since I was a little kid.

02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:35.780
Nice. I saw my Super Nintendo hooked up. I can play Super Metroid in its purest form.

02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:40.780
I tripped over Super Nintendo today. We have three of them in the house.

02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:43.780
I think you should always have a classic console hooked up for good measure.

02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:49.780
Of course, of course. Have you guys ever heard of a game called Double Switch on the Sega CD?

02:20:49.780 --> 02:20:50.780
Yes, I have it.

02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:54.780
I have it too. It has late Corey Haim in the game.

02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:56.780
Yes, it does.

02:20:57.780 --> 02:21:06.780
It is not one of my favorite games, though. If I was going to sit down and play a Sega CD game that I would actually say was among my favorites, it would probably just be Sonic CD.

02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:20.780
Oh, yeah. Sonic CD can never go wrong with Sonic CD. Another thing about Double Switch, Arlie Ermes is in the game. He knows the story of Simon Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He's in the game.

02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:23.780
Yeah, that's right. It had actually a pretty decent cast, didn't it?

02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:33.780
Yeah, he played while I was a handyman in the game. So, at first I was like, that doesn't look like I didn't know who it was after this thing.

02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:38.780
It was Arlie Ermey and they pretty much put the voices two and two together and, hey, it matches!

02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:44.780
Yeah, it's worth a lot. The GI.

02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:51.780
Alright, well, Nemesis 47, enjoy the classic gaming on your classic consoles and thanks for calling us tonight, alright?

02:21:51.780 --> 02:21:54.780
No problem, man. Good to see you guys.

02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:56.780
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:21:56.780 --> 02:21:58.780
Alright, bye bye.

02:21:58.780 --> 02:21:59.780
Bye.

02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:14.780
1877 game OLR, I wish I could disable the sounds. I'm actually using Skype on the iPad, so I wish I could disable the sounds. Maybe it's possible. I could disable all the sounds, but then I wouldn't be able to hear the callers and that would be a bad thing.

02:22:14.780 --> 02:22:25.780
1877 game OLR, username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio. Before we took that call, I was talking about a tweet that Dark Tetsuya had sent us saying, I'm trying to start an OL army for Monster Hunter 3 on Wii U.

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:39.780
By the way, that's how you do online on Wii U. I gotta be honest, Dark Tetsuya, I wasn't able to get into Monster Hunter. That's my honest answer on that, but, hey, for those of you that are enjoying it, I definitely would support an OL army being created for that.

02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:43.780
But we do have another call on the line, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio. Who's this?

02:22:43.780 --> 02:22:44.780
Hey, it's Marissa.

02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:49.780
Marissa! Oh my gosh. We haven't heard from you in forever, Marissa. How you doing?

02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:50.780
I wonder how you need to call right now.

02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:58.780
It's been too long. I feel like an old lady though, trying to figure out this Skype thing. I thought this was only for the kids doing the porn thing.

02:22:58.780 --> 02:23:01.780
No, that would be Snapchat.

02:23:01.780 --> 02:23:02.780
Yeah, that's Snapchat.

02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:03.780
Oh, okay.

02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:06.780
That's for the porn thing. What's on your mind, Marissa?

02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:13.780
I was calling to say hello and check in. Oh, and fuck the new Thief game, but I guess, yeah, that would probably be it.

02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:16.780
Oh, yeah. Is that, like, coming out finally?

02:23:16.780 --> 02:23:24.780
I know! They put so much into it. They have so much on the line at Eidos Montreal, and it's coming out next week and nobody really seems to know or give a shit.

02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:26.780
Oh, two weeks, says Logie.

02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:28.780
The 25th.

02:23:28.780 --> 02:23:34.780
Wow, they've got a great marketing push going on on that one. That's sure to do well. They must have a lot of faith in it.

02:23:34.780 --> 02:23:44.780
It's funny, because of my interest, the voice acting is particularly bad. I mean, everybody is outraged that they got rid of Stephen Russell, who's just brilliant.

02:23:44.780 --> 02:24:01.780
But I've been listening to it in general, and the direction itself is just... it's really bad, but there are laws with regard to casting and doing projects in Canada, and everyone suspects that they did that to keep funding.

02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:03.780
Oh, like Canadian content?

02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:06.780
Canadian content laws or something. Oh, that's an interesting theory.

02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:08.780
Damn Canucks.

02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:11.780
Damn it Canada, you do so many things right, but sometimes you get it wrong.

02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:16.780
Damn it Canada, you gave us Rush, but you also gave us Bieber.

02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:21.780
You know, I hate Justin Bieber too, but to be fair, we've exported a lot of shit to them too.

02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:27.780
That is true. That is true. Fair's fair. I mean, they get like Miley Cyrus.

02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:32.780
Thanks to a friend of mine, I actually did hear about a Canadian band that I've started liking a lot called Stars.

02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:33.780
Okay.

02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:34.780
They're really good.

02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:35.780
Rock on.

02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:36.780
Okay, I will.

02:24:36.780 --> 02:24:38.780
I like Alanis Morissette. She's cool.

02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:43.780
Hey, actually to be fair, they import a lot of comedians too. We get a lot of great comedians.

02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:48.780
That is true. We get a lot of comedians from Canada. I feel like it's like Canada history 101 today.

02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:53.780
As opposed to Canadians from Alaska? Or Canadians from Norway?

02:24:54.780 --> 02:25:03.780
I remember when I was a little girl, actually, I had a friend that was from Peachland, and I was trying to explain Canadian bacon to her, and I had this exact reply.

02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:05.780
You mean ham?

02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:11.780
Although, isn't that also just what they call bacon in England?

02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:13.780
You're not supposed to talk about bacon, Jamie.

02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:16.780
You know what? I've seen you eat bacon.

02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:20.780
See, I'm allowed to be a heathen. I don't give a shit.

02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:23.780
It's not going to go away if you pretend it doesn't exist.

02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:26.780
For the record, I had turkey bacon today, so I'm still being a good Jew.

02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:28.780
Of course, there was cheese with it.

02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:34.780
So Marissa, I know you're very disappointed about The New Thief, but is there any games you've been checking out lately?

02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:44.780
Otherwise, I haven't had a chance to look into a lot of them. I've had the chance to record and rehearse in various studios with some interesting video game scripts.

02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:48.780
Some of them haven't come out yet, so you can't talk about them.

02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:51.780
Some of them was the interesting little tank commander bit I sent you.

02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:57.780
I don't know what it's from, but they had me rehearse this thing about giant eyeballs are attacking the city.

02:25:57.780 --> 02:26:01.780
That sounds like something out of Earth Defense Force or something. Who knows?

02:26:03.780 --> 02:26:05.780
I can only hope.

02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:09.780
Marissa, I know you haven't been on the show in a while, but it seems like since the last time you were here,

02:26:09.780 --> 02:26:12.780
you've been really getting into studying voice acting and doing all that.

02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:16.780
I know you sent me some of the demo reels that you did, and it was great.

02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:19.780
I thought I was actually listening to commercials on FM radio. It was cool.

02:26:19.780 --> 02:26:22.780
Oh, thank you. That shit that you skip over.

02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:29.780
Well, you can't when you're in the car and waiting for the next Lady Gaga song to come on. You're kind of held hostage.

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:36.780
Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. That's actually what I've wanted to do my whole life, and I decided to go for it.

02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:38.780
That's awesome. See, I always talk about...

02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:42.780
You like the sexy sax, though? That's important if you like the sexy sax bit.

02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:49.780
I always talk about wanting... I would love to be a voice actor in a video game just once in my life. That would be my dream.

02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:54.780
But you're actually going and doing it. But you know what? I do have flappy vog.

02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:59.780
I did get flappy vog, so I did get my game that I have a voice actor in.

02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:04.780
Well, Rob Paulson, when he hosts his podcast, he sometimes brings it up north.

02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:11.780
I suggest everyone to check that out, Talking Tunes. He brings Maurice LaMarche sometimes, and they do Pinky and the Brain live, and they've all done video games as well.

02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:12.780
It's awesome.

02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:13.780
It's a lot of fun.

02:27:13.780 --> 02:27:21.780
Awesome. Awesome. All right. Well, you want to give us your best voiceover sign out for the night before we let you go?

02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:25.780
Not to put you on the spot or anything.

02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:29.780
Good night, everybody.

02:27:29.780 --> 02:27:36.780
I don't always do that, but it's interesting how it's really incestuous when you go from this to...

02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:38.780
Hi, how have you been?

02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:42.780
That's a lot of anime work. You do a lot of that.

02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:45.780
Oh, my God. I love it.

02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:46.780
Have fun with that helium.

02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:50.780
I accidentally did that with my answer machine message once. I was trying to be professional.

02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:56.780
Your reception isn't very good, so I was trying to be, hey, this is Marissa. I hope to hear from you soon.

02:27:56.780 --> 02:28:01.780
But this is how it turned out. Hey, it's Marissa. I'd love to hear from you.

02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:08.780
I didn't realize until my doctor called me one day. She just left a message, and she said this exactly.

02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:15.780
She said, Marissa, what a suggestive sounding answering machine you have.

02:28:15.780 --> 02:28:20.780
Well, I think there's a lot of our listeners that would like to see you operating a 900 number or something along those lines.

02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:23.780
Maybe I can get that gig. Call us now.

02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:25.780
All right.

02:28:25.780 --> 02:28:32.780
All right. Well, Marissa, when you're a super popular voice actress touring the country at anime cons up and down the coast, I'm going to say she started here.

02:28:32.780 --> 02:28:33.780
We made her.

02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:35.780
No. Her first role on Vogue.

02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:38.780
I don't know some of the bits I've done on your show. I want to be known.

02:28:38.780 --> 02:28:45.780
No, no, no, no. I know what your first fun voice was on Orange House Radio. It was Uso's Braziers.

02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:50.780
Yes. I'm going to dig up those shows. You better watch out.

02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:54.780
Actually, I'm just trying to get started, but I know lots of people are doing indie projects.

02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:59.780
That's where a lot of people cut their chops, and if anybody's interested, I'm always happy to do indie projects.

02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:03.780
Awesome. All right. Well, how can people get a hold of you?

02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:12.780
Well, I have that sound cloud you can link to later, but my name is Marissa Meisel, so M-E-I-Z-E-L.

02:29:12.780 --> 02:29:19.780
I can always send out demos that way, or you can contact me where the old people are on Facebook.

02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:23.780
Awesome. Awesome. And if you email the show, we'll get you in touch with her, too. We'll forward it on over.

02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:24.780
As long as we still have that email address.

02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:29.780
Yes. All right. All right, Marissa, I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call, but thanks so much for the call.

02:29:29.780 --> 02:29:30.780
It's so good to hear from you. Miss your face.

02:29:30.780 --> 02:29:33.780
One time, I'll have to come up soon and have giggle time.

02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:34.780
What's that?

02:29:34.780 --> 02:29:37.780
I'll have to come up soon, and we can have Rob and Marissa's giggle time.

02:29:37.780 --> 02:29:41.780
Yes. I cannot wait. All right. Bye.

02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:42.780
Bye.

02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:45.780
I always love hearing from Marissa. She is great.

02:29:45.780 --> 02:29:48.780
All right. I can probably squeeze in one more call if somebody wants to try to get through.

02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:52.780
1877 Game O-L-R, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:52.780 --> 02:29:56.780
Trying to get to some more tweets beyond that.

02:29:56.780 --> 02:29:58.780
S2100 Matt tweets us.

02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:02.780
Old story, but the Kickstarter hack reminded me of it.

02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:06.780
Best and worst online retailers password safeguards.

02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:08.780
And he links us to this article from Ars Technica.

02:30:09.780 --> 02:30:17.780
I don't believe I read this, but apparently, the headline on the site is this.

02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:20.780
Apple.com does more to protect your passwords.

02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:22.780
The study of the top 100 sites finds.

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:27.780
I guess some sites will allow you to have 123456 as a password.

02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:32.780
Apple.com was the only site to receive a perfect score of 100 based on 24 criteria.

02:30:33.780 --> 02:30:39.780
Amazingly, 55% of the sites allowed 123456 and password.

02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:46.780
Sites like Toys R Us, 1-800-Flowers, and J Crew sent passwords as plain text in emails.

02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:50.780
Interesting. So, yeah, Apple got a 100.

02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:53.780
Microsoft and Chegg, C-H-Egg.

02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:57.780
Chegg is a book rental for school book rentals.

02:30:57.780 --> 02:31:00.780
And if you run from them, they actually plant a tree.

02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:03.780
They were right behind that with a score of 65.

02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:05.780
Of course, I want to see who's on the bottom.

02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:11.780
MLB, the Major League Baseball website, negative 75 was their score.

02:31:11.780 --> 02:31:14.780
Kind of surprised that somebody's in the bottom.

02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:18.780
Hulu, negative 45. Disney Store, negative 45.

02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:20.780
Interesting story there on ArsTechnica.com.

02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:22.780
Thanks for that, SJ100Matt.

02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:26.780
And don't use shitty passwords, people. Don't use shitty passwords.

02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:28.780
And don't use the same ones for your financial institutions.

02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:34.780
Never, never, never have your email password used anywhere else.

02:31:34.780 --> 02:31:36.780
Same thing with your banking passwords.

02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:41.780
At least those two should be unique and separate. For real.

02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:44.780
Alright. Anyhow, let's see.

02:31:44.780 --> 02:31:48.780
Going on, we have another tweet from SJ100Matt.

02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:52.780
Someone made a Space Jam mod for NBA 2K14.

02:31:52.780 --> 02:31:56.780
Now you can play with the Tune Squad or Monstars from the movie.

02:31:56.780 --> 02:32:00.780
That's it. We've accomplished all we need to in gaming.

02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:04.780
That's it. Done. Video games are over, everybody. Pack it up. Go home.

02:32:04.780 --> 02:32:10.780
They put Space Jam in NBA 2K14. Wait. Somebody made that game good?

02:32:10.780 --> 02:32:13.780
NBA 2K14 was apparently pretty good.

02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:16.780
I thought it got like hazed and stuff in the video.

02:32:16.780 --> 02:32:18.780
That's NBA Live 14.

02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:20.780
Oh. Pardon me. Pardon me.

02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:22.780
Yeah, Rob. I don't know how to play either.

02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:23.780
Sorry.

02:32:23.780 --> 02:32:25.780
No one's making any mods for that.

02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:29.780
And Strudels89. It was a tweet to me as well.

02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:31.780
But this is worthy of mention on the show for Dark Sakura.

02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:34.780
OMG. I found a pink berry.

02:32:34.780 --> 02:32:36.780
It's been so long. I missed it.

02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:39.780
You would think this show is sponsored by that company.

02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:41.780
But sadly, nope. No free yogurt here.

02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:45.780
Well, it doesn't appear that anybody else is calling in.

02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:48.780
So I guess we're gonna go ahead and close up ye olde Skype line.

02:32:48.780 --> 02:32:50.780
Which means we don't have last minute stories.

02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:52.780
I have one last minute story.

02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:54.780
Oh, you got one. Alright. Well, Loki, what did you get?

02:32:54.780 --> 02:32:58.780
It's kind of a little easter egg for Disney Infinity.

02:32:58.780 --> 02:33:02.780
Apparently, once you've collected all of the characters,

02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:04.780
say if you buy every single one of them,

02:33:04.780 --> 02:33:08.780
you will unlock a lightsaber.

02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:12.780
Like an actual lightsaber in the game as a weapon.

02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:16.780
Of course, no one has figured this out yet.

02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:20.780
Except for one person who got some of the toys early that haven't been released yet.

02:33:20.780 --> 02:33:24.780
But that's what's gonna happen when you do collect all of them

02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:27.780
if you happen to pay for all of those different characters.

02:33:29.780 --> 02:33:34.780
Alright. Bobby Black Wolf has just sent me an update via private message

02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:36.780
worthy of last minute story.

02:33:36.780 --> 02:33:42.780
Per Bobby Black Wolf, over 1300 people have died in Flappy Vog during OLR.

02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:43.780
So I don't know if that means...

02:33:43.780 --> 02:33:44.780
Third place.

02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:46.780
What? Does that mean 1300 plays?

02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:49.780
Or like 1300 unique people have played the game in 3 hours?

02:33:49.780 --> 02:33:52.780
I don't think we have those kind of numbers at VoG.

02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:55.780
But I would imagine that's 1300 plays.

02:33:55.780 --> 02:33:57.780
That's still pretty impressive.

02:33:57.780 --> 02:33:59.780
I imagine a lot of you guys are just zoning out, listening to the show,

02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:02.780
and playing Flappy Vog, and that's totally cool.

02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:04.780
If that's the case.

02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:09.780
Black Wolf says 1300 plays. Well, that's still impressive.

02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:13.780
So, wow. God, how many times has my head crashed into a wall in the past 3 hours?

02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:14.780
That's a little disturbing.

02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:15.780
Mine hasn't at all yet.

02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:16.780
Yet.

02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:17.780
But we're doing my lines.

02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:18.780
But you're gonna be in the first DLC.

02:34:18.780 --> 02:34:21.780
I could give people a sample.

02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:24.780
Okay. Give them one sample. Don't ruin it. Give them one sample.

02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:25.780
Yarp.

02:34:29.780 --> 02:34:32.780
Alright. That is about gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:35.780
Hey, I wanna thank you guys for listening to the show,

02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:38.780
having fun with us, whether it be live or podcast.

02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:40.780
I really appreciate your support of the show.

02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:42.780
You know, all we ask here, we do ask it every week.

02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:45.780
If you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two or five about the show.

02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:47.780
Help spread the word. That's all we got.

02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:51.780
We also could really use some nice reviews.

02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:56.780
Five-star reviews on iTunes or Stitcher Radio go a very, very long way in helping to promote the show.

02:34:56.780 --> 02:35:01.780
And we thank you very, very much for all the nice words you guys have to say.

02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:04.780
It is about that time where we go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:10.780
Loki, hope to see you back soon, but I understand you gotta do what you gotta do there at home.

02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:13.780
So, take care of yourself and say hi to Nellie.

02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:15.780
Do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:18.780
Yes, I'm third place on Flappy Vogue.

02:35:18.780 --> 02:35:20.780
Are you really? What's your score?

02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:24.780
Forty-two, I think? I don't know.

02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:27.780
That's pretty good. That's pretty good.

02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:32.780
My final thought tonight is I wanna go to Disneyland.

02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:34.780
I wanna go for my birthday.

02:35:34.780 --> 02:35:37.780
Well, I kinda had an offer to go next week.

02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:38.780
Jeez.

02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:39.780
Jeez.

02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:46.780
I might, but it would be literally Lee Friday to go Saturday to drive back Sunday in time for the show.

02:35:46.780 --> 02:35:50.780
Which will probably kill me, but do you know what's on Saturday?

02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:54.780
Like why I really gotta go? Dapper days.

02:35:54.780 --> 02:35:55.780
Bring me back something, Duffy.

02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:58.780
Oh, of course. How could I not? How could I not?

02:35:58.780 --> 02:35:59.780
I know.

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:00.780
All right.

02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:03.780
And last but not least, Lee, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:09.780
I start my new schedule at the land of cubicles and tech, Locat.

02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:13.780
So I'm happy that I can actually stay up to a normal time tonight.

02:36:13.780 --> 02:36:15.780
Huzzah.

02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:17.780
That's it.

02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:20.780
All right. That's it. We're done. We're out of here.

02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:22.780
We'll be back to do it all again next week, though.

02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:24.780
Thank you guys for staying with us and listening.

02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:28.780
Oh, wait. Marissa says we have to go to Knott's to see the Billies.

02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:29.780
Is that where they moved?

02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:30.780
That's where they are.

02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:31.780
Get out.

02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:32.780
I've never been there either.

02:36:32.780 --> 02:36:34.780
I thought they have really good fried chicken.

02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:35.780
This is the record.

02:36:35.780 --> 02:36:38.780
But I didn't I didn't I thought the Billies were like a part of Disney.

02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:41.780
I thought there's like a bunch of Billies.

02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:43.780
They do performances at various places.

02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:44.780
And I love the Billies.

02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:46.780
Well done to Knott's.

02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:47.780
Well done on them.

02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:48.780
All right. We're out of here.

02:36:48.780 --> 02:36:49.780
Have a good night, everybody.

02:36:49.780 --> 02:36:53.780
We will see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:54.780
Good night.

02:36:54.780 --> 02:36:58.780
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:04.780
Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios to join us for a live show.

02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:11.780

02:37:54.780 --> 02:37:55.780
Bye.
